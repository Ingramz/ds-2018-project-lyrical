Loretta Lynn,"Oh Lord my God when I in all some wonder
Considered all the worlds Thy hands have made
I see the stars I hear the roaring thunder Thy art throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul Thy save dear God to Thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art
Then sings my soul

When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration and there proclaim my God how great Thou art
Then sings my soul",How Great Thou Art [Swedish Traditional Melody],1998
Loretta Lynn,"I am weak but Thou art strong Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee let it be dear Lord let it be
When my feeble life is o'er time for me shall be no more
Guide me gently safely o'er to Thy kingdom shores to Thy shores
Just a closer walk",Just a Closer Walk With Thee,1998
Loretta Lynn,"I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Comin' for to carry me home
A band of angels comin' after me
Comin' for to carry me home.

Swing low, swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Tell all of my friends I'm comin' too
Comin' for to carry me home.

Swing low, swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home.

I remember well my brightest day
Comin' for to carry me home
When Jesus washed my sins away
Comin' for to carry me home.

Swing low, swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home.

Loretta Lynn,"What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
Oh, what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Do the friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee
And you will find a solace there

And you will find a solace there",What a Friend We Have in Jesus,1998
Loretta Lynn,"Will that circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I was standin' by my window
On one cold, and cloudy day
When I saw a hearse come rollin'
For to carry my mother away.

Will that circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.

Undertaker, please undertaker,
Undertaker, please drive slow
For that body you are hauling

Loretta Lynn,"When troubles surround us, when evils come 
The body grows weak 
The spirit grows numb 
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us 
He sends us His love 

On the wings of a snow-white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above 
On the wings of a dove 

When Jesus went down through the river that day 
Well, he was baptized in the usual way 
And when it was done 
God blessed His son 
He sent him His love

Loretta Lynn,"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
 
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
 
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
 
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone",Help Me Make It Through the Night,1998
Loretta Lynn,"How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find 
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Once I was winning in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened I lost every dime 
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a proper at time 
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When life has ended and time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind",A Satisfied Mind,1998
Loretta Lynn,"I can't stop loving you so I made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I just live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago, still make me blue
And they say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you, so I made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday",I Can't Stop Loving You,1999
Loretta Lynn,"I chased you till you caught me you had plans of your own
It didn't come as no surpise and you knew it all alone
Now I guess you think you're a pretty cheek but I've got news for you
It don't really matter to me just who caught who
Well it was a long hard race I thought I've finally won
I thought I really played it smart but brother was I dumb
You thought you'd pull to figure out and won my heart and hand
But things were only workin' out accordin' to my plans
I chased you till you caught me...
[ guitar ]
Now you were playin' hard to get just danglin' on a string
I was only holdin' out for a pretty weddin' ring
So you went to the jewelry's to get my big surprise
But you done been there a month before and given them your size
I chased you till you caught me...
It don't really matter to me just who caught who",I Chased You Till You Caught Me,1999
Loretta Lynn,"Bitin' my fingernails thinking of you don't love nobody else it's funny but it's true
Just got a feeling maybe we're through
Bitin' my fingernails and thinking dear of you

You really got me worried now I must confess it's true
I sit around twiddlin' my thumbs breaking my heart in two
I'm wondering if you love me so the way you say you do
I'm bitin' my fingernails and thinking dear of you
Bitin' my fingernails

If you have plans to end it all I wish you'd tell me now
Don't leave me thinking that someday you'd leave me anyhow

Loretta Lynn,"I know you've had a change of heart the way you're on the range
But the love for you that's in my heart is something you can't change
When you get your field of green green grass stay home and you'll find clover
Let's stop right where we are and start all over
Let's stop right where we are and start all over
Let's both admit that we've been wrong cry on each other's shoulder
Let's straighten up and save our love before we lose each other
Let's stop right where we are and start all over
[ guitar ]
You don't love on me anymore the way you used to do
So I went out looking for the love I failed to get from you
I'd make believe that it was you the nights when I would hold her

",Let's Stop Right Where We Are,1999
Loretta Lynn,"I can see you are not happy the way you've been acting
And I think you'd like to be free
I know he's a good man but I know that you can be a whole lot happier with me
In your eyes there's a yearning and inside you're a burning
And I'd like to put out the flame
So let's get together like birds of a feather and we let the love take the blame
But right now I don't think that I can leave him for lately he's been so good to me
And there might be once more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see
But the way I can make you forget him cause I'll take you
To places that you've never been
We'll may call the night spots the dim and the bright spots
And then we'll forget where we've been
We'll walk sunny beaches and taste Georgia peaches and swing from Maine to Mexico
If you'll come along we can make life a song and you won't be tied down anymore
But still I don't think that I can leave him for lately he's been so good to me
And there might be once more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see yes let's wait a little longer then we'll see",Let's Wait a Little Longer,1999
Loretta Lynn,"Love is no excuse for what we're doing
For we both know that two hearts could break
We tell ourselves we've got to have each other but love is no excuse for us to make
Sure we love each other and it could be so right
But not if someone else has got to pay
Our love for each other looks good in the night
But our love can never see the light of day
It's been going on for much too long now and our wrongs have mounted one by one
We tell ourselves that's cause we love each other
But love is no excuse for what we've done
Sure we love each other...",Love Is No Excuse,1999
Loretta Lynn,"Somewhere between me and you
I love you so much I can't let you go and sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine there's a door without any key
Somewhere between your heart and mine there's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky somewhere between me and you

Somewhere between your heart and mine there's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile and I'm left in the middle again

Loretta Lynn,"We're that odd couple on our street neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love with each other
Today a friend of mine came by said let's do the town
I can't fix you up with a cutiest thing around
She's what I was jokin' when I told him patiently
The only woman that I want is waitin' at home for me
We're that odd couple...

A neighbor on our left talked with our neighbor on our right

Loretta Lynn,"I slipped out of the house about sundown while mama was a washin' her hair
And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come lookin' for me
When she finds that I'm not there
And if she catches her sweet thang runnin' around
I know there'll be the devil to pay
She'll come blowin' like a cyclone right through that door
And I can hear exactly what she'll say
Well has anybody here see sweet thang I got a notion he'll be headed this a way
Cause when my sweet thang is out tomocattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play
I want to tell all you barroom roses if my sweet thang does have a bite
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eyes

I gave my baby all my money on payday except a little she don't know that I got
Cause there's a cute little waitress at the corner cafe
And she seems to like me quite a lot
While we were sittin' in the back booth a havin' a talk
She believed in every word that I said
When the door blew open Loretta walked in yellin' loud enough to wake the dead
Well has anybody here see sweet thang...
You'd better take my advice...",Sweet Thang,2000
Loretta Lynn,"There's a new expression on my face I ain't seen in quite a while
Must be a smile
There's a new direction in my life and I can't wait to see
Where it takes me
I'm no longer lost in the past,
Even my troubles just roll off my back

[Chorus]
No the blues ain't workin' on me, those old memories
Can't put the hurt in my heart
Baby, love is lettin' me know I'm finally free
And 'cause of you I'll always be
No, the blues ain't workin' on me

Anytime the sun would start to shine,
Some dark cloud would come around and start raining down
Since I found the shelter of your arms
I don't feel the rain no more so let it pour
Might be times when we lose our way
But I know tomorrow I'm still gonna say

Loretta Lynn,"Well, they say that I'm too country, the way I look and sound.
They wanna to make me over, just a little more uptown.
Say I need to change my image, now tell me what's that mean.
Don't they know I've got country in my genes?

Well, I can't help the way I talk, I wouldn't change it if I could.
Sophisticated ain't my style, but country fits me good.
I ain't ashamed to wear what's been handed down to me.
Lord, I've got country in my genes.

I've got country in my genes, country in my blood.
It goes back generations. It's something I'm proud of.
It's something I was born with, what you get is what you see.
I'm just an old hillybilly with a country song to sing.
Lord, I've got country in my genes.

Oh that Earl Scruggs.

If country's hit the big time, me, I'm still the same.
I ain't above my raisin' and I ain't about to change.
I wouldn't trade my Wranglers for the finest gaberdine.

Loretta Lynn,"Oh, I hear familiar sounds down the sidewalk
Gettin' closer with every step he takes
Lord, I'm so afraid that if I look out the window
I'll be tempted to repeat an old mistake.

[Chorus]
Don't open that door
To an old memory,
When he said goodbye
I locked it up tight
And threw out the key.
I've stood here before
Lord I can't stand no more
Won't go there again
Heart don't let him in
Don't open that door.

The stronger me has found the will to fight it
But now he's gone and the weaker side's in tears
Lord, it took so long to put the hurt behind me
If I don't look back the past can't find me here.

Loretta Lynn,"

Well I was born in old Kentucky

In them hills where folks are lucky

From a coal miner's daughter right to a coal miner's wife


Well the mountain folks love the mountains

White lightning flowed like the fountains

On a Sunday morning you can hear all the good folks singin


[Chorus:]

It's God's country in these hills he walks

And in the middle of the night you can hear him talk

It's the closest place to heaven that I know

If you wanna get to heaven get your road map out

It's called the bible if you have one doubt

I guess my friends, you must be on the wrong route


Well I miss the old camp meeting time and dinner on the ground

What I miss most is everything like all the country sounds

Like the lonesome sound of the whippoorwill sang me to sleep every night

And the whistle of the old freight train before daylight


[Chorus]


And my old Kentucky home's far away


",God's Country,2000
Loretta Lynn,"There's two suitcases hid back in the closet
Packed for much more than a few days stay
And in her purse there's several thousand dollars
Years of saving for one rainy day
It scares her half to death to think of leaving
She's never been out on her own before
Too many nights she's cried while he was sleepin'
Oh but she's not sure he loves her any more

[Chorus:]
All he has to do to hold her is to hold her
Tell her how he feels down deep inside
All he has to do to hold her is to hold her
There's no way she would ever leave his side

To him she's always been a special angel
And so much more than he thought he deserved
Oh how was she to know all he's been feeling
When he could never put it into words
He was so afraid one day she'd walk out on him
He knows he's just a plain and simple man(Yes he is)
He could easily tear down that wall between them
Everything he needs to keep her's in his hands

[Chorus:]

Maybe he'll wake up in time
To hold me",Hold Her,2000
Loretta Lynn,"He showed me there was more to me
When I thought I had nothing else to give
God knows he wasn't perfect
Ah, but then, again, nobody is

He always told me the truth
No matter how hard it was to hear
When he said, ""I believe in you""
It was music to my ears

Oh, each word's like a note, like a beautiful tune
The kind that inspires and helps me get through
Ah, if I said I can't, he's say, ""You can""
He was my toughest critic, ah, my biggest fan

Now he's gone to a distant shore
And I can't hear the music anymore

Sometimes late at night
I forget that he's not lyin' next to me
He may be out of sight
But out of mine is something he won't ever be

Things that he said to me
Are still ringing out loud and clear
When he said, ""I love you, baby""
That was music to my ears

Oh, each word's like a note, like a beautiful tune
The kind that inspires and helps me get through
Ah, if I said I can't, he's say, ""You can""

Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear.

In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old-time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere.

I remember mother praying
Father, too, on bended knee
Sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me.

As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder

In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well, the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler

Loretta Lynn,"I was 11 months old
I was just starting to walk
And Daddy always kept a big stick behind the door just in case 
Somebody was to come in that was drunk on moonshine, 
You know, and Daddy had to do something about it
Anyway, this woman, we called her old Aunt Boyd,
She come in and she was telling 
Mommy about her, uh, husband, she thinks is going out with this woman in
Paintsville
So she reared back with that big stick showing 
Mommy how she was going to hit this woman in the head with it
And when she went back with it, she hit me in the head 
And Mommy said I cried for 5 days
And she said I, that fifth night, 
I had a great big knot that show up right in the middle of my forehead
And, you know, the only thing I remember, 
I don't remember no pain, but I just remember Mommy 
And Daddy carrying me in this old quilt that Mommy had made out of overhalls
The knots kept getting bigger and bigger so she took me to the doctor
And that stuff called mesitor, something like that
Mommy said it made both ears flat to my face and I ain't got very big ears
And told Mommy that I would, that I was going to die
And that happened like four times so I didn't walk till I was almost 5
It was, it was kind of a mess

Oh I forgot about the shoes,
Well shoot, I hadn't
I'd never had a pair of shoes
And Mommy had went
Took me to the hospital, you know, to see what that was
If they couldn't do something
But they wouldn't keep me because Mommy and Daddy didn't have no money
They just tell 'em to take me home and let me die, you know, 
Because there wasn't nothing they could do about
That kind of disease, I guess
And, um, Mommy told Daddy, 
Says ""Ted, you take her down the street, you carry her down the street..."" and said,
""...let me try this store here,"" and Mommy went in and told them the story that I was dying, 
That she had to carry me twelve miles to town 
And twelve miles back and that I had no shoes
That place, I think it was Murphy's 5 and 10 and they're still there in Paintsville, Kentucky
And I think that they told Mommy that they wasn't in business to give shoes away
Mommy told Daddy, says, ""Carry Loretta on down a little farther,"" 
Said, ""and let me stop in another store...""
And Mommy went right back to the same store
When the guy's back was turned she stole these little red shoes
And I remember on the big'old bridge that went across the river
It went way up high and was... 
I've always been scared of that bridge that took me across the big Sandy River
Mommy pulled them out from under that yellow jacket that she was wearing
And she was putting them red shoes on me 
And I thought them was the prettiest things I ever saw in my life
And Daddy started crying
And I wondered why
And he said, ""Clerie, we're not going to make it home,""
And Mommy put the shoes on me
And Daddy took off running and run all the way ahead t'Butcher Holler with me
And Mommy never had a chance to carry me any farther
And that's almost twelve miles that Daddy run with me
But Daddy knew that the cops was going to get us
He left Mommy standing and he took off in a dead run
I remember him running but I didn't know what for

And I remember asking Mommy, 
""Mommy, why is Daddy running?""
I remember her hollering, 
""To put your little red shoes away, honey, when you get home.""

Can you believe that?

In a booth in the corner with the lights down low 
I was movin' in fast she was takin' it slow 
Well I looked at him and caught him lookin' at me 
I knew right then we were playin' free in Oregon 

Next day we knew last night got drunk 
But we loved enough for the both of us 
In the morning when the night had sobered up 
It was much too late for the both of us in Oregon

I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
All portion of love had all flown away

Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me to wandering, no words of farewell

Oh, I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway

That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour

Will your big blue eyes be misty will you brush away a tear
A grave is filled with silence but if a sleeping man could hear
Darling you'd hear my footsteps up here

So if it's after midnight or just before the break of day
Anytime you need me, it'll never be too late

Hopin' you can find where you belong, I leave the lights on
My heart is never closed, you're the only love it knows

Loretta Lynn,"Come all you young people
And stand close around
And listen to the story
How Lulie Vars got drowned

She loved this young John Collier
Engaged to be his wife
He ruined her reputation
And then he took her life

They went to Elk Horn City
About 60 miles away
He promised they would marry
And their secret it would stay

They went out for a little walk
Hand in hand they strolled
In the middle of December
And the wind was blowing cold

They walked down by the river
Still water it runs deep
She could tell by the way he looked at her
In the bottom she would sleep

She threw her arms around him
Begging for her life
I'll go back to my mother
If I can't be your wife

Poor Lulie she went missing
Nowhere could be found
They searched the country over
For miles and miles around

John Collier joined the army
4 months came and passed
In the bottom of that river
Her body was found at last

They took her from the river
To a nearby town
That railroad still around her neck
Weighed about thirty pounds

When Lulie's mother got the news
She was sitting in her home
She quickly left her chair
To bring her baby home

John Collier was arrested
Locked behind the bars
He'll spend his whole life paying
For the murder of Lulie Vars",Lulie Vars,2018

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Lori Carsillo,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2004

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you

though I knew there was something wrong

I just never would suspect a thing

though I knew it wouldn't help me none

were just something I never knew

Do you,
Take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife

Til death do you part ?  ""I do""

From the words of a patriot
""I often fear that the sins in my past
Will come back to haunt me
But the consequenses are more than I can bare""
I feel that shit
This piece right here
Is about what comes with fame
And the struggle to keep family within a family
I give you......This Ring

(1st Verse)
This ring
Got me a top notch
Straight hot fox
We sought rocks
And the Ewok Slot
Was caught
Got dropped two
Playing hopscotch
On the block
Ought not twat plot
Yo for hops knot I brought dots

This ring
Helped me remain sane
No dame games
Came from bane
To a changed man
No cane thang
Refrain from gang bang
Slang a praying brain
Reigns family fame
Then came pain

Say hello to TECH N9NE
Everybody want to be down with a nigga
Women get a whiff of the money
Thinking of taking it from me
They get up in the club
Giving the love
Throwin the pussy
Full of liquor and bud
Booty hopping around up in the MO
Get to looking around
Every ho want to lick a nigga low
Infatuated
With niggas with dough
Get 'em in the sack
And try to make 'em let it go

Tech N9ne
Be autographing bitches
In front of rappin niggas
Who think of having figures
They get to grapping triggas
They can't imagine villians
When they come back and get us
We get to whacking niggas
I ain't never wanted no parts of this
I don't ever want to break
Another heart for this
Why the Devil gotta make it
Why the Lord gotta make something that'll kill
Something so marvelous

(Hook)
This ring
Brings demeaning Demons in
G-strings
Songs we sing
Make 'em fiend semen
And green things
Clinging
Dreaming
Thinking of being Miss Thing
With this ring
But if i wasn't Tech N9ne
Bitches wouldn't even want to be with
Tech N9ne
If I did no music
Then would you respect mine
This wedding band and music draws a line
Between
Life and Tech N9ne

(2nd Verse)
This ring
Was supposed to protect a nigga
Best for niggas
Who couldn't stop having sex
With bitches
Bless the Mrs.
Who stress to kiss us
Even though we spend on
Checks with strippers
Obsessed with clitorises

This ring
Made a nigga feel macho
Cry fo
Lie fo
Die fo
My ho
Nigga I go face
Diablo
With a hostile gospel
If I can't have tres or cuatro
Little vatos
Imma let a lot flow
What the sell
Up in Osco
Up a nostril

That sound like Tech N9ne
Nigga where the weed
Where the muthafucking
Blow
And the hoes (yes yes)
Next to me
Is Ectasy
Asking me if i want to roll (yes yes)
Bitches never gave a fuck about a fling
Make's it exciting
When a married nigga
want to fuck around
And a bitch know he down for a fling (yes yes)

I've been tested
And a lot of times
Been invested
Didn't know this Tech shit
Would constantly
Get a nigga molested
Been aproached by some of the best tricks
In the game
And they came strong
But I hanged on
To this ring
And I hope my son don't sing the same song

(Hook Repeat)

(3rd Verse)
Quincy J told me
Super stars are good providers
But
2 times outta 10
When we on tour
Family's not besides us
What
Can a nigga do
When he make ends
Add more to the time they spend
While he make ends
Everything else breaking
And the bond at the house
May end

And your wifey steadily yellin bout quality time
And you think
With all the fame and fortune
Shit outta be fine
But what happens when
The divorce papers just gotta be signed
And you lose half
And your children
'cause you gotta be N9ne

I want to relaxe wit 'em
And spend time to the maximum
But if silence is golden
Then me making noise is platinum
I gotta be Tech
And Daddy and Hubby
But music
Women mixed with family's ugly
I know and you know
That hell will be
Hot for a nigga's infidelity

But until then
God forgive me for any
Promises that I broke
Family
Can I be
Forgiven
For all the
Liquor and weed that I smoked
When I succeed
Will I cope?
Will I still breathe without both?
This ring
Tech N9ne
I dunno
But when I go
I'm leavin out DOPE!

And wish that I was just like you
But I'm telling you
I wish I was a better person

I don't want to work at it
It should come naturally
It shouldn't be so difficult
Should be more like honey to the bee

Well the bee has his sting and the sky has her rain
And I have all of my things that I shouldn't do over again
But if I just say the words and I look you in the eye
That I am promising you, I promise
I wish I was a better person

I don't want to work at it
It should come naturally
It shouldn't be so difficult
Should be more like honey to the bee

Well it's Monday afternoon and I'm drinking again
And I know I promised you that the Lord would be my friend
But the Lord and I don't get along so very good
He doesn't speak a word out to me
Like you promised that he would
And I'm telling you
I am telling you
I am telling you
I wish I was a better person
A better person

Lori McKenna,"They're building up big houses
Back behind the school
Where we used to drink our beer on Friday nights
And pretend that we were lovers in your car

We can't afford to live there
So we drive on past their marble and glass
Hoping that this blue collar town of ours
Won't ever lose its balls

I was just a little girl
When your hand brushed by my hand
And I will be an old woman
Happy to have spent my whole life with one man

Behind that school we found romance
We laid in the dirt and took off our shirts
While the lucky ones would fly away
On planes to other cities, other towns

Now they're building up houses
Big enough to lose your love
Big enough to never even see
One another in the dark

One man, one town is all I need
A simple plan to guide me
Through the simple life I lead
I have seen the ocean and I have seen the sky
I do not need a big house or the ability to fly

We'll remember the summers
The crumbling town streets, running from police
And acting like we'd leave this place
The minute we ever had the chance",One Man,2004
Lori McKenna,"The number to the house is on the door

But I'm tired of reading your mind this way 
So why don't you say it 

You're tearing me up inside, you're tearing me up inside
It feels like something in me died, feels like something in me died
All of the bright colors that live inside of me are now 
Just tiny pieces of what used to be

Thinking how those flowers would all just fade away 
And it seemed like such a waste of beauty

And
Now your tearing me up inside
You're tearing me up inside
Feels like something in me died, feels like something in me died 
All of the bright colors that lived inside of me 
Are now just tiny pieces of what used to be

Isn't it a crying shame that nothing ever stays the same?
I can't fit into that wedding dress or be 23 again

Stop the car and touch the ground

Rusty old gas pumps

With somethin' before I go
Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company

I don't know no town

Yeah, there's something 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
That keeps me turning home

I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field
My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright
And glory days I can't re-live
Stories I'll never forget

And I don't know no friends

And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night

We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made and prayin' I got it right
Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent

When I think about the best times

Miles of wires and kitchen drawer knobs
Transistor radios, scrap metal
Hand-me-down tools, one of everything
Old keys to unlock unknown things

The Fighter says, ""Some things just can't be fixed""
Touching the cross on her necklace
Reminding The Fixer that she still believes
He whispers, ""Then ask for a miracle please""

Goin' thirty miles-an-hour down a side road talkin' 'bout the fish we caught

And you still think he's forty-five and he still thinks that you're a kid

One day you'll find yourself sayin' the things that he said
You'll be walkin' down the hallway, turnin' off every light switch
When you twirl your kids in your arms
Before you know it, it won't take too long

Know who we are

Said they will always be with us until He comes again
Does that mean we shouldn't try
Should I just lay on down and die

Sento cantar una canzon d'amore
Più volte la ripete un bel garzone
E battere mi sento forte il core
E battere mi sento forte il core

Oh, com'è dolce quella melodia
Oh, com'è bella, quanto m'è gradita
Ch'io la canti non vuol la mamma mia
Vorrei saper perché me l'ha proibita
Ella non c'è ed io la vo' cantar
La frase che m'ha fatto palpitare

Vorrei baciare i tuoi capelli neri
Le labbra tue e gli occhi tuoi severi
Vorrei morir con te, angel di dio
O bella innamorata, tesor mio

Mi darete di più

Lieta farebbe a dio l'alma ritorno
A primavera e sul morir del giorno

Quando ai rami una foglia più non resta
Allora di morir avrei paura

Lorna Gross,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side

Lorna Luft,"Where the boys are
Someone waits for me,
A smiling face, a warm embrace,
Two arms to hold me tenderly.
Where the boys are
My true love will be,
He's walking down some street in town
And I know he's looking there for me.
 
In the crowd of a million people
I'll find my valentine,
Then I'll climb to the highest steeple
And tell the world he's mine.
 
'Til he holds me
I wait impatiently.
Where the boys are,
Where the boys are,
Where the boys are,
Someone waits for me.

Lorna Luft,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Lorne Greene,"He lay face down in the desert sand
Clutching his six-gun in his hand
Shot from behind, I thought he was dead
But under his heart was an ounce of lead
But a spark still burned so I used my knife
And late that night I saved the life of Ringo

(Ringo, Ringo)

I nursed him till the danger passed
The days went by, he mended fast
Then from dawn till setting sun
He practiced with that deadly gun
And hour on hour I watched in awe
No human being could match the draw of Ringo

(Ringo, Ringo)

One day we rode the mountain crest
And I went east and he went west
I took to law and wore a star
While he spread terror near and far
With lead and blood he gained such fame
All through the West they feared the name of Ringo

(Ringo, Ringo)

I knew someday I'd face the test
Which one of us would be the best
And sure enough the word came down
That he was holed up in the town
I left the posse out in the street
And I went in alone to meet Ringo

(Ringo, Ringo)

They said my speed was next to none
But my lightning draw had just begun
When I heard a blast that stung my wrist
The gun went flying from my fist
And I was looking down the bore
Of the deadly .44 of Ringo

(Ringo, Ringo)

They say that was the only time
That anyone had seen him smile
He slowly lowered his gun and then
He said to me ""We're even, friend""
And so at last I understood
That there was still a spark of good in Ringo

(Ringo, Ringo)

I blocked the path of his retreat
He turned and stepped into the street
A dozen guns spit fire and lead
A moment later, he lay dead
The town began to shout and cheer
Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo

(Ringo, Ringo)

The story spread throughout the land
That I had beaten Ringo's hand
And it was just the years, they say
That made me put my guns away
But on his grave they can't explain
The tarnished star above the name of Ringo

Lorne Greene,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Lorraine Ferro,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful [From Road to Rio] [Complete Version],2010

Others keep the ladies with soft pretty words

Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing

You became my very best friend
Soon as I had done my chores
I'd beat a path from our house to yours
One Christmas we both asked for bikes
One in red, one blue and white

My first ride from our house to yours
From our house to yours
Twenty-one mailboxes, twenty-one doors
For ten years or more
It was back and forth from our house to yours
One summer we both had a crush
On a boy who lived down the road from us
He liked me but he liked you more
I watched him go from our house to yours
I remember the day you turned thirteen
Thought you had grown too old for me
But I taught you make-up, you taught me boys
We burned up the phone lines from our house to yours
From our house to yours
Seven numbers, twenty-one doors
For ten years or more
I knew way from our house to yours
I'll never forget that awful day
When the moving van took you away
I cried till my eyes were red and sore
Five hundred miles from our house to yours
It had been a while since you crossed my mind
Then a card in the mailbox at Christmas time
With an evergreen wreath on a red front door

The way you smiled when you said my name
I could see my life would never be the same

And I knew nothing I could say or do
Would come close to thankin' you for your love
And I could try for the rest of my life
But that wouldn't be half enough

I turned around and you were here

They were talkin' and they were laughin'
Just like we used to do every day

Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace 
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom"" 
We were part of the lonely crowd Inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, expecting to fly, we would meet on that shore in the sweet by and by 
Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away 
And some of the stayed behind inside the Sad Cafe.

The fight we had just made me feel 
I had enough I felt like driving anywhere that left you far behind 
And I hated you at exit fifty-nine 
I passed the cars I passed the trucks 
I passed them all Saw you sitting home just waiting for my call 
But my angry heart would not allow an ounce of sympathy 
It was could as ice at exit sixty-three
With every passing mile the question seemed to grow 
Who was right and who was wrong and who's to know 
My anger turned to sorrow as my tears began to pour 
What a tangled mind at exit eighty-four 
The city slowly faded into farms and fields 
The world took on a different point of view 
I loosened up my grip around that steering wheel 
And I wondered if you were sorry too

I rolled the window down at exit ninety-one
Felt the cool wind blowing through my hair 
I saw the crimson light embrace the setting sun 
And suddenly I wished you were there 
I couldn't wait to stop and find a telephone 
To call you up and tell you I was coming home 
Funny how a ribboned road can make you change your mind

Or try to keep your feelings hid
You don't need to bottle your emotions
Of the way your daddy did

I can see inside you're hurtin'
Even though your eyes are dry
If you let a tear roll down your cheek
Honey, that don't mean you're weak
You're just strong enough to cry

They're not just little drops of water
That show the way you feel
They turn coal into diamonds
And iron into steel

I know you think that you'll be weaker
If a tear falls from your eye
Oh, but you don't understand
A woman needs a man
Who's is strong enough to cry

Every rock that we can lean on
It's not just shaped out of stone
It didn't get that way by settin'
Their dry as a bone

It took a million years of changin'
As the rain fell on it from the sky
You want to be that rock for me
Honey, I need you to be strong enough to cry

They're not just little drops of water

They turn coal into diamonds
And iron into steel

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference

It's easier to believe in - this sweet madness, oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

Leave behind these worries
Like I should have long ago
'Cause I know...

[Chorus:]
I can count on you
In a world that's always changing
Steadfast and true
Not a doubt remains
You'll break my heart in two
Just like you always do
I can count on you

I've been afraid to be without you
Guess that's why I stayed so long
Now I know too much about you
To just keep hangin' on
You won't be there when I need you
In the middle of the night
No more wonderin' when I'll see you
I'll just turn out the light
And close my eyes

Lorrie Morgan,"When I lit my first cigarette it didn't hurt me none
But I realized the danger on my 97th one
I took a pill, I did the patch, got myself hypnotized
Blew away the ashes, drew a great big breath of life
Now there's

[CHORUS]
One less monkey
Hangin' on my back
I shook it off, cut it loose and that's 5, 4, 3, 2
One less monkey that I have to feed
I feel so much lighter, now there's
One less monkey on me
I was just a number on the clock from 9 to 5
Rushing through the madness, I was payin' with my life
I had a dream, I had a plan a long, long time ago
Resigned myself to freedom and I took it on the road
Now there's

There's a jungle full of monkeys that would love to weigh you down
But I'm lookin' for a better way of monkeyin' around

Sweet sixteen
Crying in the dark
On the front porch swing
She's got a secret she can't keep for long
Don't want to tell her daddy and her mamma
She's afraid that everybody's gonna say about her
Once the truth is known

Rock, yeah, they're easy to find
Everybody knows what's wrong and right
Oh, rocks, yeah, who's gonna draw the line
Rock, oh, were made to be thrown
So ye without sin cast the first stone
Dirty old man begging on the street
He needs a job if he wants to eat
Who's he tryin' to fool with the cardboard sign
Whatever you do don't give him any money
Everybody knows he ain't really hungry
He's just gonna spend it all on wine

Don't talk to him

Because of what they believe

And all the secrets we can never tell

We got legendary stories, we're anything but boring
We've got letdowns and hang-ups, laugh lines and break-ups
And all the grace the world will allow, us girls

For 15 years we've passed around
The same advice, the same 10 pounds

Was to certain poor Shepard's in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

Then they looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

This star drew nigh to the north-west
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense

Born is the kind of Israel

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,

Nos tiramos, nos merecemos
Nos maltratamos
Sin lavarnos las manos, cariño

Y cada noche despierto cuando siento
Tu voz que siempre me llama, me llama

Mientras 
Otro ocupa mi lugar 
Otro duerme junto a ti

Que sin ti no valgo nada

Y ahora 
Otro ocupa mi lugar 
Otro duerme junto a ti

Los Acosta,"Si alguna vez quieres
Volver allí estaré en ese lugar
Donde te hice mujer

Te esperare todo el tiempo
Que sea necesario
Y viviré con la ilusión
De que vuelvas a mi lado

Te esperaré por que sé
Que tú me quieres como
Solamente a ti te estoy
Queriendo no olvides

Que en el mundo existe
Alguien que te espera
Y te acepta tal como eres

Los Acosta,"Esta es la última canción
Que escribo para ti.
Me cansé de vivir sin sentido
De pensar solo en ti.

Si mañana me encuentras tal vez
Yendo con otra y tu me ves
Haz de la cuenta que para ti
No soy aquel.

Y ahora tu que me hiciste llorar
Tendrás que recordar
Que fui tuyo en el alma y perdiste
Tu oportunidad.

Las canciones más lindas de amor
Que escribí para ti pensando en ti
Confieso que cuales de aquellas
Ya no escucharás


Ya mañana se que esta canción
Tendrás que escuchar en la radio sonar.
Pensarás que tu orgullo maldito
Me hizo llorar de tanto esperar
Pero no llores y siente por dentro
Que duele el amor

Entonces vas a ver
Lo que vale un gran amor.
Entonces llorarás
Y de mí te acordarás.

Entonces vas a ver
Lo que vale un gran amor.
Entonces llorarás
Y de mí te acordarás.

Esta es la última canción

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Otra victoria sin gloria escoria que cual espina penetra 
Otro sonido de metra que se siente de otro jodido rincón 
Que no visito el presidente 
Otros delincuentes tomando por asalto tu mente 
Armados con los problemas de su gente
Otros que como tu cargan errores, sienten 
Sobrevivientes, vividores, solo eso nos hace diferentes
A lo más bajo vente donde se vive al día 
Tú dime un día en que no hay un fajo que cuentes, vente! 
Donde vive esta mujer que te lo hace por dinero 
Para que su hijo se alimente 
Donde no vas pues dices que es peligroso el ghetto
La droga ahoga, pero no caen los que los introdujeron
Las pandillas se matan, la policía maltrata 
Mientras la mafia real come con cubiertos de plata 
Es nuestra realidad, no sabemos de lujo 
Todo viene y se va, nadie controla el flujo 
Mucha necesidad dentro de poco espacio 
Vamos a más velocidad pues vivimos despacio
Vicios o socio no hay ley 
Negocios, socio, no hay break 
Aleluya vivimos en la calle 
Nuestra casa es más grande que la tuya! 

Yo sé, que el amor el amor sin amor se fue

cuba, Chile y américa latina 
Santiago, la habana, las capitales unidas 
Centro, sur cordillera o planicie valle que vaya 
Caminando ya hacia la isla desde el malecón se abrirán las alamedas 
Se prenderán las velas y la luz con sus estelas centinelas sobre suelas 
Secuelas sobre las huellas, revueltas las escuela la cautela no da sueltas 
Ella es la calle, ella es la madre 
Ella es la abuela de todos los pilares 
La que no te deja, ni menos te abandona 
La que no te suelta si la vida te desploma 
Ella es la base que hace taza y es tu cas
Es pedazo de cemento, es tu esquina, y es tu plaza 
La que no te falla, la que no te calla 
Si tu lloras en su falda, ella te abraza en su muralla 
La que todo mira, todo observa y a la deriva 
Esquiva de forma agresiva, la salida más viva 
Explosiva de vida, sin normativas viva 
Creativa y activa, de la calle más combativa
Que vio nacer en su manto, que vio caer a tantos, tantos 
Que ningún canto alcanzaría para cuantos 
Firme y fuerte por todos los ausentes 
Firme y fuerte por todos los presentes

Yo sé, que el amor el amor sin amor se fue

Todo el tiempo si te preguntan, di que somos de la calle! 

Yeah, vengo de un lugar oscuro, sobrado de sombras 
Donde la ley es no respetar la ley que pongan 
Donde la injusticia oficial pisado se compra 
Y verdad que gira inspira la mentira que nos ronda 
Mantén tu fe fuerte, no dejes que la fechorías 
Espirituales te afecten 
Ni hagan efecto en tu alma, la infecten 
Friend sin frenar, inclina tu frente 
La vista pesa, la gente aprisa, va por la pista
Y la humanidad solo en la plata piensa
Y en la street la triste tristeza sigue free, fría
Y frívola nos besa 
Lava te que, la lava te quema
Nada te queda, nadao te queda 
Acaba esa sed que acaba tu sed escaba tu ser y clava 
Tus pies donde puedas
La sangre corre, errores no hay quien borre forre esa 
Y con responsabilidad y no respire hondo porque puede 
Caer como las torres 
Y no resistirá ver que tu ser no se deshonre. 
El fin esta, canta y un gallo 
La calle es un ring donde king del king queremos ser 
Tu caballo 
Sacan la mano a lo velocidad delo rayo y más caro 
Que un Rolls Royce del año te salen los fallos 
Ana Tijoux hermana di tu si en Chile pagan en dólares 
Y cobran en club, como el pana mapucho lucho para 
Que escuchen mi voz en un lugar donde corrupto ahorita 
Ya es hasta dios 

Yo sé, que el amor el amor sin amor se fue 
Cuando el dinero se apodero de la fe 
Que detrás de todo siempre hay interés

A una ciudad muy lejana 
Me encargo que le trajera 
Una lechuga alemana 
Un clavelito frances

En este mundo tal vez nadie sobra, no ha de faltar quien me sepa querer, por la de buenas que Dios me hizo hombre, no he de llorar por ninguna mujer.

Why por teléfono te llamo inútilmente
Pero tú no me quieres ni siquiera oír.

Espera que estoy cansado de llorar
Que no puedo olvidar tu amor
Why con mis lagrimas se enhestan los recuerdos
De los días felices que no volverán.

Amar es algo más
Que verse why conversar
Amar es entregarse
Es más que una ilusión
Es más que una pasión
Amar es perdonarse.

Amar es algo más
Que dar una amistad
Amar es ir cantando
Para aprender a amar
No basta con soñar
Amar se aprende amando.

Porque el amor te da cobijo why calor
Enciende tu corazón
Te da la vida
Why en el adiós queda un amargo dolor
Why el aire deja un sabor a despedida.

Quisiera poder hablarte una vez más
Decirte que no soy feliz
Reconocer uno por uno mis errores
Pedir que me perdones
Si es que te ofendí.

Ahora voy rebuscando en el ayer
Soñando con volver a tí
Mientras en vano mi teléfono te llama
Tratar de lentamente se vistió de gris.

Amar es algo más
Que verse why conversar
Amar es entregarse
Es más que una ilusión
Es más que una pasión
Amar es perdonarse.

Amar es algo más
Que dar una amistad
Amar es ir cantando
Para aprender a amar
No basta con soñar
Amar se aprende amando.

Porque el amor te da cobijo why calor
Enciende tu corazón
Te da la vida
Why en el adiós queda un amargo dolor
Why el aire deja un sabor a despedida.

Porque el amor te da cobijo why calor
Enciende tu corazón
Te da la vida
Why en el adiós queda un amargo dolor
Why el aire deja un sabor a despedida.

Porque el amor te da cobijo why calor
El amor te da pasión, te da ilusión
Why te da la vida, te da la vida
Why en el adiós queda un amargo dolor
Qué mal sabor quedó en mi boca
Pero tú puede pa' mí que todavía me provoca mi amor.

Porque el amor te da cobijo why calor
Yo con tanto calor, con tanto fuego
Why tu pasando frío en el corazón
Why en el adiós queda un amargo dolor
Why el aire deja un sabor...

Porque el amor te da cobijo why calor
Yo te pido perdón, ya no aguanto el dolor
Regresa a mi lado por favor
Why en el adiós queda un amargo dolor
Why cómo yo le hago nena, dime cómo me quito del alma
Esta pena, esta pena penita mi amor.

Porque el amor te da cobijo why calor
En cien lagrimas yo he quedado
Muy decepcionado why desilusionado está mi corazón
Why en el adiós queda un amargo dolor
Why el aire deja un sabor a despedida.

Mirando a toda esas chicas pasar frente a mi,
