The Country Dance Kings,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are",Islands In the Stream,2011

The Country Deputy Band,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
 
Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a guy with a drink in his hand. 
He had bay blue eyes, coal black hair 
And a smile that a girl understands. 
Then he came and sat down at my table,
And as he placed his hands over mine,
I found my self wanting to kiss him 
For temptation was flowing like wine.

The Country Deputy Band,"As far as I'm concerned 
That amber moon that can make the tides return 
Won't match the light within my eyes 
The night I learned that I'm the one you'll always love

As far as I'm concerned 
The mid day sun that can make the planets turn 
Is cold as ice compared with how your kisses burn 
And show my heart the warmth of love

Long, long ago days were empty life was oh such a slow caravan 
But now that you're here how the hours tumble by and the days disappear
They say we live and learn but what care I 
If I never ever learn why robins fly away 
As long as they return and I love you and you love me 
For that's as far as I'm concerned.

The Country Deputy Band,"Long distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find a party that tried to get in touch with me
She could not leave a number but I know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took a message and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge

Last time I saw Marie she was waving me goodbye
With ""hurry-home"" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
Marie is only six years old, information please 
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee",Memphis,1998

We'll have these moments to remember
The quiet walks the noisy fun the ballroom prize we almost won

The laughter we were glad to share will echo through the years
Though other nights and other days may find us gone our separate ways

The Country Deputy Band,"I was born in Saginaw Michigan
I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay
My dad was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay

I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand

Now I'm up here in Alaska looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm a digging in this frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan

I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan
I said, ""Honey I'm a-coming home, please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm coming home a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondike history""

Her dad met me in Saginaw Michigan
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said, ""Son, you wild young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim""

Now he's up there in Alaska digging in the cold cold ground
The greedy fool is a-looking for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is missing him
Least of all the newly weds of Saginaw Michigan
We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw Michigan
He's ashamed to show his face in Saginaw Michigan","Saginaw, Michigan",1998
The Country Deputy Band,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again

The Country Gentlemen,"Poor Ellen Smith how was she found
Shot through the heart lying cold on the ground
Her clothes were all scattered and thrown on the ground
The blood marks the spot where poor Ellen was found

2. They pick up their rifles and hunted me down
They found me a-loafing in all around the town
They pick up her body and carried it away
And now she is sleeping in some lonesome old grave

3. I got a letter yesterday I read it today
The flowers on her grave have all faded away
Someday I'll go home and say when I go
On poor Ellen's grave pretty flowers I'll stow

4. I've been in this prison for twenty long years
Each night I see Ellen through my bitter tears
The warden just told me that soon I'll be free
To go to her grave 'neath that old willow tree

5. My days in this prison are ending at last
I'll never be free from the sins of my past
Poor Ellen Smith how was she found
Shot through the heart lying cold on the ground
",Ellen Smith,1960
The Country Gentlemen,"Come all ye fair and tender ladies
                                  (D)
take warning how, you court young men.

They're like a star, on a summer morning
            (Am)                     (D)
they first appear, and then they're gone.


They'll tell to you, some loving story
And they make you think, that they love you well.
Then away they'll go, and court some other
and leave you there, in grief to dwell.

I wish I was, a little sparrow
and had wings to fly so high
I'd fly away, to my false true lover
and when she'd ask, I would deny.

Oh love is handsome, love is charming
love is pretty, while its new.
But love grows old, as love grows older
and fades away, like morning dew.",The Little Sparrow,1960

The Country Gentlemen,"Ten years ago
On a cold dark night
Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,1963
The Country Gentlemen,"(Chorus:)
She walks through the corn leadin' down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot mornin' sun
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
And left me to die like a fox on the run
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox on the run

Now everybody knows the reason for my fall
A woman tempted me down in paradise hall
This woman tempted me and she took me for a ride
Like a lonely fox, boys, i need a place to hide

(Chorus)

Oh, we'll drink a glass of wine, boys, to purify our soul
We'll talk about the world and the friends we used to know
I see a string of girls who have put me on before

The Country Gentlemen,"We started out from Bern one sunny August morn
There was just the four of us against the Matterhorn
There was Albert the Australian and John the Irishman
Me and Bill from Britain, mad dogs in the sun

   Matterhorn, Matterhorn
   Men have tried and men have died to climb the Matterhorn
   That mighty Matterhorn

Two miles up we lost John and our rations fell below
Now Al and Bill are lying beneath an avalanche of snow
Now here I am alone and I know I cannot stop
Two more yards in front of me before I reach the top

Now here I am a dying upon the Matterhorn
Not a thing for me to lie in or a thing to keep me warm
The Queen would surely knight me if I could get back down
But it's closer here to heaven than it is back to the ground",Matterhorn,1970
The Country Gentlemen,"As my mind wanders back to the quaint little shack
Where in childhood I used to play;
There with mother and dad, we were happy and glad
As we whiled the sweet moments away;
We would all kneel in prayer and in reverence there
We would praise the redeemer on high.
Now in sadness I pine for that old home of mine
And I long for that mother's love.

(Chorus)

I'd like to go back to that quaint little tumble-down shack.
I'd like to spend a day where in heaven forever I'll stay,
But time won't turn back; we must travel til Jesus shall call.
Then we'll be happy in that land where no cabins fall.

Though I drifted away from childhood's sweet play
I can still hear those voices sweet.
They are calling me back to that quaint little shack
Where the circle will never more meet;

We will praise the redeemer on high.
Now in sadness I pine for that old home of mine
And I long for that mother's love.

The Country Gentlemen,"I was driving down a lonely road one dark and stormy night
When a little girl by the roadside showed up in my headlights
I stopped and she got in back and in a shaky tone
She said: My name is Mary, please won't you take me home?

She must have been so frightened all alone there in the night
There was something strange about her, for her face was deathly white
She sat so pale and quiet in the back seat all alone
I'll never will forget that night I took Mary home

I pulled into the driveway where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car and opened up the door
But I just could not believe my eyes 'cause the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car but Mary wasn't there

A light shone from the porch, someone opened up the door
I asked about the little girl that I was looking for
Then a lady gently smiled and brushed a tear away
She said: It sure was nice of you to go out of your way

But thirteen years ago today a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life and we miss her so
Thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shone
You're the thirteenth one who's been here bringing Mary home",Bringing Mary Home,1987

Or some other seaport town

While sailing 'round the ocean,
While sailing 'round the sea

Wherever she might be.

Don't you remember, Molly
You gave me your right hand?
You said whenever you'd marry
I would be the man.

Many bitter tears were shed

I have seen the waters high, almost fierce and rushing by
I have seen in nearly dry and without motion



Now at last you can see what it has come to
Oh we prospered but poisoned the waters
Now the turnes have all been played and the piper must be paid
Not by us but our sons and daughters",Come and Sit by the River,1988
The Country Gentlemen,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again),1989
The Country Gentlemen,"Well, I came down there with my hat caved in
Oh I'll go back home with my pocket full of tin oh doo-dah day
Goin' to run all night, goin' to run all day

Well, the Camptown ladies sing this song doodah doodah

Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

The Country Gentlemen,"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon",Dark as a Dungeon,1998
The Country Gentlemen,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!""

The Country Gentlemen,"There's a Star-Spangled Banner waving somewhere
In a distant land so many miles away.
Only Uncle Sam's great heroes get to go there
Where I wish that I could also live some day.
I'd see Lincoln, Custer, Washington and Perry,
And Nathan Hale and Colin Kelly, too.
There's a Star-Spangled Banner waving somewhere,
Waving o'er the land of heroes brave and true.

In this war with its mad schemes of destruction
Of our country fair and our sweet liberty,
By the mad dictators, leaders of corruption,
Can't the U. S. use a mountain boy like me?
God gave me the right to be a free American,
And for that precious right I'd gladly die.
There's a Star-Spangled Banner waving somewhere,
That is where I want to live when I die.
 
Though I realize I'm crippled, that is true, sir,
Please don't judge my courage by my twisted leg.
Let me show my Uncle Sam what I can do, sir,
Let me help to bring the Axis down a peg.
If I do some great deed I will be a hero,
And a hero brave is what I want to be.

In that heaven there should be a place for me.

Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.

When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.

A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.

He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

The Coup,"Check it out, it's the motherfucking c-o-u
To the p now you're fucking with the real dudes
Who will meet you with a fleet of brothers in the street
Getting drunk off liberation fuck the hennessey
Cause you calmly kept us down for far too long
Now you're going up in smoke like cheech and chong
And the song ""I ain't the nigga"" is the constitution
Niggas die but africans make revolution
So what happens when a people do not get their dues
Well it's tried there's a riot so flip on the news
And let's go reach the 98th here in oaktown
But let's just say for story's sake that it's in your town
A hundred brothers taking factories, warren's law is gutters
And now they're handing out free chicken and free peanut butter
Free food to the people, how it should be
But now let's go a few blocks over to 7-3
Channel 2 says at the mall twelve cops got shot
Cause there's eight hundred sisters taking over eastmont
With nines and ak's doing the right think like spike lee
And now their babies got free pampers and free nikes
Up at the schoolhouse they said motherfuck a hall pass
Until you teach the truth, check it we ain't going to class
You're teaching lies, we got wise, now we realize
There's no end to this road, you disguised the prize
So peep game for real mental penetration
Our education's liberation

Things ain't gon' never be the same

At 6-9 there's a rally and it's swinging
Through the crowd with a thousand voices singing
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
Motherfuckers took over, and now we running the show
We don't give a damn about section eight though
For what we really need we're gonna have to take mo'
The same thing was heard in the a courts
In kendall village, across the bay in fillmore
And in the hills where all the rich folks live
They're in shock we're not failing to vote and build
Instead of brothers on stage singing ""do me""
A black man has a gauge singing ""do this, see?""
All of a sudden everybody is out of jail
But it's funny cause no one is out on bail
And somebody shoved some police against the wall
I guess today they should've worn their clean drawers
Cause an ambulance came, that's the reality
There's now a new meaning to police brutality

All we need is satisfaction
We don't want just a fraction
And we've come to
A conclusion
Revolution is the solution

Check it
Now the uzi's that were once used to kill each other
Are now used to serve and protect the brothers
And the sisters cause they're packing .45's and nines
We're down for revolution not just down for their behinds
Cause the word is heard across the bay and in l.a
In new york, ny, chicago, and atlanta, g-a
We gives a fuck if you've got money and the millions
Cause motherfucker we've got posse in the billions
So break yourself bush, it's collection day
Break yourself trump, it's collection day
Break yourself dupont, it's collection day
You stole the shit from my great granddaddy anyway
The liquor stores around, but they're not selling beer or ale
Motherfuckers selling molotov cocktails
To the crew, so light up a brew
And this is what is meant by a god damned coup

Guerillas in the Mist, a Guevara named Ernesto, so
(E-Roc: What a brother with a afro know?)
Yo, go and flow for the mack and be the hoe
So grow cause the lynchin brothers might get hung
Better rip through em from the tip of my mouth/Mao, say/Tse-Tung/tongue
Deficit (money spent) catch the glint
(E-Roc: of my nine as they cut welfare twenty-five percent)
And I dissent, as I clench and raise my fist
(We did away with, that) so you could get with this
Here's a twist cause we'll overthrow like Kwame N'Krumah
Spread around the wealth as if it were a, vicious rumor
Pam, cuts a record like a surgeon cuts a tumor from a brain
(E-Roc: We're all cooped up so feel the pain)
From four hundred years of exploitation
Anesthesia provided by your local TV station
Patience is not a virtue (I ain't waitin)
Turn this shit over like Bush did a boatload of Haitians

How now Brown Cow I'm down with the Mau Mau
Clown downtown tried to put us in the dog pound
Like H. Rap Brown with the situation
(Won't get no callouses) cause I'm spittin dialectical analysis
So how is this, we never had no Funk
Until you found out that I turned to revolutionary hunk
(Chump!) Bump you over like dominoes, rat
(E-Roc: So free Geronimo Gi Jaga Pratt!)
Lyrics hear it fear it can't get near it
Got a sample didn't clear it
Point Blank says, ""Fuck five-oh!"" That's the spirit
Cheer it, spat out, the fat that I consumed
Knew that I was doomed since my date of birth
To be the wretched of the earth, never had a Dream that was American
(The golden ?leg to chair again?) Despair again
(But that ain't nuthin new) Told the streets were paved with gold
Whoever paved that shit got minimum wage too!

*DJ Pam cuts and scratches ""Dig It!""*

""Do you understand, the metaphoric phrase?"" (repeat 3X)
""Do you understand, do you understand...""

(E-Roc: Gunned us, stunned us) exploited and they hung us
I'd like to take a moment to say, ""Fuck Columbus!""
(Millions off my back) the black on black crisis is a myth
The crack that did this to us (was the one from the whip)
The record skip, the record skip, the record ship *SCRATCH*
The record skips, cause my voice is kinda scratchy
From yelling, ""Oh shit!"" when five-oh comes to harass me
They never pass me, no one to go and tail bro
(E-Roc: Trying to kill the movement with the new CoIntelPro)
Leaders they killed, if I said it, it would threaten em
They only see my back because I'm three steps ahead of em
We're not fallin in the slot you slated
(E-Roc: We realize that our power's nickel-plated)
Masses move as well as asses do, class is through
Our time is over, past it's due
(And you still wanna know) the origin of the flow
OAKLAND CALIFORNIA NINE-FOUR-SIX-ONE-OH

Funny there's no money for my people's production

Several hundred years we have been in a chain gang
Let our shackles only add on to a migraine
Old fame, thoughts of pain slowly drive me insane

But then I started rapping for The Coup
A lot of rappers out there just looking for the pay-off

That I should squeal to the cops but that's out of the question

Could he be judged by the system that is scared of me and others? 
I believe no, so I don't go, with the flow

Up a creek called shit, light is lit on the situation 
Cause me and him is gonna decrease the population 
Now we wonder why our revolution never grow 
Killin motherfuckers just for steppin on our toe 
If we had as much funk for our oppressors as we did 
For ourselves, the blood would never flow again 
And then, the uzis that were once used to kill each other

Don't flap your lips about me takin no, trips 
You won't be takin no sips from a milk carton 
Seein my face with a caption, askin

Cause brothers who be doin brothers who be doin others 
Screwin brothers but The Coup be doin more than shoo-be-doin

It's why it don't make sense that they want me a goner 
On a, run cause some brothers in a ratpack think I'm 
Poppin junk cause they don't see for centuries

I got your back Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy cause you got mine

The Coup,"Now I shall tell a story that's filled with words 
That start with the letter N 

Step into the world of a nigger, figure 
To stay a little while so pack your bag up bigger 
First of all just let me introduce you seduce you 
Into a frame of mind that's easy to get used to 
Nigger hasn't always meant a man with melanin 
It used to be a piece of wood that sat on the cotton gin 
Masta put it there and it wouldn't move, smooth 
So what does it mean, to be a Nigger With an Attitude? 
You tell me that a nigger's crazy or lazy 
Not about the skin so, don't let it faze me 
Well you amaze me, with that ignorant bizull-shizzit 
Get a grip on the new fit 
'Cause that's a lame frame of brain for the nineties 
I know the game so it don't sting, my mind sees 
So what the fuck you want to race for the trigger 
I ain't the one, I ain't the nigga

Nigger is a word we use today, you say 
It don't mean the same if you spell it with an A 
But that's an argument that makes me itch, I twitch 
If I took the T out will I still mean bitch? 
My name is E-Roc, and I ain't the nigger main 
Save your sellout strut shit for Soul Train 
'Cause I've been known, to knock a motherfucker out 
Without a doubt, The Coup gives me much clout 
But there's a factor when I know that my skin is brown 
And never ever will I put another brother down (gawd damn) 
So I make the mental rule to massacre the word 
'Cause when I hear it, it gets, me straight stirred 
It's mental trash so I'm pickin' up the litter 
I ain't the one and I ain't, the nigger 
My people use this word each and every day

""Boy I love playing the drums, I can do the grooviest rhythms 
I can do rhythms like"" 

My attitude is this (what?) don't call yourself a niggerole (why?) 
Unless you're just an oakie-doke it'll make you sicker though 
'Cause it's all about a mind-time mind-frame 
The system is a chess game with, pawns all the same (haa haa) 
Until we change our mind too
Identify yourself, it's a part of being conscious (yeah) 
If I call myself a gangster then I'll rob you with a gat (yeah) 
If I call myself a brother then you know I got your back (yeah) 
If I call myself oppressed then I'm clear on where I'm at 
But if I call myself a nigger what the fuck is that? (yeah, you know) 
Don't be the coolie or the moolie or a boob with the jigger 
Don't be the one Don't be the nigga

But now he walks with a permanent limp

Walcy Hawkins and her son's up in double-rock
And it don't stop to the funky beat
Till my people get together and kick you pigs off the street
I grit my teeth why can't I be like Rodney with a camcorder?
Seems we need one every time you get a court order
Or pull me over in order to check identification
I'm in the back of your car with a bruise or laceration
You're in the hood and it's one more disaster

On my back, on my head, through my house and once more
You called my mother a ho, you threw my brother in a headlock
You did this to about six thousands on the block
Say you try to stop the rock so it makes me perspire
Hmm...but you work with a supplier
So I inquire what's your role in my elimination?
Ain't got a choir so it sure ain't one of salvation
But if I sung you a song it'd be of damnation
Cause all they do is let me sing in this damn nation
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, how many kids have you killed today?
Pig, now I realize our relation
Your occupation is to keep me in occupation
How many brothers have you left in a cast?
How many graves have you made in the past?
Useless! Not my task to even ask

Cause we stomped a mudhole in his ass, ha ha ha

I know you motherfucker, my face prints in your knuckles
Hit my head back to the rear and I can hear my knees buckle
And you chuckle...as the blow blurred my vision
You make a game trying to tame me for colonialism
The stars and bars are all you need to make a perfect prison
No chains or fences here so you can make me think I've risen
I'm given rations on the first and fifteenth
Just so I won't be out organizing in the street
And so I'm beaten in the court with charges trumped, see
My eyes is swollen and my nose looks like Humpty's
But I'm not laughing cause I'll take a bath in this one

Now check it, the topic of discussion
Is more than a financial profit
United Snakes won't stop it
Blow for blow, the flow with the commentary gets
Seventy-six septillion tons a-spinnin'
[Steady steppin into a new phase
New thoughts representing our slavery days]
The seeds of weeds and crops is much more than you figure
Yo if he's a black man he must be a nigga
They make a gimmick I wouldn't doubt
[A sucker selling out for the sake of a scream and shout]
Elements don't grow with nonsense
Rather kick a little bit of science
[Science about controlling actions of another
America was built on the sweat of black sisters and brothers]
Never allowed to breathe but allowed to bleed and breed
[Stripped of our creed and religion surviving on intuition]
And what the master said give 'em
[And besides the black man is the original lord of the land]
So I'm clenching my right hand
[Brothers and sisters we must fight this slumlord]
Overlord of the concrete jungle but I'm humble
As I witness my opponent crumble
Like the shack that I live in the house that I rent from him
[Roach infested I'm sure that the rats are nesting
The heat doesn't work he still hasn't checked it
Disrespected me for the last time
I loaded up the nine stepping double time
Bullseye
Another point scored
Right between the eyes of my landlord

They tell me to hold my peace but I just can't
But I'm Defrost of the rap group of Point Blank
So me I'm chilling at the table with my family
Hypothetically trying hard to keep my mind off the economy
Yeah I know the reason I find it hard to pass the test
Call me a victim cause I'm another brother jobless
Every day it seems like I'm moving closer to the streets
PG&E repo'ed the lights and my fucking heat
The situation's getting hard for me to handle
Had to trade my Nike's to the store to buy some candles
Last to first and I'm a-hunted and a ho I know
The man is going to come and throw me in the cold
Tears in my eye as I'm thinking of place to stay
While I'm staring at the freebie cheese up in my plate
I heard a bang bang bang knocking at my door
I looked up it was my motherfucking landlord, let him in quick
Followed by the sheriff deputy trying to come in
Every po on my property, staring me down
Mugging hard up in my family's face
While they're sitting at the table trying to say grace
But before I make this one my last meal
Any moves, yeah I'm looking for the damn kill
I said it twice in case he didn't hear me though
Sucker made a move evidently when he hit the floor
So now I'm in cuffs for the crimes I've committed
Maybe I'll go to jail, heh, or maybe I'll get acquitted
But the fact still stands I killed my landlord dead
Now I've got three meals and a roof over my head

Cash is made in lump sums as street bums eat crumbs
So I defeat scum as I beat drums
Rum-tiddy-tum like the little drummer boy song
Here comes the landlord at the door, ding dong
Is it wrong that my momma sticks a fat-ass thong
Up his anal cavity cause he causes gravity to my family
Says we gotta pay a fee so we can stay and eat
In a house with light and heat
The bastard could get beat, stole the land from Chief Littlefeet
House is built on deceit, got no rent receipt
So I'm living in the street and I'm down now
Don't you know to not fuck with the Mau Mau?
Notice of eviction, four knuckle dental affliction
Friction, oh did I mention
You'll be finger licking as I handicap your diction
And you say you're not a criminal like Tricky Dick Nixon?
While we're fixing to impose rent control
We didn't vote on it, this land wasn't bought or sold
It was stole by your great granddaddy's ganking
Osagyefo said they call it primitive accumulation
Plantations, TV stations wealth is very stationary
I learned the game and I became a revolutionary
Scaring the corporate asses cause the masses are a loaded gun
Killing the world banking and international monetary fund
I'm done, we're done with what you've done
For twenty-five score we've got a battle cry
Kill my, kill my, kill my, kill my
Kill my, kill my, kill my, kill my landlord

I need six hundred dollars by the end of the week
My body is cold, dirty socks on my feet
Not a black sheep, but who's the creep
Trying to put me on the street while I'm trying to sleep?
I wanna kill my landlord, murder in the first degree
If there's something wrong he wants to blame me
Wants to be a threat so he carries a gun
Well I pack a Well I pack a 9 cause I can't trust 911 cause I can't trust 911
Son of a gun, I'm the one who cuts the grass
Wash the windows and he still wants me to kiss his ass
But I laugh cause America's not my home
My landlord took me away from where I belong
But it's a sad song so I face reality now
Pick up the phone and now here comes the Mau Mau
To the rescue, down with The Coup
Yo landlord, I've got a little message for you
I'm going cuckoo, fuck a machete or sword

*DJ Pam cuts and scratches Cypress Hill ""puffin on a blunt""* 

[Boots] 

Last night I puffed on my last blunt, damn that was a stupid stunt 

Cause I done said this ten times befo' 

That when my life has come to a crescendo, I would let that indo go 

But I'm still kissin it like I'm under the mistletoe 

So here we go I'm Mork'in with the steady swagger 

Speakin with a stunt, steady stagger preachin with a Southern drawl 

That sounds like Jimmy Swaggart coughed and played it off 

Said I know I'm flippin since the last one G my laces are tied 

So you can't trip with me, I remember 1988 December 

Someone said, ""Puff on this before you go up in her"" 

So I did it and I guess it must have did the trick 

She enjoyed it so I guess I must have rocked the clit 

Felt like a man and I loved her with an indo trip 

Don't know why, cause I couldn't even feel my dick 

Ego trip lasted and I'm always gettin blasted but it's drastic 

Cause sometimes that shit can help you get your ass kicked 

Can't buy it with plastic so I'm off to drain the vein for days 

I get complaints, cause the neighbors say my house stink 

Call myself a saint, cause I won't touch a bowl of food 

I gives a fuck, just don't interrupt my Looney Tunes 

This afternoon cause I can find a job anytime 

Step off my behind I'm in a Doobie Brothers state of mind 

Run-D.M.C., AT&T, yo they both Be Illin' 

I smoked that blunt for last month's three hundred dollar billin 

And I'm willing to admit that when provoked I smoke to cope 

But if I didn't take a toke I'd be leadin a street revolt 

So I make a mental note, and to my frustration 

I decide I can't do shit about the situation 

Put the spliff to my lips, flick the Bic and it's on hit 

Coulda been my last blunt... but I can't quit 

Cause then I have to deal with, some motherfuckin real shit 

Squeezin me tighter than you gotta squeeze a cow's tit 

But on the flip tip I know I gotta get a grip 

Even though in high school he used to be hip 

*coughing* 

But shit I'm hockin spit like I thought it was worth somethin 

My throat can't take no more, no future in my frontin 

But it's rough when you grow up and the tough men roll joints 

That's why I been on the bench for marijuana to this point 

But it don't faze me though I take it lacadaisical 

It takes a while for ways to grow and get out of the old flow 

But I'm an old bro, I done passed two decades 

I'm wearin shades so my eyes don't reveal the red haze 

Caused by my yung, cause days like Frankie Beverly 

Amazin em back it's tried again, no roaches and no safety pins 

Now I'm pennin rhymes about gettin on the wagon 

And I get skittish when I think of how the British 

Put the opium in Asia, fat one to that tactic 

Gankin black folks while they daze ya, if you're gettin perved 

You're gettin served this economic, like the gin and tonic 

Brothers get moronic from the chronic bionic, and it's ironic 

Cause we're not gettin fucked up, we're just gettin FUCKED 

Shit out of luck and we're stuck with our mind in a muck 

So don't duck the situation cause I used to smoke fat Taylors 

Til I figured out that the ganjah was a jailor 

Wait a, minute, while I get up in a funky situation 

The Coup is coming through, and there's no hallucination 

So what the fuck they say that junk is good for meditation 

If you smoke a sack, take some Ex-Lax it's mental constipation 

There's no hesitation when I'm talkin bout political friction 

Stoppin evictions 

Government made afflictions and I have an addiction 

That's a big contradiction so I must confront it 

Cause ain't no revolution gonna come from a blunt

We got a way to lick it, gave him a book, said, ""Here's the ticket""

And oh my God with thick long lashes mind you

Looking out his window (Get it together)

Yeah well, uh, mama's living on welfare
And she ain't been living well
And that for damn sure ain't fair
That's 360 degrees of poverty (Get it together)

The Coup,"Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

It's almost 10 o'clock, see, I gotta ball of lint for property
So I slip my beanie on sloppily
And promenade out to take up a collection
I got game like I read the directions
I'm wishing that I had an automobile
As I feel the cold wind rush past
But let me state that I'm a hustler for real
So you know I got the stolen bus pass
Just as the bus pulls up and I step to the rear
This old lady look like she drank a 40 of fear
I see my old-school partner, said his brother got popped
Pay my respects, ""Can you ring the bell? We came to my stop""
The street light reflects off the piss on the ground
Which reflects off the hamburger sign as it turns round
Which reflects off the chrome of the BMW
Which reflects off the fact that I'm broke
Now what the fuck is new?
I need loot, I spot the motherfucka in the tweed suit
And I'm in his ass quicker than a kick from a greased boot
Eased up slow and discreet
Could tell he was suspicious by the way he slid his feet
Didn't want to fuck up the come-up
So I smiled with my eyes said ""hey, how's it hanging guy?""
Bumped into his shoulder, but he passed with no reaction
Damn this motherfucka had hella Andrew Jacksons!
I'm a thief, or pickpocket, give a fuck what you call it
Used to call em ""fat cats"", now I just call them wallets
Getting Federal, ain't just a clepto
Mastercard or Visa? I gladly accept those
Sneaky motherfucka with a scam, know how to pull it
Got a mirror in my pocket, but that won't stop no bullets
Story just begun, but you already know
Ain't no need to get down, shit, I'm already low

Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

My footsteps echo in the darkness
My teeth clenched tight like a fist in the cold sharp mist
I look down and I hear my stomach growling
Step to Burger King to attack it like a Shaolin
I never pay for shit that I can get by doing dirt
Linger to the girl cashier and start to flirt
All up in her face and her breath was like murder
Damn, the shit I do for a free hamburger!
""Well you got my number, you gonna call me tonight?""
""It depends, is them burgers attached to a price?
I'm just kidding, I'mma call, even write you love letters
Thanks for the burgers, um, hook me up with a Dr Pepper""
""That's cool, you want some ice?""
""Yeah, and some fries would be hella nice""
""Damn my manager's coming, play it off, okay? Have a nice day!""
""I'm up outta here anyway""

I use peoples before they use me
'Cause you could get got by an Uzi over an OZ
That's what a OG told me
Gots to find someplace warm and cozy to eat the vittles that I just got
Came to an underground parking lot
""This place is good as any, fuck, it's all good""
Walked in, found a car, hopped and sat up on the hood
Ate my burger, threw back my cola
Somebody said ""hey"" it was a rent-a-pig, I thought it was a roller
""Want me to call the cops?"" I don't want them to see me
Looked down and saw that I was sitting on a Lamborghini
It was Rollses, Ferraris and Jags by the dozen
A building door opened, damn, it was my cousin
Getting off of work, dressed up, no lie
Tux, cumberbund and a black bow tie
I was like ""hey!"" (""Who is it?"") ""me""
(""Oh, what's up man, I just quit this company
They hella racist and the pay was too low"")
I said ""right, what was up in there though?""
(""A party with rich motherfuckas, I don't know the situation
I know they got cabbage, owning corporations
IBM, Chrysler and shit is what they said"")
Just then a light bulb went off in my head
""They be thinking all black folks is resembling
Give me your tux and I'll do some pocket-swindling""
Finna to change in the bathroom and not freeze off my nuts
Lets take a short break while I get into this tux

Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

Fresh, dressed like a million bucks
I be the flyest motherfucka in an afro and a tux
My arm is at a right angle, up, silver tray in my hand
""May I interest you in some caviar, ma'am?""
My eyes shoot around the room there and here
Noticing the diamonds in the chandelier
Background Barry Manilow, Copacabana
And a strong-ass scent of stogies from Havana
Wasn't no place where a brother might've been
Snobby old ladies drinking champagne with rich white men
Alright then, let's begin this
Nights like this is good for business
Five minutes in the mix, noticed several different cliques
Talking, giggling and shit
With, one motherfucka in betwixt
And everybody else jocking him, throttling
Found out later he owns Coca Cola bottling
Talking to a black man who he's confused
We looking hella-bougie
Ass all tight and seditty
Recognized him as the mayor of my city
Who treats young black men like Frank Nitty
Mr Coke said to Mr Mayor: ""you know, we got a process like Ice T's hair
We put up the funds for your election campaign
And, oh, um, waiter can you bring the champagne?
Our real estate firm says opportunity's arousing
To make some condos out of low-income housing
Immediately, we need some media heat
To say that gangs run the street and then we bring in the police fleet!
Harass and beat everybody til they look inebriated
When we buy the land, motherfuckas will appreciate it
Don't worry about the Urban League or Jesse Jackson
My man that owns Marlboro donated a fat sum""
That's when I stepped back some to contemplate what few know
Sat down, wrestled with my thoughts like a sumo
Ain't no one player that could beat this lunacy
Ain't no hustler on the street could do a whole community
This is how deep shit can get
It reads ""macaroni"" on my birth certificate
""Puddin'-Tang"" is my middle name, but I can't hang

Face down, floating on the Mississippi river
Burning crosses and motherfuckas saying die nigga die nigga

See, I be stealin' from the grown-ups, runnin' from the tasks
As I dash through the grass everyday skippin' class
My daddy don't be trippin', so you can kiss my ass
Pass the doobie-doo on the left hand side
Only 9 years old gettin' high, gettin' high
I wonder why my teacher's sweatin' me, I did my history
It don't relate to me, my GPA 1.3
See, I remember places, them names, streets, dates
Anybody rollin' with stolen license plates
But if that flake out-of-date shit wasn't in my way
Ask me anything or where I'm from, I bet I get an A
Minus, in math I am the finest
Countin' mail faster than you can say yo highness
Don't come at me with dryness 'cause I know the definition
Of any slang word, so what's that synonym you're wishin'?
I want to be a lawyer, accuse a liar like LaToya
So I'm droppin' the fourth grade, slingin' lemonade
I am my own keeper, a young overachiever
Ten cents a cup, I'mma have to leave that shit to Beaver
Now I lay me down to sleep 'cause I can't eat my noodles right
Dead bodies every other night be fuckin' up the appetite
Tragedy is an everyday thing, put on a video game
Sip some Tang if I can't stand the pain
Give me the knowledge from the street, now watch me learn it
I went to get a job, but too young for a work permit
Don't come my way (fool), I might just have to gaffle you

Well it's June 17th, it couldn't have came to me no quicker
11 years old, my chest a little thicker
How you figure my life is gon' be bigger and better
When that path I'mm rollin' on is similar to that crooked letter?
Once I get a better view, check out the avenue
It's drug infested, planted there just for me to be tested
On the hard concrete, now it's three years later
Can't fuck with little league, pops be up stackin that refrigerator
8 o'clock I see Shirley down the block in a bucket
She stepped to the back, that's when I stuck it, fuck it
My first piece of butt, it was just my luck
'Cause 9 months later at my door she showed up
Damn, I was stuck, reminiscin' in my seat
I just turned 16, but to me it's not sweet, peep

Grillin you right back, you better drive by me
We the People Army is known to get rowdy
And even if you a friend of the blue
You can get it too, snitchin is never forgettable
This Hell we livin is never forgivable
It come down to DP and The Coup
Remember Huey, Bobby Hutton, George, Fred and them
Fuck the po-po, local, state, fed and them

The Coup,"[Chorus]
Preacher man wanna save my soul
Don't nobody wanna save my life
People we done lost control
Let's make heaven tonite
Preacher man wanna save my soul
Don't nobody wanna save my life
People we done lost control
Let's make heaven tonite

Now as I sleep may the oxygen inflate my lungs
May my arteries and heart oscillate as one
If police come may I awake escape and run
In the morning may I have the sake to scrape the funds
And if I take the plunge
May it be said that I wasn't afraid to shake my tongue
Show the state was scum
Makin' sure that the callin' bell of fate was rung
'cause if they could the would
And probly tried to
Rape the sun
Someone said that this is just my body
Wait for the Afterpary
Where ain't no shut-off note
And every wallet there is knotty
Feet are on the asphalt
Dick in the dirt
This system take vickin' to work
Listen alert
Check out the introvert
In the corner with the rip in her skirt
Stomach pains so she grippin' her shirt
Ain't never had dinner
So she know she ain't gettin' dessert
Don't try to tell me it's her mission to hurt
I got faith in the people and they power to fight
We gon make the struggle blossom
Like a flower to light
I know that we could take power tonight
Make 'em cower from might
And get emergency clearance from the tower for flight
I ain't sittin in your pews less you helpin' me resist and refuse
Show me a list of your views
If you really love me
Help me tear this muthafucka up
Consider this my tithe for the offer cup

[Chorus]

I used to think about infinity
And how my memory is finna be
Invisibly slim in that vicinity
And though the stars are magnificent
Whisky and the midnight sky can make you feel insignificant
The revolution in this tune and verse
Is a bid for my love to touch the universe
Strugglin' over wages and funds
Let the movement get contagious and run
Through the end when it's gauges and guns
And if we win in the ages to come
We'll have a chapter where the history pages are from
They won't never know our name or face
But feel our soul in free food they taste
Feel our passion when they heat they house
When they got power on the streets
And the police don't beat 'em about
Let's make health care centers on every block
Let's give everybody homes and a garden plot
Let's give all the schools books
Ten kids a class
And give 'em truth for their pencils and pads
Retail clerk - ""love ballads"" where you place this song
Let's make heaven right here
Just in case they wrong

The Coup,"Now, when I go to bed it's almost time to wake up
Tryin' not to go to jail, tryin' not to cake up
And even when I serve soda it would be cold as fuck
Chillin' in my sock, servin' ice for ten bucks

And you'd be in the house, all warm and shit
And ya ass got the sweater with the fire lit
And whatever ya want, you ain't gotta lift a finger
If ya wanna a glass of water, hit the maid on the ringer

Got a job for you under this hot ass sun
Tellin' me to hurry up and get some more shit done
I be so tired when I spit all my word slur together
Got so many calluses, my hands are like leather

Watchin' MTV in yo big ass chair
Tryin' out slang words while you combin' ya hair
Ya productivity is wack, bring that box here fo-sheezy
Go get some coffee, punch out before ya leave

Got yo' feet up on the desk, noddin' off to sleep
While I lift, push, pull, dig, sweat and sweep
I could work hard all my life and in the end still suffer
'Cause the world is controlled by you lazymuthafuckas

Lazymuthafucka, lazymuthafucka
You's a lazymuthafucka, lazymuthafucka

Now, you don't wash ya ass, you got a personal bather
If you roll out of bed it's like you doin' a favor
You was born into paper and that behavior
For a midnight snack, you have the bedroom catered

You ain't never learned to drive or tie ya shoe
I got my ear to the street and my eye on you
You got a secretary to write down your thoughts
On how to make us work hard and fatten up your vaults

TV say if ya poor, you must be slow and shiftless
But you pay 'em to say that, so we don't want it different
Got a cook and a girl to bring the tray for you
You're hearin' this 'cause somebody pushed play for you

My head is poundin' now and my hands are shakin'
To keep my eyelids open takes concentration
I don't get no rest, it's just a stay alive hustle
Making you stay rich without you moving a muscle

You think of people as your tool, so when your dick salute
You have a butler get the phone and call a prostitute
And say your sex drive?s stronger than the engine of a trucker
But she?ll have to be on top 'cause you a lazymuthafucka

Lazymuthafucka, lazymuthafucka
You's a lazymuthafucka, lazymuthafucka

A hundred person house, there just to sanitize
You know you don't give a fuck but they all despise you
Millions over millions makin' shit for you to sell
But police on alert, just in case we rebel

But it's gon' happen captain, hope ya know that's why I'm rappin'
Want the toasters start tappin' hands and gases start clappin'
'Cause this whole system's waitin' for you to kick it in Paris
Or roll through Hong Kong in a rich all carriage

So when you spend a dollar that's ten seconds of my time
And when ya spend a billion that's my life and that's a crime
'Cause to me life is hard like a track that I'm reppin' on
Callin' for the freedom of the backs that you steppin' on

Later for the pull up ya boot strap fastened
Hard work got me to the chiropractor
But we can work hard to take back the bread and butter
'Cause all these multi-millionaires is lazymuthafuckas

Lazymuthafucka, lazymuthafucka
You's a lazymuthafucka, lazymuthafucka

And I'm implyin' I ain't had no business cryin'
'Cause we used the rubber twice
And we knew that shit was dyin' to bust

Well, we was only seventeen
But you was older in between
And in my fresh Adidas fits
I used to come more clean than Jeru
Jerkin' off in a can of chlorine

Sophisticated with the game I was spittin' in
A nymphomaniac was with it
That's just a clip, more experience
Be on my chest when I was put to the test
You said, ""Goddamn nigga, that ain't how ya get it in""

Dashboards for the leverage
Tall cans for beverage
The weed can make you courageous
Make a Honda Civic seem so spacious
Make five minutes seem like ages, anyway

You smelled like care-free curl and nowalaters, baby
Said you liked high-top fades and Jesse Johnson's crazy
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much, today I'm still campaignin'

The lake don't smell so bad now, do it
Don't trip off ya hair, baby, just re-glue it
The windows is fogged up, can't nobody view it?
Put down the O E and turn up the Howard Hewett

And some more, we had things to discuss
Like how we do it, we got amniotic fluid
And a baby floatin' though it
Hey, imagine if it look like us

It was me up in the vaginary
And I'ma love my kids whether real or imaginary
Quit school, work well depends at the mall
Next to Fashion Berry, operation cash and carry
Manual labor from six to noon

Makin' six kabooms
Got a baby that's fixin' to bloom
And he befits the groom plus grips the spoon
So let me twist the ploom
And inhale and emit the fumes

You smelled like care-free curl and nowalaters, baby
Said you liked high-top fades and Jesse Johnson's crazy
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much, today I'm still campaignin'

I was composed, I didn't even crack a frown
I was supposed to let my parents fall down
And show my ass when I found that the baby was
Four months early and around ten pounds

I heard a lot of bad things about teenage mothers
From those who don't really give a fuck about life
She said, ""It ain't so much that they startin' out younger
It's just they supposed to be more like a wife""

Meanin' you ain't shit without a man to guide you
If ya mama tried to feed you that she lied too
Make ya grab any motherfucker that ride through
If jobs are applied to knots can get tied too

Plus I know that you must have been scared
It made it easy when the feelings were shared
Flashback to 20/20, I know you waitin' for the dollars
'Cause you knew I had funny money

Yellin' all loud like I'ma tear the whole hood up
Don't tempt me 'cause the real daddy stood up
He said, ?I was a mark for believin' in you
Now it's more that I'm seein' is true?

There's a few things I'd like to say in this letter
Like I wish I would've seen him grow
And ask my wife I learned to fuck much better
And thank you for lettin' me go
Yeah, thank you for lettin' me go
For real, thank you for lettin' me go

I'm peeling off like stolen registration
And leave a lot of smoke
See I'm that sort of folk
That been pig hunting since my mama's fucking water broke
Cause they the henchmen nah they the lenchmen
Between the rich and puffs of weed known to trench them
Cause they dispense with the dollars and cents
So when you stand go get candles, flowers, and incense
Behind steel gates is fifty percent of our bill rates
A pre-kin making microchips for Bill Gates
Pelican Bay, t-shirts for the workout
Police station where the slave catchers lurk out
Listen to the thunder, I'm no more taking under routes
We'll synchronize and give em' shit to wonder bout
The DEA is filthy, yell not guilty
We need control of the cash and the realty
And get rid of all the motherfucking parasites
More than weed burn at 420 Fahrenheit
Shaking in they boots when we start to bust
They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us

Some confuse ass-breath for strong halitosis
It's been hundreds of years since the first diagnosis
By the African doctor Mawangi Misoi
Known in the states as Mr. Thomas' boy
He found that preventing this affliction was lost
With the mention of the phrase, ""Um yessir boss!""
When that phrase was uttered many stomachs would wrench
Some jumped in the Atlantic to escape the stench
He know that ass-breath came from kissin ass a lot
To be the boss's knight-in-armor like Lancelot
Doctor Misoi years later, before he was hanged
Developed pills with the taste, of lemon merengue
Made from ground gunpowder, of Haitian slaves
And swept from Seminoles who just wouldn't behave
He tested first on young Nat from the Turner plantation
Then sent a batch off to the French speakin nation
It should also be noted a bottle of it was found
In the clenched dead hand of the white John Brown
Everytime it went 'round new people would find it
They would take their essence, put it in and grind it
In Russia, Africa, Asia too
Mao Tse-Tung made the flavors new
In Cuba, the people make new shipments
Of this pill that is on the FDA shit-list
That is not recommended, to take befo' dinner
When supervisin Presidents and such type sinners
Take this pill and say what you wish you said
It hardens backbones, they might wish you dead
And it's not to be confused with courage juice
Which we drank in chains and we still ain't loose
These pills really should be taken in groups
Cause ass-breath motherfuckers move with troops
MLK took half a pill, procrastinatin
Once he took a whole pill, they assassinate him
Take Ass-Breath Killers, to really get down
Wherever rocks, fire, and struggle are found

Even with no thangs to bust
They wanna keep puttin' chains to us

That's why I constantly sang and cuss
And when I bring it, it's a gang of fuss
They tryin' to send us out to bang for bucks

Mashin' out or in the scraper
And you can listen at me now or later
But stop givin' them pimps your paper

Used to be caught up in them capers
Havin' to hustle, rustle up my status
They beat my yellow ass purple like the Lakers
More like the Clippers 'cause they tryin' to fade us, now holla wit me

Let's fill the fridge up in the kitchen
It's lotsa pots for cookin' D-boy chicken
But we still ain't got one to piss in

They say I'm always fittin' the description
Of sellin' unprescribed prescriptions
But it's them with the green addiction
Think we gon' have to shake 'em off and keep dippin', so sing along

In a land not very far away from here
George W. Bush was drinkin' beer
His daddy was head of the CIA
Now listen up close to what I say

The CIA worked for Standard Oil
And other companies to whom they're loyal
In a whole 'nother land by the name of Iran
The people got wise and took a stand

To the oil companies, ay ain't shit funny?
This is our oil, our land, our money
CIA got mad and sent false info
To Iraq to help start the Iran-Iraq wo'

Pronounced war if I have to be proper
The CIA is the cops that's why I hate the coppers
Saddam Hussein was their man out there
They told him to rule while keepin' people scared

Sayin' any opposition to him, he must crush it
He gassed the Kurds, they gave him his budget
Said you gotta kick ass to protect our cash
Step out of line and feel our wrath

You know the time without lookin' at the little hand
Time came for them to cut out the middle man
Children maimed with no legs and shit
'Cause the 'Bomb's over' you know the OutKast hit

And they really want you to hate him dead
When just the other day they made him head
War ain't about one land against the next
It's po' people dyin' so the rich cash checks

The Coup,"I love them boosters, they love them boosters
You should love them too, even if they don't know ya
They'll get it for ya like a whole outfit or shoe

I love them boosters, they love them boosters
You should love them too, even if they don't know ya
They'll get it for ya like a whole outfit or shoe

A booster is a person who jacks from the retail
And sells it in the hood for dirt cheap resale
In these hard times and press on like Lee Nails
In all of my experience, sex has been a female

Back in elementary, my shoes used to rap
Every time my soles would hit the street they would flap
Then in high school Langston Anderson would cap
'Cause my jacket didn't have a brand name on the back

Years later, this lady took me to her apartment
It looked like the Macy's sportswear department
Clothes on the chairs, on the couch and the carpet
A twenty had me icy like leasing in the Arctic

If it wasn't for the hard work of a booster
Most couldn't go to the clubs that we're used to
If you won't get the dress cold, they'll boot ya
Like people who did dress up won't shoot ya

For some of y'all folks, this stuff might phase ya
This ain't the way the society raised ya
But most of it was made by children in Asia
The stores make money off of very low wages

The next time you see two women running out the Gap
With arms full of clothes still strapped to the rack
Once they jump in the car, hit the gas and scat
If you have to say something, just stand and clap

I love them boosters, they love them boosters
You should love them too, even if they don't know ya
They'll get it for ya like a whole outfit or shoe

This goes to all them hard working women
Who risk jail-time just to make them a living
We know there'd probably be no one in prison
If rights to food, clothes, and shelter were given

Plus they be giving me dress so fresh
Even when my wallet yells 'SOS'
In a cheaper Sunday suit, you feel a little more blessed
So until the revolution that I profess

My shirt is from Stacey, my pants are from Rhonda
My shoes came out the trunk of a baby blue Honda
My wardrobe's in luck if something falls off a truck
If you're looking for some leather, then go see Yolanda

I'm on the red carpet and they ask who designed this
I'm gonna give a shout out to Bay Area's finest
All on our own, we survive this with slyness
But when we come together, all our fashion is flyness

I love them boosters, they love them boosters
You should love them too, even if they don't know ya
They'll get it for ya like a whole outfit or shoe

The Coup,"[Chorus]
They're givin us a mind fuck
They don't have to put our hands in cuffs
They can tell us stay put and that's enough
We bust, they feel the earth vibratin
It ain't a earthquake, we just need a new equation
Mind fuck; they don't have to put our hands in cuffs
They can tell us stay put and that's enough
We bust, they feel the earth vibratin
It ain't a earthquake, we just need a new equation

The fog rolls in like the thickest cream
Nightfall comes and the crickets scream
Deafened by the latest lotto ticket schemes
Cement lies and white picket dreams
The pain on his face is glistening
No one's eyes are listening
'Til his 44 starts whistling
Hairs on necks bristling
You can holla so loud 'til the silence comes
Ask that hustler with the Midas tongue
He was born after you but not quite as young
Waitin for the day when the fighters come
She said, ""Seem like traffic lights is always red""
""Your application's on file,"" is all they said
She wish the great leaders wasn't always dead
She could resurrect 'em inside of her instead

[Chorus]

He was killed in the end by quiet persuasion
Not the FBI home invasion
Nor the cross on his lawn emblazoned
The predictable fights didn't phase him
Bullhorns off holidays given
House notes nine to five prison
He yells at the news sayin, ""There'd be a movement
If the new generation was a little more driven""
One mind, two hands, four walls
She says Babylon's gon' fall
She'll tell you the signs since everybody's dumb
She'll be home waitin for the Messiah's phone call
There was pride in the fact that the blunt was massive
Tight like the ships in the middle passage
They escaped through the flames, then wondered
If the flame in their soul, if the smoke has smashed it

[Chorus]

Day broke in like a fiend with a ladder
Suicidal dew drops splatter
Teeth on shirtless bodies chatter
A blowjob short of a breakfast platter
Crowded rooms on lonely souls
At work before the whistle blows
They never knew their strength in numbers
So power seems so mystical
They're waiting for that perfect day
When they've paid all their bills
They kids are grown, they graduate
And guerrillas come out the hills
And for her it gets too much
'Til she won't accept my touch
She'll fix it by herself
She's fallen into their mind fuck

Lash out for your just desserts

It's black back to birth
Bullshit y'all talkin' 'bout
Out ya mouth, I'm not concerned
Cause y'all got the nerve
It's y'all turn like Detroit red
When he said he had an ultra perm
The long walk to burn your bare heels
So they worn your boots
The game camouflage like army suits
But I can see it more clear cause I came with the coup in here
Ring the alarm and form the troops
Send 'em out into the world, go to war in a fluke
Eye to eye with the enemy you sworn to shoot
Now comin' at ya neck sick ya hand, something wrong with me
Motherfucker somethin's wrong with you
When you cheat just way to smart to question

Death to the pigs is my basic statement
I spit street stories 'til I taste the pavement
Tryin' to stay out the pen while we face enslavement
Had a foolproof hustle 'til they traced the payments
I was grippin' my palm around some shitty rum
Tryin' to find psalm number 151
To forget what I'm owed, as I clutch the commode
Alright, put down the bottle and come get the guns
I get off the chain like Kunta Kinte with a MAC-10
They want us gone like a dollar in a crack den
Said at least a track then, seeds & stems
Mind cloudy through the wheeze and phlegm
I'm get my brain off of that and the Jesus hymns
If we waiting for the time to fight, these is thems
Tellin' us to relax while they ease it in. We gettin greased again
The truth I write is so cold, It'd freeze my pen
I'm Boots Riley it's a pleasure to meet you
Never let they punk ass ever defeat you
They got us on the corner wearin pleather and see through
All y'all's gold mines they wanna deplete you
I ain't just fin to rap on the track, I fin to clap on the back
And it's been stackin' to that
Been a hundred years before iceberg ever lean back in the 'lac
Before they told Rosa black in the back
Before the CIA told Ricky Ross to put crack in the sack
And Gil-Scott tradin' rappin for smack
This beat alone should get platinum plaques
I'd rather see a million of us ecstatic to scrack
'Cause if we bappin' 'em back we automatically stack

This the guy like Truman C[e1]
Riq, Boots and me
Activate in the community
Up in the bay like Huey P
It's like a free, it remind me of the be	 Kder's love for me
But beats got it twisted, I'll untangle it
Black mind is entwined like the ropes they used to hang us with
This is my favorite shit, I came in the game with any way to spit
Ya got a questionnaire, who you bangin' with?
Take it back to M hotel
Throw a step deeper like a poor righteous teacher with holy intellect
Killer flow form a real niggaz laughin'
And forni fairly at a jigabou at a penitent (???)

In summer bridged hiding from the tutors
Bumpin gums about the future
You said that one day we'd be ruled by computers
I said, ""It's like that now cause we all machines""
And you replied, ""But I'm a robot with dreams""

And all the fellas used to talk about ya
How you had a joyful aura and a walk about ya
Necessitated by a beautiful backside

Nevertheless we would call you ""waddle waddle""
Somebody shoulda slapped us with an old hot water bottle
Could called you ""talky talky"" or nothing at all

You had warmth and sincerity, a heart with no barriers
A laugh that made slightly funny turn hilarious

Came straight home as you bled that evenin

Once upon a time when crack was gold
And hip-hop was not yet platinum sold
I scoured the streets for stacks to fold
My mood like my hair was relaxed and blowed

I hated police and my teachers were beasts
My heat in the trunk of the classic Caprice
The one university, I knew the deal
So I cooked it, bagged it, put it on sale

Now philosophically you'd be opposed
To one inhaling coke via mouth or the nose
But economically I would propose
That you go eat a dick as employment froze

And I felt like an abandoned child
Left to fend for myself in the wild
While every courtroom, judge and gavel
Were there to bury me under the gravel

Or at the bottom of the finest malt ale
Observe, you'll find without fail
That in every neighborhood and penitentiary
There exists many others who are similar to me and

Who mixed burners with Belvedere
And took shots from gung-ho cashiers
The world was cold yet hell was near

So I seek for a kilo
And my stack got a little bit taller like Skee-Lo
A street C.E.O.
There was all of this hell well and not one hero

The intensity was fortified
As I clenched five digits on the forty-five
Barely down at the retail store, I would detail more
But I don't wish this action to be glorified

There was a plan I was eager to listen
To not sleep in the park in the fetal position
Having to wipe off canine fecal emission
Otherwise I'd survive without legal permission

It's an equal division and then we go to prison

All I wanted was a Regal to glisten
And my kids would have meat in the kitchen

The dreams in the dust, the evidence flushed
The grieving is just, they're thieving from us
Insulted and cussed, this evening we bust

Appears unstable and under the table
We like free speech but we love free cable
We're taught from the cradle, the Bill Gates fable
Which leads to high speeds in Buick LeSables

We have no excuses just great alibis
And poker faces you can't analyze
Our politicians sell our soul and our cries
With blood on their hands, they can't sanitize

It's obscene

And the storm, it seems so scary
Your face lit up on beats of lightning

And your eyes are like screaming
And since there is no end and no beginning

You will run
You will run
You will run

Girl, I know the woods look dark
And the trees, they seem so deadly
The girls around you are so frightened

And you start, you start to panic
And the courage starts to vanish
And the world, it really is on fire

And it burns
And it burns
And it burns
And it burns

Vivian, your life is told through 19 thousand pages
In a world too unreal to behold
Your innocence has faded
Faded all your blues to gray

Your skin has bruised through moving days
Glue is peeling back away
Curling, cracking, painted
Girl, you’ve been rolled up in colorful carpets

Your blood is rushing, look around you
You're froze, you're frozen quiet
And your eyes, they are widened

Room unfurnished, no light for nightfall
Just rugs for rolling you up, you know you can't get up
When you do, you swear you will run

You will run
You will run
You will run

No one will ever save you
If no one can ever find you
No one will ever save you
If no one can ever find you

Have no names; have no faces

Through tears I see a blurry red-stained hue
And who knows someday soon no one can ever tell
The scarlet sky might once again be blue.

I'm tossing all my pennies very carefully
And caringly I wish the world to stay
Any price I'll pay; I'm waiting patiently
I sense that love will someday have its way

So I'll stay ...
Sitting round the wishing well and I wish you well
Will tomorrow be a yesterday?
Maybe if we all sat around a wishing well
The world wouldn't have to go away
Away ...

Ahhh... I'm tossing all my pennies very carefully
Hopefully I'll see a brighter day
And maybe if we all sat around the wishing well
The world wouldn't have to go away

That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on blue bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on blue bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on blue bayou

The Cox Family,"They were standing by the window
On the night he kissed her cheek
He had waited long in silence
Waited long for her to speak

When at last he whispered softly
As the cool breeze kissed her head
She had waited long to tell him
What they told her he had said

Oh they say you love another
That you never did love me
If these words be true my darling
I'll forever set you free

They are true he hardly answered

Then they told you of my love

Left her standing by the gate
Sent a message by her sister
But the message came too late

God in Heaven sent an Angel
To relieve her ache and pain
She went drifting off to Heaven
On an Angel's snow white wing

He was standing by her casket
As he looked upon her face
Then he realized he loved her
And no one could take her place

And things I could not understand.
Many times in trials my weakness blurs my vision 
And that's when my frustration gets so out of hand.

I've never had to stand one test alone.
As I look at all the victories, the Spirit rises up in me.
And It's through the fire my weakness is made strong.

He never promised that the cross would not get heavy
And the hill would not be hard to climb.
He never offered a victory without fighting.
He said help would always come in time.

That ole' Preacher man sure had the holy power. 
With his Bible he read my life like he knew it well. 
The more I put up with my defense, the more conviction fell

I took a walk, I took a walk down to the alter that night. 
I knelt to pray I cried I want to make things right. 
What they were singing slips my memory, there's a lot I can't recall. 
But I won't forget the mercy and i won't forget the walk.

If like a paper back novel my life could be read.
With every turn of the pages, I would be losing again.
You see the curse I was living under, brought nothing but defeat.
Like a desperate, dying villain that was the life of me.

(Chorus)
Then Chapter two the story changed another writer penned
Down his name.
He saw in me what no one did, took what was dying and made it live.
It's hard to believe everything you read, but the proof is
In what you see in chapter two. 

(2nd Verse)
Going nowhere in the fast lane, seemed like a road with no end.
I cursed at the sunset, hoped it would never rise again.
Every sense of emotion had vanished in me it seemed.
With the candle, burning at both ends it was a matter of time for me.

One night while on life's raging sea it looked as if I would suffer defeat.
As the blackness of night closed off the light my heart sank with fear.
My desperate cry rang out with fright; all I could see was no hope in sight.
With faith all but gone I met the one who came looking for me.

(Chorus)
He came looking for me, He came looking for me.
He made a way when there was no way that I could see.
When I drifted so far Jesus was near to rescue my soul and calms all my fears.
Now I'm safe from all harm since I met the one who came looking for me.

(2nd Verse)
Satan had already picked out my grave, his plan was to foil and put me away.
I'd drifted so far, would anyone care that I'd soon be lost.
I knew my destruction was a matter of time but Jesus appeared and said this one is mine.
Now I'm safe with no harm for he walked through the storm
When he was looking for me.

Dragging your past around, tortured by the pain. 
You've been living in bondage to those old memories.
But calvary has paid your debt and grace holds the key

You've got to let it go and leave it at the cross.
You've got to lay it down,turn your back to it all.
Your freedom tomorrow is accomished today.
But you've got to let it go, put it down,and just walk away.

You know that sin is a prison that locks you away.
It takes all your freedom with a price you can't pay.
But your pardon was granted if you'll only beleive.
The friend of sinners bore your shame,
So you could go free.

Walk away don't you ever look back,
Get free from that ole tie that binds.

Tell you but I doubt that I could ever make you see. What
Would I do without Him where on Earth would I be

We've come from separate worlds, but mercy brought us near
No matter what we've done, we're on common ground today
At the cross of Jesus, every one of us can say

I was serving time in Tahatchopee
Four o'clock in the morning
I was sleepin' in my cell
I heard a whistle blow
And I heard somebody yell

There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
Up in cell block number nine
The trouble all started up in cell block number four
It spread like fire across the prison floor
Warden came in with a big tommy gun
Bang-bang-bang, tryin' to stop our fun
The warden said, come out
With your hands up in the air
If you don't stop this riot
You're all gonna get the chair
Two-gun Mathilda said
It's too late to quit
Pass the dynamite Molly
'Cause man, this fuse is lit
They called the state militia
To help them win the fight

In the middle of the night

He looked so tall and fine

Crystals of beauty, the mountain, the sea
Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free

Come and see
Come and buy
Buy my fire
Buy my fire

Eyes are glaring on your face
Watching you below
Take the sun that sweats at midnight
Burning you below

See the sun as it sweats with beauty
Burning through the fire
Feeding on your soul, so deep
Fire
Come and buy my
Fire
Come and buy my fire

So cold

Go away, then return
Know which face you have to turn
Eyes are glaring

Soared to Taco Bell and I ordered some gorditas (Mmm, that's good!)
Wanted four more, ordered 'em, didn't eat 'em
Then head to Thebe's house for some gymnastics
Fantastic, I backflip on this beat B
Cause we running shit like the Dingleberry's on four cheetahs
Flow colder than Papa Joe's or Domino's (Fuck it, whatever, um)
Trashwang scratched inside the knucks
Got some One Direction tickets, I should hit that up
Drive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck
Then see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk
Move over the microwave and the cannabis
Try to take the van and the whole band to Canada
Fuck the block news and the venues, they can't handle us
They can't stand us including fruits that Frank's channeling
The Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers
But thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is (fuck)
Man, I suck now, I ain't still dope (nope)
But Chris and Rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope
Oh fuck, I went there, balling bitch, I'm Ben's hair
Y'all barely breaking like Taco's self-esteem in a thin chair
Old Navy bitches love this gap, yeah this grin's rare
Watch a nigga smile like five-year-old child
I'm kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile, it's
Red Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but
That's just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago
Don't let me get hold of that rifle
Shout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo
Surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style
And some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile
They never did catch that rhino

Squadron full of some lost souls
Sergeant of all, it's autumn and Nak just nollied a pothole
Non-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college
And coppers labeled a problem since paying for Damianos
So shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the foxholes
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home
Shit, it's like 6 p.m. and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented stupid as the group is
Only slightly, write precise to get a pussy nigga two chins
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth

Spraying that hotter wind in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences

Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs

Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick, thought out
Toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Gives a smile of tooth and metal
Winks an eye like a falling petal

Tracks the years of the living knife

See the head of virgin skin

Tries to tell me what's to be

To feed the fire of a heart that burns

So deep are the eyes of fury

Running rings around the moon
Exchanging glances taking chances
Did we laugh and see to sing too soon
Our stomach turn on a fever stream
But with no mosquito bite
Rabid kisses in a dream
Still we can't escape the site
There's no sleep for fury eyes
So deep are the eyes of fury
Tonight they exorcise the ghost
Of love from its unyielding host
If that don't suit you scream and shout
It thine offend thee pluck it out
Alone in love with the other one
The one who doesn't know
And when we dance with the other one
The eyes of fury glow
Tonight they exorcise the ghost

Beholding love a thing of beauty

Ignoring your taunting
Ignoring you feelings

See them staring
See them wearing that same stupid face

Only cause inner groans

The Cribs,"One of those fucking, awful black days
When nothing is pleasing and everything that happens
Is an excuse for anger
An outlet for emotions stockpiled, an arsenal, an armor

These are the days when I hate the world
Hate the rich, hate the happy
Hate the complacent, the TV watchers
Beer drinkers, the satisfied ones

Because I know I can be all of those little hateful things
And then I hate myself for realizing that
There's no preventative, directive or safe approach for living
We each know our own fate

We know from our youth, how to be treated
How we'll be received, how we shall end
These things don't change

Change your hairstyle, your friends, cities, continents

Like an unarmed walrus, like a dead man face down on the highway
Like a skunk, eating it's own tail
Steam turbine, frog farm

I've hear your stairs creak, I can fix my mind on your yes
And your no, I'll film your face today in the sparkling canals
All red, yellow, blue, green brilliance and silver Dutch reflection

Racing thoughts, racing thoughts, all too real
You're moving so fast now, I can't hold your image
This image I have of your face by the window
Me standing beside you, arm on your shoulder
A catalog of images, flashing glimpses then gone again

Untethered to the posters soak in me, every clear afternoon now
I'll think of you, up in the air, twisting your heel
Your knees up around me, my face in your hair
You scream so well, your smile so loud, it still rings in my ears

News headlines going around, you watch as they go
And hope there's some good ones, those tree shadows in the park
They're all whispering, shake some leaves

Around six p.m., shadows across the cobblestones
Girl in front of bathroom mirror, she slow and careful
Paints her face green and mask like
Like my cheese, portrait with green stripe

Long shot through apartment window
A monologue on top but no girl in shot

Like an unarmed walrus
Like a dead man face down on the highway
Like a snake eating its own tail

Clouds in a Bombay Sapphire coma
Been several shades of broken

She laughed when I told her, ""I was seriously hurt""
She said, ""Don't want your money, pain comes free
You hooked up with pain, when you hooked up with me""

Utopia granted my wish
But when I looked under the blankets
I saw the legs of a fish

And among us are the faithless who long only for the glory of this world. Among us are faithless but I am not of them for I long only to die in His arms. In the eyes of God I am His testament. The wool is warm with comfort but this is coated in deception for the sheep will soon be stripped and it will freeze without protection. Bare blooded and ripe for failure. This is where all are defined by His will. Thy knees will testify, did he stand to the throne? The pigs drown spiraling alone. Arrogant, the goblet raise you high, the portrait of perfection. Do you not see this pride itself is an infection? Nigh is the hour when trumpets will close the graves and may those who stood for their Lord rejoice, let cowards sink and settle for remorse. On tables stretched horror stares, to rape our lungs of precious air. Three times to the skies our hands we raise: Reverse this curse, this violent plague. It is infectious, the dispersion of bone of the spineless. Live like a wordless dog, may you forever remain silent. Or stand for His throne. Relieve the world of its infectious ailment. In the eyes of God I am his testament. Come crumbling for without God, one exists without meaning. We are his testament serving as the heart and flesh. When one part of this body aches we seek to cure its distress. We are the testament.",In the Eyes of God,2009

Answering old winter's call

Weeping forth the sad refrain

You mark a grin, a moonbeam
Brightens your smile, pray tell me
How all the while you can be

Wake this land and stop the sea
Show me love, unlock
All doors

Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh!

The Crown,"Can't you see that death does want me?!

I can't explain, you won't understand
The dream is gone, the falling deep
Under the spell, spoken in tongues
In the colors... of Hell.
In the ringing that chimes inside me
So drag me down, deeper still
Far beyond the black horizon, beyond the things you know!

Poison, the poison, the poison
Poison, the poison, the poison demon!

I am lost again, everything's gone
And more alone than I ever have been
Out of my mind and down on my knees
I'm losing more than I'll ever get
And even if you want to, you can't ever help me
Nor can I ever hope to reach you
But I love to fall... Need the rush
So don't pray for my soul 'cause I'm already damned!

Poison, the poison, the poison
Poison, the poison, the poison devil!

I am down again, everything lost
And more gone than I ever have been
I'm not here to stay, not made to last
Total destruction is the way for me!

And when I kill, I kill!
When I kill, I really kill!
Yeah, when I kill, I kill!
So I take the poison even though I know that it kills!

Treachery... I will betray you all
With a poisoned kiss, filled with deceit
Smiling turning my back
And leaving you all behind
In chaos, and drunk in desperation
Trying to escape this meaningless life
A child of death, playing with fire
So sing for my soul 'cause I cannot be saved!

Poison, the poison, the poison
Poison, the poison, the poison god!



",The Poison,1999
The Crown,"Straight down to Hell I will go, I'll take you down with me...
Blood of divine, holier than mine...Wine of Delight I drink to ease my guilt.
Hoping to see bodies to bleed. Hoping to see the beautiful art I've built.

Pose! Pose naked with blood as your skin!
Crawl! Crawl hated, my expression of sin!

Die, die, die, die!

Drain! Drain your soul with the wounds I provide!
Take! Take your place in my gallery and die!

Feel...your breath: getting stabbed away!
Our heartbeats...synchronized...while I make you pay!
Never...again...shall you spread your filth!
Bleeding...heart sympathy...shall you never get, from me!

How can the rest just live in silence
When the children are being injected with their rotting venom?
Led to death with 'belief' as the guiding light!
Trust and Deceit, hand in hand. Born into slavery
Nailed on these walls are the scum of humanity
Parasites of life left for generations...to see!

Straight down to Hell I will go, I'll take you down with me...
One last statue I'll put on there, showing the face of vengeance!

Feel...your life...getting washed away!
Our heartbeats...synchronized...while I make you pay!
Never...again...shall you spread your filth!
My gallery is now complete...and my vengeance dies with me!
