Jimmy Sturr,"Over and over
I tried to prove my love to you
Over and over
What more can I do
Over and over
My friends say I'm a fool
But over and over
I'll be a fool for you

'Cause you got personality,
Walk, personality
Talk, Personality
Smile, Personality
Charm, personality
Love, personality
And of Cause you've got
A great big heart
So over and over
Oh, I'll be a fool to you
Now over and over
What more can I do?

Over and over
I said that I loved you
Over and over, honey

Jimmy Sturr,"Splish splash, I was takin' a bath 'long about a Saturday night
A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub, thinkin' everything was all right
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me and I opened the door
And then a splish splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well, how was I to know there was a party going on?
 
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang dancin' on my livin' room rug (yeah)
Flip flop, they were doin' the bop, all the teens had the dancin' bug
There was Lollipop with Peggy Sue
Good golly, Miss Molly was a even there too
A well a splish splash, I forgot about the bath
I went and put my dancing shoes on
 
I was a splishin' and a splashin', I was rollin' and a strollin'
I was a movin' and a groovin', I was a reelin' with the feelin'
 
I was a splishin' and a splashin', I was rollin' and a strollin'
I was a movin' and a groovin', I was a reelin' with the feelin'
 
I was a splishin' and a splashin', I was rollin' and a strollin'",Splish Splash,2004
Jimmy Sturr,"I found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you

The moon stood still
On Blueberry Hill
And lingered until
My dream came true 

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to be

Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry Hill 

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to be

Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry Hill",Blueberry Hill,2005
Jimmy Sturr,"Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour
Paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh, these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

Headed down life's crooked road
Lots of things I never knowed
Because of me not knowin', I now pine
Trouble got in the trail
Spent the next five years in jail
Should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour
Paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh, these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

When I got right to the place
Where it said ""About Face""
I thought that all my worries were behind
But the farther I go
The more sorrow I know
Should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour
Paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

When I got stuck in the mud
All my hopes dropped with a thud
I guess that my heart strings are made of twine
Have no willpower to get
From the hole that I'm in yet
Should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour
Paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign
Should have read that detour sign

Jimmy Sturr,"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line",I Walk the Line,2005

I couldn't sleep a wink last night just a-thinking of you
Baby things weren't right I kept on tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'  tossin' and turnin' all night
I threw the blankets on the floor, turned my pillow upside down
Then I thought of you some more
And I kept on tossin' and turnin' turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night
Jumped out of bed, turned on the light
Pulled down the shade went to the kitchen for a bite
Pulled up the shade, turned off the light
I jumped back into bed it was the middle of the night
The clock downstairs was striking four, couldn't get you off my mind
Heard the milkman at the door but I was tossin' and turnin'",Tossin' and Turnin',2005

I've hungered for your touch 
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly 
And time can do so much 
Are you still mine
I need your love 
I need your love 
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow 
To the sea 
To the sea 
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely riverside 
Wait for me 
Wait for me 
I'll be coming home 
Wait for me

A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms

With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old

My own

I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

I'll go to sleep and dream again

Till all my lover's dreams come true

No they just won't let me be

People talk about me
Both night and day
I cried Lord, please forgive them
And I go the other way

I smell trouble

No they just won't let me be

I will not run and hide
I'm gonna face trouble with a smile

Jimmy Urbina,"How can I convince you what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while",The Search Is Over,1991

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

When the moon is beaming brightly 
Along the Santa Fe Trail 
Stardust scattered all along the highway 

On a rainbow-colored skyway 
Along the Santa Fe Trail 
Beside you

Are the wall I built around you

There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago
Are you on the trail of buffalo?

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?

Empty guns covered with rust
Where do you talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do you walk tonight?

Empty saddles in the old corral
My tears will be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal

There's no song, still I hear guitars,

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

Jimmy Wakely,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Jimmy Wayne,"After every day-after-Thanksgiving sale the malls just ain't complete
Without a bunch of decorations and a paper angel tree
There's artificial smiles on artificial tree limbs
Saying what she'd love to have and what to buy for him

Well I hope Maggie likes her new winter clothes 
and her buggy with a baby
Doll
And maybe Tom'll smile in his new Nike shoes 
when he shoots that
Basketball
I can't help but wishing that I could do more
But not just while I'm shopping in the department store

[Chorus]
Paper angles you're in my thoughts and prayers
No matter where you are right now remember God's right there
He's asking all of us to help take care
Of his paper angels everywhere

Going thought the mail almost every afternoon I see a Mom and Dad's
Worst dream
There on the back of a money-saving ad to get my carpet cleaned
Height, weight, hair, eyes, date missing, and DOB
A child's name, a picture and the words ""have you seen me?""

Watching cartoons

At that big ol' hunter runnin' round
Trying to chase that rabbit down

What goes aroung comes around
There's no doubt
We'll have to answer for the things we've done
When the tables turn and they will turn
Mark my words
It ain't gonna be fun when the rabbit gets the gun

The coffee's still sittin' in the pot
His temper's hot
And she knows he's just lookin' for a readon
AS he comes stormin' down the hall
She's wishin' there was a hole to crawl
Into, but there isn't

[Chorus]
She stood there without a work
Thinkin' maybe I deserve
All that I've got comin' from him
But when he handed down that verdict
And the whole courtroom heard it
Even the judge himself was smiling

Growing up desensitized
By what they're seeing on TV, believing that's reality
That sex is love and life's a game
Where all the winners look the same
Designer jeans, expensive shoes, imported cars and attitudes
What happened to individuality
The right to choose your destiny?

I'll just say goodbye

I won't give up the world

I believe in love, bigger than us
I believe it's the strong
That I just gotta trust
I give all that I have, I believe it so much

I, I believe that something heavenly
With all the mistakes
And the pain that love takes
I still believe in what it could be

""And here we have all kinds of trash""

I could not believe what I just heard
At first I wasn't gonna say a word

It's not where you been, it's where you're going
It's not who you were back then, it's who you are at this moment
Kinda like looking at an old photograph, remembering way back when
It's not where you been, it's where you're going

I said, ""Excuse me, sir, I know you won't remember me
But try to imagine how I looked when I'd just turned 15
Defiant, scared and confused, dirty clothes and tattoos
With nothing really left to lose, you see the last door on the right?
Sir, that door used to be mine""

It's not where you been, it's where you're going
It's not who were back then, it's who you are at this moment
Kinda like looking at an old photograph, remembering way back when
It's not where you been, it's where you're going

We all have a story we can tell
Some's been lost, some hurt, some of us have been through hell
Well, the past is a ghost, a door that's been closed
The start of a winding road and I know without a doubt
That doesn't matter now

It's not where you been, it's where you're going
It's not who you were back then, it's who you are at this moment
Kinda like looking at an old photograph, remembering way back when
Oh yeah, it's not where you been, no, it's not where you've been
It's where you're going

It's where you're going, it's where you're going

I didn't like the way he was looking at you, yeah
How he made you laugh, you just couldn't get what I was saying
It was my imagination

So do you believe me now, I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talkin' about, every time the sun goes down
Hes the one thats holdin' you, baby, yeah, me I'm missin' you way across town
So do you believe me now

I'm kickin' myself for being the one foolish enough
Givin' him the chance to step in my shoes
Oh, he was bidin' his time when he saw our love
Was havin' a moment of weakness, he was there between us

Oh, oh, yeah, whats the use in being right

All night long 'til the sun came up
Outside the diner where you used to work
Waiting for you to walk out, but you never did

With every mile I get a little further from you
But that doesn't make this any easier to do

To walk away
From everything I've ever known
To have to wait
And hope I'll find another road to you again
But until then, I'm counting the days

It wasn't like I never said it
It wasn't like you never knew
Sometimes the choice is not leave or stay 
But just to face the truth there in front of you

I'm not real sure just how far I'll have to go

One last song I gotta play, don't want to keep you up all night though
I make it mezzo piano

Kinda tired in my own way
Trying to keep myself upright though just like you, piano
Just keep smiling and I'll play this tune for you
Just keep smiling and we'll pull each other through

Softly, we'll play our folding music
And we'll fade, fade away

",Piano,1972
Jimmy Webb,"See her how she flies
Golden sails across the sky
Close enough to touch
But careful if you try
Though she looks as warm as gold
The moon's a harsh mistress
The moon can be so cold

Once the sun did shine
Lord, it felt so fine
The moon a phantom rose
Through the mountains and the pines
And then the darkness fell
And the moon's a harsh mistress
It's so hard to love her well

I fell out of her eyes
I fell out of her heart
I fell down on my face
Yes, I did, and I, I tripped and I missed my star
God, I fell and I fell alone, I fell alone

And the sky is made of stone

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

I'm sitting apart from 
The laughter and the cheer
Scenes from the past 
Rise before me while 
Watching the bubbles in my beer
Visions of someone 
Who loved me brings 
Along salty tears to my eyes
And I know that my life's 
Been a failure 
Watching the bubbles in my beer

I'm seeing the road 
That I've traveled

With heartaches and tears

Jimmy Webb,"All my love's laughter
And all my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms

She's following after
The king of all places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
She walks without shining a light now

She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know till it's night

All my love's softness
And ll my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove

She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says, everyone says
She's searching for sweet love

But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
She stands with her flock
All alone on the hill

Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning and you never will

",All My Love's Laughter,1993
Jimmy Webb,"I met her on a plane
I had forgotten I was made of glass
I watched the cars and crows and cities pass

But I kept seeing her and I
Disappearing in the scenery
I was humming, humming inside
Mmm mmm humming, I was humming inside

She told me of her pain
She did not know that I was hearing her
She did not know that I was nearing her

And don't look so morose

We never really made it baby
But we came pretty close
Adios, adios

Going up north where the hills are winter green
I got to leave you on the California coast
Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner
Than, than the California Coast

Our dreams of endless summer
Were just too grandiose

And I miss the blood red sunset
But I miss you the most

Jimmy Webb,"Every year when this day rolls around
I think of the night we first tore up the town
And I wonder if you're laughing with your eyes glowing
Making pretty conversation with the wines flowing
I'm runnin' your place just like always
Just like always, baby

Everyday at least one time
I look at your face in the back of my mind
When you're smiling at the ocean and your eyes shining
When your hair's a red river and it's all mine
For a thousand days just like always

Maybe someday I believe we'll forget
I'll really learn to live again, I'll live without regret
Funny, isn't it? This man ain't laughing yet
Does love really last forever?
Does the ocean love the sunset every time?

I pass your street, I look both ways, so incomplete
And I think that I might see you but of course, I don't
And I wish that you would call me but I know you won't
And I love you anyway just like always

And I drive the main roads
Searchin' in the sun
For another overload

I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Will never stand the strain

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time

Jimmy Webb,"By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says
I'm leaving 'cause I've left that girl so many time before

By the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go

Jimmy Webb,"I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With the sword and pistol by my side
And many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
And many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
They fin'lly hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
And I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner 'round the horn of Mexico
I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
Seems like it all goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round

I'll fly a starship
Across the universe divide
Until I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again
And again, and again, and again.",Highwayman,1996

Of sun goin' down and dinner bell
And children playing at hide and seek from floor to rafter

For bein' cold and blind and weak
They would tell you that it's only

Jimmy Weinstein,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1993
Jimmy Weinstein,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1998
Jimmy White,"Steven I never knew you, I only know your name
And even though its not your fault, pal
There’s only you to blame
If you hadn’t died that day, I never would’ve met her
You two would be married now, and I wouldn’t be cryin’
Tryin’ to forget her

[Chorus]
She was born to be with you
You were born to die too young
I was born to fall in love
With a girl too badly stung
How was I to know?
This was a hopeless romance
I never stood
A ghost of a chance

If you can’t accept the past, you’ll never want the new
Her heart’s still buried with you there
Sometimes Steve, can you believe it buddy
I wish I were you

[Chorus]

Steve, I know, you wouldn’t want it this way
Is there nothing I can do?
Do you know someone to whom I can pray?
To break through the fear

Like she loved you

I never stood, a ghost of a chance",Ghost of a Chance,2004

Purring softly as I hold him tight
Lying so that I can’t move
But I don’t mind
Good friends are hard to find

He’s getting older I need to worry more
He’s getting cranky, his legs are very sore
He needs more attention now
Cause time is unkind
But I don’t mind
Good friends are hard to find

By the door he’s waiting
In his eyes I see
The love he’s stating
He follows me onto that favorite chair
It’s filled with hair
I don’t care

Walking through my legs is his favorite game
And when I call, “Smoke” answers to his name
And when he goes, I know I’ll never be the same

Cause a piece of this heart will forever die
And both of these eyes will forever cry
But Smokerboy even this
Even this
I don’t mind
Cause if God gave me the chance
To never have known you,
To never have loved you
The offer would be
Between you and me
Politely, but firmly, declined

Anxiety is all that you’ve got
There in your chest

In your anger
Through your tears
You make a vow

Next time for sure, next time
You’re gonna hold on to your heart

You’re useless for now, your mind is a waste
All you can do is picture her face
You think of it now
How it used to be
Tortured by scenes
In your heart’s memory

He doesn’t want to look insecure
But you’ve gotta let him know girl

That he knows you really love him
So if you want to make sure he won’t go

[Chorus]
A man needs to know
That you’re his woman
You need to show
That you care
So if you don’t want him to think
You don’t care if he stays or goes
A man needs to know

He keeps it inside
He’s afraid to show he’s got needs
But if you cut him through the heart girl
Believe me baby, he bleeds
He needs to hear you tell him

You can take him or leave him, you can leave him alone

All alone out here, I’m just hanging on
All the paths are blocked, what was once so clear
There’s no exit, out of here
I can’t see no exit

You just wanna be good friends
But every time that we’re together
That’s how it begins
But not how it ends

You can deny that we fit like a glove
You can lie about what you’re dreamin’ of

Jimmy White,"Kimberly’s lovely, dressed all in white
She sits at the bar on a Saturday night
And waits for her boyfriend who comes when he can
Get away from the wife, who would not understand
Her smile and laughter can’t quite disguise
The bittersweet sadness I see in her eyes
The days become weeks and weeks become years
And harden the heart to a place beyond tears

[Chorus]
Kimberly, its better to be alone
Cause nothing’s free, but at least what you’ve got
You can call your own
Kimberly, it just seems to me
That you are what you choose
You’ll be what you’ll be
You’re too good for this
Be true to yourself

Kimberly’s lonely, dressed all in white
Alone in the bed that he visits at night
Sometimes he stays, but mostly he goes
And if she ever cries, nobody knows
The truth is the truth, and in your heart it will stay
You know you can’t change it Kimmie, by turning away
By selling your soul, by trading your pride
Before you know it baby,
There’s nothing left inside

[Chorus]

It’s none of my business this isn’t my heart
But it’s not for a song, and this isn’t just art

You could be more

Jimmy White,"She looks so good and she loves me better
She owns me now cause I wanna let her
I love her big, big, big, big time

So afraid that I’m gonna lose her, cause I want her oh so bad
She just laughs and says “ now honey,
 I’m the surest thing that you ever had”

You’re stuck with me, boy don’t you know
I ain’t ever gonna let you go
You’re stuck with me and that’s no lie

She loves to shake it, round and round
She loves it morning, noon, and night
She loves it loose and she loves it when it’s tight, when it’s tight
So afraid that she’s gonna flake, and she’s gonna set me free
She just laughs and says “now honey,
There’s just two sure things,
Death and me”

Whispered “I love you’s” into the moonlight

And my love needs you home
Your love needs, so much space
But my love needs to see
Your face

I, I reach to hold you tight,
But again you disappear, into the lonely night
I, I know the reasons why
But it doesn’t seem to help
Hold back these tears I cry

You, your love plays defense
And mine’s so damn intense
Your love needs a hiding place
But my love needs to see
Your face

You run again, I don’t know where or why
There’s only so much pain love can justify
And I can’t say, we’ll ever lose this dream
But can you stop a train
When she’s built up so much steam

You, your love needs the space
And you, your love needs a hiding place
And your love disappears sometimes, without a trace
But in any case
My love needs to see
Right in front of me

And I know that it’s for real

And call it lost, at any cost
And call you found

And then there’s certain places you don’t

How much do I have, how much do I make
How long can I eat it and still have the cake
How long ‘til I realize that I’ve become a fake

I am powerful until I finally die
I am confident until I ask but why
I am full of shit, until I finally just cry

She would have wanted you, to have a chance to live

So come all, and so come one
For every battle lost, there’s a war yet to be won
Her spirit lives, so very near
In the heart of forever
She’s still here

In the name of love, the heart breaks
In the name of life, for all our sakes
We share and we care
We fight what’s so unfair
Stealing heaven from the grasp of hell
Your offered hand
Lifts yourself as well

[Chorus]

Love, live, fight, give, speak , hear
In the tenderness of fingertips

That brush away a tear
In the heart of forever, she’s still here",The Heart of Forever (Amy's Song),2011
Jimmy White,"The first time I saw you there 
I couldn’t help but stop and stare
My heart would know you anywhere
And follow you
Although we hadn’t spoken yet 
I loved you long before we met
And the dream that I could not forget
Had just come true

You were where I had to be 
You were all my eyes could see
I couldn’t even think 
But still I knew
My heart in its heart always had
It’s heart set on you

So tired from the race I’ve run,
But now I know I’ve finally won
Like a flower aching for the sun, 
That just broke through

Pain can be a mirror to the soul
And diamonds come from pressure on
What was once
An ugly piece of coal",Heart Set On You,2011
Jimmy White,"I only call you when I’m drunk
That’s why I call you every night
I only call you when I’m lit
Is it only then I see the light?
Am I braver when I’m drunk
Are you cuter when I drink
Am I dumber when I’m sober?
These are the stupid things I think

Maybe I’m a modern man
Just too cool to be involved
But the wine dissolves my defenses
And unleashes longings unresolved

Do you only answer when you’re drunk?
Oh, do you have longings too?
I only call you when I’m drunk
That’s my compliment to you

Does the wine make it really me
Does the beer make it really you
Does the mode of transportation matter
If the destination’s true?

I only call you when I’m drunk
You only answer when you are too
Do we only love when we’re both drunk?
I don’t know, 
I hope you do",I Only Call You When I'm Drunk,2011
Jimmy White,"Almost every moment, 
A starving person dies
In the midst of our abundance
Do we even realize?
I am among the guilty 
I could do so much more
And so I make this pledge today
Of what I’m living for

I wish you peace, I wish you love
I wish you blessings from above
We can try to make this world a kinder place
There is a lot that we can do
If we make our minds up to
All the loss and tears and pain 
That seek release
I wish you peace

We don’t need a miracle 
Or a magic wand
One step forward gets you help
Power from beyond
God will always help us, 
Relieve our brother’s pain
He helps us build a rainbow
From our brother’s rain
   
I wish you peace, I wish you love

All the loss and tears and pain 
That seek release
I wish you peace

For those I look above
But every time I ask, I hear
Its love
It all leads back to love

Jimmy White,"I know you’re happy, when I’m away
In the illusion that you’re free
I know my love, just how you feel
‘Cause it’s the same way for me
The trust is gone and we can’t talk
Despite the countless times I’ve prayed
Now the pain of leaving 
Is less than
If I stayed

There were once, so many good times
They overwhelmed the bad
But somewhere, somehow the balance changed
Into tears over what we had
The smile’s gone, into a frown
And I’ve got nothing left to trade
Now the pain of leaving is less than
If I stayed

Who knows, where love goes
Can you name the time, or the place?
And I would swear
That I don’t care
But then why are these tears 
Upon my face?

In the heartache, I see a ghost
Another life too late to save
And so I write this, for the love that once lived
Like putting flowers on a grave
You look like someone I used to know
Who shared a promise we betrayed
Once the pain of leaving
Was less than 
If I stayed",If I Stayed,2011
Jimmy White,"You came, when I 
Was so low I really 
Didn’t, think I’d 
Last another day
But you, took me, 
Out of my depression
And showed me a much better way

Loving you is where I wanna be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Was when she left and made room for you
Oh its plain to see
You’re just what I need

It’s not, that you’re 
Just a substitution
Cause no one has ever 
Made me feel this good
But if I had 
Never hit the bottom
Then I’d never know that you could

Loving you is where I wanna be

Was when she left and made room for you

Jimmy White,"I cursed, I prayed
I tried to go, but stayed
I tried to show it 
Who was boss
Ah but in the end
I could not defend
Against the loss
Against the loss

I tried, I cried
I felt like I almost died
There was a line
I wouldn’t cross
So I grit my teeth
And was crushed beneath
Helpless against the loss
Against the loss

Every failure is a promise
Of the final time
Our victories cannot save us
From the final crime
It strips us of our dignity
It strips us of our pride
People look with sympathy
At the one who died

I yelled, I screamed
I groped and hoped and dreamed
And begged to be excused at any cost
But it’s all sour grapes
'Cause none of us escapes
From the loss

Jimmy White,"Time, trains passing by, in the blink of an eye	
I’m left grasping at air	
I’d walk a million hard miles, to see one of your smiles
And lay my soul bare

I lay me down at night to pray
In a dream that cannot stay
I see your face so far away
In a midnight prayer

Lost, in a cloud drifting on, in a moment it’s gone
Still I’m in the same place
Trains, from the stations they go, mine’s the wrong one I know
Cause I can’t see your face

[Chorus]

Reaching for what I have missed
Lips that I have never kissed
I do not care for open doors

Unless this one is yours

Every kindness, every deed, never ever done
Every truth, every lie, every sentence spoken

All remembered in a place, you can sell it
You can keep it, you can save it, if you care

Is there someone here at all?

We can kill it

Jimmy White,"We all make mistakes from time to time
Everybody’s human and it ain’t no crime
Just pick yourself up, no matter how you feel
Forget about it baby
It ain’t no big deal

When you’re on the top it’s a fantasy
You’ll soon be on the bottom, take it from me
Life is always neutral, and that’s always real
So forget about it baby
It ain’t no big deal

Pain is an illusion too
It wants to drain the life out of you
But if you stay with it you’ll make it through
And you’ll see, you’re free

Failure and success are the same old storm
A picture of a fire won’t keep you warm

Blindness with the sight 
Wrongness with the right 
Disabling my will to action
Sadness from the wasted 
Precious moments tasted 
Copied cut and pasted, 
Aching for some satisfaction
 
And I hear the siren calling 
All my defenses stalling
And my fear 
That keeps me falling
So far 
So far behind

Hands offered seeming nice 
But once I took it twice 
I had to pay the price 
A blank check on all that I owned
Love comes seeming real 
But it’s not what I feel
It’s just part of a deal, 
Where I can’t pay back 
What I was loaned

Is it forever, feeling my feet
Stuck in a past amassed 
Of concrete?
Do I have the strength, 
Do I have the time

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking

Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words

If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like

The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios

Can get Russian reds to yes her

Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows

Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction

Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?

That's why my baby has gone from me.

Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

I heard a maid sing in the valley below
""Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave me,
How could you use, a poor maiden so?""

Remember the vows that you made to me truly
Remember how tenderly you nestled close to me
Gay is the garland, fresh are the roses
I've culled from the garden to bind over thee.

Here I now wander alone as I wonder
Why did you leave me to sigh and complain
I ask of the roses, why should I be forsaken,
Why must I here in sorrow remain?

Through yonder grove, by the spring that is running
There you and I have so merrily played,
Kissing and courting and gently sporting
Oh, my innocent heart you've betrayed

How could you slight so a pretty girl who loves you
A pretty girl who loves you so dearly and warm?
Though love's folly is surely but a fancy,
Still it should prove to me sweeter than your scorn.

Soon you will meet with another pretty maiden
Some pretty maiden, you'll court her for a while;
Thus ever ranging, turning and changing
Always seeking for a girl that is new.

Thus sang the maiden, her sorrows bewailing
Thus sang the poor maid in the valley below
""Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave me,
How could you use, a poor maiden so?""",Early One Morning [#],1995

Jimmy Zavala,"I didn't know what day it was 
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon

Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical

I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsly prints
I put down to experience

The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense",You're in My Heart [The Final Acclaim],1982
Jimmy Zavala,"Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket and a head full of dreams.
He said somehow, some way, it's gotta get better than this.
Patti packed her bags, left a note for her momma, she was just seventeen,
there were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye.

They held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so exited.
We got just one shot of life, let's take it while we're still not afraid.
Because life is so brief and time is a thief when you're undecided.
And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands.

Young hearts be free tonight. Time is on your side,
Don't let them put you down, don't let 'em push you around,
don't let 'em ever change your point of view.

Paradise was closed so they headed for the coast in a blissful manner.
They took a tworoom apartment that was jumping ev'ry night of the week.
Happiness was found in each other's arms as expected, yeah
Billy pierced his ears, drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh!

Young hearts be free tonight.Time is on your side,
Don't let them put you down, don't let 'em push you around,
don't let 'em ever change your point of view.

[instrumental verse]
Young hearts be free tonight.Time is on your side.
Billy wrote a letter back home to Patti's parents tryin' to explain.
He said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way.
But there ain't no point in talking when there's nobody list'ning so we just ran away
Patti gave birth to a ten pound baby boy, yeah!

Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side.
Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side.
Young hearts be free tonight, time in on your side.

Young hearts gotta run free, be free, live free
Time is on, time is on your side
Time, time, time, time is on your side
is on your side
is on your side
is on your side
Young heart be free tonight

Jimmy Zito,"Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories

Got my bag, got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
Long to hear that ""All aboard""

Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven
I'll be waitin' up for heaven
Countin' every mile of railroad track

Jin,"Dumb dumb dumb, another day at work
Man...where the heck are my keys?
I can't be late for work again
It's bad enough I don't get any tips
There they go

Before I was even in the source trying to get 5 mics
I made deliveries for extra duck sauce and fried rice
For about 5 nights outta' the week
I pulled up to peoples houses and hopped outta my jeep
That shit was hard work... but hey, no pain no gain
I runnin' red lights to make sure they have hot lo mein
This ain't dominos... 30 minutes or less
You should be impressed if I even show up at your address
Customers got me stressed... constantly complainin
Tellin' me to turn down that loud music that I'm playin'
Whatever happened to tippin'? see these folks are strange
9.99 give me a 10 and tell keep the change
A whole penny for me, that's some shit
24 more deliveries and I can buy a whole bag of chips
Just the thought of it is making me sick
Hold up, let me take this order real quick

[jin]Hello, house of china how can I help you sir?
[man on phone]Yeah I want to order me ah... spare ribs... and ah... give me a quarter of friedrice
[jin]Ok, would you like to try today's special sir?
[man on phone]No I don't want to try anybody's special
[jin]It's very good very good
[man on phone]No special I'm good, I just want my freakin' food
[jin]What's your address sir?
[man on phone]Ah... 1474 mockingbird lane
[jin]Ok be there in about 30 mins, thank you very much...
[man on phone]Yeah... make it snappy

So after I take the order I put it in the kitchen
And you them chinese chefs they always be bitchin'
Screamin' n' yellin', tryin' to play me like I'm dumb 
Shut yo ass up and keep cookin' that egg foo yung
Finally the food is done and I'm ready to dip
Grab the two bags of grub and head for the whip
Put the key in the ignition and I step on the gas
My pockets kind of swollen and they filled with cash
I pull up to the house, the shit doesn't look safe
Double checked the address make sure I'm the in right place
Yup 1474, I see it on the door
Got out of the whip almost slipped on dog shit on the floor (eeewww)
Something smells fishy 'bout the whole situation
All of a sudden I feel my heart beat racin'
I ring the bell and patiently I'm waitin'
When the door opened up, two shotguns is what I'm facin' (oh shit!)

I can't believe this shit just happened
Me Jin, a victim of a jackin'
I don't know what was wrong with these dudes
They just robbed me for some chinese food
I don't know what was on their minds
I guess they where goin' through hard times
I guess they were some hungry dudes
Cause the just robbed me for some chinese food

Imma' make a run for it, if I get the chance
Starin' down the barrel, shit I almost pissed my pants
It was two guys, one short and one a lil' shorter
I recognize his voice the shorter one placed the order
Either I was dreamin' or I smoked some bomb weed
Two midgets with shotguns were about to rob me
Now I'm nervous as hell that's not a surprise
Its like I saw my whole life flash in front of my eyes
I'm thinkin' about my future wife and kids
The only thing on their minds is the rice and ribs
See the funny thing is they don't want me cash at all
They just said give up the food and that was all
Call the cops... why would I? I don't want to be on the news 
A guy gets dropped by two midgets for some chinese food
So if you make deliveries for the price of rice
And if you see two midgets you better run for your life

I can't believe this shit just happened
Me Jin, a victim of a jackin'
I don't know what was wrong with these dudes
They just robbed me for some chinese food
I don't know what was on their minds
I guess they where goin' through hard times
I guess they were some hungry dudes
Cause the just robbed me for some chinese food

[some guy]Damn you just got robbed for some chinese food?
[jin]Yea..
[some guy]By 2 midgets?
[jin]Yes...
[some guy]I guess they where a lil hungry...get it? a lil hungry?",A Little Hungry,2003
Jin,"Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You at my welcome mat and I ain't mad by letting you in
Long as you listen to me closely as you get to know Jin
First of all I had the thirst of all rappers combined
Worst of all people told me I was wasting my time
Like I was better off making up computer designs
A doctor, a lawyer, or anything that's using my mind
When I used to rap I usually got refused and declined
Till I felt abused and used it as fuel in my rhymes
In every battle, the race card was my downfall
Till I read the Art of War and used it to clown y'all
I'm still battling but on a different note
Not rappers, but labels, same ocean but a different boat
Them CEOs must be sniffin' coke
Don't they know that I'm the dopest product on either coast?
They tried to drown me, but I stayed afloat
Here's a verse for you to quote
The realest shit I ever wrote

[Chorus]
C'MON!
Now that I got your attention I gotta say this
I know that it's been debated I'm a gimmick they created
C'MON!
All the people that hated because I made it, two-faced
When they the same ones that wished that I'd make it
C'MON!
All the critics that's jealous that I've created
Still highly anticipated they nothing to do but face it
C'MON!
Even though that I'm asian we all related be patient
Cause we gon' make it so if you rollin' with me

[Verse 2]
We together now, we ain't gotta act like strangers
I done let you into the deepest and darkest chambers
Introduced you to Jin, all the pain and anguish
Gave you reasons why they say the fame will change us
It's most common amongst entertainers
Rappers and athletes, how can you blame us?
Runnin' round crazy, saying I ain't the same cause
But jealousy, is a funny thing that the brain does
How can you not see, in simple and plain view
My fame ain't changed me, man it changed you
But then again I guess that's what haters do
And it's a damn shame my fans got haters too
It's like the listen, and disregard the lyrics
Imagine if they flipped it and the artist were the critic
And everything YOU did was under the scope
And YOU'S about to get hung, and we the ones with the rope

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If you think about it, me and you, we really the same
Ain't nothin' different about us but the faces and names
The places we came, lies that were placed in our brains
If our ancestors knew they'd be disgraced and ashamed
So I chose to be the one to change the pace of the game
Look at me, hot as California burnin' in flames
Still I feel, that everything I earn is in vein
Unless I do somethin' positive with what I obtain
These people must truly think I'm really insane
Like my life around me revolves around the jewellery and dames
I'm quick to rip that picture right up outta the frame
I ain't tryna see my whole life go down the drain
And be, 40 years old still hoppin' the train
Frontin' with a fake smile like I'm doin' my thang
Hurting inside, tuck in my pride, hide in my pain
If you've never settled for less then you feelin' the same

[Chorus]",C'mon,2004
Jin,"[Verse 1]
You can't help of the way that flow
When he leave the club ladies be like, ""did you see which way did he go?""
That will wraps a coop out from a radio though
When my single drop I'ma charge 80 a show
If you droppin' with me you ready for a pitfall
When my shit hit stores I'm charge a ?
Man, I'm tryin' to cop my toys in too
And stay away from the boys in blue
Just 'cause I'm gettin' dough the beast are made at me
But these cops are jokes like ""Police Academy""
Too much stress and I ain't blew up yet
When the 7 tring to the lax got you upset
I never stress over a chick I'm slick like blue balls
If I was Papa' Smurf you couldn't give me blue balls
Big dick playa, rip through balls
Balls so large they couldn't fit into jars

It's my club 'cause I say club

Yo, this my club song this my club song
Everybody got one so I had to make a club song

Throw your hands high, reach for the sky for my piece of the pie
I'm a beast I ain't speakin' no lie
I'm freakily hot, freak a bunch of freaks in back of the Jeep
Hope on reachin' to speak
I put 'em to sleep, ain't no reason to speak
Way I creep got 'em say; ""Gotta leave in a week""
Poof, be gone - I won't miss you at all
Not ain't sayin' I did you wrong; I ain't ditch you at all
Got a passion-o for gassin' hos
Live my life like everyday is a fashion show
I ain't playin', you know what I'm sayin'?
I wasn't talkin' about your IQ when I told you to give me some brain
Fam, you better play your part
'Cause your girl, she about to have a change of heart
When I come through find me in the cut like a stitch
Chick get wild up 'cause (I'M RICH JAMES BIATCH)

Problem when I'm drinkin'; I get tipsy easy
Leave the bartender a hundred-dollar tip; leave me

Bouncin the fatty when the base go bump
She witness how Twista spit it
So now she want me to hit it
'cause I'm blazin up the booth and raisin up the roof
I'm in the vip sippin on Cris' and Henn'
All the ladies is trippin 'cause they can't get in
They see me ballin wit the Ruff Ryder homie
And say they only drink liqour nigga but now they want some Jin
Everywhere we kick it we got the club sold
International hustlas that travel the globe
Rockin the thugs makin hoes keep it live
It's the Double are connect and that nigga Twista from Chi
I'm fly

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Jin]
We can definitely kick it
I don't want to just stick it
If bein fine was a crime well I'd havta write you up a ticket
If you dance for me its sign jus like a picket
And I got two middle fingaz for all you critics
Never you in this someone so clever who spit this
I'm only here for one night so I mix some pleasure with business
Every few minutes
I drink a couple of shots
Take a dutch break it in half and fill it up with some pot

[Chorus]
Now mama shake some
If they don't like it fuck it
They some haters (c'mon shake it girl)
Yo mama work some
If they don't like it fuck it
They some haters (jus work it girl)

Neo keep 'em rockin baby
Double are what!
I got this part right here

From the start to the finish Imma bark on contenders
Wanna tarnish my image I can't promise forgiveness
See I was never like this my moms would never like this
And y'all was never like us that's why y'all never liked us
See I might take ya style flip it back make it crack
Sell a couple mil get some stacks here you go now take it back
I'm spittin lines of fire I'm in the line of fire
Designer attire makin me a sign of desire
I just rhyme to inspire ya favorite line supplier 
I run through fan signs and landmines the size of tires
How many minds inquire I got mines and acquired
Enough props to make y'all resign and retire

Now hold on
And just stomp stomp
Get ya hands off me

this is hot as gets ya shits not as intense
My flow got 'em convinced they ain't got at him since
My backs against the wall
So if I turn and flee and run from what's in front of me
That won't make no sense at all
This for my dons and divas haters and non believers
They just tryin to deceive us like Judas dishonored Jesus
Why you tryin to critique this
Don't take kindness for weakness leave you behind the speakers
Body minus some pieces
You got records to sell I got records to break
You will never excel against me measure the rate
I got too much at stake I just follow my fate
Annhialate and dominate and I ain't even
Tryin to wait

Now hold on
And just stomp stomp
Get ya hands off me

While you hang out I bang out make moves 
Like shots rang out 
Wanna know what my slang bout they be like
Shut yo damn mouth
Ya chances are slim makin advances on Jin
While you shootin the breeze I'm dancin with the wind
This is not ya ordinary my style sorta varies
Slaughter you than ya crew cause you know
The more the merry
You already know the outcome so how come
You doubt son I'm goin out by any means necessary Malcolm
Hiphop without Jin is like shootouts with guns
Churches without nuns bankers without funds
Smokin without lungs cities without slums

Jin,"About they never talked about the guns or the drugs
'Til I saw the guns and the drugs
There is tons in the hood
I'll admit, I never sold a sack in my life

Watchin' ""Scarface"" thinkin' that was a life
Slingin' dope or coke, respect, money and power
But what happen when things start to go sour
Everybody want to see more cash

But ego's clashin', that's when egos crash
See the two of them started when they was in dimes
Graduated, now they movin' bricks at a time
Down to do whatever even wet up cops

Tryin' to build an empire so they shut up shop
They got themselves a connect ready to tie it down
A buster went from Philly straight to China town
Now there is dough's poorin' heads thinkin' it's the same

All of a sudden there is weak link in the chain
He's a 6""2, brawler cat -- nickname Bolo
Caught beef with his man so he had to go dolo
But that was a no no

You know the code of the streets; everybody gotta eat
And that's how shit in the hood be
Ain't sayin' it's a true story, but it could be
For the next three months Bolo is nowhere to be found

They say 'cause of the beef that's why he left town
And everybody knows why they don't get along
He's a greedy bastard - stole half a meal from Fom
Fom is the quiet type, silent and deadly

You play with his money now he's violent and ready
They was partners - betrayed by his own man
So he really gotta take action into his own hands
Father forgive me for the sins I commit
But when I see that thief again, that's it

[Chorus]
The good, the bad, things can get ugly
Every hustler over this money thinkin' what it should be
Never know who, when, where, what could be
If you still alive then you'll probably understood me

Meanwhile across town in a two bedroom apartment
Bolo's going through it, baby mama through it
All that dumb shit he be puttin' her though
Disappear for three months plus he hittin' her too

Now she got her bags pack then she ready to bounce
Didn't leave a thing - not even the keys to the house
Let her leave, he ain't talk with her at all
Went straight for the safe behind the portrait on the wall

He's back for his jewels, that 'n the cash
Plus the sale of last few bricks he had in his stash
Get his money right then he leavin' again
Off to find a new life and start breathin' again

So the deal was made and the buyers agreed
And exchanged - they bring what the suppliers would need
Pick a spot in China Town uncle Lenny used to own
Dollar bills on the wall respectfully known

Bolo went by himself even though it seem risky
Wanted the whole cake - somethin' smell fishy
Back in the kitchen the money was waitin'
Deep in his heart he knew he was dancin' with Satan

Dress in all back with gats - this ain't part of the deal
Had a me set a mouth for the kill
Startin' lettin' off shots now just a few here
Sounded like firecrackers durin' Chinese new years

Bolo's big as a truck I don't know how they missed him
But they got so close the bullet stay there and kissed 'em
Grabbed the suitcase threw a table at the goons
Jump out a shattered window not a moment too soon

The thugs follow and he sprayed up his ride
Cut up from the glass but he made it alive
Now he's back at the crib frankly they say at least
He was just being chased by thugs and the police

Countin' his dough sittin' on the couch' in
Two shots to the back of the head now he slouch' in
Fom tried to get him at the spot, couldn't then
So he paid his baby ma' 50 Gs' to let him in
Damn

Jin,"[Verse 1]
Look I'm not a gimmick it's not a rapper I'm tryin' to mimic
My life move about a mile a minute make the best of it while I'm in it
Talk shit I'll never get offended I'm so pushin' to the limit
I can shake off 20 haters - ignore 'em and handle my business
Highly hood got my name cement in
A treat to every rapper in the game or that seven up in it
5"" 6, but I stand tall
Built for war, sort of like Great Wall of China
Hear my footsteps like Yao Ming's behind'cha
Don't remind me, do whatever to you, fly back and there'd be
Hell on earth for you to find me
They say we all look alike, cook alike
But they ain't know that we all crooks alike
I changed the game when I took the mic
In freestyle what it took for you to write

[Hook]
I am here now say what you want
I know I got something you want
I am here now think what you want
This is my life let's get it on

[Verse 2]
It's like the curse bein' successful
The more progress the more stressful
Don't ask about heart, I got a chest full
Throw into a cesspool of sex juice
So my next move is to elevate for the best view
I got a few things to confess too
They say I'm famous, I don't feel special
Plucked from a few to be placed on a pedal stool
Only to be ridiculed and find out they want to get rid of you
Once you in a pinnacle they try to limit you
From the start of your career until when they finish you
That's why in interviews I keep my shit in minimal
And if I do say somethin' is a subliminal
Is it because I'm signed with killers and criminals?
It's pitiful; this rap game is too political
But fuck it, I ain't got shit else to do

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
y'all, y'all
You ain't gotta give me my respect, I'ma take it
You gotta punch me in tonight, I'ma lay it
You gotta loan me no money, I'ma make it
And I'll do anythin' that I can get away with
I say what I want, take it how you take it
Media hype that I've created has enhanced my hatred
I came from the basement, rolls among the stars like a space ship
Face it, there is no replacement
Time you spent lookin' for the one is time wasted
I'm too defined, my design you can't trace it
So, give it up I ain't bitter but
I'm sick enough to take my contract and rip it up
Plus my friends say I'm forgettin' stuff
Is it 'cause I failed to get in touched while I'm out rappin, travelin', 
gettin' bucks
And my hearts in my Miami indeed
Oh I ain't forget, I just got my family to feed

Yo I was doin' a show with Kanye in the West

Look at shorty with my name, tatted on her breast y'all
Mr. West, what do you think is the best?
Take 'em backstage, get acquainted, that's what I suggest dog

Ain't no credit card, spendin cash' on Rodeo

Jin,"It's from the heart
It's from the heart right here (yeah)
Everybody has a story to tell
Check this out though

I knew this chinese dude in Junior High
Part of my crew, everybody knew the kid
He was the talk of the school, intelligent
And well spoken, respected by teachers
All the other students kept their eyes on his sneakers
What can I say? You can tell he's cool if you talk with him
During fire drills girls would want to walk with him
He could have any chick up in his view
But there was only one girl he wanted to call boo
See its all true, found himself stressed in a dead end
The girl he was feelin was obsessed with his bestfriend
His bestfriends a playa, that's the reason he's pissed
Plus he treat her like she don't even exist
He ain't tryna hate on his man, but there was no help in it
Wrote the girl a letter told her how he felt in it
She was shocked at first of him revealing the truth
Till she realized that she was feelin him too

[Chorus]
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you

And you've been thinkin of me

Oh

Uh
So you know as time goes by
Things get a little bit serious
Just listen

It was strictly hip hop, now they bumpin slow jams all day
Went from holding hands, to makin out in the hallway
Their relationship, seemed like a dream come true
As time went by their friendship grew
Staring at the stars, trading secrets on the phone
When her parents were at work, she would sneak him in her room
He told her he was a virgin the day that they met

So on his birthday he got a gift he'll never forget
Females were jealous, but they still calling him cute
First day of summer school, they rocked the matching nautica suits
Happy in each others arms, can it be
They found true love, living in a fantasy
Then reality attacks, his pops couldn't see past the fact
His son was asian, but his girlfriend was black
Imagine having to choose between the one that you love or your fam
That's like cutting off your right or left hand, damn

[Chorus]

Uh huh, yeah

I know this sounds like a true story
Coulda happened to any one of us
It's crazy though right?

Now if this sounds like a true story
That's probably cause it is
And I know for a fact cause I'm that chinese kid
Mm, lookin back now, I know its more than just a crush
I'm sayin the whole expierience taught me so much
Love can overcome anything that gets in its way
That's reason I still think of shorty 'til this day
We talk now and then, she's doin her thing
We both full grown up, I think she rockin a ring
I know she's proud of me and all the things I've accomplished
She was there when I was nobody, that's being honest
Ain't no shame, I'll admit it she was there when I cried
So in return I wipe the tears from her eyes
As far as my pops, he's a little more open minded
If his son is happy, he's 100% behind it
Now this is a song I know I had to do
Cause all the stuff I went through might have happened to you

[Chorus]

Oh

Uh, yeah

Everybody remembers their first love
You only get one
So you gotta remember
Yeah
Uh
I just want you to know
That Jin's still thinkin about you",Love Story,2004
Jin,"We may look different but we see the same sky
We may see different but we cry the same cry

To wake up daily and sleep better nights
That's what we all wish for to seek a better life right?
It's unfortunate when tragedy strikes
But the truth is reality bites
June 4th '89 a day residents feared
Now known as the massacre at Tienamen Square
The day I turned seven they were mourning and grieving
Thousands of innocent died for what they believed in
Armed with nothing but heart and a point to prove
Stood in front of tanks and refused to move
What would you do? run or stand still
When a lifes on the line and they test a man's will
Seeking change and they found it but in death
Strangers yet they were my blood and flesh
This happened in China but you ain't gotta be Asian to relate
To the struggle pain and heartache so

You'll never know you'll never get it
There is no choice we can't forget it
When we look up we see the same sky
When we look up we cry the very same cry

See I'm a grown man
It hurts when I turn on the news and see what's going on in my homeland
The SARS epidemic could have been lies
Could it stand for should Asians really survive
They'll try anything to break your family apart
Politics'll break down the manliest heart
Can the child within my heart rise above?
If there's a billion of us I shouldn't have to look for love
Over-population but damn just the meet the needs
It's illegal to have more than one seed
How can you dictate birth regardless to women
And the parents they make the hardest decisions
Sons keep the family name so that's not an option
Imagine being forced to put your daughter for adoption
And even though its beyond your control
Keep your head up here's a song for your soul

You'll never know you'll never get it
There is no choice we can't forget it
When we look up we see the same sky
When we look up we cry the very same cry

If you don't know where you came from
You can't get to where you trying to go
Ain't no denying so
It's true I got some big shoes to fill
But if I don't lead the movement than who will?
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Thinkin' bout the refugees that went to see God's face
Sixteen-thousand miles across the ocean tides
Some died some got lucky and survived
I wouldn't call it luck they reached the destination
Modern day slavery without the plantation
Them sneakers on your feet cost a hundred a pop
My people's making fifteen cents a day and sweat shots
To make them kicks so you can look good
You think we open restaurants 'cause we cook good?
Hell no we ain't got no choice
I gotta speak up without me my people have no voice

You'll never know you'll never get it
There is no choice we can't forget it
When we look up we see the same sky
When we look up we cry the very same cry",Same Cry,2004

First and foremost I gota give praise
To the lord above and his almighty ways
Blessin me with the gift to lift spirits
And evoke emotions through these words everytime you hear it
I got the lyrics and flow I'm capable so
When I blow just know this ones for April and Joe
Me and my little sister we grateful you know
Wish I could see you more Avah at the rate that you grow
My favorite uncle Franky for opening ya door
When I ain't have a place to stay I crashed on your floor
Taught me the basic survival tools
Auntie Cathy every summer kept me in vacation Bible school
Mr Diskin for more than passin grades
And my fourth grade teacher mr Scott who passed away
Peep how I met Kamel corner on the street
We goin to the top lets do it for Shawna and Jaleek
In the beginnin no one was on Jins side folks
Bar and Amory whoa bundy that's a inside joke
Before bullshit friendships synthetic for cream
Chilled with my wall click Bryan Cedric and Jean
So when I moved to ny chose to invest in a few
One love to Patricia Ben and the rest of the crew
To be loved is a privilidge that's what I was told
A gem from my man LS more precious than gold
Infamous joe lacin my tatt so sick
Fong YungMac and Ken down at ho yips
To dee waah chivon and the rest of the Deans
For believing in a young man obsessed with a dream
Allowin me to write history create my own chapter
All original ryders and the generation after
The double are staff my thanks worth a million
And the whole 30th floor at the Universal buildin
You could never walk in my shoes or stand in my boots
Know how I came up I'll never abandon my roots
Yeah see rayz poison pen for sharing the stage
Shouts to stronghold tone and the rest of the plague
Ask big zoo we ten steps ahed of ya
Vice versus eye to eye e-o dub regulars
My man j pure for bringin the heat right
And the rest of the poets chillin under streetlights
Just keep the beats tight shouts to the record spinners
Enuff felli fell and all the heavy hitters
Kubichi k sly hold me down in La
Might catch me flickin it up with Von in the bay
Then its off to the wake up show with tech and sway
Or big nat and foot out in VA
Its damn near tradition to kick a freestyle
Anytime I'm with Eddie Francis out in seatown
Can't forget hometeam as high as I be
Supacindy big lip and Dj irie
The club and mixtape djs that break records
Cause thanks to them we've heard some great records

Anytime ya boy Jin gota run in with the law

And of course swizz blocks carl climax
Far east movement they got what ya minds lack
T dot montreal where I keep mass appeal

Thanks to BET for jump startin my career
As for 106 who they askin about
Free and AJ can't wait to see y'all back on the couch
And MTV for givin advance warnings
John singleton plus the chance at performin
The source double xl rolling stone vibe
The truth the lies the layout in rides
For every write up forever in context
King magazine elle girl and complex
To all the producers for providin the beats
Shouts to neo tunehedz divine and elite
JR wyclef kanye can I rep
This is real hiphop be damned if I let
Y'all tell me otherwise cause we so live
This ones for 954 and 305
All the way to 718 and 212
And if you ever showed love this ones for you
But I gota say thanks even those that hated
Cause cause y'all kept me motivated

I gota thank God I wanna thank y'all

Tonight we're gonna try something a little different.

[Jin]
This is not an exclusive, so pardon me
As I get on my Posdu new shit
You know them stakes is high I can't relate to guys
That create disguise-is
Exaggerate how great they pies is
Is that a pizza or lemon merengue
You ain't slangin a thang, play guerilla
But you ain't even orang and a tang
I hang with a gang, we ride til we die
Preferably ride yessire I professor M-I
CNN for information, order now
And get free installion, oops
You're a flow too late, I got the flow of two lakes
Ontario and Michigan
That means great for every rap fan listenin
Soon you will be seein and you will be agreein
Even though I'm Chinese I do a show for the Koreans cause
I'm so dope and my flow so tight
I could turn Karaoke to Open Mic Night
(right)
4x

[Styles P.]
Why don't you try to Karaoke this verse
Is the nigga with a whole bunch of birds and don't none
Of them chirp
Ten ways to calm down and don't none of them work
I go bezerk with a gun in my shirt
Blow a hundred of earth, pastor said don't come to the church
I'm a problem when it come to the work
Listen if its a race to split ya face
I'll be comin in first
I show up niggas wonder who I'm comin to murk
Got my broad in the corner gun under the skirt
And we lookin at ya jewels, tryin to wonder the worth
Gettin slayed at night, take away the ice
Cause its sorta like sprite, how we obey our thirst
Shoulda known you seen both of the are's
Ghost come with the toast, Jin came with the Chinese stars
You can catch me downtown at a Chinese bar
Dai-ma like a motherfucker high off la' wha..
I'm so dope and my flow so tight
I could turn Karaoke to Open Mic Night
(right)
4x
[Jin]
Simply put I limp with a pimpery foot
And that's just how its meant to be took
Or taken, I hate the pigs
But I got fam out in Frisco that's my bay-kin
See how that works a beat
And the perks of bein a jerk
Me and styles P leave you deep in the dirt
Peek in ya hears whisper in ya ear freakin a verse
While the deacons speakin a church
Oh lord
I'm so dope and my flow so tight

Ah we got that got shit..
Woah we got that hot shit..
Oh we got that hot shit..

its the G.O.L.D.E.N
And the emcee back at it again..
Its the G.O.L.D.E.N
And the emcee back at it again..

lets take it back to the basics..
'cause face it..
Nowadays its all about the beats..
Lyrics are wasted..
Simple minds get nothing at all..
I'm saying what do'ya think the rewind button is for...
If I was your A&R every verse be the kind..
You're a grown man, why you kicking nursery rhymes..
Fooling the public with the rubbish you create..
Hoping they won't notice it beneath the AO8s..
Its a shame that your tactics are affected..
It seems like listeners are not as selected..
Djz, drop this and let it blast..
Bet you anything the first question they gon ask...

is that a neptune track, uh uh, uh uh..
Is that a timbaland track, uh uh, uh uh..
I'm saying who did that..
I'm saying who did that..

its the G.O.L.D.E.N
And the emcee back at it again..
Its the G.O.L.D.E.N
And the emcee back at it again..

I can rhyme on fast beats so ones that tell us slow..
Better yet no beat check the acapella flow..
You got beats for the streets, beats for the clubs
Beats for the ladies, beats for the thugs..
Top 40 beats get it across the nation..
Underground beats don't make it pass college stations..
Some beats are worldwide, other beats are local..
Most beats aren't even hot until I lay my vocals..
I got love for this self, they holding it down the day..
But don't these crunk beats all sorta sound the same..
Don't care where its from, long as the shits hot..
I need a beat, the 5th element of hip hop..

is that a neptune track, uh uh, uh uh..
Is that a timbaland track, uh uh, uh uh..
I'm saying who did that..

And the emcee back at it again..

pre got the shit sonicly mastered...
That's why his 1st album the cronics was a classic..
Hip hop is pre most drum kicks..
Resalace 36 chambers with karate flicks..
Swizz is known bang on the MP..
But the beat prolly get your ass banned from tv..
Havocs like give up the goods or he gon take it..
Alcumus came through on some we gon make it..
I bet bow wow didn't even know..
When the role beat drops everybody wanna flow..
Kanye got some classics under his belt,
But since he started rhyming he keep his shit to himself..
Wish I had the budget to get up with just blaze..
Prolly cause a couple grand just to use the phrase..
Sometimes you just wanna to hear street knock..
A little bit of night wonder maybe some beat rock..
Get a many fresh bit if I ever start blinging..
Or mario winans if I ever start singing..
Psyke... but biggup to all your producers..
Mark my work, golden child is the future..

is that a neptune track, uh uh, uh uh..
Is that a timbaland track, uh uh, uh uh..

Shit real, I know how baggin' a whole brick feel
Big deal, hit the garage and switch wheels
My chicks real, with the menage and tip drills
Give me a massage, then show me how them lips feel

I'm shinin' cause I'm clinin' on the strip still
And I grip steel, still keep the clip steel
Everything I spit real, everything I spit ill
Everything I spit sick, for real

When shit switch, ain't shit changed
Like Rick James, I'm rich, bitch
Get change, big chain and wrist gliss
I'm with game, I'ma make cake like this quick
My album went gold in a month, that was a quick flip

Don't say shit, bitch 'cause niggaz with the lip bit
Ain't one in the gun, 'till it go click click
Then I'ma switch clips and squeeze like toothpaste
Palm over my forearm so I could shoot straight

Should've been spit on volume one, tell your corner it's time

Throw in the towel, you done
Call up Jimmy, Kevin Lyles, whoever you want
It's a wrap, your career cannot be saved
Fuck makin' a comeback, you ain't Flavor Flav

Before my album dropped, I rocked show for G's
Blowin' trees, while I'm tourin' overseas
Flew to PR, won a quick fifty G's
And I'm still poppin' up on Smack DVD's

Ain't got no platinum plaques for records sold
But if eatin' rappers was sales, I'm seven times gold
Bout to blow, get set for detonation
Speakin' on behalf of the next generation

No matter what they spit us, I still ain't convinced
Not at all, your brains over the window, make it look like you got red tints
Hope your GT got a bulletproof F are O N T
Pop with them slugs and give a fuck about your Bentley

You a punk and I'm a boss boy, it's the you Cheeks
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that nigga from 'The Lost Boys'
The barrel was too big, you had to see the fall
You had to see that havin' it all was just a casualty of war

I got keys like a chord when I'm swingin' a sword
I could bring you the law, got them things on the fog
We the best and I ain't got to spit a punchline
'Cause I do sit ups all over the track when it's crunch time

Fuck this rap shit, I've been realer, you got thin scrilla
I'll put this machete through the side of your chin chilla

Think of the things you can do with that money
Choose any charity, give to the poor

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

It's about to go down like this here

Uh, uh, these niggas keep hatin', that ain't right though
I'ma throw it down like this here

Now I ain't trying to take over the game
I'm just trying to get a Range Rover and a couple of chains
I got a X-ed out college bitch giving me brains
Gave her my e-mail address and an alias name
And they tell me take it easy but I can't help it
I want more green than the Boston Celtics
Let a true nigga breathe don't be selfish
Bet on hot spitta competition getting dealt wit
Hollerin' bout you totin' guns
But I see you with no straps like low-top Air Force Ones
And you hollerin' bout money ain't got no funds
And you rappin' on beats using pots for ya drums
And you'll never see me with ya bitch
Oh I got the hoe with me, you just can't see through the tint
And I'm beggin' ya dog please don't quit rappin'
If you quit rappin' I quit laughin'

Don't want to see us with no paper ha (that ain't right)
Don't want to see us niggas make it ha (that ain't right)
I ain't gon call you a hater dog ('cause that ain't nice)
Just let a nigga breathe in the game aight

I got a flat so I had to leave the V in the garage
And X see the bar on his Bentley ??
Headin' to the spa for a weekly massage
Me, ya lady, and ya sister do minage trios
And I just copped two Porsches
And the dashboard got more wood than the Evergreen Forest
 
Pull up on the block, two glocks two torches
Shorty too hot like papa bear's poridge
Talkin' bout you pop caps to wet me
The only cap you pop is off a bottle of Pepsi
I got enough waves for you to ride on jet skis
And fuck a bodyguard I let the tech protect me
Hell in a black end male with white break lights
Known for spittin raps out like that on tapes right
Say you got skills ha bitch keep frontin'
And I'll carve ya face up like a Halloween Pumpkin

[Chorus]

I guess I ain't supposed to spit
You probably want me locked off in the back so you can hush my shit
You probably thinkin' is see wrong for this
But XL ain't just a name known for production and shit
If ain't nothing else, I'm never ya bitch
Lyrically I'm hot, like the different color paint on my six
And if y'all really ain't on my shit, it's cool
'Cause that ain't right
I guess I know you better than me
You probably a pimp who get the pussy wetter than me
You probably a thug with more ice and cheddar than me
Fuck that if i was you I'd be better than me
Ya bitch you, you better be better than me
You're probably right, that ain't right
Naw dog, not on your life
You're better off trying to fuck with a dike
If you smart why you sound so dumb on the mic
You can't fuck with my beats let alone what I write
My click, or the fact that we tight
It ain't us, y'all ain't doin' it right
I ruined it right

Aw fuck it they done gave me a mic

Tearin' the block up
I don't stop bank I close account stock up
Spend the whole advance and both hands get it rocked up

Street lookin' like a track meet when I pop up
How these broads gonna stop Luck
Without glocks up
Run in the club barefooted throwin' five shots up

Niggas want to bounce , tell em bounce , throw your ox up
You just buck oh five and act like you want some

[Jinx Da Juvy]
Ay yo you can catch me in the hood with Papi
Tryin' to cop grands
Screw a dirtbike I'm tryin' na cop me a land
I'm a gorilla nigga feed me black banannas

Might catch me blacked down with a black bandanna
With the 5th choked out
In a Benz with the rims poked out
Or in a truck with Luck gettin' smoked out

I'm tryin' not to blast this cat
But y'all hatin on again so I'm a spaz on Funkmaster Flex

[Chorus]
[Jigga's sample and Big Kap]
Bounce
To all my thugs in the club poppin cris
Bounce

Bounce , bitch , bounce , bitch , bounce , bitch , bounce , bounce
To all my ladies in the club wildin out

[Jinx Da Juvy]
Ay yo ay yo ay yo
Y'all done let the kid in the game who black out
Y'all done assed out
I'm runnin' in the game snatching change on the cash though

Anybody could get it
I dare why'all to act up
I guarantee homicide will be comin' to drag out
Dummies I'm dumpin' dumb dums on when I clap out

A lot of niggas rap thug but never pull gats out
Shit I'm from the street lay the strip with the jacks out
Who want the coke price whenever I ran up in the crackhouse

[Lady Luck]
I got niggas on my dick and I ain't even got one
Flow kind of sick you gotta get cop one
Niggas talk slick only when the cops come
That's when I come through and scrape yo' ass

Uh uh I need ta uh uh milli uh uh's
Extra fu-unds , whole damn crew got gu-uns
How you goin' talk crap with clap are you-uns
Claim to be a thug nigga won't't you blast su-um

Jinx Da Juvy,"Chorus (Kool G. Rap)
N.Y. City, crime around me, drug dynasties
Death and robberies 
On the dark blocks where bodies bleed
Jake inside the P.J.'s, the heat waves
Kids play where heat sprays
Straight floods, no love, fake thugs
Draw blood with Four-Four snubs
Tear away your rug
Kids with clout 
Up in the Range Rover with chicks, spray in their mouth
Drain 'em out, set up for the wet up, bang 'em out
These streets in Queens remain the murder scene, blood stain 'em out
(repeat)

Verse 1: (Kool G. Rap)
Inside the chambers of Hell
Where all the L puffin' niggas dwell
And fell 'cause of a loss of blood cells
Bullet shells, glass is shattered
Shit gets torn and tattered
Niggas brains is splattered on sewage drains when they be goin' at it
Static over addicts, revolvers and automatics 
It's illmatic how I seen one catch two in the cabbage
From an initial, official shiny nickel played pistols
Sparklin' like crystals, launchin' missiles
Domes get blown like whistles
Ain't no jokin', niggas will leave you and your Momma soakin'
And smokin' and blown open
Bodies found in Hoboken
Kids comittin' murder after murder
Shit is real so I feel for the ones that don't pack steel and burners
Bodies be droppin' down around Queens 
By different teams, it's the Teens that tear your ass out the frame by
The seams
The end of the drama center, niggas you want drama?
Word to Momma come equipped with two clips and body armor. 

Chorus 
Verse 2: (Jinx Da Juvy)
Yeah, it's that young fella, Jinx Da Juvy
Fly lil' nigga, iced out with a fresh brand new Coogi
Jigged out, wig spinned out with waves
Pockets full of the Franklins, I stay gettin' paid
Stay stackin' papes, plus my Fam flip cakes
While some of us rap, other fellas flip 'caine
Rock big chains, what ya'll think this a game?
Murder incorp. slash open cases with cartels
We do things that make the Mob tell
The way we go outta state and flip more cakes then Carvel
Ya'll play the cut, and watch this lil' nigga prevail
'cause I spit much hotter than Hell
So why ya'll playa hate and plot to creep on mine
I pay ya'll no mind, but violate and speak to the Nine
I'm a B.K. Son of a gun 
When I spit 16 bars ya'll rap niggas dial 911
I'm only 14, and ya'll rap dudes ready to run
This ain't a game, ain't no time for fun
I'm the young rap Lord, so I gotta hold it down
It's Easy Mo Bee, G. Rap and Jinx Da Juvenile. 

Verse 3: (Kool G. Rap)
Crushed with the ice, get rushed for your life
Busted in twice, stuck with a knife
On these rough nights we hustle and heist
Put heaters to your Man and double the price
Snuffin' your lights, shake you like a couple of dice
Nothin' is nice, prepare for combat
Firearm cats with long gats, end up where you get embalmed at
Lay on the floor flat, pull the gat format
Direct beside your door mat 
Cock the Fours back, blow out your Whore's back
Leave the kids wigs tore back
My niggas ride with me like horseback
Go to war rats, niggas you strapped? let me take that 
G. Rap face slap all of these fake cats
And unofficials, get gun missiles clapped in your lung tissue
Me and my Dun's'll hit you, slugs not even one'll miss you
Tons of pistols 
Kid, you got guns?, you should've brung 'em wit' you
Them niggas runnin' wit' you
Caught 'em and hung 'em wit' you
No games, out to blow frames with Fo' flames
At close range, have all you niggas lookin' for Rogaine.

It ain't my fault The devil's been on my back lately He's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle But it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual But I need you, God
A lot of things that I used to I don't want to
Runnin' the streets like I used ta
I know I'm gonna speak the word for you one day
Up in the light -- Hallelujah!! -- on Sunday
I thank you Lord for the blessings that you gave me
And for my life the blessings that you have saved me
And for my wife
You have carried me enough times and that's the truth
Carried me through the rough times throughout my youth
And through it that I saw you was still wit me
I was that one lost sheep and you was comin' to get me

I'm lookin' at life a lil' different now since you hugged me
And I always loved my people but now they love me
Thank you for the love, Lord, we praise ya
Jacob, ascendants, from Africa to Asia
Bleeding the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout your name in times of need
And times of joy and when we bleed
And when we are overcome with grief
You don't have to tell me twice; I'm a take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I never knew I had 
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad, 
All praise is due to ya, that's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya,

Open up the doors and let me in 
I'm done wit the cards so let's begin
Prayers that you give to me, I give to them
Same way you live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now you got me smiling
From inside of my heart when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain any more only sunshine
No pain anymore.... I really love mine
You wash away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, in thirty years
You know that

The ones that put a red beam in your mug
The ones that bug and be in the clubs
and hide whips, gleamin' with dubs

that hit the hot blocks to cop the diesel
in back of the spots but chop on the lethal
Then pop goes the weasel

Drop pots of evil, ghetto D with shots from a needle

Got kicked out of school cause I used to carry guns in my knapsack
Been a serious dude, never the one to laugh at
So play crazy and this 380'll twist your cap back
Before rap, I played the slums where the cash at
Duckin' the boys in blue, with jumps in ass crack
Now I switched over, but still tote the big toaster
for niggaz schemin' so I'm fiendin' to bend your wig over
You might catch the kid herbed out, bent over
Without a license, gettin' brain in a tint Rover
But not for nuttin, a frontin' dude get popped for frontin'
Y'all the type to snitch when a cop's comin'
But that don't stop nuttin' cause trust me the cop's duckin'

Now we, spillin' the Crist', niggaz still with the hits
Won't stop until I cop a half-a-mill' for the wrist
Rule with a iron fist but still in the midst

Harsh killer hold the hammer like twenty bar villains
Spit flames like Godzilla, menage-a-trois in large villas
Pack the trey-pound God pealer

Decide your fate like a Tarot card dealer

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time

Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this

Never be the same again. 

I call you up whenever things go wrong. 
You're always there. You are my shoulder to cry on.

To take the forbidden step. 
Is this something that I might regret?

Things will never be the same again. 
It's not a secret anymore. 
Now we've opened up the door.

We'll never, never be the same again.

I'm glad I realised I need you so much more.

From sidewalks to highways. 
See it'll never be the same again. 
What I'm sayin' 
My mind frame never changed 'til you came rearranged. 

But sometimes it seems completely forbidden. 
To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden. 
Where there's no competition. 
And you render my condition. 
Though improbable it's not impossible. 
For a love that could be unstoppable. 

But wait. 
A fine line's between fate and destiny. 
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be? 
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me. 
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly. 

And as our energies mix and begin to multiply. 
Everyday situations, they start to simplify. 
So things will never be the same between you and I. 
We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified. 

I thought that we would just be friends. 
Things will never be the same again. 
It's just the beginning it's not the end.

Come on
Can you fill me in (Let's talk about it)

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said, ""hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
When I returned, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in

All they seem to do is be checking up on you baby
Watchin' our every move, think some day they might approve baby

Why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light

You're my reason for reason

I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it

But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round

In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand

Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

And I understand you've come to shake my hand.

You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,

When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,

How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.

But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,

It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way

Switch to the truck, nothing more said
Kid don't play, just do clean
That's what it is, when I come from Queens
Do my lean, big black truck
Coming through like I'm moving that stuff

Jizzy Pearl,"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Without warning, somethings dawning, listen.
Then within your senses,
You'll know you're defenseless
How your heart beats, when you run for cover
Your cant retreat I spy like no other.
Then we race together.  
We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry.
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
On and on we're charging to the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode.

Jizzy Pearl,"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woah, oh oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Woah, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh

About some bridges I've burned
I spent some time in Hell
I guess I know it too well
I never want to return
 
Why can't I just forgive?
Why can't I learn to let go?
Why can't I live and let live
Like I used to anymore?
How many years will go by
Where I bang my head on the sky?
Why can't I just forgive?
 
I just can't seem to let go
It tortures people I know
Spend too much time in the past
I'd like to leave it at last
I don't know which way to go
 
I thought I was stronger
Than I was
A chip on my shoulder

I spent so much time in Hell

Each and every day making cash with Satan
Can't eat can't sleep, it's exasperatin'
Mad like burning off
All he needs is one warm hug to keep from turning off
I'm sure you could use a boost
Left the hooptie parked in hood with the screws loose
Bust the coupé out the driveway, stash house
Scooped you up, hit the highway and mash out
Matte-black like melanin on melanin
Of course the butter soft, black leather trim, set of rims
Let 'er purr, not a scratch on it
Spin it back to the garage and put a latch on it
I need a handful of melanin
Feelin' like the lambswool beard on your tender skin
It might give you a shock initially
As we reconnect up the flow, electricity
The phenomenal melanin bio-polymer
Follow with a glass a Merlot, I could swallow her
Eat 'er up like a SnackWell
We could live forever like Henrietta Lacks cells
Melanin on melanin
Ask me where the hell I been soon as I felt her skin
Holdin' hands, feet in the sand, grounded
Starin' in them pretty brown eyes, astounded
I'll share some solar power
If you let me pound it we could go for hours
And then again in the shower
Left her leg tremblin', recharged the melanin

Girl you got it
Me too let that show

That's that glow
Feel it yo
Love that glow
Even so
Feel it yo

Tastes stale see the world in shades of greyscale
Right there in black-and-white, protected by chain mail
Today's the day maids await to see a cisternum
Took my little mens with her, told 'em love 'em, kissed him
He's always sensitive, youngins is on some new stuff
Can't sit still or focus, the time it take to do enough
From the mean streets of the 'Can I get a dollar, dude’?
Above measure, the singular pleasure of solitude
It's your poison, if you so choose, absorb it
Veins to the brain, shoot off into orbit
How you know octagon?
Or much less tetragrammaton?

With any luck, you might could score locally
Keep it on the hush when you're speaking on it vocally

Who need credit when cash speak?

Still frozen in their very poses when the smoke cleared
Raining fire, barbecue meat 'til
It's mesquite of the grill balled up in a fetal
They like them pickled and smoked
Beer battered, deep fried up if it's a joke
It's on yall to serve man, the cook book
Whoever don't find it too funny to look, look
With clear eyes, and skies that's easily clouded
I wonder how come the graveyards ain’t over crowded
Know about it - missing children are delicacies
Tender with the skin, bone-in, many recipes
Fresh from out the oven, bruh

Or the cup that runneth - let's keep it a hundredth
It's just in time for the world harvest
No matter if you're stinking filthy rich or impoverished
On or Off-line
They're out to get that new new white meat, the fourth kind
The plot thickens like a pot of hot chickens
Few choose to mix it with the lot of rotten pig skins
And get caught up in the rapture
Led to the slaughter like cattles off the pasture
Give them back their pieces
These bloodthirsty gods eat you like mac and cheese wiz
Devoured alive, adrenaline is hot sauce
Only thing could say, use melanin if you're not lost
Similar slaughter to Sodom and Gomorrah
Flee from out the horror and you might can see tomorrow
War time, they snack often, they be back orphans

Ni dar marcha atras..

Aunque nunca pude dejarla de amar

Por ella pongase a luchar
Mas vale amor seguro que cuatrocientas corriendo

No se si mi condena será seguir solo
O sentenciarme a no volverla a ver

De que me arrepiento de su sufrimiento

Entonces buscala buscala ya!
Que no se te haga muy tarde
Y no pueda perdonarte
Ni dar marcha atras..

Y a pesar de los fracasos he encontrado el tiempo
Voy buscando su rastro detras de su aliento
Yo se que he fallado y aqui me arrepiento
En fin
Sin ella a mi la vida se me va perdiendo
Si no la tengo a mi lado sintiendo su cuerpo
Un corazon desolado que se esta muriendo
Y vuela y vuelve ma'
Que tu iluminas mi sendero
Y vuela y vuelve ma'
Que nada es igual sin ti

Entonces buscala buscala ya!

(Yeah, Tech N9ne!)

Follow me, all around the planet, I run the game with no Sickology
They could never manage, we do damage with' no apology
Pick 'em out the panic, a little manic 'cause I gotta be
Frantic, I'ma jam it 'cause I'm an oddity
Down for the trackin' like I'm grabbin' at my binoculars
I could pop at you, papa, 'cause I'm partners with' Waka Flocka
Gimme the top of hip-hop and watch 'I'm make 'em rock
With a show-stopper, chakras poppin' off the (Worldwide Choppers)

Take as the pinnacle, now the ideal nickel solos it
Little coders to pull again, wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo, when it exposed, the flow be hold it, 'cause when that motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the rear
Better to get just near the mirror, ready to get near my heels
Gimme the knock and I'ma chop it, he came and it went tomorrow
But I'ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas

Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trippin' when I rip it, I be the X when I split 'em up
Sorta like I was liquored up and backin' up in the cup
Everybody be knowin' I be actin' up when I buzz
From Missouri to Canada, I be keepin' the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous
Killa Kaz'll fuck anybody, Tech is calamitous
Leave 'em in the dust, anybody, Tech when I'm standin' up

Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with' it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinkin' he can give it the Poe and toss it Picasso
Killin' everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the convo' when I go

What if I ran into you with' a Pogo stick?
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness?
With' a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more tracks like I was playin' Hamlet?
Syllable burnin', that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peelin' pecans
But instead, I'm peelin' rappers' heads, makin' a sam-a-wich
Pick up a twenty two
And put a bullet inside a motherfucker
From a side of a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make 'em feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feelin' rebuffed, like you had dead shots
When I hopped on the fuckin' beat and I worldwide chopped
When I fuck with' Tech N9ne, with the piranhas
I smoke a beat with' Mr. Busta Rhymes, well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with' the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go

And I said that with no shame
I was lit up like propane, tripping over this dope strain
Gary say, ""do you think the Cavi is mixed with cocaine?""
I don't know, I don't know
All I know is that it's super fire when I blow
He said thanks for the dough
I said, ""have a good show"" I was on one and I hope he didn't know

Yeah, that's some good weed
You could tell by the look on my face
Ain't no way to hide that I smoke

Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir bak jak
Burada mikrofonuna tak kagit
Kalem bir de ilham alinacak gam gaz choppers,
Havada düsman avina çikalim akalim, haydi bu battle'i kazanalim

(We started in the Midwest)
(Now we 'bout to take it)
(All over the world, baby!)
(This is the pinnacle!)
(Yeah, Tech N9ne!)

Follow me, all around the planet, I run the game with no Sickology
They could never manage, we do damage with' no apology
Pick 'em out the panic, a little manic 'cause I gotta be
Frantic, I'ma jam it 'cause I'm an oddity
Down for the trackin' like I'm grabbin' at my binoculars
I could pop at you, papa, 'cause I'm partners with' Waka Flocka
Gimme the top of hip-hop and watch 'I'm make 'em rock
With a show-stopper, chakras poppin' off the (Worldwide Choppers)

If you anybody, you notice it
Take as the pinnacle, now the ideal nickel solos it
Little coders to pull again, wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo, when it exposed, the flow be hold it, 'cause when that motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the rear
Better to get just near the mirror, ready to get near my heels
Gimme the knock and I'ma chop it, he came and it went tomorrow
But I'ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas

Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trippin' when I rip it, I be the X when I split 'em up
Sorta like I was liquored up and backin' up in the cup
Everybody be knowin' I be actin' up when I buzz
From Missouri to Canada, I be keepin' the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous
Killa Kaz'll fuck anybody, Tech is calamitous
Leave 'em in the dust, anybody, Tech when I'm standin' up

Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with' it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinkin' he can give it the Poe and toss it Picasso
Killin' everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the convo' when I go

I'm light years

Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

Check it, I'm ahead of 'em, chop it up with the veteran

Gotta notice an elephant, none of you niggas relevant

What if I ran into you with' a Pogo stick?
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness?
With' a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more tracks like I was playin' Hamlet?
Syllable burnin', that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peelin' pecans
But instead, I'm peelin' rappers' heads, makin' a sam-a-wich
Pick up a twenty two
And put a bullet inside a motherfucker
From a side of a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make 'em feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feelin' rebuffed, like you had dead shots
When I hopped on the fuckin' beat and I worldwide chopped
When I fuck with' Tech N9ne, with the piranhas
I smoke a beat with' Mr. Busta Rhymes, well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with' the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats

Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm
Or loosen the venom and hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'ma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies 'cause of cannibalism
Breakin' 'em off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible 'cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then ya best pick a better habit
'Cause I'm an anomaly, able to give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challengin' my astronomy
Hoppin' out, I don't stop when the flame stone
Now one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwin' it up in the air, takin' it there
We W-W-C, if you can't keep up, shoulda stayed home
My-my-my alien knowledge be makin' other astronomers
Welcome to Los Angeles, a discovery of palentology
So play me and I'ma be shinin' on them haters
I'm finna be usin' it as energy, watch how radiant I'ma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die

See how they ask when I'ma stomp on my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it, and what I'ma drop on my dude
Inevitably, instead I'ma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask ""What in the world is you provin'?
What, when you already the best? And what the hell is he doin'?""
Well, I'ma be choppin' and cuttin' and breakin' and beatin' and shakin'
And fuckin' everything up 'til there ain't no further mistakin'
And bustin' everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shuttin' everything up, 'specially the ones who be hatin'
They lovin' everything until I got 'em stutterin' stupid
You hear 'em now? ""D-d-d-d-don't do-do-do-do it!
P-P-P-Please? Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us?
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest!""
And now I'ma come and kill 'em, get 'em, hit 'em, and finish 'em
And bang 'em in the head and diminish 'em, and then I'll
Hit 'em again at a minimum, repeat comin' to kill 'em
Then he be gotta be drillin' 'em, thinkin' ""They gotta be feelin' 'I'm!""
Spittin' lithium, see the way a nigga be spillin' 'em?
And gettin' 'em stupid to the point where there's no forgivin' 'I'm?
Hopin' you're listenin' and you're payin' attention
And you're witnessin' the way that I be crushin' on the mic
And gettin' in the zone, I be flattenin' and packin' in

I wanna knuckle up, and beat em, I'm antsy
King of the jungle, I beat a chimpanzee
I never gave a single fuck on a man, see
Never ran the city of Kansas banshee
But I been around her a minute and then I did it all I may not been all around the planet
 And then I’m finna show em how ya make a novelty pop
When he go choppin' he’s as hot as you can possibly stand it but wait
Number one draft pick on Speedom, beat 'em
Niggas get they ass kicked when I see em we dumb
Get em in they plastic when I read 'em, keyed em
Sick of wack whack shit cried freedom, freedom
Thinking of mashed potatoes at night baby sick and I pass -aby maybe sipping on gas 
And they paid us delight
I might be giving a bath to my label, finger to my cable TV Kali Baby
And I’m ready to fight an orangutan

Oh, let 'em out, let 'em out
Animal and he's circling about
Keep us free and it won't come out the mouth
Monkey do, monkey see, it's about to go south
He never did no harm to me
Like he could free easily
Enough to make your heart go bad
Ferocious orangutan

No killing what can't be killed

Get off the dick of a nigga bigger than you
Getting money to hand me
You don't know me, I pull up on the sansby
Pull out the jimmy, put it right where their hand be
Guns is handy, big as Michael Alig with candy
Can't stand me, plan to can me, dick damn (But I rock)
Holler if you find a nigga better, pull a hammy sammy be bout them fans but (he not)
Selling out to get a little cheddar in my land, a hand only that that man (and he drop)
And figure out what the eleventh letter is fam and animals is stand on (that Glock)
And cut the head off every little keffer
Black dynamite I’m running thangs, I don’t bang 
But I got love from here to Inglewood to the Hunnidgang
So that mean that I can hunt ya if I wantcha get a bunch of mandingos, amigos with gringos
If ya know me then ya know I gotta make feet step to the beat of my own damn drum
On some grown man stuff, never weak cause I beat you to the fleet all along ran come
Get ya funk ass up, get my secretary thirty dollars and I’m hallow I’m living in the dirty water

It's W-T-F ever whenever they wanted you to edit in
Don't really matter what I say or what I be on
They knowing they can take it to infinity and beyond
They prayin' on my death, hoping that it wouldn't be long
But it could take an eon, no B-S so we gone

But we on speed, you couldn't get a lead on
I keep calm, rap fast and feast on
I heard, everybody gotta play the fool
In the jungle, nobody safe from the chain of food - you dig?
And I been cooking in the kitchen waiting on a couple things
That didn't come to fruition that we're doing this spring
You wouldn't think that rappers are really bitches
Strip 'em of all their riches and see what they can do in the ring
Scooby is big if you can consider both of us represent for the middle
Keep it Strange and doing it big
You be the king, orangutan, usually
Hanging, one-handed, from a branch where you couldn't swing
Ha, and the view is insane
You never see it but believe it's a beautiful thing
I sped up speed, you seen I make it sin upstream

Evolution is saying I come from monkeys
I don't know but what I do know is people get super jumpy
In every part of the country, they look at a nigga funky
Like I'm an alien baby and I get 'em all really grumpy
When I spit it, they don't want to admit it, but I shit it
Whenever I get to pivot up on the mic and I lit it
I get 'em livid, I do the impossible, fuck a critic
I tell 'em to kid-iss my did-dick you bid-itch

Come and witness the animals on exhibit
We taking over the planet and all of the outer limits
They hand me they will and really ain't gotta be reinvented
With the pen and some picture being plotted
You couldn't mimic
I'm p-equitable, service I'm in a tin and let him out like Krizz
Hanging off of the tree, but I'm hanging
Chest banging indestructable
Diamonds on display and see us swinging
On the monkey bars, who let an orangutan in?

Hongo, banging on the bass of the bongos
Even the Congo strapped up with a longbow
Soon as we get to rockin', I be up in the Times bro
'Cause I'm an animal, happy to damage the stronghold
Why you gotta be knocking the ooo-wee switch?
We get it poppin', more than often and you do eat shit
Hit the drop and motherfuckers chop-suey prick
This our planet goddammit, King Louie, bitch

Somebody better tell 'em watch the throne
I come outta nowhere with a knockout like Holly Holm
You on top now, not for long
The name's Strange, rang bells worldwide
But you hardly known
I'm balling on 'em like I'm Karl Malone
My swisher looking like a waffle cone
But know my homies know I came to drain
These rappers thinking we the same, we ain't
I might jack the track while you just back up
