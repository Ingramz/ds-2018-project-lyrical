Jimmy Raney,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2005
Jimmy Raney,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad

Jimmy Raney,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty",You Are Too Beautiful,2005
Jimmy Raney,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love [Live],2007
Jimmy Raney,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On,2013
Jimmy Raney Quartet,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Jimmy Raney Trio,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1990
Jimmy Raney Trio,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away

And now that dream is here beside me

Was you",Long Ago (And Far Away),1990
Jimmy Raney Trio,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1990
Jimmy Raney Trio,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2000
Jimmy Raney Trio,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,2000
Jimmy Raney Trio,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,2000
Jimmy Rankin,"I followed her around
I was quite naïve
Holes in my soul
I wore my heart upon my sleeve
Down that winding country road
Despite the stories I'd been told
Now I don't go in to town
Since I followed her around

I stood and watched in disbelief
From the shadows of my grief
She wore lipstick black as coal
And her boots up to her knees
How could I even speak my mind
All the boys were making time
I bowed my head without a sound
Since I followed her around

Everybody's got a hunger
And a seed they gotta sow
I should have listened to my mother
When she cried no, child no
Son get your feet back on the ground
Don't go follow her around

I watched her from afar
That pretty flower in mid bloom
Oh how that girl could work a bar
As she waltzed around the room
I couldn't take it anymore
Tried to get her out the door
One more time she shot me down
Since I followed her around

Everybody's got a hunger
And a seed they gotta sow
I should have listened to my mother
When she cried no, child no
Son get your feet back on the ground
Don't go follow her around

Now I'm old and wise
Still got that sparkle in my eyes
All my kids have come and gone
All except my youngest son
It was just the other day
I swore I heard him say
Dad I'm heading in to town
I think he follows her around
Dad I'm heading in to town
I think he follows her around
Dad I'm rolling in to town
I think he follows her around",Followed Her Around,2001

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.

Oh, I had a love, a true love and I lost it

I believe that I should know
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to make her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
Think it over

Don't take for granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mumbling word
But she's got to know that her voice is heard
Oh, I had a love, it was a true love and I lost it
Now I'm suffering all this pain that the true love cost me

And maybe you've got eyes to keep her

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1981

It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven,1993

You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1991

Just friends, but not like before

Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1992

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Jimmy Rushing,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes

I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance

When I know that you can guess?,""

Jimmy Rushing,"I can still remember
When I bought my first guitar
Remember just how good the feeling
To put it proudly in my car
And my family listened fifty times
To my two song repertoire
I told my mom
Her only son was gonna be a star
Bought all the Beatles records
I sounded just like Paul
I bought all the old Chuck Berry's - 78's and all
I sat by my record player
Playing every note they played
I watched them all on TV
Making every move they made

Rock and roll, I gave you all
The best years of my life
All the dreamy sunny Sundays 
All the moonlit summer nights
I was so busy in the backroom
Writing love songs to you
While you were changing your direction
And you never even knew
That I was always just one step behind you

Sixty-six seemed like the year
I was really going somewhere
We were living in San Francisco
With flowers in our hair
Singing songs of kindness
So the world would understand
To the guys and me you were something more
Than just another band
 
And then sixty-nine in LA
Came around so soon
We were really making headway 
And writing lots of tunes
And we must have played
The wildest stuff that we had ever played
And the way the crowds cried out for us
We thought we had it made

Rock and roll, I gave you all
The best years of my life
All the crazy, lazy, young days 
All the magic moon at night
I was so busy on the road
Singing love songs to you
While you were changing your direction
And you never even knew
That I was always just one step behind you

Seventy-one and so alone 
When I met Susanne
I was trying to go it solo
With someone else's band
She came up to me later
And I took her by the hand
And I told her all my troubles
And she seemed to understand

And she followed me to London 
Through a hundred hotel rooms
Through a hundred record companies 
Who didn't like my tunes
She followed me when finally 
I sold my old guitar
She tried to help me
Understand I'd never be a star

Rock and roll, I gave you
All the best years of my life
All the dreamy, sunny Sundays
All the moonlit summer nights
And though I never knew
The magic of making it with you
That I thank the Lord for giving me
The little bit I knew
And I was always just one step behind you",Rock and Roll,1999

For the moon refused to shine. 
Couple sitting underneath a willow tree, 
For love they did pine, 
Little maid was kinda 'fraid of darkness 
So she said, ""I guess I'll go."" 
Boy began to sigh, looked up at the sky, 
Told the moon his little tale of woe: 

""oh, shine on, shine on harvest moon up in the sky. 
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July 
Snowtime ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon, 
So shine on, shine on harvest moon, for me and my gal!"" 

I can't see why a boy should sigh, 
When by his side is the girl he loves so true, 
All he has to say is: 
""Won't you be my bride, 
For I love you, 
Why should I be telling you this secret, 
When I know that you can guess?,"" 
Harvest moon will smile, 
Shine on all the while, 
If the little girl should answer ""yes.""

How could he do it, why should he do it

How can you ask me am I blue

Done fell through

That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North Carolina
And a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

That's why it seems like a dream
Got me hypnotized
And I know that's right

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
'Cause what matters most is the feeling
You get when you're hypnotized

 About what I just have to learn to do
 But imagine the nerve of God
 Letting me let you in
 And I thought I could let you go in grace
 I've gotta think again

 Because right now I would be bought and sold
 To see your face somewhere
 I would sell your sweet soul
 Just to touch your crazy black gold hair

 I saw heaven in your eyes

And yet she cannot choose but labours on;
Her mighty heart forbids her to desist

Hunts for the perfect word, the perfect shape

Leaving me a song that will not die

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1957

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer

More of your kind

Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1957

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Something in your eyes I see

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

To keep love and romance forever alive

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face

And I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me
An overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones

Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy
She said

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I thought to myself what could that mean
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream
Now, wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one more time:

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake cake, cake cake
Uh I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

Yeah, uh, look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferrari's all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg",Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2,2013
Jimmy Smith,"Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Jimmy Smith,"I never know, what you're gonna do
You're always so far away

Down below, you used to tell the truth
Now, you're lookin' for something to say
You give me those eyes
And then look away

Do you want me down on my knees?
Are you livin' a lie?
Is this some kind of game
Baby, won't you tell me please?

Give me one good reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

Who do you love? What makes you happen
What do you need for satisfaction
Who do you love? I need an answer
Is it just about a good time, good time
Who do you love?

I wish you'd lie or tell me the truth
So I can decide for myself
Maybe you've tried what we used to do
With somebody, somewhere else

Give me one reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Home Cookin' (aka One for Philly Joe),2018

Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Ought to be right

I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Falling in love
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

I defy anyone who claims
That I didn't control
Whatever moved
In my soul

I could touch, touch delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing

To tell the world I've found love and what it means to me
But all around there's violence and laws to make me think again

There's more to love than boy meets girl

There's more to love than boy meets girl

Through time they've always tried to hide and cast aside this love denied
In the shadows we held each other tight

Made it all so very real.

And check my masculinity

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Well once upon a time there lived a couple as fat as they could be
So what they did was get together and started a family tree
Well year by year the tree did grow
They might've been fat, but they wasn't slow
And now they're known as the Bubble Bunch

The disco bug bit the Bubble Bunch
I heard one Bubble to another Bubble say
""I've been bit before, but never this way""
So later that night they all got dressed
The Bubble Bunch put on their Sunday best
And three of them decided to go
Where Super Rhymes rocked the disco
Well on my way to the jam to rock the beat

Jimmy Spicer,"Rhymes faster than a speeding bullet
Has more rhymes than a train has tracks
Able to leap sucker MC's in a single rhyme
Look, at the jam, on the mike
(It's a bird!)
(It's a plane!)
No
I'm Su...Su...Super Rhymes
(Rhymes)
(Rhymes)
(Rhymes)...

It's the new thing, makes you want to swing
While us MC's rap, doin' our thing
It's not singin', like it used to be
No, it's rappin' to the rhythm of the sure shot beat
It goes one for the money, two for the show
You got my beat, now here I go
You see, this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hiddip, the hop, ya just don't stop
You rock to the beat till it makes you drop

Yes, I'm one of a kind, I'm Super Rhymes
And I'd like to say hello
And since I'm on the mic and I'm ready to rock
This is how it goes
Yes, I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-a-dang
Baby, I'll ring your bell
Yes, I'm Super Rhymes, I'm 22
I'm gonna be 100 before I'm through

Because no, I didn't come from the planet Earth
Planet Rhymeon is my place of birth
From the day I came out my mother's womb
I found myself in the operating room
Then the doctor spanked me on my behind
I didn't cry, the kid started to rhyme
My mother said, ""Son, that's the way it should be
Your name is Super Rhymes, you'll be an MC""
So then my father put me on a meteorite
Sent me to Earth to rock the mike
I got to Earth and started layin' it down
At the jam, on the mike, I could be found

While I was at the jam this one time
Rockin' to the beat, said I'm feelin' fine
Just freakin' out on a freak's behind
I looked in the face of Frankenstein
I said, ""No, no, she's not mine""
Because my woman is fine as wine
And she goes by the name of Louis Line
But she didn't come here with me this time
I'm feeling real sad, but not that bad
I'ma have to run away from this crowdad
I ran to the deejay to rock the mike
He said, ""Super Rhymes, take it, do what you like""
So I rocked the party viciously

This guy I didn't know, walked up to me
But the closer he got, the more I could tell
It was the man they call Howard Cosell
The guy you'd see on KBC
While Joe Frazier boxed Muhammad Ali
He said, ""Excuse me, sir, are you Super Rhymes?
The one with the fine woman Louis Line?""
I said, ""I am, will I be on TV?
Like to float like a butterfly stingin' Ali
He said, ""Yes, my man, if you show me you can
I was told you had the masterplan""
So I rocked the mike for Howard Cosell
To show America how I rocked so well

And while I rocked the mike, this is what I said
About Dracula, the living dead
He didn't like blood, not this vampire
The disco beat was his desire
Transylvania's where he made home
Until one day he decided to roam
And then out of the crib he did crawl
Count Dracula is what he's called
He said, ""The sun's gone down, and now it's night
I'm goin' to spread my wings and take a serious flight
I turned into a bat, I flew away

I said at the disco is where I gotta stay
Because back home, there was nothing like this
In Transylvania this is what I'd miss
They just bite necks and suck blood all day
But I know there had to be a better way
I parked my car, sun set, ""Vampires, I am leaving""
So I turned into a bat and cut out that evening
The first disco I hit was 54
They didn't even want to let me in the door
I said, ""Listen, my man, I am a real cool guy
I can turn into a bat, I can even fly""
He said, ""Dracula, you can do all of that
Then come on in and catch a neat freak attack""
So I went inside and I started to dance
And had all the ladies waitin' for their chance
They said, ""Isn't he cool with his widow's peak""
And the strange way he does the Freak
He said, ""Where I come from it's not called the 'Freak'
It's the Transylvanian Boogie, seven days a week""
I didn't get to dance with them all that night
Cause at the break of dawn I saw sunlight
I said, ""I'm sorry to say I cannot stay""
Cause us vampires must be in before it turns day
But don't forget, I'll be back

I like it when I catch a neat freak attack
And since you heard my story, it's time I be leaving
In Transylvania we say ""good evening""
Mr. Cosell said, ""Damn, that's good
You'll be on TV in every neighborhood""
He said, ""Super Rhymes, you're a real MC
We must put you on KBC""
I said, ""I'll dress to impress, won't claim I'm best
I'll come a little better than all the rest""
Because I never come with any less
Than all the rhymes that will pass the test
Because I'm cool as ice, I'm twice as nice
I never had an off-day in my life
You see, I take all your money, bust out your wife
Make you dance to my beat all your life
Cause when I get in my stuff and I start to rhyme
The sucker MC's hide every time
Because my voice is baritone
And I really don't need no microphone
But I use one anyway
To make sure the ladies hear what I say
And from here to there they hear my voice
The ladies hear me, I am their choice
Because my hair's more wavy than there's ships in the Navy
And they use a boat to stay afloat
To put hickeys all over my throat
Because I am so coooool...

Because I'm cool as snow, I'm like savoir-faire
I'm the man you can't find anywhere
Because I'm cooler than cold, I'm hotter than heat
I rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Because I got what it takes
To make everybody want to break
You see I gotta what it take
I take it, make you want to break
Breaker 1 (breaker 1) breaker 2 (breaker 2)
I say this is what I want to say to all of you
Go and telephone, or tell a friend
The man known as Super Rhymes is back again
And all you fly guys, I tell you this
I take your fly girls with one kiss
Because I take the fly girls, put em in check
I got my love potion all around they neck
They've heard my voice and they know my name
They know within me there burns a flame
That I'm MC man, headed straight for fame

I got a Coupe DeVille, diamond rings
I even got fur coats and gold plate things
Cause I'm the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
The ladies know I'm the man with the power
And now that you know a little more about me
This is how I rocked KBC
You see, deep in the desert, the city Bagdhad
Aladdin was the boy, a magic lamp he had
Aladdin was to rub it and soon find out
That the lamp had magic and a genie, no doubt
He rubbed the lamp, a genie appeared
But you really couldn't see him till the green smoke cleared
Well, the smoke was gone, and there he stood
The tallest damn cat in the neighborhood

He said, ""Where I come from I committed a crime
For every little thing you must serve time
But if my lamp was rubbed I'd be set free
But otherwise within the lamp I stay eternally
And Aladdin, I say thanks to you
You rubbed my lamp, now my sentence is through
And Aladdin, your wish is my command
I'm sorry, but you only get three, my man""
He said, ""Genie, my first wish would be
To go to the year 1980""
""Hocus pocus,"" said the genie, ""I'll do that""
Aladdin looked around, saw where he was at
He said, ""Damn, things aren't the same
I wonder if Aladdin is still my name
But it's nice to be in '80
And I gotta say thanks to you, genie""

He said, ""There's nothin' to it, I used to do it just about everyday
Until I went to court, I got put in the lamp and the judge to take the spell away
But then you came along, made right my wrong
You rubbed my lamp and you set me free""
He said, ""You used one wish, and you got two left
Aladdin, tell me what's it gonna be?""
He said, ""Genie, in this society
You must have the green stuff called money""
So ""hocus pocus"" said the genie, ""here's a million bucks
You take it all with you, here's an armored truck""
""Thanks,"" said Aladdin, ""Genie, you're a real champ
But for a little while get back in your lamp""
The genie said, ""Aladdin, yes, I'll do that
But you got another wish, now I'll be back""
So with a puff and smoke the genie was gone
Aladdin said, ""A new millionaire is born""
Well, with all that money he made more money, Aladdin was doin' swell

You see, my man Aladdin he got smart, you see, invested money into an oil well
But then one day he said, ""I'm tired of makin' the desert scene""
He said, ""I gotta get away, I gotta go to the disco, find the freak of my dream""
So he took control of his private jet
His magic lamp and money he could not forget
Yes, he got to the disco, danced and screamed
But still couldn't find the freak of his dream
But then she came, through the door
The baddest freak Aladdin said he ever saw
He said, ""Wow! I gotta get that girl!
Her love is worth everything in the world""
She was a 38-24-35

Aladdin was attracted like a bee to a hive
Aladdin walked up, said, ""Hello""
She looked him up and down and said, ""You know where you can go""
He said, ""Come on, baby, don't play no game
I'm called Aladdin, tell me what's your name?""
Well, out of all the things Aladdin tried
She said, ""Listen, sucker, take a carpet ride""
Aladdin said, ""I know what to do
I call on my genie with a spell for you
So then he rubbed the lamp, the genie came back out
The genie said, ""Aladdin, what you're fussin' about""
He said, ""Genie, I rocked, I said I'd be her man
I tried to do it to her cause I thought I can
It was then that I met this girl
Who said she wouldn't freak me for nothin' in the world""
Out of all the things that Aladdin thought
She stole him a body, just couldn't be bought
So Aladdin said 450

I know you're comin' to this bank with me
But the freak told him no
And my main man Aladdin, he told her so
He said, ""I grab my partner do-si-do
I spank her to the beat, but don't let go
Until I hear her holler 'yo, yo'""
To the beat, beat, check it out
The genie said, ""Aladdin, I agree
This freak has got a vicious body
But that wish will be your last one
After I do, my job is done""
The genie said, ""Your wish is my command
She'll be your girl, you'll be her man
So he crossed his arms, said a magic word
A 'hocus pocus' is what you heard
He said, ""Aladdin, she belongs to you
Take her home and do what you want to do
But now it's time that I leave

I pull my magic carpet down out my sleeve
I'm gonna climb aboard, I'm gonna fly away
Back to Bagdhad, that's where I'll stay""
So Aladdin looked up, said goodbye
He watched the magic carpet and the genie fly
Now this is the end of this little tale
It's time I keep rockin', the genie's out of jail
So when I say 'rock', you say 'roll'
When I say 'ice', then you say 'cold'
Then when I say 'disco', you say 'the beat'
I say 'it's like honey', then you say 'it's sweet'

I say rock - roll
Say ice - cold
Say disco - the beat
Like honey - it's sweet
Now you know my name, you know my game
Compared to me there's none the same
Because I got a funky groove, I'm gonna make your body move
Because I gotta what it take
I take it, make you want to break
Breaker 1 (breaker 1) breaker 2 (breaker 2)
I said you heard my jam, now catch the boogaloo flu
Cause I'm Super Ryhmes with disco
I rock from here to Frisco
I make you hate your video
While I rock your mind in stereo
So kick off your shoes, relax your feet
You're gonna move to my beat, it sound so sweet

Because it's all of you I do adore
And I got so much and more in store
Cause all through the day, through the night
I sit down and new rhymes I write
Because this deejay, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hiddip, the hop, you just don't stop
You bop to the beat till it makes your drop
Because I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-a-ding-dang-a-ding-ding-dong
Baby, I ring your bell
Because I ROCK and ROLL
In stere-ere-o
I rock and roll
In stere-ere-o

Like Fred Flintstone, said, a-yabadabado
You hear my jam, want to yell it too
Because I got more rhymes than a clock chimes
I got more rhymes than a monkey climbs
I got more rhymes than a lemon in limes
And I got more rhymes than a bank got dimes
So freak it to the east, freak it to the west
I freak it to the girl with the biggest chest
Freak it to the west, then you freak it to the east
But you never freak out with an ugly beast
So young ladies in the '80s
Come and ride in my Mercedes

'Cause the ladies see they all must stare
Because I got brown eyes and a wavy hair
I'm not so tall, but I'm not so short
And you young ladies are my favorite sport
So put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
You put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
Then scream: oh yeah (oh yeah) oh what? (oh yeah!)
y'all, I'm leavin' now, but I'll be back
To make the young ladies catch a neat freak attack
Yes, the time has come for me to leave the mike
But I'll be back with more of what you like
So, take a trip",Adventures of Super Rhymes,2008

When brother-in-law called me on the phone
He said Son, let's you and me go steppin' out
I found a place the girls know nothing about
Well, I knew when we crossed that county line
We're in the wrong place at the wrong time

A mountain of a man was takin' money outside
I saw a line of Harley's and some four-wheel drives
I said brother-in-law, I think we better steer clear
Don't tell me that you really want to go in here
I ain't a fortune teller, but I kinda got a vibe
We're in the wrong place at the wrong time

Wrong place, wrong time
Lord, I must be outta my mind
If we ever get out of this place with our lives
What in the world 'we gonna tell our wives

I was mindin' my business sittin' on a stool
Brother-in-law was actin' like a fool
He had a tattooed lady out on the dance floor
And they were doin' a dance I'd never seen before
Then the bartender said that's the bouncer's wife
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time

Wrong place, wrong time
Lord, I must be outta my mind
If we ever get out of this place with our lives
What in the world 'we gonna tell our wives

That mountain of a man came runnin' inside
The tattooed lady pulled a switch-blade knife
I thought Lord have mercy, we've reached the end
When the local police came and hauled us in

We were standing there in front of that night court judge
There was sixteen dollars between the two of us
I said judge I'd rather spend my life in jail
Then to have to call home to make my bail
He said four hundred dollars and you're gonna pay the fine
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time

Jimmy Sturr,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.",City of New Orleans [Polka],2002
Jimmy Sturr,"The devil went down to Scunthorpe
Looking for a soul to steal
In a bind and way behind
He was willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Pickin' on a guitar, playing it hot
And the devil jumped on a hickory stump
And said I'll tell ya what

I guess you didn't know it
I'm a guitar player too
And if you care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a real good guitar boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a guitar of gold to get your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you

The boy said my name's Johnny, it might be a sin
I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret
I'm the best that's ever been

Johnny resin up your pick
And play your guitar hard
'Cause hell is here in Scunthorpe
And the devil deals the cards
Now if you win you'll get
This shinny guitar made of gold
But if you loose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And said I'll start this gig
And fire flew from his finger tips
As he resined up his pick
He strummed the pick across the strings
It made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
Let me show you how it's done

Fire on the mountain run boys run
Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Ready says you don't fight, no child, no
Let's go

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
He laid that golden guitar
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said Devil come on back 
If you ever want to try again
I told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best I've ever been

Fire on the mountain run boys run
Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Ready says you don't fight, no child, no
Let's go",The Devil Went Down to Georgia [Polka],2002
Jimmy Sturr,"This land is your land, this land is my land
From the California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
And saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me

I roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me , a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

When the sun comes shining, then I was strolling
In the wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land and this land is my land
From the California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

When the sun comes shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
The voice come chanting as the fog was lifting
This land was made for you and me",This Land Is Your Land [Polka],2002
Jimmy Sturr,"I'm walkin', yes indeed, and I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me (yes)
I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin' for your company
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
What 'ya gonna do when the well runs dry?
You're gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side, for you pretty baby I'll even die
I'm walkin', yes indeed, I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
 
I'm walkin', yes indeed, and I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me (yes)
I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin' for your company
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
What 'ya gonna do when the well runs dry?
You're gonna sit right down and cry  
What 'ya gonna do when I say ""bye-bye""? 
All you're gonna do is dry your eye
I'm walkin', yes indeed, I'm talkin' 'bout you and me

Jimmy Sturr,"Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Someday, I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Please don't make me dream alone
I beg you don't make me dream alone
No, I don't wanna dream",Dream Lover,2004
Jimmy Sturr,"Well she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now

And she'll have fun fun fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away)

Well the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
(You walk like an ace now you walk like an ace)

But she leads them on a wild goose chase now
