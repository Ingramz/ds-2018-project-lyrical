Shirley Bassey,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love,1989
Shirley Bassey,"Please please play my music for me,
I'm not sure of the words yet;
Huh, I'm not sure of anything!

Life is very rough and tumble for a humble siseuse;
One can betray one's troubles never, whatever occurs!
Night after night,
Have to be bright,
Whether you're well or ill;
The people have to laugh their fill,
You mustn't sleep till dawn comes creeping.

Though I never really grumble,
Life's a jumble indeed!
And in my efforts to succeed
I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.
Heigh ho!
If love were all I should be lonely!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,
Heigh ho!
If love were all!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think, I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But, ah-ha, I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,
Heigh ho!
If love were all!",If Love Were All [From Bitter Sweet],1989
Shirley Bassey,"The Liquidator 
Will soon be coming around
You won't feel safer 
Until you get out of town
He's an eraser 
He'll rub you out like a light
And for a chaser 
He'll kiss your woman good-night
He's a jackal and a Romeo, you know 
The devil in disguise
There's no telling where a girl would go, you know 
To gaze into his eyes
With the snapping of the fingertips of him 
He'll take your life away
And a whisper from the smiling lips of him 
Will take your wife away
The Liquidator 
Will soon be getting to you
You'll wake up later 
Somewhere up in the blue
The undertaker 
Would never try to deny
That the Liquidator 
Is a hell of a guy

I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Shirley Bassey,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1989
Shirley Bassey,"People,
People who need people,
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people 
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people.

Though life is empty since you have gone. 
You're always on my mind, though out of sight, 
It's lonesome through the day, 
But oh! the night. 
I cry my heart out, it's bound to break, 
Since nothing matters, let it break.

What's to become of it,

Shirley Bassey,"What now my love?
Now that you've left me
How can I live through another day?
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal

I walk the night without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul

What now my love?
Now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars, tumbling around me
There's the sky where the sea should be

What now my love?
Now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on

Where have you gone without me

I can't believe we're parted
Where are you

When we said good-bye love
What had we to gain
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain

Why can't I simply close my eyes, go to sleep

Why must I always hear 
Dio come ti-amo

Oh god how much I love you 
It still runs through my head 
The wind began to blow 
And all the leaves were flying 
He stood there in the night 
And tried to keep from crying 

What could I have told him 
What could I say of you 
When love has lost it's meaning 
It's over, it's through 
And so I hurried on 
For someone new was waiting 
To hold me in his arms 
In endless celebrating

And many loves have I 
But only one was real 
And that I let slip by 
Dio come ti-amo

Yet I walked away 
I know, it's much too late 
But I go right on praying 
To have you back again

Beautiful to my eyes
From the moment I saw him 
The sun filled the sky
He was so, so beautiful 
Beautiful just to hold

Winter was cold
How could I tell him 
What I so clearly could see
Though I longed for him 
Another ...
Trusted me completely, so I never could be free
It was beautiful 
Knowing now that he cares
I will always remember moments we shared

How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?

How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year

And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,

Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.

Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.

Shirley Bassey,"Yesterday when I was young
the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish g ame,
the way the evening breeze may tease a candle fl ame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
and only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday when I was young
so many drinking songs were waiting to be sung,
so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
and every conversation I can now recall
concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue
and every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died.
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
and only I am left on stage to end the play.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.",Yesterday,1991

That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it

Mere alcohol
Doesn't thrill me at all

I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me

Then you might as well take the sun away

And the moon stood still for the night birds' song 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 
But if you stay, I'll make you a day

We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain

Then if you go, I'll understand 
Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 
If you go away, as I know you will 
You must tell the world to stop turning till 
You return again, if you ever do 
For what good is love without loving you 
Can I tell you now as you turn to go 
I'll be dying slowly till the next hello 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 
But if you stay I'll make you a night 
Like no night has been or will be again 
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch 
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much 
But if you go I won't cry 
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 
If you go away as I know you must 
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust 
Just an empty room full of empty space 
Like the empty look I see on your face

I teased at life as if it were a foolish g ame,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle fl ame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if itwere a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died.
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.","Yesterday, When I Was Young",1995

Wouldn't you like to have fun, fun, fun 
How's about a few laughs, laughs
I could show you a good time 
Let me show you a good time! 

The minute you walked in the joint 
I could see you were a man of distinction 
A real big spender 
Good lookin' so refined 
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's goin' on in my mind? 
So let me get right to the point, 
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see

Shirley Bassey,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young, and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning 'til
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello?
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go! I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away",If You Go Away (Ne Me Quitte Pas) [DJ Skymoo Mix],1995

Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

Shirley Bassey,"How insensitive I must have seemed
When she told me that she loved me
How unmoved and cold I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely

Why, she must have asked, did I just turn
And stare in icy silence?
What was I to say? What can you say
When a love affair is over?

Now she's gone away and I'm alone
With the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad, I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look

How, she must have asked, could I just turn
And stare in icy silence?
What was I to do? What can one do
When a love affair is over?

Shirley Bassey,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.

And not the words of one who kneels.

I took the blows - 
And did it my way!",My Way,1999

That lived within the heart of me

Became impatient to be free

Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,1999

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made

Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone

I hear it still, I always will

How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had

Looking through my tears,

Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar

Though the good is gone from the word goodbye

Lions in the zoo
All were jealous of Johnny's big trill.
Thunder claps stopped clappin',
Traffic ceased its roar,
And they tell us Niagara stood still!

Boat whistles,
Steam whistles,
Cop whistles;
All whistles bowed to his skill!

But the thoughts we used to share 

Now I keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you 
Not thinking you were gone
Then it felt so strange to lie awake alone 

No regrets 
No tears, goodbye 
Don't want you back 
We'd only cry again 

Say goodbye again 
All friends have tried to turn my nights to day 
Strange faces in your place 
Can't keep the goss away

But just beyond the darkest hour 
Just behind the dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone 
No regrets 

No tears, goodbye 
Don't want you back 
We'd only cry again 
Say goodbye again",No Regrets [Live][#],2000
Shirley Bassey,"Time and again I've longed for adventure,
Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure,
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights a star,

And some day I'll know that moment divine,

As if I could forget!
And we were lovers
The moment that we met!
And we would wander,
Content to wander,
Through the golden Summer,
With nothing to regret.

That moment in our lives,
And through my sadness
That happiness survives!
And I'll remember,
As the tears go by,
Till the day I die,

Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free

were all the years I had with you

I would give anything I own,
Give up me life, my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own,
just to have you back again.

You taught me how to love,
What its of, what its of.
You never said too much,
but still you showed the way,
and I knew from watching you.
Nobody else could ever know
the part of me that can't let go.

you're loving them so,
but taking them all for granted.

A room is a still a room, even when there's nothin' there but gloom

And one of us has a broken heart

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends, it ends in tears

I've had every accolade bestowed on me

It wouldn't bother me

If I never sing another song 
Or take another bow 
I would get by, but I'm not sure how 

Always posing, but you love it all 
Though you have to learn to act like you're above it all 
Everything I did the world applauded

Got a scrapbook full of quotes, I can recall them all

And the note he sang was this: aaaahh 
Poor Johnny One Note 

Sang out with Gusto 
And just overloaded the place
Poor Johnny One Note 
Yelled willy-nilly 
Until he was blue in the face
For holding one note was his ace 
Couldn't hear the brass 
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class 
By himself, by gum
Poor Johnny One Note 

Got in Aida indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note 
Howled like the North Wind 
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned round in his grave 
Couldn't hear the flute 

Or the big trombone
Everyone was mute 
Johnny stood alone
Cats and dogs stopped yapping 
Lions in the zoo 
Were all jealous of Johnny's big thrill
Thunderclaps stopped clapping 
Traffic ceased its roar 
And they tell us Niag'ra stood still
He stopped the trainwistles 
Boatwhistles 
Steamwhistles 
Copwhistles
All whistles bowed to his skill

Much wiser since my goodbye to you,
I've traveled the world to learn,
I must return from Russia with love.

Still my tongue tied, young pride
Would not let my love for you show

I suddenly knew you'd care again

Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight

The way that you hold me whenever you hold me

He acts while other men just talk

So he strikes, like thunderball

His needs are more, so he gives less
They call him the winner who takes all
And he strikes, like thunderball

His fight goes on and on and on

That I don't do anymore
We grow out of things
Each day is different than the day before
And yet to love you
I just have to breathe

There are needs we have when we are young
And discard as we mature
Time can change so much
The only certain thing is nothing's sure
And yet to love you
I just have to breathe

It's not an easy place

But I'll face anything
As long as that warm morning sun
Will always bring me you

When it's over we move on

Vikki Carr

I tell myself what's done is done
I tell myself don't be a fool
Play the field have a lot of fun
It's easy when you play it cool

I tell myself don't be a chump
Who cares, let him stay away
That's when the phone rings and I jump
And as I grab the phone I pray

Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him or I shall die
Or I shall die
Oh hello, hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die

After a while, I'm myself again
I take the pieces off the floor
Put my heart on the shelf again
You'll never hurt me anymore

I'm not a puppet on a string
I'll find somebody else someday
That's when the phone rings, and once again
I start to pray

Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him , it must be him
or I shall die, Or I shall die
Oh hello, hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die

Shirley Bassey,"One day we walked along the sand
One day in early spring
You held a piper in your hand
To mend it's broken wing
Now I remember many a day
And many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper song
The shadow of a smile

The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things, you are, to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that the love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile [Love Theme from 'The Sandpiper'],2005

From across the sea
It lingered there so warm and fair

we sang a song
And then we strolled on golden sand
Two friends
and the summer wind 

Like painted skies, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the bright blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
That piper man
One day, it called to you
And I lost you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter winds
They have come and they have gone

To all the nights that never end?

In the songs I've been singing quite often a phrase
Comes close to the feeling of you
But I never suspected that one of those days
The wish of the song would come true

You love for real
You show the feel
Of everything that touches you

You are of gracefulness
You are of happiness
You are what I would guess to be most like
What I've been singing of

In my most secure moments I still can't believe
I'm spending these moments with you
On the ground I am walking, the air that I breathe
Are shared in these moments with you

You love for real
You show the feel
Of everything that touches you

Love love

The sweetness and the sorrow

Shirley Bassey,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unshared
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope, goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
There was a man, a lonely man
Who would command the hand he is playing

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere

Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you

Let daylight dry your tears

Your fears are far behind you

A world with no more night
And you, always beside me

Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you, here beside you

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face

I should have made you leave your key

Go on now, go walk out the door

Shirley Bassey,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground

Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

Just when I'd stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear!
But where are the clowns
Quick send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here

Isn't it queer?

Shirley Bassey,"Diamonds are forever, they are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever

Shirley Boone,"Is the struggle and strife we find in this life
Really worth while, after all
I've been wishing today I could just run away
Out where the west winds call

Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by

While the real world waits outside
Away out on the breast of the wonderful west

And fillin' up cribs

They get married; some of them go to college
They move away from home to New York and Chicago 
and to some other places
But the saddest thing about it is that they forget 
that they have a darling mother back home
So it is I’m thinking about a young man who left
 and moved away to Germany, and while he was there
he was critically wounded so much so that the doctor 
said, “that he would never walk again”
He had braces on his legs and another sad thing happen to that young man
He lost his mother. And the family tried 
to get in touch with him but to no avail
And finally we see that young man standing 
with braces on his legs before a fresh grave
with on faded rose in his hand
As he began to drop the peddles from the rose on that grace
he began to talk to his mother
These are some of the words he was saying to his mother

Peddles form this faded roses momma
is all I have to give
But momma I tried to give you flowers
every now and then (now and then) 
Oh yes I did

but wouldn’t wake you from your sleep, as eternal ages grow
Verse 2
So peddle form this faded rose is all have to give
But momma I tried to make you happy, while you lived

You know while that young man stood there
dropping the peddles on the fresh grave
two of his sisters drove up in a big fine car
they got out and they put their arm about his shoulder
One of his sisters said “Brother don’t cry
said you know we did all we could to get in touch with you
But one thing I did, I knew that you would be pleased with
I took my diamond ring and placed it
on momma’s finger and the other sister said
Brother, so do you remember that fur coat that I had
I draped it about momma’s shoulders
but the young man standing there crying
couldn’t think about diamonds and furs
All he could think of was the best thing he had was gone
and with the few more peddles left on the rose
he continue to drop them on the grave and he said to his mother

Diamond rings and silver things momma
I never had, I never had to give
but momma I tried to give you a flower every now and then

If I had a million dollars, I’d line your grave with gold
but that wouldn’t wake you from your sleep, as eternal ages grow",Faded Rose,1977

Jesus said, ""If I go not the Comforter will not come, but in the meantime
I'm not gonna leave you comfortless

Shirley Caesar,"My sister's little boy came in the kitchen one evening 
While she was fixing supper 
And he handed her a piece paper he had been writing on 
And after wiping her hands on an apron 
She took it in her hands and read it 
And this is what it said: 

For mowing the yard five dollars 
And for making up my own bed this week one dollar 
For going to the store fifty cents 
And playing with little brother while you went shopping twenty five cents 
Taking out the trash one dollar 
And for getting a good report card five dollars 
And for raking the yard two dollars 
Total owed one fourteen seventy five

Well she looked at him standing there and expecting 
And a thousand memories flashed through her mind 
So she picked up pen and turned the paper over and this is what she wrote: 

For the nine months I carried you holding you inside me $ no charge 
For the nights I sat up with doctored you and prayed for you $ no charge 
For the time and tears and the costs through the years 
There is no charge 
When you add it all up the full cost of my love is $ no charge 

For the nights filled with grey 
And the worries ahead 
For the advice and the knowledge 
And the costs of your college 
There is no charge 
For the toys, school, and clothes 
And for wiping your nose 
There's no charge son 
When you add it all the full cost of my love is no charge 

Well you know when I think about that 
I think about the day that Jesus went out to Calvary and gave his life as a ransom for me 
When I think on the words ""if any man be in Christ he's a new creature"" 
I like to think about the very minute that he shed his blood 
My debt was paid in full 
And I want you to know today 
When you add it all up

Shirley Clay,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts,
Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man,
But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie and Johnny,1996

As fair as any that the sun shone on,
But how to win him I do not know,
For now he has a sentence to be hung.

As he walked out through the streets of Derry
I'm sure he stood out right manfully;
He looked more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallow's tree.

""Oh, where's my love, she's so long in coming,
And what detains her so long from me;
Perhaps she thinks it's a shame, a scandal
For a man to die upon the gallow's tree.""

As she rode swifter than the wind;
She said, ""I'll show them that they cannot hang you,
And I'll crown my love with a bunch of green.""",The Streets of Derry,1967

How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss

But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song

Shirley Ellis,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001

The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops falling down a mountainside
Many times I've been here
Many times I've cried
We used to be so happy
When we were in love
High on a mountain of love

Night after night I've been standing here alone
Weeping my heart out to cold gray dawn
Praying that you're lonely and you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance that I get a glimpse of you
Trying hard to find you
Somewhere I love
High on a mountain of love

A mountain of love
A mountain of love
You should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and they should have been ours
That's why I'm so lonely
My dreams gone above

Shirley Horn,"Once I was young, yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps
Once I was young, but never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was
Then you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Once I was old, twenty years or so
Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show
Once I was old, but not too old for fun
I used to hunt for little girls up my imaginary gun
But now I ain't for only one

Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man

I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Shared the body and bouquet

That I'll remember always and always

Hold up well in poems and books

Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.
On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.
Too misty,
And too much
In love.....

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Trying to keep you out of my heart
I'm out of my mind
I tell myself ""I'm through with you
And I'll having nothing more to do with you""
I stay away, but every day
I'm just foolin myself

Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it isn't so
I'm just foolin myself

And every time I pass
And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say
""How do you do, you fool
You're trowing your life away""
I'm acting gay
I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend
But in the end
I'm just fooling myself",Foolin' Myself,1999
Shirley Horn,"In old Savannah, I said Savannah,
The weather there is nice and warm!
The climates of a southern brand,
But here's what I don't understand:
They got a gal there, a pretty gal there,
Who's colder than an arctic storm,
Got a heart just like a stone,
Even ice men leave her alone!

They call her hard hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher,
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan,
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man!
She's hard hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah!

They call her hard hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Talk of your cold, refrigeratin' mamas,
Brother, she's a polar bear's pajamas!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
An evening spent with Hannah sittin' on your knees,
Is like travelin' through Alaska in your bvds.
She's hard hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah!

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah
She's got the right name, the vamp of Savannah
Any time a woman can take a great big pan
And start pouring water on a drownin' man
She's hard hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah 

Ohh she's sweet as sour milk",Hard Hearted Hannah,1999

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Shirley Jones,"[Laurey:]
Why should a woman who is healthy and strong
Blubber like a baby if her man goes away
A weeping and a wailing how he's done her wrong?
That's one thing you'll never hear me say

Never gonna think that the man I lose
Is the only man among men
I'll snap my fingers to show I don't care
I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck and I'll brush my hair
And start all over again

[Chorus:]
Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn
Before I do

Many a light lad may kiss and fly
A kiss gone by is bygone
Never have I asked an August sky
Where has last July gone?
Never have I wandered through the rye
Wondering where has some guy gone
Many a new day will dawn
Before I do

[Together:]

[Chorus]

[Laurey:]
Never have I chased the honeybee
Who carelessly cajoled me
Somebody else just as sweet as he
Cheered me and consoled me
Never have I wept into my tea
Over the deal someone doled me

Many a blue moon will shine

And eat it too
Maybe I'm insane tryin' to figure out your scene
And I've got to see you soon to work it out

I was down so low thought I'd never get up

Said she didn't look much older than seventeen
She said, I'll take you to a place
That you've never seen
If your lookin' for a good time
Lookin' for a good time
Lookin' for a good time

She took me away downtown
To a smoky cafe called Barefoot George
There were other people walking
Then she knocked three times
She whispered to a guy he's a friend of mine
Said take off your shoes and come on inside
If your lookin' for a good time
Lookin' for a good time
Lookin' for a good time

Well the lights when on
And the lights when off
And the music stopped
And a man grabbed me from behind
And said ya just got caught
Well your under age and this here's a raid
I should take ya in
I'm gonna to do you a favor and let ya go
Don't ya let me catch you round here no more

Daddy said he should have put me over his knee
And asked me where I've been till a quarter to three

I didn't believe a single word was true

There's truth somewhere & I should use my head
But I didn't listen to a word she said
I kept right on sayin':

""Oh no, not my baby; oh no, not my sweet baby
She's not like these other girls, you see
And I believe she's in love with me
Oh no no no no no, not my girl""

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

But to me was a thrill supreme.

From some enchanted land.

Why should a woman who is healthy and strong
Blubber like a baby if her man goes away
A weeping and a wailing how he's done her wrong?

Never gonna think that the man I lose
Is the only man among men

I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck and I'll brush my hair
And start all over again

Many a new love will find me

Never have I wandered through the rye
Wondering where has some guy gone

What a setup, holy cow!
They'd never believe me
If my friends could see me now!

If they could see me now
My little dusty group
Traipsin' round this million dollar chicken coop
I'd hear those thrift shop cats say, ""Brother get him!
Draped on a bedspread made from three kinds of skin!""
All I can say is ""Wow!""
Wait till the riff and raff
See just exactly how she signed her autograph
What a build up, holy cow!
They'd never believe me
If my friends could see me now!

If they could see me now alone with Mrs. V
Who's waitin' on me like she was a maitre'd
I hear my buddies sayin', ""Wow, what gives?
Tonight he's living just like the other half lives!""
To think the highest brow which I must say is she
Should pick the lowest brow which there's no doubt is me
What a step up, wow, holy cow!
They'd never believe it
If my friends could see me, if my friends could see me
If my friends could see me now!
Take a look at me now, take a look at me now",If My Friends Could See Me Now,1969

'Cause we didn't have much money

That I'd never be something

Came from nothing & life in my surroundings
Was bad. but deep inside me
I would pray for god to guide me
'Cause I knew he'd give me strength for life
And all it's problems back then.

Hand me down clothing 
Empty shelves inside the cupboard
And mama kept three jobs to make do
I'd hear her cryin'
But she never stopped between
Three girls, light bill and the rent ya'll

Shirley Ross,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entre nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Across the sand so I may keep

As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1959

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1960

Our summer day withers away

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At Last the skies above are blue

I found a dream that I can speak to

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

All the letters of the alphabet
I learned them all from A to Z
And now my Mother's giving me

Animal crackers in my soup
Monkeys and rabbits loop the loop
Gosh, oh gee! but I have fun
Swallowing animals one by one

In every bowl of soup I see
Lions and tigers watching me
I make 'em jump right through a hoop
Those animal crackers in my soup

When I get hold of the big bad wolf
I just push him under to drown
Then I bite him in a million bits
And I gobble him right down!

When they're inside me where it's dark
I walk around like Noah's Ark
I stuff my tummy like a goop
With animal crackers in my soup!

Animal crackers in my soup
Do funny things to me
They make me think my neighborhood
Is a big menagerie

For instance, there's our Janitor
His name is Mr. Klein
And when he hollers at us kids
He reminds me of a lion

'specially when it rains.
At first I was a 'fraidy cat
But now I know it's growing pains.
Gosh! oh gee! oh can't you see,
I'll soon be grown up tall,
So I've got to think what I will be 
When I'm no longer small.

When I grow up
In a year or two or three,
I'll be happy as can be
Like a birdie in a tree.

When I grow up
There's a lot I want to do.
I will have real dollies too,
Like the woman in the shoe!

I want to be a teacher so the children can say,
Teacher dear 
The gangs all here
With apples today.

When I grow up
I will have a big surprise,
For I'll bake the kind of pies,
That'll make you roll your eyes.
And if you see
That you need some company,
You can call me up and I'll come down
When I grow up!.

When I am sweet sixteen I'm going to a ball,
Of all the ladies there I'd like to be the best of all;
I'll wear a dress of silver and lace, they'll call me Princess Curly,
I'll be like Cinderella 'cept I won't run home so early.
I want to meet a handsome prince with a uniform of gold,
But I won't lose my slipper 'cause my tootsies might get cold.
I'll talk with queens and dance with kings like a little princess would;
If I could only do these things, I promise I'll be good.

When I am twenty-one I wish that I could look
Like the picture that I saw in a pretty story book;
A laur little girls were standing there much tinier than me
And they all carried baskets, they looked happy as can be,
Every one was smiling and having lots of fun;
I wish that I could be like that when I am twenty-one.

When I get very very old I'll stay at home all day,
But I haven't quite made up my mind,-- it's much too far away.
I think that I would like to be like the lady on the wall,
She looks so nice and comfy in her rocking chair 'n' all.
With that little cap upon her head she looks real pretty, too,
I like her long and funny dress, I like her hair, don't you?
It must be oh,-- so quiet you can hear the tick of the clock,
But it must be fun to have nothing to do but rock, and rock, and rock.",When I Grow Up,
Shirley Temple,"You came along
You looked at me
So sweetly
You smiled so discreetly
And I fell so completely
You came along
And your arms were there to run to

I'm spellbound
Darling, look what you've done to me

When I'm with you
I have lots of toys

You're busy all your life
I long to hug and kiss you
Marry me and let me be your wife

Tastes like pumpkin pie

In every dream I caress you
Every night I play the Lord will bless you

Daddy dear when I'm with you.
Every street I walk on 
Becomes a lovers lane
When I'm with you
I can see the sun
Though we're out in the rain
When I'm with you
To lose you would be tragic
Here is my heart unfurled
You have that certain magic
You're the seven wonders of the world
Snow is on the ground
But the leaves are in the trees
When I'm with you
Flowers sing a love song
There's music in the breeze
When I'm with you
Hmmmmmm

You are my magnificent obsession
The world is all in rhyme
Lovely one when I'm
With you.",When I'm With You,

Which I gaze on so fondly today
Were to change by tomorrow,
And fleet in my arms

Let thy loveliness fade as it will;

And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart 
Would entwine itself verdantly still!","Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms",1996

They are made out of wood,
Such nice little shoes,
Don't you think they look good?
I can dance all around
With the greatest of ease
I jump from the ground
To the tops of the trees.

I'll tell you something
I'm going to try
Put on your shoes 
And away we'll fly,
We'll take a trip
Where ever we choose,
We'll dance and skip
In our little wooden shoes.

How many miles will you travel with me,
One mile or two miles or may be three.
We'll make a stop where ever we choose,
We'll skip and hop

This is going out to all the homies on a Sunday afternoon

Sittin in the park on a Sunday afternoon
Me and the crew just jammin the oldy tune
Sippin on a cold bottle of brewsky
Gave O? a swig he passed it back to me
Right about then up came some of the homies
Mike, Elia P, J Smooth, Phil and Larry
Bustin out the ice chest Phil popped the cooler
Elia P drunk brew nothing better to do
Mike his cup yo is filled with bird
J Smooth had a cold glass to you know it word
Girls at the place just preparing the food
The sky was clear and the weather was cool
Kids at the playground playing on the merry go round
All the cars cruisin bumpin their funky sound
Cause it?s Sunday last day for a funday
Back to business as usual come Monday
At the park everything went real smooth...
On a Sunday afternoon

We were chillin at the park
Just waiting for the sun to go down
It was me Shylo and the homies

I said chill(chill)

Playing horseshoes to win the bill(bill)
Carnisata nappin on the grill(grill)
So now we eat
The cops cruise by looking for the boos
But what Ruben had was plainly simply apple juice
Coming up short just like a fool
Went back to his car with nothing he could do
All the cars in the parking lot low profiling
And everywhere you look you see somebody styling
Cars would listen rolling deep with booming sounds
Its a good time to cruise around
In the parking lot where the brownie was stackin
And all the vatos are looking for some action yeah

(Chorus)

Well the sun was set and it began to get dark
And we were gettin ready to leave the park
We had a good time(ahh yeah)
Yeah we had a good day
Pack the stuff off and we was on our way
Yo mackin the brownies as we all cut em off at the pass
But the all actin soft as we pulled up
They was actin all shy to us
But essays yo want to know who's the flyest
We bowed out and Jimmy Hassler passed out
Una sta feo so hey yo pimps jacked out
Coming up short they gave us no run
So yo homies consider this a dry one
Time to cruise the boulevard
Time to have I'm guaranteed to find a brownie while the night is young
We were rolling yeah looking real smooth
Cause cruising Whittier is how we ended our afternoon

Smooth chillin just kickin it
With the top down, down to the ground
I know they be watching me smooth chilliin

Shit Creek Boys,"It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes.""

Chorus:
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us all feelin' all right

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke and he'll light up your smoke
But there's some place that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""
As his smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessman slowly gets stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Chorus
sing us a song you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well we're all in the mood for a melody
and you got us all feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about their life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnivore
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Oh, la la la, di da da

I might be done
No it won't be too soon 'til I say goodnight moon

There's a shark in the pool
And a witch in the tree
A crazy old neighbor and he's been watching me
And there's footsteps loud and strong coming down the hall
Something's under the bed
Now it's out in the hedge
There's a big black crow sitting on my window ledge
And I hear something scratching through the wall

What should I do I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out
And maybe and then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door he followed me home
So goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it's not here soon
I might be done
No it won't be too soon 'til I say goodnight moon",Goodnight Moon [DVD],2006

To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some cheese and get out these crazy streets
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some gwop and get off this crazy block
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some cake and get out this crazy place
To get away I got to pray that it'll
Be all good if I get out this crazy hood and I pray

I pray everyday for a better life 
But it's never a night I ain't trying to get my cheddar right 
Make it better Christ I'm on both of my knees 
I""m trying to stop coppin' cope by the keys 
I'm sorry father but I got to keep a toaster to squeeze 
I be stressin' cause the blessings I'm supposed to receive 
I ain't gettin' yo I'm supposed to succeed 
But I didn't yo I didn't know cause I was naive 
But now I'm gettin' dough 
My son gettin' plead I hit the stage and spit a flow 
I rip the show and make enough monet to but a brick of snow
I get to travel to places you never get to go 
So I got to move from the block I'm a lot richer yo 
I'm a lot sicker yo I make hits quicker yo 
When I blaze the haze and mix it with the liquor yo 
Niggas know to get cake I need these streets 
So I'ma stay but I pray that I could leave these streets everyday

For a life full of transgressions is heaven harder than inner 
Are the roads to the pearly gates all for repenters 
Is the harder the winter the harder the sinner 
Lord I blow so much kush the answers hard to remember 
I'ma win the game hands down if yall the contenders
Cause yall far from the real thing see yall the pretenders
I know I ought to go to church and pay my tides 
But I'd rather play the hand I'm delt and wake my eyes 
And I drop to my knees and I pray my god 
That when you save my soul you save my squad 
Cause they some vicious killas that'll spare no life 
They don't pray to Allah and they don't fear no Christ 
So don't where no ice cause they'll run up and clap you dummy 
Which proves my theory the route to evils the lack of money 
So that's the reason why I stack my money 
I'm tryin' to move from these streets and concentrate on this rapper money

Man we supposed to be family and we all hood 
If we all could get money it'll be all good 
Cause we all street but we all deep 
I'm tryin' to make more to make sure that we all eat until 
We all fall then we get fed then get bread we hustlin'

Runnin' that shit back and forth, handlin' their business... 
Do what it takes to make it...Me and willie d about to 
take a trip to mississippi on your ass...Check it out!

Mississippi here I come with three keys
My boys in the car full of fire arms
I gotta make that drop
I gotta outer-state plates so the cops are real hot
I'm off on no vacation
I'm not supposed to leave the state because I'm on probation
I need a driver but who can I trust?
Not Greyhound they got norks on the bus
I need somebody with some balls who won't slip
Because I'm payin' 900 for this big trip
Got my boys and everything's on so far
Need a fiend with a creditcard
To rip the call, gave the fiend the 8
He was sold, loaded up the ride
Now it's time to hit the road
But here comes the tough part
I got a road to Louisiana, the dopeman's graveyard
So I stopped poppin' no dopes
Roadin' through hell I can't afford to have my eyes close
Now I'm gettin' paranoid, spotted new folks
And they was comin' up real hard so I had to play it cool
Put on my seat belt and waved at them damn fools
Lifted my seat back putted on my locs
And told the driver don't stop till you get around some black folks
Back in road, I got somethin' to eat
Down me a forty and got right back in the streets
Drove for a while, now we finally here
Took me a shower, fresh clothes, now I need a bed
Made a call to make sure that the drop was right
Cause I don't transact no dope at night
I kinda thought somethin' was wrong
Cause the fool I was callin' he haven't his ass at home
But hell I let it pass
I left him message and told to get back real fast
See, my boys want some brew and some butt
After all this drivin' Sho had to bust a nut
Waxed the ass then I watched some TV, gee
I got a call around three
I set the drop off to twelve noon
I did the freak again and put her straight out of my room
Up the next morning, paid for the rooms we had
Loaded up my nine and rolled to the fool path
Got to his cribI told my boys:
""Don't kill him low! Give him the dope!
 Collect my money! We gonna hit the road!""
Put the dope on the table, started countin' my money
But somethin' was wrong, I'm feelin' kinda funny
Like this clown was starvin' for time
The whole whileI had my hand on the crome-plated nine
Yeah, I think it's time for Sho to leave
I took one step and heard: ""Freeze! Don't breath!""
And out of the blue comes the things my mother said:
""I be in jail! All this dope would have me dead!""
I can still see my baby mama on the floor
On her hands and knees beggin' me not to go
Had my mind on the grip
Could paid any hustler in the hood to take the trip
Didn't want to spend that extra paper
Bein' greedy got me gaught up in this caper
Now i'm face-down for the second time
Damn! I should had followed my first mind
Because now I'm in the cell where i'm gonna die
And Mississippi they get two years for P.I.
And the judge won't set a bail
I'm gaught up in this trap, the redneck hell
It had to be a set-up, see
Because the snitch I dropped the dope to was runnin' around town free
While his bosses still stairin' me
But sits won't last
Because when I get out here I'm a bust a cap in his punk ass
And till then I gotta stair these walls
Cause my moms phone don't except collect calls
County jumpers and some slippers
I'm stucked no luck 
I should known from the start it was a set-up...",Mississippi,1993

Stop look and listen
Pay close attention
While my road dog Sho tell ya how it G-O

(Sho)
Lord have mercy, anotha day anotha dollar
So many bills and problems, it make me want to holla
But thinkin bout the easy way out
Puttin a gun in my hand, let my brains hang out
But then I'd leave my mama with the bills to pay
And that's suicide, I'll go to hell anyway
Life ain't gettin no cheaper
And every single day I'm fallin deeper and deeper
Been thinkin about a jack
But it ain't enough for the rent
Plus my family is starvin, black
You see I'm runnin outta options
And every single day there's somethin new to stop me
And how I'm gonna face my family, dude
When they countin on me to bring home the food
The future don't bring no hope
I been worried about my bills
I ain't have time to vote
And if I did Mr.President wouldn't understand
Life in the ghetto
I'm the trouble man

(Willie D)
What ya know about the trouble man
You ain't never struggled so how can you understand
Got your big car and your big house and your big money
So you lookin at the trouble man funny
He's gettin dissed by society
When all he's doin is tryin to make ends meet
So when you see the trouble man don't frown
Cause what goes around comes around 

(Sho)
Come take a trip to the hood
Everybody knows I'm up to no good
Tryin to make them licks so I can pay them woods
Don't live my life on the rose
The only come up was to slang a lil' dope
But now I'm standin at the pen, G
They tryna lock me up 
Cause Uncle Sam couldn't tax me
My bills are due yesterday
And to make it worse I got a little baby on the way
But who really cares about my songs
I won't have lights if I'm broke when I come home
Been starrin life's mirror for directions
But I'm so broke I don't cast the reflection
Times are gettin so tough
If I had a few bucks I'd buy a 1/5 and a ice cup
And hang on the cuts with the rest of my friends with no plans
I'm the trouble man 

(Chorus)
I'm just the trouble man
I'm just the trouble man
Lord knows I'm doin the very very very best I can

(Sho)
Sometimes I don't want to see the next day
God knows a brother shouldna live this way
But I ain't the type that's sittin in the crib and chill
Sittin on my ass ain't gon pay my life bill
I'd rather be locked up for tryin than sittin in my crib
with no food watchin mama cryin
I'm always gonna do my part 
Straight outta South Park where the hustlers got heart
Just beein black is a punch in the stomach 
But beein black with no money is like my mind playin tricks on me
Everyday I'm out there duckin and divin
If you ain't livin how you want to
Then you just survive
Everybody think they got the plan 
But everywhere I go I see another trouble man
So on the dope game they wishin and hopin
But you got just as many slangin as you got out there smokin 
So I'm on to a new thang 
Rap music 
The brand new dope game

(Chorus)
(Sho)
I'm the trouble

(Chorus)
(Sho)
I'm the trouble

(Chorus)
(Sho)
I'm the trouble

(Chorus)

I'm the trouble",Trouble Man,1993
Sho,"Hi welcome to our fuckin' incredible music, 
I hope you're gonna listen to it at high volume and 
I also hope you're gonna like it a lot as I believe 
We're The Suneatshours, the name tells you all and 

Here we are gonna teach you how to not waste your time and 
We're selling you the recipe to believe that 
We've all our life ahead 
We'll never be kind 

To all of those who don't believe that we can 
And we will be right 
We're always the same 
But we'll never be 

A bored generation without dreams to believe in 
That's alright 
We're alright 
And we'll never demean our eyes 

Down to the floor 
S.E.H. means that you'll never give up 
With your dreams 
And obviously that your soul will never die",Intro,1998
Sho Baraka,"I'm free from sin
I win! I win!
I'm free! I'm free!
And no more chains are holding me!
I'm free from death
Got power now
Me kill the flesh
I'm free! I'm free!
(tell the world) I'm gone
I'm gone!

I know when you hear this beat it sound like something to step with
But morals and music you want them separate
Like garnish on the side something ya'll don't mess with
That christo-centric rap electric
You might like rap that's wild and wreckless
A soap box for lots young and restless
They got ya head bobbin til ya lose ya necklace
Or betta yet bobbin til it leaves you neck less
You know where death is, where no more breath is and 
3rd graders learn how to leave you chestless
Where god is dissed, dismissed and distant and far 
From their hearts cause they hard and wicked
Sin hates god for real
That's he's rarely talked about and he don't get the mass appeal
You might see sin sharin' a meal that it eats while 
It cheats on the spouse out seeking a thrill

They walk in the church dressed flyer than sea birds
She came to see him he hopin' to see her
They motives ain't right and they heart ain't either
And over god they choose to feed they fever
See he don't understand that it's christ who bled for
Every second glance every turn of his head yo
And she don't really get that
Jesus did that
For every time she fantasize about his six pack
They sure like al b
To connect like his brows be
And with they bodies spit in god's face so foully
Sin so
Bad it's a liar
It's says we on the throne tells god to retire
It's says he ain't enough
And it says we want more
Is says he ain't just and it says he ain't lord
Sin is the laugh at his power
Rape of his mercy
Mock of his patience
It say he ain't worthy

I been duped and been schemed
Like the lord was cool with my sinning
Mocking the cross living unrepented
My sinful life kept us so
Distant
I know lord and been king
Let him run your life like a
Simmons
Then you'll start loving his righteousness and we start
Looking just like his kids

Live free by his mercy and grace
Live free by his mercy and grace and tell the world I'm gone
Live free by his patience and peace
Live free by his patience and peace and tell the flesh I'm gone
Live free by his joy and love
Live free by his joy and love and tell the lust I'm gone
Live free by his truth and just
Live free by his truth and just and tell the hate I'm gone",Live Free,2008

Spit it how you live it

But I never seen a lazy boy grow
And I know a couple of 'em

But they never really get out there and go
So back to the fact

No need for me to act
Instead of growing in Christ
And learning to reenact
That lifestyle he lived

Sho Baraka,"Man up!

Momma want some more Obama in me
The hood want PAC hip hop
Wanna see the Common in me
And since it's a senseless contradiction
I end up a misfit trying fit in
This ends when I stand up
And see the hands that are standard
Holy is the lamb (Holy is the Lamb)
Now we holding you to man up 'cause we were made
In his image start looking at what you came from.

Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy had to make
Adamant after what Adonai is against
Let me take you back to the tree and Eden,
If you read it you'd see that Eve was deceived,
But Adam's the one who let her eat it (Man up)
Standing leading no, we ain't leading we (Bump that)
Basically little boys with muscles and a mustache!
The femininity, we need a remedy that God made a
100 percent masculinity

We the last, yeah
Where the men at, seems like they all lost,
None of them are on the scene, seems like they died off.
They extinct but my dream is to rise up,
We chasing the prize of the King, the divine boss,
But we fell away, now we ungodly
We lose and we really got the blues like Navi,
I want to celebrate the dudes that's beside me.
Fellas let's elevate, we through with the lies man.

They lie, go ahead say boy get your shine on
If a sucker try to block you get your 9 on
And what I heard you gotta do to be a man now,
Stand up for yourself so I took it in my hands now.
And that's the problem man we busy trying to solve it
All the while we walking dead man somebody bring the coffin, boy drop
Peach fuzz now you think that your a man 'cause you feeling yourself
You need to man up!

Sex and models and tippin' bottles
Pack a pile of excuses right next to your bottle caps 
A Rolodex filled with names that you aim to please
Next to the stack of money buildin' up a heart of greed
Ice on his neck, givin' jokers the cold shoulder 
You drunk off pride plus you loving the hangover
You gotta whole lotta stuff that won't amount to gain 
Life will never make sense because you never made change  

We got it twisted, sick like a fever
Lil' man live to stack dough, Keebler
Man up, get up out of that treehouse
Leave them cookies alone, it's time to eat meat now
Tryna show you a new way to live now
No charge, you can call it a freestyle 
Without Christ you won't know what a man is
You a boy in a man's body like Tom Hanks in Big

Being a man got nothin' to do with age
You can be a boy 'til the day you lay in your grave
None of us behave like the image of who we're made 
'Cause we fallen the ways it's better known as depraved 
Running from responsibility really we crave
The easy way out of places that call us to pull our weight
Man they blowing through every day decisions are made
Responding to the call God's giving 'em from the gate

Man up!
Let the process begin, separate the boys from the men
Man up!
Doesn't matter how you started partner, it's about how you end
Man up!
Jesus is the model follow us we go follow him
Man up!
We-we the last of a dying breed it's time that we
Man up!",Man Up Anthem,2011
