Betty,"Rust to dust, us to them
Change your mind, change your skin
Life to death, weak to strength
Cash a check, change your sex

Day to night, dark to light
Hard to soft, on to off
Push to shove, hate to love
In and out, it's all about

They're just transformations
Variations, alternations, deviations
You know, Mother Nature rules us all

I move and I go
In time, fast or slow
I move, because
Each time there's some more

Wet to dry, eye to eye
Yin to Yang, pleasure or pain
Good to bad, crazy or sane
You make the rules, then you play the game

Fist to glove, lose or win
You live a life of sin, then you're born again
Trash to art, heart to heart
Big or small, we're all a part

They're just transformations
Variations, alternations, deviations
You know, Mother Nature rules us all",Transformation,2009
Betty Adel,"There's just one place for me, near you
It's like heaven to be near you

Times when we're apart
And I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stay
More than just two lips away

If my hours could be spent near you
I'd be more than content, near you

Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Near you, near you
Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Spend the rest of my days near you",Near You,2007
Betty Adel,"If I sent a rose to you
For every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white
For every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses

And if you took the petals
And you took them all apart
You'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you tore my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send some roses too
Well I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you

And if you took the petals
And you took them all apart
You'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you tore my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send some roses too
Well I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you",Room Full of Roses,2007
Betty Barclay,"Me and my childhood sweetheart
Have come to the parting of the ways
He still treats me like he did In our baby days.
I'm a little bit older And a little bit bolder
Since both of us were three.
I'm a little more padded Something new has been added
He oughtta take one good look at me 
I'm a big girl now
I want to be daring like a big girl now
When daddy tells those certain jokes it isn't fair
He tells me I'm too young and makes me take the air
But I could tell a couple that would curl his hair
I'm a big girl now.
I'm a big girl now
I want to be handled like a big girl now
I'm tired of being babied like a kid of three
I'm tired of having chaperones to follow me
I want to have some secrets in my diary
I'm a big girl now
I'm a big girl now
I want to be cuddled like a big girl now
I'm through with going to movies with my Uncle Tim
Through with going to picnics with my old Aunt Min
I want to go to Mexico with ... you know him
I'm a big girl now
I'm a big girl now
I want to be wanted like a big girl now
I'm tired of staying home each evening after dark
Tired of being dynamite without a spark
I want to learn what fellows do in Central Park
I'm a big girl now",I'm a Big Girl Now,2002

Betty Bennett,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly

And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all

I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours

Betty Bennett,"When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love,

It was easy said the night we parted
That we'd forget we'd ever met
I haven't forgotten, I wonder if you have
Or if your heart is full of regret.

As long as I live if it be one hour
Or if it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever
I'll love you dear, as long as I live.

Oh, I never thought that night we parted
That life alone would be oh, so bad

Betty Bennett,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2000

She thinks I'm grand, that's grand for me

When I am with her, I am glad the boy who's with her

Betty Bennett,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2000
Betty Bennett,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.
And if my throbbing heart should ever start repeating 
That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You,2000

Just you wait.......!

Where god paints the scenery

I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Come on, let me take you there, this is something we can share
Come on, let me take you there, ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh yeah
Take proctection now, don't say I didn't warn ya
You must be careful, you'll go as pink as a lobster
Only have to look at the sun and then I go brown
Don't want to upset you, come on, let's go to the fairground
The house of fun, the big wheel and the dungeons
There's loads to do, so many of them
I don't feel like going back to the grindstone
But what'll we do when the sun goes down",Let Me Take You There,1992
Betty Boo,"(Ooh ooh ooh) I can't believe you've left me
Don't know that you've upset me
You just want to forget me, why don't you come and get me
And boy, I really miss you and all I want to do is kiss you
I've used up all my tissues 'cause there's more serious of issues
I don't even know the reason you were playin' and you were teasin'
Did they tell me you were leavin'
Those good looks are deceivin' (ooh ooh ooh)

[Chorus]
Where are you, baby, we used to have so much fun
You drive me crazy, somebody tell me where he's gone
Where are you, baby, we used to have so much fun
You drive me crazy (ooh ooh ooh)

You're peepin' through the window, this is too much for me to handle
Already caused a scandal, a disturbance like a vandal
I've lost track of all time 'cause you're always on my mind
And you're just that type of guy
That'll make me cry, oh why, oh why, oh why
Oh why has he disappeared, this feeling is really weird
You're precious and you're dear
Can you feel the weight of these tears (ooh ooh ooh)

[Chorus]

Good goodbye, a good goodbye
A good good na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na now
Na now now now, now now now (ooh ooh ooh)

[Chorus]

You've really got a nerve and all you want to do is flirt
Love is just a word that you tell to all your birds
Does it give you any satisfaction to see the worst of one's reaction
And this has never happened, it's my first love attraction
And what did I do to deserve this, some days I feel all nervous
Please use the telephone service
I hope today you hear this (ooh ooh ooh)

Betty Bruce,"I pretend I'm at home getting dressed for a date
I take a comb, comb my hair
Take a flower, smell it and put it in my lapel
And I spot the audience

Once my clothes were shabby
Tailors called me Cabbie
So I took a vow, said this bum'll be Beau Brummel

Now I'm smooth and snappy, now my tailor's happy
I am the cats meow, my wardrobe is a wow
Paris silk, Harris tweed, there's only one thing I need

Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest
All I need now is the girl
Got my striped tie, got my hopes high
Got the time and the place and I got rhythm
Now all I need is the girl to go with 'em

If she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl
And if she?ll say my darling I'm yours
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best pressed tweed
All I really need is the girl

I start off easy, you see?
Now I'm more debonair, ssh, break
And I sell it here, I start this step, see?
And then I build it, double it

She appears all in white, I take her hand, kiss it
And lead her on the floor
This step's good for the costume, Astaire's pat
Yah, dah, dah, dah, yah, dah, yah, dah, dah, yah

Now we waltz, strings come in
And I lift her again, once more
And now the tempo changes and all the lights come up
And I build for the finale

Louise that's it, do it over here
Follow me, faster, Charleston
Again, do it again, give me your hands

You see the border of her coat is torn and stained with sand
And you see the corner of her eye twist like a crooked pin

She haunted many a low resort
Near the grimy road of Tottenham Court
She flitted about the No Man's Land
From ""The Rising Sun"" to ""The Friend at Hand""
And the postman sighed as he scratched his head
""You'd really had thought she ought to be dead""

And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1997
Betty Buckley,"I, I used to visit all these very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get a feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen grey faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there
You could see where they've been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then suddenly you came along 
With a siren song
It tempts me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness...
Of a great love for me
But, I was wrong
I was wrong

Life is lonely again,
And only last week, everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A trough full of hearts will probably be a bore, a bore

A week I might go to Paris 
At least a bite of it
All, all I want to do is laugh in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

And it stifles those who strive
Well I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And I, I'll be alright with the rest

Betty Buckley,"The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you're older
And all because of
The man that got away.

The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it's final inning,
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.

Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

A beautiful smile to hide the pain

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

Every fancy free

Betty Buckley,"Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you

Is when I give my heart to you",When I Fall in Love,2007

You can reach me by trailway
You can reach me on an airplane
You can reach me with your mind

You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can

You can reach me by sail boat
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down the slope
Into these arms of mine

You can jump on a speedy colt
Cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way surely you would be closer
I need you closer

You can windsurf into my life
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon

Your smile is soft and drowsy as you let it play upon your face
Oh, how I dream I might be like the morning sun to you

Like a lover the river wind slides and ripples its fingers through your hair
Upon your cheek it lingers never having known a sweeter place
Oh, how I dream I might be like the river wind to you

How I envy a cup that knows your lips, let it be me, my love
And a table that feels your fingertips, let it be me, let me be your love
Bring an end to the endless days and nights without you

Like a lover the velvet moon shares your pillow and watches while you sleep
Its light arrives on tiptoe gently taking you in its embrace
Oh, how I dream I might be like the velvet moon to you

How I envy a cup that knows your lips, let it be me, my love
And a table that feels your fingertips, let it be me, let me be your love

But where would I begin

There were eyes that seemed to reach me
Arms that opened wide
There were lips that seemed to know me

It was springtime in DC

Betty Buckley,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright you are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

But that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Betty Buckley,"When I take you out, tonight, with me,
Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 
the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.

Or a chorus of sighs when the die has been cast 
And you run like a criminal in from my past
And I feel myself break from the sorrow

Still waters run silent; old wounds they run deep
And fear in the long night can find me
It drains my forgiveness and robs me of sleep
Like a key that was sent to unwind me

As echoes from your cool green eyes
Grow louder

Remembering old lovers

Roll on New River
Roll on forever
Carry me with you
Roll on

Past the farms and fields of corn
Past these hills that I adore
Up a winding corridor you travel
Men have tried but never tamed you
I still wonder why they named an old, old place ""new""
Like they did New River

Roll on New River
Roll on forever
Carry me with you
Roll on

Well old train you seem to know that I
Can't turn around and go back home (and your)

Silver wheels just keep on turning turning

Seems is all that's left for me
To carry with the part aching dull inside

And the tears they just keep burning burning

Betty Elders,"Call upon the innocent
Call upon the weak
Call me down an avatar
I am afraid to speak
Won't you conjure me one witness
Let him dare to share the truth
Then please call upon my children
For they never needed proof

I am silenced by your intellect
Confounded by your brain
I have stood before your altar
And I've found myself in flames
I've seen your burned out buildings
And the rubble in the street
And I 've stood beside your people
But they lie between the sheets

Now there is a distant fire
And the smoke does surely rise
For the Watchman in his tower
He doth seek to crucify

I have come before your counsel with your name upon my tongue
I have counted every bullet that you've held on everyone
There is no shame in mercy
But there are no heroes here
And there will be no survivors
In this War Between The Fears

Still you call out to your brothers
Yes you raise the battle cry
While you fornicate the others
You would love what you despise
Tell me who does tend your children
While you're polishing your throne
The Wolf is in The Garden
And your lambs are all alone

I have read The Book of Knowledge
I have pondered every page
And the madman-in-the-mirror
Looks alot like my own face
I question every answer
And The Keeper Of The Keys
He has led my children from me
To the land of his disease

And they stood before the altar
He did pound upon his breast
And I felt my courage crumble
They were easily impressed

Call me down a warrior
Call me down a sage
Call my God a taxi for I fear 
He is too late
And I'll conjure you some mercy
If you let my people go
And I will not tell the children
What they would not want to know

We love it more than we can say, (how nice!)
We get like a good fresh air, (uh huh) the ocean's everywhere (uh hum)
That's we hate to get leave and go away.

We could be swabbing the deck, sweeping the bunks with a broom,
We could be shoveling tons of coal, down in the boiler room.

Betty Hutton,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are

Ahh, gee, you should have seen him this afternoon

Bang went the bridge lamp, down went the table, crash went the china tray

Got up early this morning, wore a flimsy negligee
Had to hurry to fix the breakfast and get daddy on his way
Figured I could get the paper, so the neighbors wouldn't see
So I sneaked out on the porch, very, very quietly
Wham went the dish pan, then came a holler, up went the neighbor's shade
It was Mother's little darling, out on a commando raid

Came home late from a picture. I was tired, my shoes were tight
Took off my stockings, dropped my girdle
Got undressed and pulled the light. boy!
Slipped into my night gown, then tiptoed across the floor
Better have a look at Junior, so I peeked into his door
Clang, clang, clang went a cowbell, whee went a whistle, I nearly had a stroke
It was mother's precious baby, just havin' his little joke

Always just when I'm breathin' a peaceful sigh
There's G-Men, coppers and robbers and hi-yo silver!
Bam went the book case, boot went the fruit bowl, boom went the glass bouquet
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some mother's day
I'll remember when, bang went the lamp, down went the table
Crash went the tray, rip rip went the curtain, wham went a window

If it started raining soup his family'd all have forks,
If they was to cut a woman in two, he'd get the half that talks.

Unlucky Luke, unlucky kid,
Why he broke into a betting shop and he lost four hundred quid.
Now his parents never loved him like they did his sister, Kim,
They could tied a kipper 'round his neck to get the cat to play with him.
And he cried the day that he was weened 'cause he knew even then,
It'd be twenty years before he was near anything like that again.

They put his cradle on the ??? near the door,
So the folks downstairs could hear him when he fell out on the floor.

Was the day he went to hospital to get his tonsils out.
He was on the operating theatre trolley sleeping sound,
When a short-sighted nurse came past and turned the trolley 'round.

Unlucky Luke, no wonder he hollers,
His sick aunt died and in her will he owed her forty dollars.
Now Luke married Charlie's widow, a lady with no manners,
She had a figure like a hippo and face like a bag of spanners.
She told him she'd four children in the cemetary by the creek,
She forgot to tell they was down there playin' hide and seek.

He said, ""With luck like mine the plane'll crash and I'm too young to die.""

Head hung to the floor

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt

The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Betty Johnson,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'

How little we understand what touches off that tingle
That sudden explosion when two tingles into mingle

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,

And reminisce with you that's my desire.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

All innocent children had better beware
She's like a spider waiting for the kill

But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realize you've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock

She ought to be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place until

But all I see is a silver sky;
For in my fancy I sweep away light,
And keep my image of the sky,

All through the day I dream about the night,
I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,
Until the time when I'm here with you.

The evening mist melts away;
Down smiles the moon, And soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day.",All Through the Day,2011

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Betty Russell,"I bought a bonnet to suit my face 
I had my petticoat trimmed with lace 
I looked at the mirror, around I twirled 
And then I went out in the wide, wide world

I saw them all kneeling at my feet 
I can't understand it, my hair is all curled

I can't understand it, I've knitted and pearled 
But my goodness me it's a great big world!

But my goodness me, it's a great big world.

What'll I do?
I long for somebody who
Will sympathize with me
I'm growing so tired of living alone
I lie awake all night and cry
Nobody loves me
That's why

All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night

I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there
Playing solitaire

And still be friends

Betty Scott,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1974
Betty Scott,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1974
Betty Shirley,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?
And so all else above

Betty Smith,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",
Betty Taylor,"When the crypt doors creak
And the tombstones quake
Spooks come out for a singing wake
Happy haunts materialize
And begin to vocalize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize

Now don't close your eyes
And don't try to hide
Or a silly spook may sit by your side
Shrouded in a daft disguise
They pretend to terrorize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize

As the moon climbs high o'er dead oak tree
Spooks arrive for the midnight spree
Creepy creeps with eerie eyes
Start to shriek and harmonize
Grim grinning ghosts come out socialize

When you hear the knell of a requiem bell
Weird glows gleam where spirits dwell
Restles bones etherealize
Rise as spooks of every size

Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
Grim grinning ghosts come out
Grim grinning ghosts come out
To socialize",Grim Grinning Ghosts,2006

Betty Woolfe,"Well after all, Pickering,
I'm an ordinary man,
Who desires nothing more than an ordinary chance,
to live exactly as he likes, and do precisely what he wants...
An average man am I, of no eccentric whim,
Who likes to live his life, free of strife,
doing whatever he thinks is best, for him,
Well... just an ordinary man...

BUT, Let a woman in your life
and your serenity is through,
she'll redecorate your home,
from the cellar to the dome,
and then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling you...

Let a woman in your life,
and you're up against a wall,
make a plan and you will find,
that she has something else in mind,
and so rather than do either you do something else that neither likes at all

You want to talk of Keats and Milton, she only wants to talk of love,
You go to see a play or ballet, and spend it searching for her glove,
Let a woman in your life and you invite eternal strife,
Let them buy their wedding bands for those anxious little hands...
I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling than to ever let
a woman in my life,

I'm a very gentle man, even tempered and good natured who you never hear complain,
Who has the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein,
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips, 
the sort who never could, ever would, let an insulting remark escape his lips
Very gentle man...

But, Let a woman in your life, and patience hasn't got a chance,
she will beg you for advice,
your reply will be concise, and she will listen very nicely,
and then go out and do exactly what she wants!!!

You are a man of grace and polish, who never spoke above a hush,
all at once you're using language that would make a sailor blush,
Let a woman in your life, and you're plunging in a knife,
Let the others of my sex, tie the knot around their necks, 
I prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition than to ever let a
woman in my life

I'm a quiet living man,
who prefers to spend the evening in the silence of his room,
who likes an atmosphere as restful as an undiscovered tomb,
A pensive man am I, of philosophical joys,
who likes to meditate, contemplate, far for humanities mad inhuman noise,
Quiet living man....

But, let a woman in your life, and your sabbatical is through,
in a line that never ends comes an army of her friends, 
come to jabber and to chatter and to tell her what the matter is with YOU!,
she'll have a booming boisterous family,
who will descend on you en mass,
she'll have a large Wagnerian mother, with a voice that shatters glass,

wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

So very hard to find the real thing today
It's even harder to keep they say
And it's so hard to keep a new love from growin' old
And everything that glistens
It sure don't have to be gold

But I've got

Betty Wright,"It's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
Girls, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life

She takes the time to listen
To what he has to say
While all you do is nag him
A thousand times a day

And her clothes are always stylish

Around this time last summer
When you and I first met
I thought I was cool
Living by the rules
Trying to play hard to get

So you found some good time chick
To give you the love you needed
I didn't know a thing
About the thrills love could bring
I was young, selfish, and conceited

I know you don't think I'm ready
But open your eyes and see
As sure as my name is Betty
I can love away all your misery

So let me be your lovemaker

About this time last year
I was blind to all the good things you said
The sweet words you spoke
I took them for a joke
Though they were strong enough to raise the dead

So you thought you wasted
Both your time and mine
But now I'm ready to do
What you want me to
'Cause I'm your woman

Go out and play some times

'Cause girls you can't do what the guys do, no
And still be a lady
Girls you can't do what the guys do, no

You can easily be hurt
And the least little wrong he does
Always seems like dirt

Don't try to do the things the guys do

Girls you can't do what the guys do, no

Betty Wright,"Well, I couldn't resist the urge
To tell you the end of my story
For all those who wanted to know
Was there life after the pain?

After the pain, you come and love me
And I welcome you, you're a glad sight to see
And after the rain and all that I have been through
I still can't explain how I can still love you like I do?
But I do, yes, I do

Still love you like I do
(After the pain)
Though you still do me like you do
(After the pain)

After the pain, we sit and we talk awhile
And I fight with all my might
To hold back the tears from falling with a pleasant smile

And after the rain, I can't believe you
Got the nerve to still call me, baby
And I try to tell you, “No, it ain't so”
But I guess “No” just ain't in me

‘Cause boy, I still love you like I do
(After the pain)
Though you still do me like you do
(After the pain)

Yeah, I know you're laughin'
Those of you who heard 'Pain'
Yeah, you're right, I sure did
I said I'd never take him back again

Well, it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind isn't it?
But we do it all the time
Don't laugh, you probably done the same thing too
It's just that you know me and I don't know you

You know one thing, time has taught me that
Havin' a piece of man is better than havin' no man at all
So I'ma just take what I got and work with it
You understand what I mean

And don't you remember thinkin' back just a few years
When people used to try to help you stay together
They find out you're on the verge of breakin' up
They used to cook up a little food and throw a little party
And whisper things in your ear like

Don't blame Mr. Charlie, Mr. Charlie is just a man
And he's doing the best he can
I heard 'em say, “Don't blame Mr. Charlie, Mr. Charlie is just a man
And he's doing the best he can”

That's why I still love you like I do
(After the pain)
Though you still do me like you do
(After the pain, the pain)

I know that you know it's true
After all I've been through
I should be through with love
But there's a God up above

That keeps sayin', “Betty try
Don't give up, you know why
The sun is gonna shine
'Cause you are mine, all mine”

You just keep doin' your best
And I will do the rest
'Cause I love you, love you, Betty, like I do

That's why I still love you like I do
(After the pain, the pain)
Though you still do me like you do
(After the pain, the pain)

My love is deeper than any ocean
And my love is higher than any mountain
It's, oh, it's full of emotion
My love is full of devotion

My love is in and out of season
And I love you with or without a reason
You see God is gonna bless me for lovin' you
For all the times that you treated me wrong and I kept bein' true

You see, God's eyes they're not closed
He's not asleep
Said He's watchin' everything move you make
Every secret you keep

Boy, you better be careful
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
Said if you treat me bad or make my sad
My Father in heaven is watching you

But I still love you like I do
(After the pain)
And nobody's ever gonna love you like I do
(After the pain)

No one's ever gonna love you like I do
No one's ever gonna love you like I do
No one's ever gonna love you like I do
I don't know why I do, but I do, yes, I do
(After the pain)

Oh, there's a woman in me that keeps on lovin' you
(After the pain, the pain)
I don't know why, oh, I don't know why
(I don't know why, baby)
(After the pain, the pain)

I don't know why
(I don't know why, baby)
But I do
(I do)

Said I do
(I do, I do, I do)
Said I
(After the pain, the pain)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
(After the pain, the pain)

Do, I don't know why, baby
(After the pain, the pain)
But I love you so, yes, I do
(After the pain, the pain)

Baby, don't you know it's true, yes, I do
Baby, no strain
(After the pain, the pain)
Still love you after the pain

Betty Wright,"First of all I'd like to say good evening
And we're so pleased that
So many of you could come out and share
In all the love and all the happiness we have in store for you
We want you to have a real good time
'Cause that's just what we have in mind
Is that alright with you

Now, this is a tune that I composed
And it's called
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman

Now I never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
That is until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through the pages of my notebook
He came across the words and he said
We gotta somethin' with these words
It's happening every day
And people wanna hear about it, Betty

You see, it's the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time

Now when I finally got a melody
I took it home and I, I played it for my mother
Now I got to tell you a little bit about my mother
You see, I come from one of those pretty large families
And I'm the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother

I'll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it for her
She said, eh I like the music
You know, baby, the melody it's really nice
But I know you're not gonna sing that song

But we eased it right on by, yes, we did
And it became one of my biggest records too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time

Now I'll give you a little while longer
'Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little further than others
Come on now, I want you to play catch-up
'Cause I don't want you waitin' till I get to the end of my song
Sayin' oh, yeah, now I remember

Now whether it was good
Or you just smilin' it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here's my story

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I, I hope you will, mmm

I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin'
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can't help actin' like a child

You're knockin' on my door and you're ringin' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang ups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I, I hope you will, mmm

I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'

Tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still

Ho, ho, baby
Ho, yeah
Yeah

Oh, but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin' what we are doin'
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it'll all be ruined

But we've gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let's just pray
That true love is what we've found

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Ho, I'll never forget tonight
No, no, I'll never forget tonight
That's when you make me feel real, mmm
You make me feel real, real good

Yeah, and I wanna thank your love
Said I've got to thank your love
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby

She had lost her man
To her babysitter
I thought she was lying
I said no sixteen year old schoolgirl
Could ever take a man of mine

Staying home with our baby all the time
It kept me kind of broken hearted
So I went and hired myself a babysitter
And that's when my trouble all started

This sixteen year old chick walked in
With a skirt up to her waist
She had a truckload of you know what
And all of it in place

I should have been aware
Mmm hmm, ooh, ooh, of the babysitter, oh, yeah, yeah
I should have known from the jump, yeah
She was a man getter

I should have been aware, uh huh
Of the babysitter, aah
I should have known from the jump, yeah
She was a man getter, yes, she was

When I found out exactly what was going on
There wasn't much that I could do
The babysitter had his heart and soul
And all of his money too

You know, I should have been aware
Ooh, ooh, of the babysitter, hoo
I should have known from the jump, yeah

It’s happening every day
And people wanna hear about it, Betty”
You see, it’s the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time
Now when I finally got a melody
I took it home and I-I played it for my mother
Now I got to tell you a little bit about my mother
You see I come from one of those pretty large families
And I’m the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother
I’ll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it forher
She said, “Uh, I like the music
You know, baby, the melody it’s really nice
But I know you’re not gonna sing that song”
But we eased it right on by, yes, we did
And it became one of my biggest records too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time
Now I’ll give you a little while longer
‘Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little further than others
Come on now, I want you to play catch-up
‘Cause I don’t want you waitin’ till I get to the end of my song
Sayin’, “Oh, yeah, now I remember”
Now whether it was good
Or you just smilin’ it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here’s my story

Hm, hm, mm, mm

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mm
You said you’ll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, mm, mm

I’m nervous and I’m tremblin’
Waitin’ for you to walk in
I’m tryin’ hard to relax
But I just can’t keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin’
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can’t help actin’ like a child

You’re knockin’ on my door and you’re ringin’ my bell
Hope you’re not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang-ups
And we’re both old enough to know right from wrong

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mm,
You said you’ll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, hmm, mm,
I’m nervous and I’m tremblin’
Waitin’ for you to walk in
Tryin’ hard to relax
But I just can’t keep still

Mm, hey, baby
Ho, ho, baby
Ho, yeah, yeah

Oh, but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin’ what we’re doin’
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it’ll all be ruined
But we’ve gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let’s just pray
That true love is what we’ve found

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Ho, I’ll never forget tonight
No, no, I’ll never forget tonight
That’s when you make me feel real, mm, hm
You make me feel real, real good
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa,
Yeah, and I wanna thank your love
Said I’ve got to thank your love
‘Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
I love you and I know it

I just wanna thank you, ain’t no way I could repay you
Strongest woman that I know, you’ve been my motivator
And just know I’ll be everything that you said I would
Only focus is hoping that all my family good

A lot of cloudy days, prayin' for that sun to shine

Five kids, three jobs, how you ever did it?
Tryna make a livin, hustle got me reminiscin'
Daddy chose lust over all us
Tell me what’s the type of man who never kept in touch
How do you feel? Mama showed me the real
Can’t recover them years, too much emotion to feel
We was covered in bills, mama takin' them pills
Got er stressin' for days, then why the fuck ain’t you here
It’s why I love her to death
She was there when they left
Prayin' for me every day, Lord honor my steps

I’m a believer in me and now we livin' the dream

I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'mma go
DJ Khaled

Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the Pearly Gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (Sheesh)
At least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'mma take it, just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to Hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple, they can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre, except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement with you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key 
(The holy key, the holy key, the holy key)

And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine

Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (Uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (Come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
'Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth,"" that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubix cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches, sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason, you won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it, let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration

Left ya stumblin' in the dark

Right to where I've been

Way down beneath the hurt
It was so hard for me to feel that I was

Worthy, worthy
What a thing to claim! 
Worthy, worthy
Ashes into flames
Oh, ah, worthy

I've walked through a wall of fire
Left behind the only life I knew
No way back, nowhere to hide
But finally, finally a voice came through

You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it

You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done.

So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on pushing and don't look back.

Cause you know that's hot, and them haters
Do your thang and come on home, cause you know
That I'm waiting, with that fire

5 in the morning, ain't no yawning ain't no time for sleeping
I'm still working the block, the block still bleeding
I'm still toting a glock, cause niggaz be scheming
I still want what you got, until then I ain't leaving
Battle scarred and hard headed, off of the streets
Was brought up in the hustle, the game supported me
Day to day grinding, gotta make sure we eat
Gotta make sure, we can step out on the block and be seen
Trying to let all them fiends know, I'm back on the scene
Got them power packs ready, Scottie throw down a beam
Undercover snitch niggaz, trying to break my dream up
Baby girl home alone, waiting for me to show up
Plus this morning, she told me she woke up throwing up
And I wanna lay, all I'm thinking bout is paper
It might be real early, in the morning when I come home
But best believe I'm coming home, pockets full of do'


Gonna hop up on niggaz, like quizzes in class
Sensei shife niggaz, and chizzle they masks
I ain't your hammer jamming, but I'm packing a glass
When I hit you I'ma split you, like that crack in your ass
Got elbows of weed, I'm bagging my grass
I got weight niggaz, think I need to take out the trash
4 flipping in the dash, one under the seat
Worm just laid the track, to what I done to the beat
Wet niggaz up everywhere, but under the feet
Plus I rock-a-bye niggaz, put 'em under a sheet
I'm trying to get freaky tonight, I'm in the mood
For a baby-faced girl, with a big girl mule
Jeans on the couch, underwear in the pool
Closer boys keep girls, square in the nude
A layer, the Earth's my turf so I'm a grown
When I'm finished with these streets, I'm gone into hiding

Pull it all night, as on the block stacking bread
Ducking police, and I'm stacking big heads
Never letting it go FED, while I grind it out
Shooting dice on my knees, making boys drop out
Got it popped at the spot, and a twat that's wide
I dig up between thighs, when they qualified
Naked showing hide, cotton up six figgas
Day for day on the block, watching thangs get bigger
Build an empire, the boss of the street game
Stack it up real pretty, I'm sicking all my change
Fame is a trip, people can back stab you
Gotta watch your back, cause somebody could grab you

I just want to be loved and liked by everyone... shining down on my every move... impossible thoughts... stay on this cruise... never go back, relaxation calms these metal nerves... need to just let go and become a giant... forcing the improvement of our musican system... one can't do such, especially with such a lack of confidence... maybe they see it... maybe they frown upon this face... time ... I keep drifting away... I look forward to these days physically, but mentally they can become very tiring... why worry... personal hapiness should be all that matters... (I feel this most of the time) days like today mordecai flies down on this ship and stares me in the eyes (every time, can't change) maybe I should just be this bedroom performer I keep hearing of... no pressure, no boundaries... only personal pleasing... coward... yes I call myself this... control... control me... sit back now... piss it all away.. loser losing lost... (scene)",Autodidact,2005
Between the Buried and Me,"The early love seems to become jaded... I'm never expecting this... glance towards the mirror, imagination toward the stars... the endless desire for my one and only true love... this will never change i predict.... but i do get tired.. if only they knew what push we have given... for this music... this happiness that keeps us all sane... cold nights seem to force questions, not wanting to accept these thoughts... I have worked and will keep working... to keep the tradition of my one true motive in life... music... my only love... once building drum boxes and pretending to be the artist... I guess I'm here but it feels weird... so weird... to know how weird all this can be... it seems to never work out like I planned... like we planned. 

One day it will all come together... first place desire in the backwards marathon... that's all we can ask for... 

It's raining... it's raining... it's raining... it's raining... 
When the sun comes up, it's still raining. 
Slowly grow... weeds turn into... smiling trance... never mentioned 

The early love seems to become jaded... I'm never expecting this... dance for the mirror, imagination towards the stars... the endless desire for my one and only true love... dreams won't let go... thoughts will not change... can't watch it fly away.",Backwards Marathon,2005
Between the Buried and Me,"Croakies 
Boatshoes 
Collars up 
Daddy's money increased my social status 
""Dang, my loafer got smudged"" 
We are the suburban elite 
""Hey where y'all wanna meet?"" 

I've got something to fucking prove man 
I've really gotten something to prove 
Dude, brah, lets go party tonight 
Maybe start another goddamn fight 
But its alright, my coach knows the sheriff 

Don't stare 

At my car 
At my shirt 
At my girl",Croakies and Boatshoes,2005
Between the Buried and Me,"The road is dry I'm fucking delirious right now 
Life goes on glorious evening of nodding and jumping starts 
I need to make a personal dance party. 
The brain works very weird at this hour 
Not the best time for lyrics I suppose keep writing, keep dreaming. 

Nope, can't be awake and dream, drift in and out, in and out. 

Eye motions in out heat lightning, 
Scares us both the only two people awake at this fucking hour 
I won't remember this in the morning at least I wrote this all down 
Please pick the right song the one 
That keeps the eyes wide creepy yes, 
Creepy the idea of control controlling death 
With alertness when is the fucking sun coming up. 

Then it all changes, same scenery 
But sun involved shouldn't be much different 
Alaska the brain works very weird at this hour. 
Tick tock tick tock the rain is pouring now wide awake 
At least for now nature can be the death of me 
A thing we'll never overcome in out in out.",Alaska,2006
