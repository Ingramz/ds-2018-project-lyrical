Rhonda Thomas,"Hush now don't explain
I know you raise Cain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
You mixed with some dame
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you and what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat
But right and wrong don't matter when you're with me sleep

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours love
Don't explain",Ill Wind,2003
Rhonda Thomas,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Rhonda Thomas,"The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, ""Now, listen, Jack
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top""
The buzzard told the monkey, ""You're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free""
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
""Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie""

Rhonda Vincent,"One fine day as I was a-walkin' down the street
Spied a beggar man with rags upon his feet
Took a penny from my pocket
In his tin cup I did drop it
I heard him say as I made my retreat

[Chorus:]
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with his toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

The laundry man is really on his toes
Found a hundred-dollar bill among my clothes
When he called me I came a-runnin'
Gave him back his dime for phonin'
I heard him sayin' as I turned to go

[Chorus]

I was way behind one day to catch the train
Taxi driver said ""We'll make it just the same""
The speed cop made it with us
And as he wrote out the ticket
I stood by politely a-waitin' for my change

[Chorus x3]",May the Bird of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose,
Rhonda Vincent,"Way back in the hills, as a boy I once wandered
Buried deep in her grave lies the one that I love
She was called from this earth, a jewel for Heaven
More precious than diamonds, more precious than gold

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the Angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

When a girl of sixteen, we courted each other
She promised some night to become my sweet wife
I bought her a ring to wear on her finger
But the Angels, they called her to Heaven one night

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the Angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

This world has its wealth, its trials and troubles
Mother earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
But she can't hold the soul of one precious jewel
She's resting in peace in that Heavenly home

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the Angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

Wow baby
",Precious Jewel,1991
Rhonda Vincent,"My heart can sing when I pause to remember
A heartache here is but a stepping stone
Along a path that's winding always upward
This troubled world is not my final home.

But until then my heart will go on singing
Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold my Saviour
Until the day God calls me home.

The things of earth will dim and lose their value
If we recall they're borrowed for a while

Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold my Saviour
Until the day God calls me home...",Until Then,1991

Rhonda Vincent,"I don't mind to give you a slow dance or two
I'm sorry I'm not at my best
I know you can see I'm incredibly blue
But I'm not that lonely yet

I look in your eyes while you're dancing with me
And try to fulfill your request
But don't ask for favors when it's time to leave
Cause I'm not that lonely yet

Now don't say you want me
I've heard that before
The words weigh like stones in my head
There may come a time when I'll think of you more
But I'm not that lonely yet

To waltzes again
And maybe it helps to forget

Rhonda Vincent,"You're a midnight angel,
At twelve is when you start.
Searching for a victim,
To feed your hungry heart.
You say you don't love me,
Still, I wait all alone.
For my midnight angel to come home.

It seems I've spent a life time,
Between midnight and dawn.
Watching from my window,
For someone to bring you home.
Listening to the silence,
While waiting all alone.
For my midnight angel to come home.

I see you through my window,
As he is bringing you home.
You know that I'll be waiting,
And you know I'll be alone.
But come tomorrow morning,
You'll look and find me gone.
Goodbye my midnight angel from now on.

It seems I've spent a life time,
Between midnight and dawn.
Watching from my window,
For someone to bring you home.

That I'm glad to have you out of my sight
I laugh all day long and say I'm glad you're gone

Rhonda Vincent,"Tonight the rain that's falling
Only adds to my heartache
It runs quietly down my window
Like the tears upon my face
And each time the lightning flashes
And I hear the thunder roar
I'm reminded of the closing of the door

I'm not over you
The storm still rages
The waves of pain remind me
That we're through
I'm slowly drowning
In a sea of endless heartbreak
I'm going under
'Cause I'm not over you

I keep holding to your memory
But my hopes are sinking fast
The chance that you'll come back to me
Now fades into the past
Can I find a way to let you go
Somewhere down deep inside
By reaching for the healing hands of time

I'm not over you
The storm still rages
The waves of pain remind me
That we're through

In a sea of endless heartbreak
I'm going under
'Cause I'm not over you

Rhonda Vincent,"I met someone I need to talk about
Never been so certain, with so many doubts
My heart's afraid to be alone with him
In late night hours, when the lights are dim

[Chorus]
If you were me
Would you take that kind of chance
Step into his arms and dance
Into the night
If you were me
Would you let your feelings go
Or hold him back and never know
If you were me

I've always played it safe with this heart of mine
Same old kind of romance time after time
And now he's calling from the wilder side
Last night I felt like if I'd only tried

In your loneliness
Do you miss my kiss
Need my arms to hold you tight
From your easy chair
No one seems to care
Not so easy there tonight

And I close my eyes and see

That the pain that you feel
We both share until
Your own heart sets you free

Rhonda Vincent,"Mama knows the highway by the songs
When she hears a good one, she always sings along
She don't ever worry 'bout what's gone
She says, ""Good country music will never steer you wrong""

She talks to the truckers with her lights
Maybe just a little bit more on Saturday nights
She knows a good road to paradise
And that's just enough to keep the highway bright

Yeah, Mama knows the highway now by heart
She can see the rain before it starts
Looking clear through a windshield full of stars

She can tell Wyoming by the wind
She can tell another trucker by the rig that he's in
She knows how to watch the river bends
She knows where the real South begins

Well, Mama knows the highway now by heart
She can see the rain before it starts
Looking clear through a windshield full of stars
Mama knows the highway now by heart

She can gauge a cafe just by looking at the sign
Little old places always share the grand design

Rhonda Vincent,"Way back when it all began
With muscle, wood and steel
Mighty man tamed the land
With a horse that rode on wheels

It broke the heart of the red man
And made a name for Jesse James
A mark was left forever
By the passing of the train

As a little child, my thoughts ran wild
As I clung to Mama's dress
As the train grew near the engineer
Waved my fears to rest

He tipped his hat and pulled the cord
And blew a long refrain
Around midnight I'd be dreaming
Of the passing of the train

Clickety clack heating up the track
Can't you hear that whistle scream?
She's a-letting you know just how she feels
With a belly full of steam

All aboard who's going aboard
It'll never be the same
It's a downright lonesome feeling
With the passing of the train

That old caboose, they cut it loose
And ain't gonna bring it back
It sits beside the towns that died
Along a million miles of track

We're always late when we get there
So we'd sooner hop a plane
But anyone who's heard that whistle
Mourns the passing of the train

Clickety clack heating up the track
Can't you hear that whistle scream?
She's a-letting you know just how she feels
With a belly full of steam

All aboard who's going aboard
It'll never be the same

Rhonda Vincent,"Lately I've been living with my heart on the mend
Last thing I wanted was to try love again
But then you backed me up against the wall
Next thing I knew, I was takin' the fall

[Chorus]
I wasn't lookin' to jump into love
But I had no choice when your push came to shove
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I fell for you
Tell me what else could I do

Boy when I saw you I looked the other way
He could be trouble's what I heard myself say
When my resistance hit an all time low
Guess your persistence just wouldn't let me go

And the love you left with your goodbye
I spend my lonely nights
Telling stars in the night about you and I
I thought if I wished hard enough
I could've found my way back to your arms
I guess the love written ever so deep in my heart
Was never written in the stars

I've tried counting every one
Just passing the time until the dawn
But some stars are bound to fall
I see them drop from the sky
Through the tears in my eyes
Here we are so far apart
Like the miles between the moon and Mars
I guess the love written ever so deep in my heart
Was never written in the stars

I wonder if it's true
That only fools believe in destiny
I know I believed in you
And now Fate has made a fool of me

It's hard for me to walk away from all we could've had

I'm at the corner of walk and don't walk and I can't make up my mind
One way leads me back to you and one leaves you behind

Frolic and discuss the coming days.
When I would go out on my own for all the world to see.

Keep your feet on the ground, what goes up must come down.
And solitaire's a lonely game when there's no one else around.
Keep Jesus on the Throne of life no matter where you're bound.
He will always help you keep your feet upon the ground.

The years have travelled by me, and tomorrow's gonna wait.
Made a few mistakes along the way.
But whenever things get really tough, I think back on the times.

I hear the wind a-blowing through the lonesome pine
And I know my love is gone too

And it always haunts me with a breeze

And they live like Christians on the Sabbath day
But come Monday morning, till the coming Sunday

If you don't love your neighbor
If you gossip about him, if you never have mercy
If he gets into trouble, and you don't try to help him
Then you don't love your neighbor

There's a special warning in the 35th verse

Oh you don't love God
If you don't love your neighbor
If you gossip about him, if you never have mercy
If he gets into trouble, and you don't try to help him
Then you don't love your neighbor
And you don't love God

There's a God Almighty, and you've got to love him
If you want salvation and a home on high
If you say you love him while you hate your neighbor
Then you don't have religion, you just told a lie

Oh you don't love God

If you gossip about him, if you never have mercy
If he gets into trouble, and you don't try to help him

But when He calls me, I will go
And leave my brothers and dear sisters here below

All at once I'll be rejoicing with the angels
Resting in the promise that someday
We'll meet again face to face
In the Last Best Place

Some folks dream, of growing old
Contented with their treasures in some mansion
There are those, weary souls
Who search in vain to satisfy their passion

Some can't wait to ride that train to glory
And see St. Peter at the pearly gates
But for me, God's embrace
Is the Last Best Place

I will sing by His grace
In the Last Best Place.

I said, 'how do you do it?'
He said, 'there's bad with the good.'
And no matter how tough it gets,
The soldier stands strong.
Keeping our family, flag and country free,
And righting the wrong.

I met a soldier, she was thanking me.
At first it was strange to hear,
Then I started to see.
What it meant to have someone
Appreciate her sacrifice,
And everything she gives for us,
Defending our rights.

-CHORUS-
God bless the soldier
As they walk the streets.
Let them know how much it means
To have them keep our country free.

When you meet a soldier, stand and salute.
Take a moment to show your love
For everything that they do.
Don't be afraid, give them your praise.
For this is the stranger that is willing
To give their life for you.

For she'd held the hand of Jesus everyday,

As they welcomed one so fair,

It seemed I saw Her Smile,

In the little church the crowd began to swell
Quite a send off for a simple country farmer
For many loved and knew the old man well

She bravely walked to where his body lay
A hush fell over all that stood around her
She smiled through tears as she began to say

I will see you again
For this isn?t the end
You?re my forever friend
And I will see you again

Ever since a simple carpenter from Nazareth
Walked the mountains and the shores of Galilee
Ever since he died and rose again on Easter
Death doesn?t have the same old victory

Tonight I?ll lay my head upon his pillow
And cry until the breaking of the day
But even in the pain of separation
There?s a hope inside my heart that lets me say

When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard

I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

A candle glows,

Someone will come to show the way,
I believe, I believe.

I believe above the storm a smallest prayer
Will still be heard,
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word,
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry,
Or touch a leaf, or see the sky,
Then I know why,

Into the blue my heart will lead
To find that place again where I won't be lonely,
Where the mountains and valleys and rivers whisper your name.

Echos, they travel so fast
Speaking so clear of the past.
Telling me I have a long way to go
Before I will find you at last.

I'm coming home again, home to you.
While the waves carry my dreams on through the night.
The sea is dark and cold and goes on forever,
But the moon and the stars and the sun will show me the way.
I'm coming home again.

The pain and the hurt and the tears,
The longing I've felt through the years,
The road I have travelled so blindly before,
Is now leading back to your door.

I'm coming home again, home to you,
And the mountains and valleys and rivers that whisper your name.
I'll find that place again, where I won't be lonely,
And the moon and stars and the sun will show me the way.

Rhydian,"To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest
To follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far

To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march into Hell
For a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable, the unreachable, the unreachable star

And I'll always dream the impossible dream
And yes I will reach the unreachable star!

After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking

I can still see you standin' there
Midnight wind blowin' through your hair remember
Kisses sweet in the salty air
When love was forever
Turn the page and we fade to blue
Scene has changed now I'm without you
Well you just walked away when the act was through
And the dream
Was over

It was almost like a movie - the way you said goodbye
You must have spent a lot of time rehearsing each and every line

Now there's not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking - breaking

Not a smile left on my face

And there's not a dry eye
Not a dry eye in the house

The greatest story was you and me
We had it all we had everything
But now the story's done, it's just history
The last act is over
Your every line had the sweetest sound
Your every touch turned my world around
But then the light came up and my world crashed down
End of show - it's over
It was almost like a movie, those nights we touched the stars
Time stood still for you and I now it's sad enough to make you cry

And there's not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking - breaking
Not a smile left on my face
The ending's just to sad to take
And there's not a dry eye

Act One: The story's just begun
Act Two: I fell in love with you
Act Three: Knew it was meant to be
Act Four: You don't love me no more

Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking - breaking

I pray we'll find your light, and hold it in our hearts
And stars go out each night, remind us where you are
Let this be our prayer when shadows fill our day
Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

A world where pain and sorrow will be ended
And every heart that's broken will be mended
And we'll remember we are all God's children
Reaching out to touch you, reaching to the sky

We ask that life be kind, and watch us from above
We hope each soul will find, another soul to love

In a perfect light
If you just imagine living in a world

That's when we'll reach for stars we never knew were there

Will she be strong enough to fly, to soar

And you are watching over me from up above

Fly me up to where you are
Beyond the distant star

To see you smile
For now I love the world, I know you're there

Here inside my dream
And isn't faith believing
All power can't be seen

As my heart holds you
Just one beat away
I cherish all you gave me everyday
'Cause you are my

And I believe
That angels breathe
And that love will live on and never leave

Two steps from the border line
Anything closer will kiss the nine
Think I'm out the game? You out of your mind
'cause I stay on track, like transit line
Keep it nappy or braided up
Dirty in the cockpit, blazin' up
Stop frontin' when you made it up
Tellin' all my hoes, you can't spray it up
Hah, huggin' nuts like tighty whites
Still trickin' on hoes like Heidi Fleiss
You know why niggas don't give you much respect
'cause they seen you gettin' slapped with the empty gat
Know Dirt, like bow know death
When I'm huntin' down, birds of rap
Hate Dog, 'cause I ate your cat
And you can eat my ass and have a coke with that
Use a spoon, unless you want a fork
Pull my dick out, watch the room get dark
Stay high with the zombie walk
Gotta sit my ass down, like Rosa Parks

They say dirt and sunshine make the flowers grow
I say, fuck a bitch raw and drive your nut on the floor
Call it what you want, you son of a hoe

3, 2, 1, I can lick the sun with my tongue
Pull it out and smack a nigga, just for thinkin' I'm done
Shut your trap, razor blade cut your wrap
Fat girls seen my comin', started tuckin' their flab

The day he got to heaven, track mud on the carpets
Hot like the hot potato, you niggas ain't motto
You hot as the spot, yo
Go to the show, for hot dogs and nacho's
This me and Dirt Dog's style, it's not yours

Test my manhood, go get my dick ruler

Has she ever tried fuckin' under water

Let me just, remind you, who the hell you lyin to 
Said that you was goin out with Claire 
I called Claire (Hello?) she was at home, you wasn't there 
I'm like ahh hell naw, dawg she wouldn't dare 
Dare she did, went to the club, there she is 
That's my word, I started thinkin all absurd 
I started listenin to Tank like {""Maybe I Deserve""} 
Yeah yeah I cheated once, twice, maybe three 
But hey, that ain't the point, we ain't talkin 'bout me 
Don't change subjects and claim you love 'Fest 
When every other day I don't know who you gon' fuck next 
I'm thinkin you my girl, my lady, my boo 
Tell me admit nothin, we can work this through - psych! 

[Chorus: Mario + (Rhymefest)] 
Are we, really sure (yeah, yeah) 
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure

Hey hey I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere 

[Rhymefest] 
Oh you don't think you need game, homey you better have it 
Cause women cheat like men, only they better at it 
You kiss your girl on the cheek, thinkin she sweet 
She got a man to meet at least for every day of the week 
Monday - she with Larry, he think he slicker than hair grease 
Big daddy with a Caddy and he rockin his hair piece 
He like to show off, he's spendin the bucks 
But she ain't even gotta fuck him cause he cain't get it up 
Tuesday - she with Claude, he on some treat her like a lady shit 
Chivalrous, pull the chair out and he's always there to babysit 
So - Wednesday and Thursday - she can go out and dance 
And if she met me, she probably had a one night stand 
Friday - she back wit'chu, kissin and cuddlin 
Talkin 'bout her hard week and lookin for love again 
Now I ain't tryin to tell you that you wrong for keepin her 
All I'm tryin to say is you don't own her, you leasin her 

[Chorus: Mario + (Rhymefest)]

Look I'ma sing it one mo' time - man, don't get distracted 
Your woman cheat like you, only she better at it 
She come up with the plan befo'hand, befo' you even ask 
""Where was yo' ass?"" She tell you where she been and then 
Give you a hug, backrub, run the water for the tub 
By now, you done forgot she was a thug? 
Wait, you need some help stud 
Yo' girl wearin perfume and spandex like 
I'm goin to the health club with Sheryl 
(You know Sheryl!) Yeah you know Sheryl 
With two baby daddies, one for her and one for yo' girl 
And the whole world knows, but they cain't convince him 
That's his baby momma and he's so defensive 
She ride around in the Benz and spend them ends up 
Took me to the mall, I was so expensive! 
I ain't tryin to tell you not to give her your best 
But you might wanna still have a paternity test 

[Chorus: Mario + (Rhymefest)] 
Are we, really sure (are we really sure) 
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure

Do I, really care, hey hey hey 
I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere

Mr. Blue Collar, yeah... you know what?
It's time for me to give a testament to where I came from
The streets of Chicago, Southside
Yeah, Mr. Blue Collar
I gotta do it like this

You can take the boy outta slum, can't take slum outta son
I should be lynched, I'm so high-strung
At 15 my mother tried to have me aborted
You gotta kill us both doc, I'm not the only one
It's a package deal, comin up like a pack of rats
Fightin over scraps, the streets is ill
Take a trip to the city of wind, the city of sin
My block'll have you born again
But it ain't like church, life hurts
Drug raids, she stuffin rocks down her baby's diapers
It go the other way too when your mother's on hype
And you gotta serve her blow 'fore you go to school
So I spit like a fool to the chorus
Military jail time all they got for us
I seen how they deal every Hoover and Jeff Ford (how?)
Lock up all our leaders, let the ghetto eat us
I'm the ghetto Regis, in Che-vy Caprices
And niggaz that front can get blown to little pieces
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know why? Cause it's

[Chorus]
All I do - workin hard for scratch
Talk shit get your jaw deattached
All I do - though I'm still in the streets a bit
A brother ain't fin' to take no shit
All I do - lil' buddy, this could get ugly
Trust me, cause this is
All I do - before I explode, I give you my ode
In the summer, rain, fall or cold

Spittin bars is felt to carve wealth
And stay hungry to the death I will starve my-self
To keep what I got and have what I want
And stay real them my niggaz knowin half of 'em don't got
The gift to ball, a rhymers fit
Thought we still want the finest shit (all I do)
Is take whitey's bread, keep a nice spread
Hit the club and try to leave without bustin no heads
I don't care about a deal, I've been poor all my life
Cocksucker I ain't afraid of how the shit feel
Sit still, soak the moment in
You got somethin bad to say, nigga hold it in
You afraid to die? You ain't a soldier then

What should I do to like, get her to come my way 
Write back soon, your biggest fan, Rhyme-fest

Have you ever met a girl, come into your world 
Cat put your brain on sterile 
Activate and leave stains like curls 
Sophisticate, and make you feel so world 
Ah, there it is, so liberated 
Ridin' in a sports car, so ventilated 
Joggin' in a sports bra, so titillated 
Chick so cool, but not refrigerated 
Look McGirt, I don't wanna trouble ya 
But this chick on my block, I'm in love with her 
I wanna get up in her Bush like Dubya 
Tryin' to get up in her Bush like Dubya

I just wanna talk to her 
But I'm me and this girl is so popular 
It's a dirty game, me has binoculars 
From a distance I just started watchin' her 
Then I met her at Hills on the Southside 
Bought her chicken and fries, with coleslaw aside 
She ain't say thanks enough, that's all pride 
I don't care about her man, I just let it slide 
I just think about fuckin' you everyday 
And just sink in the back of my Chevrolet 
All that chicken you ate and you never paid 
Take my order, can I have a breast or leg? 
Would you fin' to say no, oh, how's that so? 
After I came here and spent all my dough? 
""Look boy it's chicken, what is you broke?"" 
Then I got scared and said it's a joke 
Gave her a hug and stole her coat 

[Chorus] 

[Rhymefest] 
Dear Dirty, thanks for the advice and everything man 
It didn't really work out with this chick this time 
She wasn't that buttercup, she was just another slut man 
But you know what? I'm just gonna say forget about it man 
I'ma go get a movie, you haven't seen ""Harry Met Sally"" yet? 
It's kinda like what I'm goin through, aww, whatever 
C'mon! 

Yeah 
This is for everybody lookin' for that perfect girl man 
Sometimes you ain't got all the money in the world 
And you ain't got all the looks in the world but 
You can still find that buttercup 
Don't let her build you up and break you down man 
You build it up, whatever, yo freak for me 
Make sure she like to fuck though, heh

Wanted to go to college but no money was nothin' new 
Wanted to get away go see the world and do somethin' new 
He got approached in the mall by the army recruit 
Told him ""If you wanna go to school we got money too 
Sign up at eighteen you be you when you twenty-two"" 
He joined the army airborne got his uniform went to boot camp got some 
Discipline Iraq is where they shipped him 
He's in the mission where bullets flyin' and missin' him 
Wishin' he was a kid again with his family in Michigan 
In the midst of fightin' militiamen, one round took down six of them 
He ain't really a killa though, takin' a lotta risks 
This is what a poor person do for a scholarship 
He turned around and got a face full of hollow-tips 
But don't be mad, he died for the flag

Now what you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target 
And it won't be long before, you're pullin' yourself away

Papa was a playa, knew just what to say ta' 
Get the women back to his lair, and lay her 
If sex had a trophy he's the Hiesman touchdown 
Hittin' models and be	-chicks in Buzztown 
He got the women with crazy stares with his lady there 
Thay ain't care they like ""Ooh look at his baby hair"" 
He took 'em all put 'em in a line hit five new chickens 
He though they was fine 
Got head from five dope fiends smokin' a dime 
And did it all raw dog, and dog I ain't lyin' 
Til' he woke up one season with legions 
He went to the doctor asked him what was the reason 
The test read positive he couldn't believe it 
He tried to blame God askin' why did he leave him 
Pleadin' please let the disease leave him 
From women that he conquered, he caught the monster

Now when the sun goes down, north side of town 
On the other side of the block, when cops ain't around 
On the same side of the street that 'Pac hit the ground 
Not in Vegas, cause every nigga got 'Pac in him now 
When my guys hit the block, and we provin' we thugs 
I ain't on no swim team but you see pools of blood 
Skip Judy when you die, she ain't whose the judge 
If you married to game then prove your love 
Here's a strap shorty, shoot it do it then do it 
This ain't a game this a organized movement 
My hurt, my love, my pain, my stress 
My strife, my wife, my life, my test 
We made for more, we die for less 
When you starvin' in the ghetto I'ma right the rest 
See my girl think I'm hard, and my Momma think I'm hard

Nice car, no gas, stuck at the pump
Had a lil' hot single now he's stuck in a slump
At the top of his section eight, straight waitin to jump
Like Milli Vanilli, now people just look at him silly
Sayin ""That's umm - I forgot his name - who is he?""
He wanted (mooore) never really thought of the loss

Yeah, this song right here 
Is about a lot of different - people, women I know 
Family members, things we go through, why'know? 
And, it just means that, sister I understand 
You can't have trials without tribulations 
And umm, sometimes we just need God to work that out 
I'm a kick it like this, look 

This beat reminds me of a lounge, on a Wednesday night 
Shorty chillin' at the bar ain't have no friends in sight 
I rolls up like, ""Damn girl, what you in tonight?"" 
She looked up said, ""This ain't how I wanna spend my life"" 
Tears in her face, fear in her face 
Man this ain't about love, she was feelin' disgraced 
She said, ""In five years I got three kids, two different dads 
I'm pregnant now and I don't know who the father is"" 
Heavy thing, she was tellin' me everything 
Her mother became a widow before she got the wedding ring 
Shorty was locked in a prison, I wanted to set her free 
But I couldn't, so I sat and listened 
With no intermission, I didn't interrupt her 
To tell the truth, originally I just wanted to fuck her 
But, heh, I was like damn girl, you gon' be okay? 
She turned around and said

This world don't treat you, right, yeah 
And sister, I know that he left you 
With too many, responsibilities, yeah

Look, love don't love nobody 
Drugs don't love nobody, so why you put that shit in your body? 
Now we can't have a decent conversation 
Cause she always shakin' 
I tried to deny it at first, it bothers me now 
Don't ask for money, you done ten dollar'd me out 
I even took yo' kids when they put you out the last house 
But I will not babysit while you in a crack house! 
And I would hate, to turn 'em over to the state 
Look what I did, I let they bad-ass stay and just tear up my crib 
While you hurt me child, horribly 
He asked me why my momma love drugs more than me 
I couldn't answer, I sat back and peered in the sky 
I thought it was rainin, but damn, there was tears in my eyes 
He was like you gon' be alright Uncle Che? 
I'm like man, look 

[Chorus: Mike Payne] 
Yeah, sister, don't you know 
You're worth, more than gold (way more than gold) yeah 
And sister, don't you know

Where can I start? Start at the part
Me at the part, playin' this part
Provin' this role, waitin' on old
Just got fronted at eight for that blow

Now you run the pot, watch me rock
Back on the block with a few in the sock
Doing the heavy, cops in the Chevy
Scopin' his every move already

Smooth and deadly, cool his belly
Probably get popped right in front of the deli
The ghetto to mallon, his tools was heavy
His crew was ready to do whatevy

Got juice but not tryin' to turn in the power
Ain't burnin' the pot, now you watchin' me rock

Chop, stop, you pop, we cops

Only thirteen, he ain't know what it mean
But he lovin' the green the American dream

His momma says stop, his father was hot
Couldn't just stop 'cause he coulda got shot
They move him down south to straighten him out
And he's still selling dope by the big warmer house

Jenny was bad, she stayed on suspension
Hung around guys, she liked that attention
Give her daddy an honorable mention
He wrote her letters while he was in prison

Brother ain't home, momma was gone
Working them doubles, now she all alone
Stuck at the crib with no food or a phone
What you thinkin'? Your girl gon' be on

Party at Jam's house, people would come
Sippin' that scissor, hitten them blunts
Underage kids could come and get drunk
Did I hit it? Well, maybe just once

She had a boyfriend, they was in love
He had a job, he was sellin' the
Same shit's on the streets
Now she gettin' two letters a week singin'

What is the loneliest number that you'll ever do?
When your looking for love and daddy ain't there to hug
And two is the loneliest number is as bad as one
When your hurtin' your soul thinking you're makin' a feelin' at home but

When ? your home is gonna get stole

It don't matter, we ball like we athletic
On the run from the cops till we asthmatic
In a house with a bill ?

This ain't nothin' but life for ghetto youths
That I'm writing spitting this little booth
If I lie, I still mix it with little truth
When I go down, nigga, I'm living proof

Don't get mad 'cause I'm stuck in this glory
And y'all rappers ain't go nothing to for me

My favorite winter coat

I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top

It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

And a washed-out dream

The times we shared together holding hands
And walking in the park
Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then

That I love you more today

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away the first time
When we fell in love

Although some time has passed
I still remember just like it was yesterday
But time is movin' fast
The love I had for you time won't ever change
I'll always feel the same
Now until the end

Memories we share will live forever
Deep inside my heart I know I'll never forget

Wiped the tears away the first time

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Rhythmakers,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1991

Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number

And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way

Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers

They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap

You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out

I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string

When a film comes on that she wants to see

It's Monday morning 5. 19
And I'm still wondering where she's been
Cause every time I try to call
I just get her machine
And now it's almost 6 a.m.
And I don't want to try again
Cause if she's still not back
And then this must be the end
At first I guess she's gone to Cannes
Her silver pack of cigarettes
A pint of milk, food for the cat
But it's midnight now and she's still not back
** repeat

Cause if she's still not back
Well, heaven knows what then
Is this the end

In the back of someone else's car

Oh, you shouldn't left him touch you there

Get married settle down and have some kids and be a good housewife.
But she would go to bed at night,
With day-glo stars and fairy lights stuck on the ceiling of her room,
As she dreamt of another life.

Now it's too late to go back home,
It's saccharine and silicone, for a broken barbie doll.
Sleeping pills and alcohol, and nights she'd rather not recall,
For a broken barbie doll.

And though the hands that played with her were cold,
She let them drag her down.
And as her cardboard world begins to fold,
She's lying on the ground,

Now it's too late to go back home,
It's saccharine and silicone, for a broken barbie doll.
Sleeping pills and alcohol, and nights she'd rather not recall,
For a broken barbie doll.

Rialto,"Back when she was a girl there was a plan to see her through her life:
Get married settle down and have some kids and be a good housewife.
But she would go to bed at night,
with day-glo stars and fairy lights stuck on the ceiling of her room,
as she dreamt of another life.
Now it's too late to go back home,
it's saccharine and silicone, for a broken barbie doll.
Sleeping pills and alcohol, and nights she'd rather not recall,
for a broken barbie doll.
And though the hands that played with her were cold,
she let them drag her down.
And as her cardboard world begins to fold,
she's lying on the ground,
Now it's too late to go back home,
Her mother writes her every week,
she says she's worried for her health.

You get that nagging hunger,

We ain't got our weather proofs on but we're feeling strong
A belly full of hope, lie back and you will float
Drifting on your dream boat to a distant land
And if we can't make it home, we'll sleep on the paving stones

Happy just to be there, beneath the starlit dome

It's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself, where is she?
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her
But I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh well

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions

Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic

My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure, they tell me

Holy clouds, playful light, so reluctant in silent flight
Fragile skin, stroking hands left in doubt with no demands

So hard to meet, sweet sensation, paradoxical dream
Curious creatures in between

Tonight, you're full of sorry

Moonlight swims in bitter sweet

And propositions that you fear

'Cause

[Chorus]

I would do anything
To hold on to you
That's just about anything
That you want me to

I'd hold on to you
Until you take it all in stride
I'd hold on to you
'Til you want to stay here

By my side
'Cause

[Chorus: x2]

(You're emotion in motion)
Emotion in motion
You're emotion in motion

Ric Ocasek,"You were my silver you were my gold
You were all the things that cant be told
You were my star falling through the night
You were the one who showed me grand delight
I cant see you but I need you
And you're gone
You were my right hand you were my friend
You were always strong until the end
You were my good time you were my rave

You're the one that always set the stage
You're what I once new now I miss you
'Cause you're gone
Now I spend my lonely nights
Wishing you were here to make things right
To turn my darkness into light
You were my party you were my tea
You're the one that had faith in me",Silver,2005
Ric Ocasek,"You got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend
When I was down you just stood there grinnin'
You got a lot of nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend
You just wanna be on the side that's winnin'

You say I let you down, you know it's not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason that you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd you're in with
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street, you always act surprised
You say, 'how are you, good luck,' but you don't mean it
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it

No I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
Now I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place
Can't you understand that's not my problem

Well I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
You know what a drag it is to see you



",Intro,2015
Ric Sanders,"Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time
For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time
For who knows how my love grows?
And who knows where the time goes?",Who Knows Where the Time Goes?,1995
Ric Seaberg,"She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting

She's sitting with you but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see, what you think you're getting for free?
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter, if you're in it for love you ain't gonna get too far

Oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh, here she comes
She's a man eater

Oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh, here she comes
She's a man eater

I wouldn't if I were you, I know what she can do
She's deadly man, and she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
The beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

Oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh, here she comes
She's a man eater",Maneater,2005
Ric Slagle,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way,2008
Ric Slagle,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son
Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me

Ricardo Acosta,"Una novela nuestra vida siempre fue
Nunca supiste mis ternuras comprender
Ya no me extrañan
Tus trampas de mujer

Una novela tan difícil de contar 
Que escribimos capítulos de amor 
Mi corazón, lloraba de dolor

Yo como actor 
Muy pasito
Tu como actriz 
Lo máximo fingiste bien 
Por tanto tiempo 
Yo te creo­

En tu papel sintónica 
Yo solamente aplaudo 
El perdedor, fue­ yo 
Pues aún te amo

Una novela 
Tan romántica y tan cruel 
Queda escrita
Con mis lagrimas lo sé
Más no me quejo, mi destino así es

Yo como actor 
Muy pasito  
Tu como actriz 
Lo máximo, fingiste bien 
Por tanto tiempo yo te creí

Ricardo Arjona,"Ayer, Jesús afino mi guitarra y agudizo mis sentidos, me inspiro
Papel y lápiz en mano, apunto la canción y me negue a escribir
Porque hablar y escribir sobre Jesús es redundar, seria mejor actuar
Luego, algo me dijo que la única forma de no redundar es decir la verdad
Decir que Jesús es acción y movimiento, no cinco letras formando un nombre
Decir que a Jesús le gusta que actuemos, no que hablemos
Decir que Jesús es verbo no sustantivo

Jesús es mas que una simple y llana teoría
¿que haces hermano leyendo la biblia todo el día?
Lo que ahí esta escrito se resume en amor, vamos ve y practicalo
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo no sustantivo
Jesús es mas que un templo de lujo con tendencia barroca
El sabe que total a la larga esto no es mas que roca
La iglesia se lleva en el alma y en los actos no se te olvide
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo no sustantivo
Jesús es mas que persignarse hincarse y hacer de esto alarde
El sabe que quizá por dentro la conciencia les arde
Jesús es mas que una flor en el altar salvadora de pecados
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo no sustantivo
Jesús es mas que un grupo de señoras de muy negra conciencia

Que pretenden ganarse el cielo con club de beneficencia
Si quieres tu ser miembro activa tendrás que presentar a la directiva
Tu cuenta de ahorros en suiza y vínculos oficiales
Jesús convertía en hechos todos sus sermones
Que si tomas café es pecado dicen los mormones
Tienen tan poco que hacer que andan inventando cada cosa
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo no sustantivo
Jesús no entiende por que en el culto le aplauden
Hablan de honestidad sabiendo que el diezmo es un fraude
A Jesús le da asco el pastor que se hace rico con la fe
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo no sustantivo
Me bautizaron cuando tenia 2 meses y a mi no me avisaron
Hubo fiesta piñata y a mi no me lo preguntaron
Bautizame tu Jesús por favor, así entre amigos
Se que odias el protocolo hermano mio

De mi barrio la mas religiosa era doña carlota
Hablaba de amor al prójimo y me pincho cien pelotas
Desde niño fui aprendiendo que la religión no es mas que un método
Con el titulo ""prohibido pensar"" que ya todo esta escrito
Señores no dividan la fe las fronteras son para los países
En este mundo hay mas religiones que niños felices
Jesús pensó ""me haré invisible para que todos mis hermanos
Dejen de estar hablando tanto de mi y se tiendan la mano""
Jesús eres el mejor testigo del amor que te profeso
Tengo la conciencia tranquila por eso no me confieso
Rezando 2 padres nuestros el asesino no revive a su muerto
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo no sustantivo
Jesús no bajes a la tierra quédate ahí arriba
Todos lo que han pensado como tu hoy están boca arriba
Olvidados en algún cementerio, de equipaje sus ideales
Murieron con la sonrisa en los labios
Porque fueron verbo y no sustantivo","Jesús, Verbo No Sustantivo",1992
Ricardo Arjona,"No se acaba el amor, solo con decir adiós
Hay que tener presente, que el estar ausente
No anula el recuerdo, ni compra el olvido
Ni nos borra del mapa

El que tu no estés, no te aparta de mí
Entre menos te tengo
Mas te recuerdo aunque quiera olvidarte
Estas en mi mente, why me pregunto 1000 veces

Por qué es tan cruel el amor
Que no me deja olvidar, que me prohíbe pensar
Que me ata why desata why luego de a poco me mata
Me bota, why levanta why me vuelve a tirar

Por qué es tan cruel el amor, que no me deja olvidar
Porque aunque tu ya no estés
Se mete en mi sangre, why se va de rincón en rincón
Arañándome el alma why rasgando el corazón

Por qué es tan cruel el amor
No se acaba el amor, solo porque no estas
No se puede borrar así como así nuestra historia
Seria matar la memoria why quemar nuestras glorias

Por qué es tan cruel el amor
Que no me deja olvidar, que me prohíbe pensar
Que me ata why desata why luego de a poco me mata
Me bota, why levanta why me vuelve a tirar

Por qué es tan cruel el amor
Que no me deja olvidar, porque aunque tu ya no estés
Se mete en mi sangre, why se va de rincón en rincón
Arañándome el alma, why rasgando el corazón
Por qué es tan cruel el amor

Por qué es tan cruel el amor
Que no me deja olvidar que me prohíbe pensar
Que me ata why desata why luego de a poco me mata
Me bota, why levanta why me vuelve a tirar

Ricardo Arjona,"La de lentes, la pasada de moda
La aburrida, la intelectual
La que prefiere una biblioteca a una discoteca
Es con la que vivo yo

La que todos tachan de fea
Y en el bus nadie le cede el lugar
La que es más que una presea para enseñar
Jamás será modelo de televisión
Porque aún no hacen anuncios para el corazón

Me gusta porque es autentica y vive sin recetas
De esas que tratan de vestir al amor de etiqueta
He venido a parar con la mujer que no soñe jamas
Pero también jamas fui tan feliz

La que ya ni se pinta la boca
Defraudada de coquetear
La que es más que una aguja para enhebrar
Si su enemigo aparece acechando el espejo
Ella le da una sonrisa y aniquila el complejo

Me gusta porque es autentica y vive sin recetas
De esas que tratan de vestir al amor de etiqueta
He venido a parar con la mujer que no soñé jamas
Es una estrella fugaz

Y nuestra cama es un inmenso desierto
Con la vida y la energía de un muerto
Qué voy a hacer conmigo
que difícil es cargar con mi peor enemigo a cuestas 
viviendo de preguntas donde no hay respuestas 
que voy hacer conmigo 

solidario corruptor de mis momentos placidos 
canalla inventor de mis tragedias épicas 
que voy hacer conmigo 
ahora que no estás 

ahora que no estás 
el silencio es un ruido que lastima lentamente mis oídos 
me dio por serte fiel aunque te importe poco 
y hay algo de tu piel en todo lo que toco 
Y nuestro cuarto es almacén de recuerdos
Y nuestra mesa es aeropuerto de moscas
Y nuestra cama es un inmenso desierto
Con la vida y la energía de un muerto

¿qué voy hacer conmigo? 
que difícil es cargar con mi peor enemigo a cuestas

Ricardo Arjona,"El ser un animal nocturno
Era una bella rutina
Conquistar a chicas del jet set
O a mujerzuelas de esquina
Si es que no son la misma cosa
Con diferencia de precio
Entrar a algún bar sin conocer
Ni que me conozcan
Entonar una canción
Y esperar el trago de cortesí­a
Que siempre venia
Era mi filosofí­a

Hasta que un productor
Según él me hizo el favor
De grabarme un disco
Y metió la inspiración en una
Computadora
Y aquel fuego de libertad
En refrigeradora

Me dijeron quí­tate esos jeans y
Esa camisa vaquera
Tendremos que cambiarte de look
Pues ese nadie lo aprueba
Tendrás imagen nueva
Y una prospera carrera

Luciendo siempre cara de mascota
Recién comprada
Salí­a en la tele con cierto dejo
De tristeza en la mirada
Y el alma enfadada
De cantar sin decir nada

Me canse de los representantes
Y cocteles de moda
Me canse de toda esa gente
Que dice que te adora
Das la espalda y te ignora
Me harte de no ser el mismo

Me compre unos cuantos amigos
Una novia y un perro
Los amigos y la novia se fueron
Solo me quedo el perro
Que no tiene prejuicios
Y me acepta como soy

Por eso vine a este bar
Y aquí­ me pagan diez mil pesos
La hora
Tengo un cuarto con balcón
Y hasta una chica que me adora
Y es tanta mi fe que
Aunque no tengo jardí­n
Ya compre una rodadora
Y es tanta mi fe
Que aunque no tengo jardí­n
Ya compre una rodadora",Animal Nocturno,1993

Y que Lucia y la Vero se adoran

Hablan de honestidad sabiendo que el diezmo es un fraude 
A Jesús le da asco el pastor que se hace rico con la fe 
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo, no sustantivo 

De mi barrio la mas religiosa era doña Carlota 
Hablaba de amor al prójimo y me poncho cien pelotas 
Desde niño fui aprendiendo que la religión no es mas que un método 
Con el titulo prohibido pensar que ya todo esta escrito 

Me bautizaron cuando tenia dos meses y a mi no me avisaron 
Hubo fiesta piñata y a mi ni me preguntaron 
Bautizame tu Jesús por favor así entre amigos 
Se que odias el protocolo hermano mio 

Señores no dividan la fe las fronteras son para los países 
En este mundo hay mas religiones que niños felices 
Jesús pensó ""me haré invisible para que todos mis hermanos 
Dejen de estar hablando tanto de mi y se tiendan la mano"" 

Jesús eres el mejor testigo del amor que te profeso 
Tengo la conciencia tranquila por eso no me confieso 
Rezando dos padres nuestros el asesino no revive a su muerto
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo no sustantivo 

Jesús no bajes a la tierra quédate allá arriba 
Todos los que han pensado como tu ya están boca arriba 
Olvidados en algún cementerio, de equipaje sus ideales 
Murieron con la sonrisa en los labios porque fueron 
Verbo y no sustantivo",Jesus Verbo No Sustantivo,1993
Ricardo Arjona,"El ruido de un tren me despierta
Fueron dos horas y media las que dormí;
Y me desayuno un cigarro
Y el espejo me dice estas mas flaco que nunca
Mi cuarto es un caos de objetos
Nada en su lugar 

Haré un mes me cortaron el teléfono
Y esta tele en blanco y negro
No quiere funcionar
Y tu foto ruiseña a un costado
Aunque parezca cursi
Me provoca una lágrima
Y el perro que era mi único amigo
Se buscó; otro amo

Y sigo aquí
Tan solo como un rubio en Harlem 

Y soy libre y no me sirve
Para que quiere la libertad en la luna un tigre
No me sirve
He compartido mi cama cien veces y quiero irme
Que me pasa
A donde vivo desde que no estás ya no le llamo casa 

Cae la noche y todo es silencio
Queda sin nadie la calle treinta y tres
Y esta noche hay que encender una vela
Por no pagar me cortaron la luz
Y para colmo la señora me avisa
Mi alquiler está en mora

Tan irreal que existiría solo en mi mente y nada mas

Why en el circulo vicioso del hombre why sus hazañas

Descubri cosas de buena apariencia pero sin entrañas
El hambre why el caviar bajo sus pestañas
Why mujeres que perfuman su indecencia con Channel
Why disfrazan de Oscar de la Renta un cuerpo infiel

Descubri que aqui el amor es una hipotesis inconclusa
Se que tienen una vaga idea pero sigue difusa
No se como le hacen los poetas para encontrar sus musas
Aqui el hombre es el que tiene mujeres why vida de tormenta
Sin saber que hombre es el que tiene una why la mantiene contenta

Del otro lado del sol hay un mundo en decadencia
No es casualidad que tierra rime con guerra
Del otro lado del sol hay un mundo en decadencia
No es casualidad que humano rime con tirano

Es increible pero aqui nadie se tiende la mano
En mi galaxia la especie se extingue why es inevitable
Abunda el amor pero no hay sol ni agua potable
Mientras ustedes siguen discutiendo el asunto del desarme
A veces Dios le da pan precisamente al que no tiene dientes
Para que su peor castigo sea el dia que te arrepientes

Del otro lado del sol hay un mundo en decadencia

Tú eras la burguesa, la princesa del penthouse
Así lo quiso dios
Te saludaba con mi cara de asustado
Mientras le pedía a dios que se tapara el excusado
Para irte a echar un vistazo
O que te mandara al supermercado
Para ayudarte a cargar lo del mandado
Fui testigo mudo de tus fiestas y aventuras
Te conocí dos doctores, un maestro y hasta un cura
Y un día viendo en la rendija
Vi como te merendabas al del 6
Mientras su mujer mojaba el negligee
Estas acabando con el edificio
Chica del penthouse

Y con toda la ciudad
Estas acabando con el edificio
Chica del penthouse
¿y conmigo por que no?
Era de todos los días esperar que den las 9
Ir al patio de atrás a esperar en la ventana
Tu baño de las mañanas
Que triste era ver aquella sombra al desnudarse
A 12 pisos de mis mejores ganas de tocarte
Pero que iba yo a hacer
Le daba chance a la imaginación
Mientras ya me retumbaba el corazon

Estas acabando con el edificio
Chica del penthouse
Y con toda la ciudad
Estas acabando con el edificio
Chica del penthouse
¿y conmigo por que no?
Me he enamorado de usted
Dígame ahora que hay que hacer
Fumo como un loco y dejado de comer

Muy particular
Me sucedis hare unos meses
En un viejo bar.
Un hola fue suficiente
Para entablar conversacisn
Le improvisi un poema
Inspirado en su diadema
Las intenciones del Don Juan
Ya saben ustedes donde van.
Cuando eran siete las cervezas
Haciendo alarde de destreza
La inviti a mi departamento
Inventando no si que cuento
Acepts muy gustosa
Eran las dos de la madrugada
Que manera de darle fin a la jornada.
Pass lo que tenma que pasar
La noche fue de amar why amar
Lo csmico es que al despertar
Cuando urge una caricia, me dijo
Son ochenta de los verdes
Why eso por tratarse de ti.
CORO:
Le dije estoy acabado
Mira no tengo ni un centavo
Sslo amanecm un poquito enamorado
Aceptas un cheque post fechado
Que sirva de pago por haberte amado.
Me dis un beso en la barbilla
Que me hizo un tanto cosquillas
Se vistis why se fue, adonde yo no si
Una lagrima en su mejilla
Why en su historia otra pesadilla
Regress why me dijo: Tu deuda esta saldada
Yo tambiin me marcho algo enamorada.
CORO:
Le dije estoy acabado...
Ochenta verdes por ternura
Es una ganga en el mercado
Yo que buscaba una aventura
Why termini enamorado.
",Cita en el Bar,1996
Ricardo Arjona,"Tus labios enterabiertos
Con un leve zumbido al respirar
Tu cara sin gestos
Tus pechos pretextos

De una possible maternidad
Toda tu dormida alli
Despues de la estampida
De dos cuerpos why el amor

Tu vientre haciendo un hueco
Para guardar mis pistilos de agua luz
Tus pies descubiertos
Yus brazos abiertos

Tu ombligo el universo todo en ti
Why yo me fumo tu aliento
Despues de la batalla
De dos cuerpos why el amor

En tus uñas hay rastros de mi piel
Why en mi piel hay sudor del compartido
Es sudor de sal que sabe a miel
Son tus manos arañando en lo prohibido

Duerme, duerme
Que yo aun no se si estoy soñando
Se vino el cielo a este lugar
Mientras tu cuerpo aun temblando

Duerme, duerme
Que sere el centinela de tus sueños
Que no hallaras alli uno mejor
Que del que acabo de ser dueño

Tu pelo derramado
Llenando de azabache mi colchon
Tus uñas pintadas, tus piernas cerradas
Tus pliegues en perfecto claro obscuro
Why yo creo mas en Dios, despues de la fortuna

De dos cuerpos why el amor
Why tu que aun no te enteras que te amo
Porque no entiendes el lenguaje de mis manos
Mañana al despertar yo te dire
Lo que este tiempo por cobarde me calle

Duerme, duerme
Que yo aun no se si estoy soñando
Se vino el cielo a este lugar
Mientras tu cuerpo aun temblando

Duerme, duerme
Que sere el centinela de tus sueños
Que no hallaras alli uno mejor
Que del que acabo de ser dueño",Duerme,1996
Ricardo Arjona,"Ella es de La Habana, él de Nueva York
Ella baila en Tropicana, a él le gusta el Rock
Ella vende besos en un burdel
Mientras él se gradúa en U.C.L.A

Ella es medio marxista, él es republicano
Ella quiere ser artista, él odia a los cubanos
Él cree en La Estatua de la Libertad
Y ella en su vieja Habana de la soledad

Él ha comido hamburguesas
Ella moros con cristianos
Él, el champagne con sus fresas
Ella un mojito cubano
Ella se fue de gira a Yucatan
Y él de vacaciones al mismo lugar

Mulata hasta los pies, él rubio como el sol
Ella no habla inglés, y él menos español
Él fue a tomar un trago sin sospechar
Que iba a encontrar el amor en aquel lugar

Lo que las ideologías dividen al hombre
El amor con sus hilos los une en su nombre

Ella mueve su cintura al ritmo de un tan tan
Y él se va divorciando del Tío Sam
Él se refugia en su piel la quiere para él
Y ella se va olvidando de Fidel
Qué sabían Lennin y Lincoln del amor
Qué saben Fidel y Clinton del amor

Ella se sienta en su mesa, él tiembla de la emoción
Ella se llama Teresa y él se llama John
Ella dice hola chico, él contesta hello
A ella no le para el pico, él dice speak slow

El se guardó su bandera, ella olvidó los conflictos
Él encontró la manera de que el amor salga invicto
La tomó de la mano y se la llevó
El yanqui de la cubana se enamoró

Lo que las ideologías dividen al hombre
El amor con sus hilos los une en su nombre

Ella mueve su cintura al ritmo de un tan tan
Y él se va divorciando del Tío Sam
Él se refugia en su piel la quiere para él
Y ella se va olvidando de Fidel
Qué sabían Lennin y Lincoln del amor
Qué saben Fidel y Clinton del amor

Ahora viven en Paris
Buscaron tierra neutral

Ricardo Arjona,"Me enseñaste a no fumar sin desayuno
Me enseñaste a dividir
Que la suma de uno y uno siempre es uno
Si se aprende a compartir
Me enseñaste que los celos son traviesos
Que es mitad falta de sesos y mitad inseguridad
Me enseñaste a ser pareja en libertad
Me enseñaste que el amor no es una reja

Y que es mentira la verdad
Me enseñaste que no es bueno el que te ayuda
Sino el que no te molesta
Me enseñaste que abrazado a tu cintura
Todo parece una fiesta
Me enseñaste muchas cosas de la cama
Que es mejor cuando se ama
Y que es también para dormir

Me enseñaste entre otras cosas a vivir
Me enseñaste que una duda puede más que una razón
Pero fallaste mi gurú
Se te olvidó enseñarme qué hago si no estás tú
Me enseñaste de todo excepto a olvidarte
Desde filosofía hasta como tocarte
A saber que el afrodisíaco más cumplidor

No son los mariscos sino el amor
Pero no me enseñaste a olvidarte
Me enseñaste de todo excepto a olvidarte
A convertir una caricia en una obra de arte
A saber que los abogados saben poco de amor
Y que el amor se cohíbe en los juzgados
Pero no me enseñaste a olvidarte

Pero no me enseñaste a olvidarte

No encuentro el interruptor

Ricardo Arjona,"Se nos muere el amor, tiene fiebre de frio
Se nos cayó de la cama
Cuando lo empujó el hastió
Y esta enfermo de muerte
El mismo que era tan fuerte
Tiene anemia de besos, tiene cáncer de olvido
Y por si fuera poco, tiene ganas de morir

Se nos muere el amor
Se nos mueren las ganas, las vemos agonizar
Convulsionando entre las sábanas
Y no existe un vino tinto
Que nos reviva el instinto
Se nos muere la magia, la pasión, la locura
Ay amor traicionero
Viniste pa´ jorobarnos

Yo sobrevivía sin ella
Y ella era feliz sin mi
Ay amor con el tiempo te nos has oxidado
Ay amor susceptible, ay amor delicado
Ay amor no te mueras
O muérete de un trancazo
Que no hay peor agonía
Que la que es de paso en paso

Se nos muere el amor, se acabo la ternura
Y a la libertad, la convertimos en dictadura
Se contagio de costumbre
Le falto fuego a la lumbre
Se nos mueren los sueños, los versos, los besos
Ay amor implacable yo ya no se que prefiero
Que me odie de corazon

O que me ame sin amor
Ay amor con el tiempo te nos has oxidado
Ay amor susceptible, ay amor delicado
Ay amor no te mueras,
O muérete de un trancazo
Que no hay peor agonía
Que la que es de paso en paso

Pero ya eres todo un hombre pa' la guerra y pa' matar

Con un conato de panza que me está haciendo lucir
Como luce una soga cuando en medio tiene un nudo
El pelo un poco más corto y una tos de cigarro que me despierta en las noches
Vivo en el mismo lugar, calle mártires 28
Y aún conservo la cama que fermente tu humedad
El mismo lunar en el sitio donde tú ya conoces
Voy al mismo bar, para ver si asesino mis noches
Y entre una nueva cana y el deseo de encontrarte se me gasta la vida

Ya probé con el yoga, el harikrishna y vudú
Ya probé con un brujo, un adivino y un gurú
Pero me sigo poniendo viejo
Me lo dice cada día el espejo y tú no apareces por ninguna parte
Mi trabajo muy bien, hasta me han aceptado como miembro master card
Y leo más el lado izquierdo que el derecho en los menús
Me he comprado un auto ya no viajo en autobús
Pero te extraño a rabiar
Al extremo de que nuestra cama no la he vuelto a usar
Y si me cae una aventura la revuelco en el sofá
Por no herir el recuerdo que se anida entre el colchón
Soy el mismo de ayer aunque ya no responde como antes me tendrías que ver
Cuando ya no se encumbra el deseo y entre charlas de borjes y de garcía marquéz
Busco un mejor momento

Son las primeras seis letras de esa palabra
Llevarte a la cama era más fácil que respirar
Tu teléfono es de total dominio popular
Y tu colchón tuene más huellas
Que una playa en pleno verano

Has hecho el amor más veces que mi abuela
Y aun no acabas ni la escuela
Y aún sabiendo que no oeres el mejor partido
Dime quién puede contra cupido
Y es que si yo no he sido un monje
Porque voy a exigirte que seas santa

Si el pasado te enseñó a besar así
Bendito sea el que estuvo antes de mí
No es dama la que se abstiene
Dama es la que se detiene cuando encuentra
Lo que tu encontraste aquí

Si el pasado te enseñó a tocarme así
Benditos los que estuvieron antes de mí
Si otros han sido tu escuela
Yo seré tu graduación
Cuando incluyas en la cama al corazón

Dicen por ahí
Que tu terrible fama de ligera
Ha venido a pintarme un par de cuernos
En la mollera
Que tengo que sacarte del barrio y del país
Si es que quiero darle a esta historia
Un final feliz

Si supieran la ternura inmensa que hay en ti
Y todo lo que tu haces por mi
Sabrían que el camino andado antes de aquí
Te ha preparado para mí
Ven y abrázame sin miedos
Y dame un beso a la salud de los chismosos

Buenas noches Doña Marta es un placer,

Si me he vestido de negro no es por luto créanme,
Aunque si esto no es la muerte se le ha de parecer,
Le aceptaría Doña Marta un cafecito de preferencia bien cargado,
Debería tomarse Don David algo fuertecito,
Para que este mas relajado

No frunza el ceño Don David,
No me odie antes de tiempo y diga me ¿Como esta el trabajo Don David?,
¿Que hay de la economía?,
¿Como anda el fútbol?,
cuente Doña Marta lo que quiera,
Si quiere hablar de la cocina,
Digan algo por favor para no ir directo al punto

Se preguntaran que diablos hago aquí,
Toda una vida de vecino y nunca vine a visitar,
Pues resulta que este humilde servidor,
Se ha enamorado de Martita su hija la menor

Le suplicaría atentamente Don David,
No meta a mi madre en esto,
Se bien la fama que me han dado de truhan,
Pero juro que esto es honesto

No se levante Don David,
No me odie antes de tiempo,
Y dígame ¿Como esta el traguito Don David?,
Tómese otro poquito,
Salud por la familia,
Que bonita casa Doña Marta,
¿Fue idea suya las cortinas?,
Siéntense y relájense,
Que esto esta solo que empieza,

Me enamore de ella,
Que quieren que les diga si me enamore,
Se enamoro de mi,
Que quieren que haga si se enamoro,
Nos enamoramos,
Se que no he sido un ejemplo pero me enamore

Todo empezó aquel martes a las tres,
Ella iba a la escuela y la encontré en la estación,
Era apenas una niña semanas atrás,
Y la descubrí mujer en un vestido café,
No fue fácil conquistarla Don David,
La perseguí por todos lados,
Y entre mas difícil se ponía Don David,
Yo mas enamorado

Ya no me grite Don David,
No me odie antes de tiempo,
Y sepa usted que estoy orgulloso Don David,
De la hija que ha formado,
Una dama hecha y derecha,
Que ademas de ser hermosa,
Es mujer como ninguna

Se parece a Doña Marta con todo respeto

Que quieren que les diga si me enamore,
Se enamoro de mi,
Que quieren que haga si se enamoro,
Nos enamoramos,
Se que no he sido un ejemplo pero me enamore

Hoy te provoca llanto

Para que armo la guerra
Siéndote sincero;
Mentir es una forma
De decir te quiero

Con tal de no ser blanco
De tus peores enojos;
Miento como un enfermo
Y viéndote a los ojos

Una mentira que te haga feliz
Vale más que una verdad que te amargue la vida
Una mentira hará¡ crecer mi nariz a cambio de libertad
Y de aferrarte a mi vida
Que hago para que entiendas
Que si miento es porque nunca creerás
Que en el sitio donde esté
Siempre estaré pensando en ti

Ricardo Arjona,"Tengo una cama que hace ruido
Un cuarto semi derruido y un reloj
Una olla express en la cocina
Una barbie que es de mi sobrina y seis casetes
Una guitarra que se afina
Con el do mayor que lanza el ferrocarril
Y una tele blanco y negro que hay que verla de perfil
Tengo tu foto pegada al borde de mi mesa de noche
Tengo un vocho por coche que es toda una aventura
Tengo u cepillo de dientes rojo, desodorante y agua caliente

Y una reputación indecente por culpa de una vecina
Tengo un saco, cinco jeans, siete camisas
Unas botas y unos nike desvencijados
Una copia de un van gogh, catorce deudas
Y solo un saldo a mi favor
Y es que cuando llegas por las noches
Le pones el ruido a mi colchón
Millonario de luz con tu mirada sin denominación
Haces magnate al corazon
Y mientras la bolsa se derrumba en wall street

Tu me haces un steap-tease tan personal como un lunar
Yo no puedo ser rico sin ti,ni pobre cuando estas conmigo
Tengo tu risa por fortuna, y un palco para ver la luna en mi azotea
Un boleto directito al cielo abordando el vuelo entre tus brazos
Tengo un trabajo suficiente
Para darnos el lujo de pagar puntual la renta
Y lo demás es lo de menos y corre todo a mi cuenta
Millonario de luz con tu mirada sin denominación
Hacemos magnate al corazon

Y mientras la bolsa se derrumba en wall street
Tu me haces un strip-tease tan personal como un lunar
Yo no puedo ser rico sin ti, ni pobre cuando estas conmigo

Ricardo Arjona,"Sueño con quitarle a la vida ese tono gris
Que se parece a la muerte
Voy y me meto a la ducha para ver si el jabón
Me lava la mala suerte
Quiero olvidarme de todo,
Quiero cambiarme hasta el nombre

No hay razón de ser el testigo de que mi vida pase
Sin que pase de nada
Quiero olvidarme de todo lo que dejó una huella
Que me dejó marcado

No hay un mal que dure cien años
Ni hay idiota que lo soporte 

No tengo siete vidas como un gato
Y es hora de que me de cuenta

Que no estoy solo
Que hay alguien esperando por mi en cualquier sitio,
Con cosas nuevas para ofrecer
Con mil locuras,
Diespuestas todas a realizar lo irrealizable;
Que tengo mucha vida por delante

Trato de pegarle un borrón
A todo lo que en su tiempo me robó una sonrisa
Quiero recuperar el ritmo
Y ya no acelerarme con estúpidas prisas

No hay mal que dure cien años,
Ni hay idiota que lo soporte

Salgo caminando ala calle y me tomo
Un taxi con destino a lo incierto
Dejo que la vida sorprenda
A ese trozo de mi
Que todavía no ha muerto

Le faltaré el respeto al destino,
Le sacaré la lengua al pasado
No tengo siete vidas como un gato,
Y es hora de que me de cuenta

Ricardo Arjona,"Olvidarte es mas difícil que encontrarse al sol de noche
Que entender a los políticos o comprar la torre eiffel
Mas difícil que fumarse un habano en american airlines
Mas difícil que una flor plástica marchita
Olvidarte es mas difícil que una flaca en un botero
Que encontrarse a un gato verde, o a un cubano sin sabor
Mas difícil que lady di en la estación del metro

Olvidarte es tan difícil olvidarte
Olvidarte, olvidarte
Es querer jalarle el pelo a una botella
Es creer que la memoria es un cassette para borrar
Olvidarte es recordar que es imposible
Olvidarte, olvidarte
Incluso es mas difícil que aguantarte

Si extraño tu neurosis y tus celos sin razón
Como no extrañar tu cuerpo en mi colchón
Olvidarte es un intento que no lo deseo tanto
Porque tanto es que lo intento que me acuerdo mucho mas
Y he llegado a sospechar que mi afán de no acordarme
Es lo que me tiene enfermo de recuerdos
Olvidarte es lo que espero para reanudar mi vida

Harto de seguir soñando con la posibilidad
De que un día por error, o pura curiosidad
Le preguntes a un amigo por mis huesos
Olvidarte, olvidarte
Es querer jalarle el pelo a una botella
Es creer que la memoria es un cassette para borrar
Olvidarte es recordar que es imposible

Ricardo Arjona,"Justamente ahora irrumpes en mi vida
Con tu cuerpo exacto y ojos de asesina
Tarde como siempre nos llega la fortuna

Tú ibas con ella yo iba con él
Jugando a ser felices por desesperados
Por no aguardar los sueños por miedo a quedar solos

Pero llegamos tarde te vi y me viste
Nos reconocimos enseguida pero tarde
Maldita sea la hora que encontré lo que soñé
Tarde

Tanto soñarte y extrañarte sin tenerte tanto inventarte
Tanto buscarte por las calles como loca sin encontrarte
Y ahí va uno de tonto por desesperado
Confundiendo amor con compañía

Y ese miedo idiota de verte viejo y sin pareja
Te hace escoger con la cabeza lo que es del corazón
Y no tengo nada contra ellos la rabia es contra el tiempo
Por ponerte junto a mí tarde (tarde)

Ganas de huir de no verte ni la sombra
De pensar que esto fue un sueño o una pesadilla
Que nunca apareciste que nunca has existido

Ganas de besarte de coincidir contigo
De acercarme un poco y amarrarte en un abrazo
De mirarte a los ojos y decirte bienvenido

Pero llegamos tarde te vi y me viste
Nos reconocimos en seguida pero tarde
Quizás en otras vidas quizás en otras muertes

Que ganas de rozarte (ganas de huir)
Que ganas de tocarte (ganas de besarte)
De acercarme a ti y golpearte con un beso
De fugarnos para siempre sin daños a terceros",Tarde (Sin Daños a Terceros),1998
Ricardo Arjona,"¿ Que hora tienes?, pregunte para entablar conversación
""Son cuarto para la dos"", y cuando escuche su voz
Aseguré que existe dios

Yo volteé para hacer frente al atrevido constructor
Aunque admiré su observación

¿Te ayudo con los libros? y a quemarropa dijiste ""no""
¿puedo acompañarte? y sin voltear otra vez ""no""
Y ante la ausencia de un buen comentario,
Te dije que me gustabas para nuera de mamá

No hay más vuelta de hoja, aquí­ empieza una historia

Que hizo Dios para hacerte feliz
Ahi tu volteaste y me dijiste ""Tú estas loco, lárgate""

Siete cuadraste seguí­, hasta que abordaste un autobús
El semáforo en la esquina fue el perfecto celestino
Con el rojo de su luz, subí­ por la puerta trasera,
Y dije hola otra vez, tú me sonreíste
Y el flechazo hirió esta vez  y ante la ausencia de un buen
Comentario, te dije que me gustabas para cuñada
De mi hermana

Con la seriedad que Gorvachov aborda el tema
De la caída de su cortina

Me gusta verte remendar mi pantalón
Que hubiese ido a parar a la basura
Si hubiese sido otra la situación

Me gusta verte sonreír cuando lo normal era llorar
Me has gustado siempre y hoy me gustas mucho mas

Porque sin aludir a la fortuna
Aquella noche de luna tu vientre se hizo cuna
Trayendo el fruto de algo mutuo

Y es que es tan sagrada tu labor,
Que pariendo con dolor materializas el amor,
Volviendo humano el sentimiento

Me gusta verte en el supermercado
Escoger los abarrotes
Según la economía nos haya tratado

Me gusta ver tu abdomen de perfil
Que viene a recordarme
Que de una nueva vida seré yo el albañil

Me gusta verte ese swing que has adoptado al caminar,
Y es que me gustas toda,incluso verte estornudar

Más te recuerdo

Que me prohíbe pensar
Que me ata y desata
Y luego de a poco me mata

Me bota y levanta 
Me vuelve a tirar

Que no me deja olvidar
Porque aunque tú ya no estés
Se mete en mi sangre 
Y se va de rincón en rincón 
Arañándome el alma 
Y rasgando el corazón
¿Porqué es tan cruel el amor? 

No se acaba el amor 
Sólo porque no estás 
No se puede olvidar

Llevo una vida sensacional
Porque al llegar a mi casa ahí estas
Tu mi amor
Y de repente se ilumina mi día
Tu mi amor
Mi niña, mi gran alegría
Tu mi amor
¿que mas puedo pedirle a la vida?
Me gusta verte en la cocina con sarten en mano

Que me sirvas un vaso de leche con un ""te amo""
Me gusta bailar navegando en tus entrañas
Encontrar en mi saco un papel que asegura que me extrañas
Es hermoso vivir esta vida en tu compañía
Ver que mi casa esta llena de amor, aunque de muebles vacía
Y hacer a un lado los enormes problemas de la economía
Porque aunque todo luzca tan mal
Vivo una vida sensacional

Porque al llegar a mi casa ahí estas
Tu mi amor
Y de repente se ilumina mi día
Tu mi amor

Ricardo Arjona,"Estas cuando no estas
Hasta en lo que no estoy pensando
Estas, porque si no estas te invento

Descubriendo un pensamiento
Eres mi profecia why mi momento

Estas entre mis libros, disfrazada de palabra
Tras cualquier puerta que yo abra
Estas en lo intocable
why en la sombra de la luna
Estas, why porque estas tengo fortuna

Contradiciendo a la razon
Uno mas uno es uno
La solucion a esta ecuacion
Solo el amor la entiende

Uno mas uno es uno
Si la suma somos tu why yo
En la matematica de nuestro amor
Asi es que se suele sumar

Estas en cada esquina
Dibujandote en la bruma
Estas en la vitrina why en la espuma
Estas en mi alegria
why en la luz de un nuevo dia
estas cuando una lagrima me opaca

Estas en el diploma que cuelga en la pared
Estas en mi persona why en mi ser
Estas cuando estoy solo
why no has venido del trabajo
Estas porque mi corazon te trajo

De que seas tú lo que eras antes y se me alivie el corazón
Y un pepto bismol se me olvidaba por aquello de la indigestión
Disculpe usted la analogía busco una cura a mi aflicción
No pudo la psicología reanimarme el corazón
Y deme un demerol pa' que no duela y cortizona pa'la hinchazón
De esto que es peor que un mal de muela y que no entiende de razón
Dicen que la morfina es muy buena pa' olvidar aunque sería mejor que vuelvas

Que pecado tan grande no perdonaba
Y que si te quería, me condenaba
Me condenaba

Del pecho en que lo llevo saque un retrato
Y el cura ve tu imagen, dulce alma mía

Habiendo tantas cosas por hacer, menos traumáticas.
Como hallarle figuras a las nubes,
o como ir al cine o no hacer nada.
Amarte a ti no es lo mejor, pero me gusta.
Quizás estoy jugando como siempre al masoquista.
En ves de distraerme con el fútbol,
o con el Internet como hacen todos.
Amarte a ti no es lo mejor, pero es perfecto,
para encontrarle algún sentido a esta rutina,
de ser por siempre solo un ciudadano,
solo uno mas.

Amarte a ti me hare sufrir, que buena suerte.
Para acordarme de que existo y de que siento.
Para tener en que pensar todas las noches, para vivir.

Amarte a ti es un veneno que da vida.
Es una antorcha que se enciende si se apaga.
Es lo sublime junto con lo idiota.
Es lo que siento y a quién le importa.
Amarte a ti es la verdad más mentirosa.
Es lo mejor de lo peor que me ha pasado.
Es la ruleta rusa por un beso,
es lo de siempre improvisado.
Amarte a ti es un error dice un amigo,
que cree que ser feliz es estar libre,
y se pierde del matiz que da lo incierto,
amarte a ti.

Es la embajada de un instante en mi cerebro.
Es también haberte odiado un par de veces.

Porque así quiso tu suerte

Para incluirme en tu futuro
Mientras yo te doy de día
Lo que él no cumple en las noches

Pa’ jugar al escondite
Como amante guerrillero
Pa’ cubrirte tus carencias
De ternura y desenfreno
Aunque yo no esté en la foto

Ni en el bautizo del sobrino

Y a mí me dividen una

Cierra puertas y ventanas
Que el mismísimo cielo pondrá una sucursal
En el séptimo piso
A las once cincuenta
Mientras duren los besos
Y permita el reloj
Cierra puertas y ventanas
Que en 90’ habrá que condensar
Las caricias que caben
En los huecos que dejan
Los encuentros furtivos y la soledad
Y es que tú ahora tienes dos
Y a mí me dividen una

Puede ser que tu conciencia
Te castigue por las noches
Y te aliente en las mañanas
Puede ser que un dia de tantos
Nos quedemos sin futuro
Y tu sigas con tu teatro

Mientras tanto dame un beso atrincherado
De esos que por ser culpables
Son como agua en el desierto
Tómame como al tequila de un golpe y sin pensarlo
Que si alguien sale ganando eres tu querida amiga
Aunque pienses lo contrario

Que esta vez se te acabo el amor,

Y con tanta libertad

Y me dejaste solo realidad,
Una casa minada de recuerdos,
Y el dentífrico aplastado a la mitad,

Me dejaste la ropa interior, que te di para quitártela,

La nena arruga los ojos pa que no entre la luz
Recita la oración de siempre para cumplir con dios
Acto seguido en el pecho se dibuja una cruz

Armada con libros de texto la lleva el chófer
Mamá la despide en la puerta agitando los brazos
La nena tiene 9 años como iba a saber
Que hace mas de cuatro meses que le siguen los pasos
Y el auto que espera a dos cuadras enciende el motor

Un tiro en la sien al chófer la nena va a la deriva
Un árbol detiene la inercia ellos la tienen rodeada
Su frente dio contra el cristal y le ha abierto una herida
Los vecinos se encierran con llave nadie a visto nada
Y la mano que mato a su chófer ahora le opaca los gritos
La nena es un uno con ceros a partir de hoy

La nena ya no arruga los ojos no ha visto la luz

Su vida es un trueque vulgar parecido a la muerte

Se pacta la entrega con una voz manipulada

Y el miedo se ríe de todos y se frota las manos
El futuro pone cara de perro si se le da la gana

No sirve de nada

Ricardo Arjona,"Los negros tienen swing, los blancos pecas
Las monjas tienen ganas, los niños sueños
Los muertos tienen said, los vivos culpas
Los ricos tienen dietas, los pobres hambre
Y al final, la mierda huele igual, sea de príncipe o sirvienta

El soborno tiene clientes, la flor olores
Los buenos tienen paz, los malos fiestas
Los lunes tienen martes, los viernes risas
El mal tiene un doctor, el tiempo, tiempo
Menos mal que el cheque alcanzara para disfrazar las deudas

Quesos, cosas, casas
Peros, paras, porque
Quesos para estar vivos, cosas para adornar
La casa que crees tuya, mientras puedas respirar

Peros pa complicarte
Paras para explicar
Porque es que estamos jodidos
Si hay aires pa respirar
Porque si seguimos vivos
Las ganas de jorobar

El débil tiene trucos, el fuerte excusas
Dios tiene sus fans, el mar misterios
El dolor le da el sabor a la tertulia
El amor le pone alas hasta un cerdo
Y al final, unos sueñan con soñar
Y otros con no soñar tanto

Quesos, cosas, casas
Peros, paras, porque
Quesos para estar vivos, cosas para adornar
La casa que crees tuya, mientras puedas respirar

Peros pa complicarte
Paras para explicar

No era mas que un vendedor
Y el mono que soñaba
Lo convirtió en consumidor

Santo pecado preguntarte
Si viajas sola por la vida
Si aceptas de inquilino entre tus brazos

A tus manos investigando todo

Al ruido que haces cuando consigues el milagro, el milagro
Santo pecado es el deseo
Santo pecado tus caderas
Y el vértice cálido y siniestro

Tan cerca siempre del cielo
Y del infierno, y del infierno
He tratado de encontrar la analogía

A este caos que has causado que me gusta
Y me fastidia y me ha dado por llamarle solo
Santo pecado, santo pecado

Porque después dar dos para estar muerto
Y grito que es un santo pecado santo pecado
Si construyes paraísos por un rato
Porque después me avientas al infierno

Y digo que es un santo pecado, santo pecado

Hoy sumo sueños a mis dudas
Hoy resto besos a mis ganas
Hoy vivo al filo de la nostalgia
Hoy tengo heridas como estrellas
Hoy sueño mientras te extraño
Con olvidarte, olvidarte

Estar preso señor juez
Por tirarle una pedrada al presidente

Mi pedrada fue un rayón en el blindaje
En la pena debe usted considerar
Que mi piedra pretendía con su viaje
Mi recurso ciudadano de poderme expresar

Con sus sueños peregrinos de inscribirse al carnaval
Ese sueño que comienza cuando empieza a terminar
Sabe cuantos sueños rotos caben en urnas de cartón
Para que cuentan los votos si se repite la ecuación
Y si le escribo alguna carta a la utopía
Y de remitente mi nombre y dirección
Seria como escribirle a la melancolía
Y entregarme a la resignación

A cuantos peces flacos ha mandado usted a guardar
Como este que hoy le habla señoría
A cuantos peces gordos ha dejado de juzgar
Para darle de comer a la ironía
Mi pedrada es otra raya para el tigre
Inocente como el llanto de un patojo
Si le toco el corazón déjeme libre
Si le tocan la razón me pinta en rojo

Ricardo Arjona,"La nana la despertó a las seis con cuarenta y dos
La nena arruga los ojos pa' que no entre la luz
Recita la oración de siempre para cumplir con Dios
Acto seguido en el pecho se dibuja una cruz

De quien es el auto que espera dos cuadras al sur
Armada con libros de texto la lleva el chófer
Mamá la despide en la puerta agitando los brazos
La nena tiene nueve años como iba a saber
Que haré más de cuatro meses que le siguen los pasos
Y el auto que espera a dos cuadras enciende el motor

Un tiro en la sien al chófer, la nena va a la deriva
Un árbol detiene la inercia, ellos la tienen rodeada
Su frente dio contra el cristal y le ha abierto una herida
Los vecinos se encierran con llave, nadie ha visto nada
Y la mano que mato a su chófer ahora le opaca los gritos
La nena es un uno con ceros a partir de hoy

La nena ya no arruga los ojos, no ha visto la luz
En la sucursal del infierno no existen ventanas
Su suerte cotiza en billetes de otro país
Su vida es un trueque vulgar parecido a la muerte
La nena no va a ir esta tarde a su clase de inglés

La nena es un bulto amarrado en un Chrysler café
Un zapato le oprime la espalda, un pañuelo la boca
La nena esta muerta de miedo y no entiende por qué
La nena no sabe que a veces también Dios se equivoca
La nena es desvelo y noticia la nena no está

Su planeta cambio de tamaño y mide cuatro por tres
Su sol es la luz que se cuela debajo de una puerta
La nena ya no ve diferencia entre un día y un mes
La nena no sabe si duerme o se mantiene despierta
La nena ya lleva tres meses buscando un porque

Seis kilos de menos la nena, tiene llagas rosadas
Papa casi loco, mama de nuevo en los hospitales
Se pacta la entrega con una voz manipulada
La misma que ha venido ofreciendo souvenirs corporales
y el miedo se ríe de todos y se frota las manos
El futuro pone cara de perro si se le da la gana

La nena ya no arruga los ojos, no ha visto la luz
En la sucursal del infierno no existen ventanas
Su suerte cotiza en billetes de otro país
Su vida es un trueque vulgar parecido a la muerte
La nena ya lleva diez meses sin ir al ballet

El día indicado el dinero esta debajo de un puente
La nena por fin sale del cuarto donde estuvo guardada
Todo marcha como pactado, no hay ningún pendiente
De pronto el jefe irrumpe en la casa sin cubrirse la cara
La nena reconoce en el rostro a alguien familiar
Los planes después del incidente han debido cambiar

En las huellas que dejan tus pies descalzos
En el gesto que pones cuando te enojas
En tus altercados con la balanza, cuando trae malas noticias

Y la sospecha de que ni sospechas cuanto te amo
Tengo tu foto puesta en la retina
Y con voz baila el estribo el yunque y el martillo

Tengo risas, tengo llantos
Tengo un termostato que me enciende cuando estas 
Y que me apaga si te vas pa' no morir de la nostalgia

Adiós melancolía
Gracias por la compañía 
Pero aquí ya no hay mas sitios para usted
Adiós melancolía
Le agradezco la poesía
Que entre versos hoy me deja confesarle a esta mujer
Que me saqué la lotería cuando la vi

Tengo la dosis de perdón por si haces algo que me duela
Y una canción de mas por si algún día la echas de menos
Tengo un stock de besos sin estreno
Y un camión del bueno para ti

Tengo risas, tengo llantos 
Tengo un termostato que me enciende cuando estás 
Y me apaga si te vas pa' no morir de la nostalgia

Adiós melancolía
Gracias por la compañía 
Pero aquí ya no hay mas sitios para usted
Adiós melancolía
Le agradezco la poesía
Que entre versos hoy me deja confesarle a esta mujer
Que me saqué la lotería cuando la vi

Hoy cuelgo mis sueños en el piercing de tu ombligo
Mientras la melancolía observa y es testigo
Quiero estar seguro
Un poco por ti
Un poco por mi
Un poco por celos

Adiós melancolía
Gracias por la compañía 
Pero aquí ya no hay mas sitios para usted
Adiós melancolía
Le agradezco la poesía
Que entre versos hoy me deja confesarle a esta mujer 
Que me saqué la lotería cuando la vi",Adiós Melancolía,2005
Ricardo Arjona,"Olor a nicotina, mesas cojas
Comandas de tequila, luces rojas 
Tertulias que se olvidan cuando llega
La maldita resaca

Meseras con billetes en la blusa
Trincheras de una luz semi difusa
Que les quita la cara a los que esconden secretos personales

El bar es un hotel 
Medio pelo que le cura el desconsuelo a los que no saben 
Que hacer con el desvelo, como yo

Papeles por debajo de la mesa
Cócteles que te alivian la tristeza
Canciones como dagas en el pecho de la melancolía

Historias que no van a ningún lado
Glorias de un pasado tan pasado
Y mis sueños merodeando suicidados en la vieja tarima

Yo llevo aquí metido media vida 
Y sigo solo y sin salida 
Y recordando todas las putas noches

Que ahí se sentaba ella
Que ahí se enamoro de mi
Ahí mientras cantaba
Pintaba en servilletas mensajes subversivos 
Mientras se las sujetaba

Ahí se sentaba ella
Ahí se enamoro de mi
Ahí en esa silla ella
Un día se aburrió, de mi

Dolores se llamaba que ironía
Dolores no buscaba compañía
Que le durara mas que el alter show y el sudor camerino

Se unió a los delirios del trasnoche
Se alió a los colirios y al derroche
Y yo que bautice de amor lo que era compañía

Jamás vimos la luna porque el bar 
Nunca nos hizo recordar que afuera el mundo 
Continuaba, sin nosotros

Porque ahí se sentaba ella
Ahí se enamoro de mi
Ahí mientras cantaba 
Pintaba en servilletas mensajes subversivos 
Mientras se las sujetaba

Ahí se sentaba ella
Ahí se enamoro de mi
Ahí en esa silla ella
Un día se aburrió, de mi

Se me acabo el carisma si me vieras
Mi voz ya no es la misma si me oyeras
La noches una puta divertida, pero cobra factura

Me fumo otro cigarro y la mañana
Me opaca como barro en la ventana
Y vuelvo como, siempre a recordar

Ahí se sentaba ella
Ahí se enamoro de mi
Ahí en esa silla ella
Un día se aburrió, de mi

Un jueves decidió no regresar
Y no existe noche en este bar
Que yo no cante su canción
Por si regresa",Bar,2005
Ricardo Arjona,"Era un jueves gris, llovía
Pídeme un remis, decía
En el lobby de un hotel barato
Viene de rentar su piel un rato
Con la algarabía del deber cumplido

Acrobacias del placer fingido
Un orgasmo de alquiler, con ruidos
Pone boca en su carmín escaso
Arañando el adoquín sus pasos
Quien tiene algo para la nariz, pregunta

Podría ser de utilidad un pañuelo
Disfracé de ingenuidad, mi anzuelo
Algo para no dormir, idiota
Si me das podrías pedir mi ropa

Donde encuentro nieve pa´l desvelo, ahora
Creo que cien podría ajustar, te animas
Y de pestal cruzar, la esquina
Estoy solo como tu, fulana
Te invito a estrenar la luz, mañana
No te quiero pa´ desarreglar la cama

No es lo que haces con tu boca mi muñeca rota lo que solicito
Te puedes dejar la ropa, mi muñeca rota no la necesito
No es mojar la calentura
Ahogar en tu cintura lo que ando buscando
Es un poco de ternura para ver si cura lo que estoy pasando
Dijo si sin sonreír, camina

Dime si el sexo sin placer, te enciende
Solo si el cliente es mujer, lo entiendes
Disimulando argumente esta claro
No te creas que me parece raro
Cada quien su gusto y su pasión, le dije

Te podría sujetar la mano
Dame cien para empezar, y hablamos
Los busque en mi pantalón y nada
Fui debajo del colchón y estaban
Se los di como quien compra un par, de alas

No es lo que haces con tu boca mi muñeca rota lo que solicito
Te puedes dejar la ropa, mi muñeca rota no la necesito
No es mojar la calentura
Ahogar en tu cintura lo que ando buscando
Es un poco de ternura para ver si cura lo que estoy pasando

Miro el buró y sin sonreír, momento
Si es tu ex la del buró no hay trato
Con su mano señaló el retrato
La conoces pregunté, confuso
Fue por mí quien te dejo, iluso",Iluso,2005
Ricardo Arjona,"Que te han visto aranar banquetas con tus tacones de aguja,
Que no sales del bar, que vives entre burbujas,
Que te sangra la nariz, que la bulimia hoy es tu gerente,
Que ya no existe barniz para tu blanco, casi transparente,
Que te inyectas la soledad, y le echas polvo a la rutina,
extasis de felicidad, y colirio a las retinas.

Dijeron que andas por ahi,
Luciendo marcas en tus antebrazos,
Que nadie quiere ya saber de ti,
Y las pasarelas no han visto tus pasos,
Que la autoestima se te fue a Paris,
Y la debacle se mudo a tu casa.

Laura,
Modelo de pasarela,
Te acuerdas de mi, Laura,
Tu primer novio en la escuela,
Ayer en un sueno vi, que en el anden,
Del tren del purgatorio, preguntan quien,
Quiere alquilarse un dormitorio,
En el vagon, de la clase ejecutiva,
Donde Dios, el diablo y sus mortajas juegan los dos,
Tu futuro a las barajas.

Si te acuerdas de mi, soy el mismo el que te adoraba,
Si te acuerdas de ti, no cuelgues esta llamada,
Enterate que sigo aqui, congelandome en el tiempo,
Esperando a que digas si, para ir hasta tu encuentro.

Ricardo Arjona,"Empacó un par de camisas, un sombrero 
Su vocación de aventurero, seis consejos, siete fotos 
Mil recuerdos 

Empacó sus ganas de quedarse 
Su condición de transformarse 
En el hombre que soñó 
Y no ha logrado 

Dijo adiós con una mueca disfrazada de sonrisa 
Y le suplicó a su Dios crucificado en la repisa 
El resguardo de los suyos 

Y perforó la frontera 
Como pudo 

Si la luna suave se desliza 
Por cualquier cornisa 
Sin permiso alguno 

Porque el mojado precisa 
Comprobar con visas 
Que no es de neptuno 

El mojado tiene ganas de secarse 
El mojado esta mojado por las lagrimas que evoca la nostalgia 
El mojado, el indocumentado 
Carga el bulto que el legal no cargaría 
Ni obligado 

El suplicio de un papel lo ha convertido en fugitivo 
Y no es de aquí porque su nombre no aparece en los archivos 
Ni es de allá porque se fue 

Si la luna suave se desliza 
Por cualquier cornisa 
Sin permiso alguno 

Porque el mojado precisa 
Comprobar con visas 
Que no es de neptuno 

Mojado 
Sabe a mentira tu verdad 
Sabe a tristeza la ansiedad 
De ver un freeway y soñar con la vereda 
Que conduce hasta tu casa 

Mojado, mojado de tanto llorar 
Sabiendo que en algún lugar 
Espera un beso haciendo pausa 
Desde el día en que te marchaste 

Si la luna suave se desliza 
Por cualquier cornisa 
Sin permiso alguno 

Porque el mojado precisa 
Comprobar con visas 
Que no es de neptuno

El día en que nacemos 
Y caduca en la muerte 
Por que te persiguen mojado 
Si el cónsul de los cielos 
Ya te dio permiso",Mojado,2005

Que culo de muñeco
Estaba el bar
De Pedro y a chaleco
Valentón
Propuse ir pa' la casa
Condición
A las doce calabazas
Vino el barrio
Martín, Melchor, Tania y la Juliana
Jose Luis, Humberto,Sandra y la Mariana
Cada quien un pomo y muchas ganas
Y no faltó, quien dijo que invitó
A la miss Tijuana

Fue más largo que un pedo de culebra
Conseguimos un mariachi en la Minerva
Vino Juan, taquero de la esquina
Bolovan con cuatro de sus primas
Una actriz, fresa y cacariza
Un productor, dizque de Televisa
Juan Gabriel en mangas de camisa
Un senador futuro precidente
Conservador pero tan delincuente
Como "" El Matraca""

Mister Bush y algún talibán

Si eres mormón o vas a la musulmana
Si vienes de luto
O eres medio Puto
Porque esta noche no me importa nada

Bienvenidos y pasen adelante
Decia un tipo no había visto antes
Kamikasis, reyes del alboroto
Paparazzis, con lentes telefotos
Policias. Orillense a la orilla
Cofradías de chicas maravillas
Merengueros, jazzistas
Usureros, rusas masajistas

Y mientras yo seguia siendo el rey
Un tipo grito ahí viene la ley
Y calabaza.

Fui a parar a la delegacion
Y ahí dentro siguió el reventón

Ricardo Arjona,"Debe ser la locura, de este amor imprudente,
Que me ata sin cura, a tu falda inocente,
Que me mantiene a oscuras el delirio inminente,
De cambiar tu figura, por otra diferente,
Me amarre a tu cintura, y aunque hable la gente,
No te cambio por nada.

Si conozco un buen dia, una dama exquisita,
Frenaria la osadia, de ofrecerle una cita,
Si cabalgo el tranvia de esta vida finita,
No comparto mi almohada, aunque nada me quita,
Tengo el alma adiestrada,
Y aunque el ego me invita,
No te cambio por nada.

No, no, no, no te cambio por nada,
Ni por un viaje a Fiji con la Venus de Milo,
Ni la Britney o Madonna me harÃ¡n cambiar de estilo,
No te cambio por nada,
No te cambio por nada.

Nunca falta una amiga, con su historia serpiente,
Para vender intrigas, necesitas un cliente,
Si te clava una duda y soy yo el penitente,
Si mi verdad se hace muda, y le crees a la gente,
Ni la Biblia te ayuda si no tienes presente,
Que no te cambio por nada.

No, no, no, no te cambio por nada,
Ni por un viaje a Fiji con la Venus de Milo,
Ni la Britney o Madonna me harÃ¡n cambiar de estilo,
No te cambio por nada,
No te cambio por nada.

Ni por un piso en la luna,
Ni los tesoros de Suiza,
Ni por un beso de espuma con la Garbo,
Marilyn o Monalisa.

Ricardo Arjona,"La cama está que extraña el movimiento
Tu ropa extraña el aire, que le quitas
Y como un batallón en huelga de futuros
Se asoman tus zapatos por el closet

La casa está con ganas de clonarte
Y el cuadro en la pared, esta aburrido
Y es que hasta tu enemiga la cocina
Extraña aquellos guisos que no hacías
Y no se hable del reloj, que haraganea
Haciendo de un instante una odisea

Y pa` qué te hablo de mi si está de más
Pa` qué la verborragia cursi y necia
Pa` qué decirte que el peor es quien te habla
Pa` qué decirte que hoy que ya no estás
La casa se derrumba en mi cabeza
Y la puerta se abre sola por si vuelves

El sillón aún guarda huellas de tus curvas
Y el piso no es el mismo, sin tus pasos
Y el sol ya ni se asoma en la ventana
Sabiendo que no estás, para observarlo
Y no se hable de tu olor, que flota inerte
O del espejo que se inclina para verte

Y pa` qué te hablo de mi, si esta de más
Pa` qué la verborragia cursi y necia
Pa` qué decirte que el peor es quien te habla
Pa` qué decirte que hoy que ya no estás

Con tu falda arremangada, con mi angustia recurrente
Con tu espalda en tres almohadas

Tu pezón amenazando y mi boca haciendo fiesta
Un colchón de contrabando y la ropa haciendo siesta
Mi almidón y tu eficacia, tu chantaje y mi venganza
Mi sillón y tu acrobacia, mi equipaje y tu esperanza

De tu vientre why su creación

No promover tu mal humor

Why es tu pecado estar distante
Why otro peor quedarme ahí
Why aunque hay receso obligatorio
Why el cielo se hare un purgatorio

A tus hormonas por las fiestas

No hay más luz que la que das

14 consejos pa' olvidar
500 razones para odiarte,
Saco la cuenta why a sumar...
Millones de ovejas pa'l desvelo,
Cocktail de pastillas pa dormir?
14 las muestras de tu pelo
Como cuchillos de fakir

Cuando fue que se fue tu amor?
Como fue que se fue sin mi?
Que no amanezca por favor...

Se trepa la la luz por la ventana
Se escuchan los autos por ahí
Tu ADN esta en la cama
Why yo lo clono para mi...
De tantas formas siento miedo
Que he preferido no salir
60 veces dije puedo
80 más me arrepentí

Cuando fue que se fue tu amor
Como fue que se fue sin mí...

Quien te besó, lejos de aquí,
Mientras te inventaba en la cama,
Quien te rozó, lejos de mi,
Quien te acompaña esta mañana.
¿cuanto perdí? ¿quien te gano?
¿que hago con este miedo a futuro?...
Saco la cuenta why a restar

Son 7 Lunes por semana,
Son 30 inviernos cada mes
Las horas son de porcelana
La vida un juego de ajedrez,
Dejaste minas en la casa
Con objetivos de matar...
La vida llora cuando pasa
La suerte ríe en el plackard

Cuando fue que se fue tu amor
Como fue que se fue sin mí...

Quien te besó, lejos de aquí,
Mientras te inventaba en la cama,
Quien te rozó, lejos de mi,
Quien te acompaña esta mañana.
¿cuanto perdí? ¿quien te gano?
¿que hago con este miedo al futuro?...

Dejaste tu sombra merodeando sin permiso por la casa,
La huella en la alfombra de tu espalda como crater en la luna
Why tu reflejo en el espejo...

Quien te besó, lejos de aquí,
Mientras te inventaba en la cama,
Quien te rozó, lejos de mi,
Quien te acompaña esta mañana.
¿cuanto perdí? ¿quien te gano?
¿que hago con este miedo a futuro?...
Saco la cuenta why a restar

... ohh noo...

Quién te ganó...

Quien te besó, lejos de aquí,
Quien te acompaña esta mañana...

Ricardo Arjona,"Quiero cometer el error 
Más grande del mundo 
Y navegar en kayac 
De Miami a la Habana

Quiero tomarme un café 
Viendo el Mediterráneo 
Y despertarme en Tulum 
Persiguiendo una estrella

Quiero decirle a Jesús 
Qué sí está que aparezca 
Y qué me corten la luz 
Pa' prender una vela 
Y soñar 

Quiero regalarle una flor 
Al amor de mi herida 
Quiero empezar otra vez 
Y cambiarme hasta el nombre 
Quiero apedrear el zaguán 
De las causas perdidas 
Y ver salir a papá convenciendo a mi madre
Quiero escucharte decir lo que gritan tus ojos 
Quiero perder el valor que gané por miedoso

Y quiero correr por ahí 
Mientras trepo un cometa 
Y levantarle la falda a la gorda del barrio 
Quiero vivir sin guión ni la misma receta 
Quiero inventarle otra letra al abecedario 
Quiero olvidarme de ti 
Quiero saber que es por mi

Que quiero y no puedo querer 
Mientras siga queriendo 
Inútil creer que querer es lograr olvidarte 
Quiero encontrar otro amor 
Y perderlo enseguida 
Para olvidarme de ti para toda la vida

Quiero silbar ""Let it be"" a la luz de la luna 
Quiero lavar en el mar lo que no sea futuro 

Y quiero correr por ahí 
Mientras trepo un cometa 
Y levantarle la falda a la gorda del barrio 
Quiero vivir sin guión ni la misma receta 
Quiero inventarle otra letra al abecedario 
Quiero olvidarme de ti 
Quiero saber que es por mi

Quiero jugar a la alquimia 
Y buscar en el Tibet alguna respuesta 
Quiero fugarme de mi para no ser de aquí 
Ni de ninguna parte 
Perderme en la antropología 
Dedicar mi vida a la filantropía 
Con tal de olvidarte 
Con tal de burlarte

Y quiero correr por ahí mientras trepo un cometa 
Y levantarle la falda a la gorda del barrio 
Quiero pararme en Iraq y mandarle un saludo 
A la mamá del idiota más grande del mundo 
Quiero olvidarme de ti 
Quiero saber que es por mí

Quiero regalarle una flor al amor de mi herida",Quiero,2007
Ricardo Arjona,"Cuándo fue la última vez que viste las estrellas
Con los ojos cerrados
Y te aferraste como un náufrago a la orilla
De la espalda de alguien
Cuándo fue la última vez que se te fue el amor
Por no dejarlo libre

Cuándo fue la última vez
Que te besaron tanto, que dijiste mi nombre
Cuándo te ganó el orgullo
Y escogiste el llanto por no perdonarme
Cuándo fue la última vez, que un simple deja vu
Me llevó hasta tus brazos

Cuándo, cuándo fue la última vez
Que te quisieron tanto
Cuándo, cuándo te ganó el orgullo
Y escogiste el llanto
Cuándo, cuándo volverás a ser
Lo que no fuiste nunca

Cuándo fue la última vez, que te sentiste sola
Y llegaste a odiarme
Cuándo llegó a convencerte, el maldito despecho
Que un clavo saca a otro
Cuándo olvidaste que el caso
No es entenderse sino que aceptarse

Cuándo
Si se sanó tu herida borra también la cicatriz
Y si un día nos vemos haz el favor de contestar

Ricardo Arjona,"Si me dices que si, piensalo dos veces
Puede que te convenga decirme que no
Si me dices que no puede que te equivoques
Yo me dare a la tarea de que me digas que si
Si me dices que no dejare de soñar y me volvere´ un idiota
Mejor dime que no y dame ese si como un cuenta gotas.
Dime que no,pensando en un s
Y dejame lo otro a mi
Que si se me pone facil

El amor se hace fragil y uno para de soñar
Dime que no
Y deja la puerta abierta
Dime que no
Y me tendras pensando todo el dia en ti
Planeando una estrategia para un si
Dime que no
Y lanzame un si camuflageado

Y me quedare´ a tu lado

Si me dices que si se fugara´ lo incierto
Y esa cosquilla en la panza cuando estas por venir
Si me dices que no seguire´ conquistando

Dime que no
Y lanzame un si camuflageado
Clavame una duda

Y me quedaré a tu lado
Siempre lo facil me duró tan poco
Y no lo niego me divierti
Pero la soledad me ha vuelto loco
Porque el amor nunca ha pasado por aqui

Ricardo Arjona,"Eran las diez de la noche
Piloteaba mi nave
Era mi taxi un wolkswagen
Del año 68
Era un dia de esos malos donde no hubo pasaje
Las lentejuelas de un traje
Me hicieron la parada
Era una rubia preciosa llevaba minifalda
El escote en su espalda
Llegaba justo a la gloria

Una lagrima negra rodaba en su mejilla
Mientras que el retrovisor decia ""¡ve que pantorillas!""
Yo vi un poco mas
Eran las diez y cuarenta sigzagueaba en reforma
Me dijo ""me llamo norma"" 
Mientras cruzaba la pierna
Saco un cigarro algo extraño de esos que te dan risa
Le ofreci fuego de prisa
Me temblaba la mano
Le pregunte ""¿por quien llora?
Y me dijo ""por un tipo, que se cree que por rico
Puede venir a engañarme""
""no caiga usted por amores, debe de levantarse"" le dije
""cuente con un servidor si lo que quiere es vengarse
Y me sonrió

¿Que es lo que hace un taxista seduciendo a la vida?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista construyendo una herida?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista enfrente de una dama?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista con sus sueños de cama?
Me pregunte

Lo vi abrazando y besando a una humilde muchacha
Es de clase muy sencilla
Lo se por su facha
Me sonreia en el espejo y se sentaba de lado
Yo estaba idiotizado
Con el espejo empañado
Me dijo ""dobla en la esquina, iremos hasta mi casa
Despues de un par de tequilas, veremos que es lo que pasa""
Para que describir lo que hicimos en la alfombra
Si basta con resumir que le bese hasta la sombra
Y un poco mas
""no se sienta ud. tan sola, sufro aunque no es lo mismo
Mi mujer y mi horario, han abierto un abismo""

""¡Como se sufre a ambos lados de las clases sociales!""
""Usted sufre en su mansion
Yo sufro en los arrabales"" 
Me dijo ""vente conmigo, que sepa que no estoy sola""
Se hizo en el pelo una cola
Fuimos al bar donde estaban
Entramos precisamente el abrazaba a una chica
Mira si es grande el destino y esta ciudad es chica
¡Era mi mujer!

¿Que es lo que hace un taxista seduciendo a la vida?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista construyendo una herida?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista cuando un caballero
Coincide con su mujer en horario y esmero?

Desde aquella noche ellos juegan a engañarnos
Se ven en el mismo bar
Y la rubia, para el taxi, siempre a las diez (je)

Ricardo Arjona,"Ayer, Jesús afino mi guitarra y agudizo mis sentidos, meinspiro
Papel y lapiz en mano apunto la canción y me negue a escribir
Porque hablar y escribir sobre Jesús es redundar, seria Mejoractuar

Luego, algo me dijo que la unica forma de no redundar es decir laverdad
Decir que a Jesús le gusta que actuemos no que hablemos
Decir que Jesús es mas que cinco letras formando un nombre
Decir que Jesús es verbo no sustantivo

Jesús es mas que una simple y llana teoría
Que haces hermano leyendo la Biblia todo el dia?
Lo que allí esta escrito se resume en amor vamos, ve y practicalo
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo, no sustantivo

Jesús es mas que un templo de lujo con tendencia barroca
El sabe que total a la larga esto no es mas que roca
La iglesia se lleva en el alma y en los actos no se te olvide
Que Jesús hermanos míos es verbo, no sustantivo

Jesús es mas que un grupo de señoras de muy negra conciencia
Que pretenden ganarse el cielo con club de beneficencia
Si quieres tu ser miembro activa, tendrás que presentar a la directiva
Tu cuenta de ahorros en Suiza y vínculos oficiales

Jesús es mas que persignarse, hincarse y hacer de esto alarde
El sabe que quizá por dentro la conciencia les arde
Jesús es mas que una flor en el altar salvadora de pecados
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo, no sustantivo

Jesús convertía en hechos todos sus sermones
Que si tomas café es pecado dicen los Mormones
Tienen tan poco que hacer que andan inventando cada cosa
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo, no sustantivo

Jesús no entiende por que en el culto le aplauden
Hablan de honestidad sabiendo que el diezmo es un fraude
A Jesús le da asco el pastor que se haré rico con la fe
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo, no sustantivo

De mi barrio la mas religiosa era doña Carlota
Hablaba de amor al prójimo y me poncho cien pelotas
Desde niño fui aprendiendo que la religión no es mas que unmetodo
Con el titulo prohibido pensar que ya todo esta escrito

Me bautizaron cuando tenia dos meses y a mi no me avisaron
Hubo fiesta piñata y a mi ni me preguntaron
Bautizame tu Jesús por favor así entre amigos
Se que odias el protocolo hermano mio

Señores no dividan la fe las fronteras son para los países
En este mundo hay mas religiones que niños felices
Jesús pensó ""me haré invisible para que todos mis hermanos
Dejen de estar hablando tanto de mi y se tiendan la mano""

Jesús eres el mejor testigo del amor que te profeso
Tengo la conciencia tranquila por eso no me confieso
Rezando dos padres nuestros el asesino no revive a su muerto
Jesús hermanos míos es verbo no sustantivo

Jesús no bajes a la tierra quédate allá arriba
Todos los que han pensado como tu ya están boca arriba
Olvidados en algún cementerio, de equipaje sus ideales
Murieron con la sonrisa en los labios porque fueron

Y le enciendo un cigarro a la nostalgia
Le doy un beso en el cuello a tu espacio vacío

Me juego un ajedrez con tu historia

Ricardo Arjona,"No se que historia te inventé
Para que te quedaras a dormir aquí
Lo cierto es que eso fue haré meses
Y no te veo ganas de querer salir

Olvidando cosas como el secador
Hasta que te adueñaste de todo
Incluso del control de mi televisor

Pues la generala me prohibió salir

No se encuentra nada en el congelador
Tu llevas 6 kilos de mas
Y yo le he abierto 3 huecos al cinturón

Ya cambiaste el número de casa
Para que esas golfas nunca llamen mas
Y me pusiste un celular
Y tú guardas la clave para mi buzón

El demonio se mudo a mi casa
Y no hay exorcismo que la haga salir
Ya colocó una foto de ella
Junto a su mamá en el recibidor

Y del clóset ni entrar en detalles
Que es campo minado a lo Afganistán,
Entre blusas y bisutería
Ya no tengo espacio para un calcetín

No ha podido Dios ni los 600 santos entender lo tuyo

Mientras la Florida que es como esa tía que se fue a otro lado
Se sienta a extrañarte en la calle al día de las coincidencias
Y yo que no toco vela en este entierro muero por la pena,
De no hacerle al mago y construir un puente de 90 millas
Para que los primos corran a abrazarse como se merecen
Y la ideología no se meta mas en lo que no le importa,
Que la historia es larga, y la vida es corta.

Hay un cubano en La Habana,
Vendiendo habanos prohibidos
Se le han quedado en la cama, tantos sueños dormidos
Un cubano en La Habana,
Que es inventor de futuros
Bloqueado a la americana el enemigo cianuro,
Un cubano en la habana…
Un cubano en la habana que no es culpable de na'

Hay un cubano en Miami
Rencores por tradición
Sandwiches un banadero lancha en su malencon,
Un cubano en Miami tercera generación,
Que habla de hacer en consorte con la misma canción
Un cubano en Miami, un cubano en Miami,
Que no es culpable de na'

Que se sequen los pies los que persiguen la Florida,
Que otros se lavan las manos con jabón de diplomacia
Ni el bloqueo es remedio ni aferrarse es la medida,
Cuando manda el orgullo siempre reina la desgracia

Puente habría que hacer un puente,
Pa' unir a tanta gente,
En medio del conflicto ha vivido y vive gente

Puente habría que hacer un puente

El tiempo va gastando el reloj de arena en tanto esperar
Vamos a hacer un puente un puente hermano
Vamos a unirnos todos con este tumbao
Allá en final del río se siembra bajo el sol,
Tabaco contra el frío cervecita con béisbol

Vamos hacer un puente un puente hermano..
Vamos a unirnos todos con este tumbao

Que fácil ve el bloqueo, un yanqui en la oficina,
Domingos al buceo, merienda en la piscina.

El Gremlin ya esta en ruinas quien quiere mas espinas.

Ricardo Arjona,"Habana,
Siempre a las mitades, tan mita' española, tan mita' africana;
Saben bien las olas que en cada ventana siempre hay un testigo.
Habana,
Juran los que saben que no saben nada pa' entender lo tuyo.

Habana,
Tan cerca y tan lejos, como esos espejos que reflejan nada;
Unos al bloqueo, otros a un trineo que jamás vio nieve.
Habana,
No ha podido Dios ni los seiscientos santos entender lo tuyo,

Mientras la Florida que es como esa tía que se fue a otro lado,
Se sienta a extrañarte en la Jayalía de las coincidencias;

Guaracha la cubana, con Celia y los Van Van,
Hay rastros de la Habana en Londres o en Milán

Hay ruidos de la Habana por toda la ciudad,
Coral Gables, Jayalía, Calle Ocho, Lincoln Road,
Cubanos que a escondidas extrañan la otra orilla
Barracoa, Santiago, Pinar del Río, Camagüey,
Matanzas,Varadero
Que allá en la vieja Habana, vedado en Miramar,
Hay rasgos de nostalgia por alguien que se fue
Cubanos del mundo con acento asincopado
En Roma o Budapest ,
Tocando sones del pasado en D.F., The West,
La clave, el swing, las curvas de mujer,
Nadie gana la batalla, todos pierden, es así,
La Política está lejos de Juan, María, Luis, Alberto, Lupe,
No importa donde vivan, si es aquí, o allá a la otra orilla,
Ellos viven, ellos sienten
Las medidas son pa' gente, no pa' muros de concreto
La historia es un suicida que revive años después,
Aquí no hay bandos, sólo hermanos,
Si me quieren de testigo, yo diré que no entendí,
Ya me dijo aquel amigo caminando en Malecón
""yo no sirvo de enemigo, si hace tiempo me rendí""

Vamos a hacer un puente

Vamos a hacer un puente

Vamos a hacer un puente

Que se unan todas las manos,
Que el tiempo sana heridas
Que no puede el rencor.

Ricardo Arjona,"La soledad no se toca el corazón
Para humillarme
Me pone a oír tus fotos
Me pone a oler tu ausencia
A ver la luz que esta apagada.

La soledad enamorada
Es un misil golpeando el pecho
La menopausia en cinta de un amor
Que ya no es na.

La soledad es el brasier que se quedo
Cuando te fuiste
El decival de tu silencio
El calendario de tu ausencia
El alma mater de lo absurdo.

La soledad enamorada
Es mi pistilo sin tu estambre
Es la hije'puta mas perversa y sigue aquí
Conmigo.

Yo no se si es una trampa que dejaste
Yo no se si es una treta, una venganza
Yo no se si tienes tu que ver con esto
La soledad enamorada sigue aquí

Esta soledad que se incorpora
Esta soledad de tus cenizas
Esta soledad que me evapora

Ricardo Arjona,"Mientras no me falte 
Tu beso en las mañanas y un café
Todo estará bien.

Y si se cae la bolsa
O el smog nos pone a todos a toser
Todo estará bien.

Y si conquistan el espacio
O el espacio nos conquista 
Me da lo mismo, todo estará bien.

Si estás tu estoy bien.

Una mesa, un par de sillas
Una cama y algo que echarle al sartén.

Pero no me faltes nunca
Que aprendí a vivir así
A ya no ser tan idealista 
Y pensar tan solo en ti.

Pero que no me falte nunca 
Ese beso en las mañanas
Que moriré con el humo 
Que se cuela en mi ventana.

Pero no me faltes nunca
Que me empezará a afectar
La critica de los diarios
Y hasta la publicidad.

Aunque al Apocalipsis
Ante la demanda le falten jinetes
Todo estará bien.

Y si empieza otra guerra
Y los demonios tengan nombre y apellido
Todo estará bien.

Si estas tu estoy bien.

Ricardo Arjona,"Usted que hace del mundo algo más que una esfera
Usted que me mira, usted que me cela,
Usted me hace daño, usted me da vida,
Usted que me construye, usted que me aniquila,
Usted que me destruye, usted que me revive,
Que bonito es decir que soy solo de usted.

El compás de mis ojos son sus caderas
Y no hago otra cosa que seguir a la espera
De un beso furtivo, de un beso cualquiera,
De una caricia suya, de un beso, un quebranto,
Tenia que ser mujer para gustarme tanto,
Que bonito es decir que soy solo de usted.

De usted, de usted, de usted,
Le digo así por ser discreto,
De usted, de usted, de usted,
Suena mejor cuando es secreto
Porque un amor tan clandestino y de trinchera
Suena mejor cuando es
De usted.

Usted hace de un pecado un milagro cualquiera,
Mete el mundo aquí adentro, lo que estorbaba afuera,
Usted aunque ausente, usted siempre se queda,
Usted tiene otra historia, usted porta una guerra,
Me escogió de venganza y celebro su idea,
Que bonito es decir que soy solo de usted.

Ricardo Arjona,"Yo nací de amor  y comadrona
En la misma cama de mama
Por una cuestión de cromosomas
Fui el varón que quiso mi papa.

Mi viejo era el profe de la escuela
Mi mama el sargento del lugar
Yo era su boceto en acuarela
El tercero y último en llegar.

Vi tantas lunas
Que hoy ya no se si soy o fui
Tantas vacunas
Para lograr sobrevivir.

Aprendí a correr una mañana
Antes de aprender a  caminar
Un teniente entro por la ventana
Y a todos nos dio por escapar.

Brasil fue campeón en el `70
Y en la radio Pol decía ei you
El gol de pele en cámara lenta
Y el cigarro entraba en el menú

Vi tantas lunas
Que hoy ya no se si soy o fui
Tantas vacunas
Para lograr sobrevivir.

Conocí el amor con la vecina
Y también alguna enfermedad
El doctor mandó penicilina
El amor cobró con soledad

Fui maestro y fui universitario
Golfo, cara dura y sobrador
Mientras el cabrón del calendario
No te hace jamás ningún favor.

Vi tantas lunas
Que hoy ya no se si soy o fui
Tantas vacunas
Para lograr sobrevivir.

Le pongo play a mi cerebro
Para ver lo que un día fui

Porque se acabara la vida
Te ves jugando a la escondida
Y al voltear preguntas

Porque caucara la vida
Aprendes a decir  que tal
Y despedida y dices

De este síndrome de la caducidad",Vida,2010
Ricardo Arjona,"Empacó un par de camisas, un sombrero 
Su vocación de aventurero, seis consejos, siete fotos 
Mil recuerdos 

Empacó sus ganas de quedarse 
Su condición de transformarse 
En el hombre que soñó 
Y no ha logrado 

Dijo adiós con una mueca disfrazada de sonrisa 
Y le suplicó a su Dios crucificado en la repisa 
El resguardo de los suyos 

Y perforó la frontera 
Como pudo 

Si la luna suave se desliza 
Por cualquier cornisa 
Sin permiso alguno 

Porque el mojado precisa 
Comprobar con visas 
Que no es de neptuno 

El mojado tiene ganas de secarse 
El mojado esta mojado por las lagrimas que evoca la nostalgia 
El mojado, el indocumentado 
Carga el bulto que el legal no cargaría 
Ni obligado 

El suplicio de un papel lo ha convertido en fugitivo 
Y no es de aquí porque su nombre no aparece en los archivos 
Ni es de allá porque se fue 

Si la luna suave se desliza 
Por cualquier cornisa 
Sin permiso alguno 

Porque el mojado precisa 
Comprobar con visas 
Que no es de neptuno 

Mojado 
Sabe a mentira tu verdad 
Sabe a tristeza la ansiedad 
De ver un freeway y soñar con la vereda 
Que conduce hasta tu casa 

Mojado, mojado de tanto llorar 
Sabiendo que en algún lugar 
Espera un beso haciendo pausa 
Desde el día en que te marchaste 

Si la luna suave se desliza 
Por cualquier cornisa 
Sin permiso alguno 

Porque el mojado precisa 
Comprobar con visas 
Que no es de neptuno

Y caduca en la muerte 
Por que te persiguen mojado 
Si el cónsul de los cielos 
Ya te dio permiso",Mojado [*],2010
Ricardo Arjona,"El amor tiene firma de autor en las causas perdidas
El amor siempre empieza soñando y termina en insomnio
Es un acto profundo de fe que huele a mentira
El amor baila al son que le toquen, sea Dios o el demonio

El amor es una guerra perdida entre el sexo y la risa
Es la llave con que abres el grifo del agua en los ojos
Es el tiempo más lento del mundo cuando va de prisa
El amor se abre paso despacio no importa el cerrojo

El amor es la arrogancia de aferrarse a lo imposible
Es buscar en otra parte lo que no encuentras en ti

El amor es un ingrato que te eleva por un rato
Y te desploma porque si
El amor es dos en uno que al final no son ninguno
Y se acostumbran a mentir
El amor es la belleza que se nutre de tristeza
Y al final siempre se va

El amor casi siempre es mejor cuando está en otra parte
Luce bien en novelas que venden finales perfectos
No te vayas amor que aunque duelas no quiero dejarte
Si eres siempre un error, por qué nunca se ven tus defectos?
Puede ser que lo que juzgo sea otra cosa, no lo sé
Que a mi suerte le ha tocado el impostor, tampoco sé

El amor es un ingrato que te eleva por un rato
Y te desploma porque si
El amor es dos en uno que al final no son ninguno
Y se acostumbran a mentir
El amor es la belleza que se nutre de tristeza
Y al final siempre se va

Y no te deja decir lo que quieres decir
Sin hacerte saber que se escupe hacia arriba
Es sentarte a mirar pasar frente a ti
El desfile mortal del cadáver de todos tus sueños

El amor es un ingrato que te eleva por un rato
Y te desploma porque si
El amor es dos en uno que al final no son ninguno
Y se acostumbran a mentir
El amor es la belleza que se nutre de tristeza
Y al final siempre se va",El Amor,2011
Ricardo Arjona,"Empezó haciendo panfletos con consignas populares
Un letrero ""patria o muerte"" en la pared, y el Che Guevara
Defendía el capital de Carlos Marx con argumentos colosales
Así lo conocí años atrás, a los 18

Enemigo de la radio y la canción con estribillo
El entorno le ayudaba pa' engordar tantos rencores
No perdía la ocasión pa' hacer valer sus argumentos de caudillo
Y el futuro se asomaba con sorpresas tras la esquina

Caudillo, tatúate en la piel lo que prometas
Que el tiempo puede hacerte un mercenario
Y ser tan solo otro falso profeta

Caudillo, de la revolución a la avaricia
Hay sólo un par de pasos en la brecha
Cuidado y te resbalas por lo fácil

Se graduó de abogado un abril y en el proceso
Los ideales empezaron a sufrir reumas y achaques
Reclutado en un partido liberal, fue diputado en el congreso
Su oratoria se hizo experta en la mentira y el debate

Yo lo vi haciendo graffitis ""patria o muerte"" donde quiera
Yo era el flaco con guitarra, no se bien si se recuerde
Se ve raro con corbata Ferragamo y Louis Vuitton en la cartera
Que fácil se acomodan los ideales a capricho

Caudillo, hoy silvas las canciones de la radio
El Che ya no es la foto en tu castillo
Hoy eres de ti mismo el mercenario

Caudillo, se te olvidó tatuarte las promesas
¿A dónde fue el muchacho solidario
Que dividiría el pan que hubo en su mesa?

Hay manifestación frente al palacio de gobierno
El tipo en el balcón presidencial
Se le parece a aquel muchacho",Caudillo,2011
Ricardo Arjona,"Fuiste tú
Tenerte fue una foto tuya puesta en mi cartera
Un beso y verte hacer pequeño por la carretera
Lo tuyo fue la intermitencia y la melancolía
Lo mío fue aceptarlo todo porque te quería
Verte llegar fue luz, verte partir un blues

Fuiste tú
De más está decir que sobra decir tantas cosas
O aprendes a querer la espina o no aceptes rosas
Jamás te dije una mentira o te inventé un chantaje
Las nubes grises también forman parte de paisaje
Y no me veas así, si hubo un culpable aquí
Fuiste tú

Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez
Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque
Que encendió la luz que hoy se desaparece

Así se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia
Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas
Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte
Nada más que decir
Sólo queda insistir

Fuiste tú
La luz de neón del barrio sabe que estoy tan cansada
Me ha visto caminar descalza por la madrugada
Estoy en medio del que soy y del que tú quisieras
Queriendo despertar pensando como no quisiera

Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez

Ni vuelvas a decir lo que ya sé
Trae tus aretes de mudanza

Al pecado que jamás yo te invité
Te pido a que te abstengas de reproches
Si todos mis defectos ya los sé

Hay amores como el tuyo
Que duelen cuando están o si se van
Hay amores sin orgullo
Que viven de perder la dignidad

Tu vida me sirvió para morirme
La muerte me enseño que hay que vivir

No arregles lo que no se descompuso
Que nadie aquí está listo pa' cambiar
Amores que se gastan con el uso
Merecen libertad y descansar

No pidas que te diga lo que sabes
Ni quieras tu saber lo que no se
De todo lo demás tienes las llaves
Y si hace falta algo, lo olvidé

Hay amores como el tuyo
Que duelen cuando están o si se van

Hay un puente hasta pluton con mis defectos
He cometido el mismo error 500 veces
Y estoy a 100 años luz de ser perfecto

Y he burlado a los fantasmas del infierno
Nadie me vendrá a contar como es la vida
Se como apagar un fuego con invierno
Y eso de portarme mal voy de salida
Yo podría decirte todo lo que quieres
Disfrazarme del tipo que andas buscando
Pero si te hago una casa sin paredes
A la primer brisa del mar saldrías volando

Piénsalo antes de decir que no
Puede que no sea tan malo estar conmigo
Piénsalo puede que sea yo lo mejor
De lo peor que haz conocido

Solo queda suplicar algún milagro
Después de autoflajelarme en adjetivos
Si me das lo que to sobra me consagro
Y ahí es donde empezaría lo divertido
Yo podría contarte historias cenicientas
Apelar el punto bajo en tu autoestima
Pero el tiempo algún día nos pasaría la cuenta

Yo le dije, quizá pa' probarla
""se me hace difícil el aire sin ti""
Yo le dije, quizá pa' animarla
¿a dónde carajos te fuiste sin mi?

Le encendí la hoguera al infierno
Me miraste y dijiste: ""que bonito cabrón""
Y yo como todo un pendejo
Con un globo en la mano en forma de corazón

Yo le dije: ""cuidado el lenguaje
Usted es una dama diga qué le pasó""
Tú dijiste: ""si quieres linaje
Ve a hablar con la vieja que te re pario""

Arrancaste con intimidades
Que hablaban del tamaño y de la duración
Y yo como todo un pendejo
Con un globo de helio en forma de corazón

Tocábamos el cielo con las manos
Quién diría que años atrás
Pintábamos grafitis de ""te amo""

Ponte a hacer bicicleta que vas a reventar""
Perdón si me abstengo el sumario
De aquel comentario que vino después

Quién diría que años atrás
Tocábamos el cielo con las manos
Quién diría que años atrás
Pintábamos graffitis de ""te amo""

No digas más, será quizás
Que me odias con todo el amor de tu vida

Ricardo Arjona,"Yo tengo un sillón de Marruecos que extraña tu espalda
Un falso Picasso que cubre el retrato en que estabas
Catorce adoquines que exigen tus huellas descalza
Yo vivo del aire que expulsa el olor de tu blusa

Yo tengo temor a perderte y terror a que vuelvas
¡no puedo vivir junto a ti y sin ti es imposible!
Me muero por verte otra vez y me matas si vuelves
¡Que bueno sería despertar y que tú no existieras!

Si tú no existieras
Serían más cortos los días
No habría que revolcarse en esta historia inconclusa
Que es una ruleta rusa con ganas de perder

Si tú no existieras
Sería más fácil el aire
No habría que respirar todo el aroma que
Dejaste desde el día en que te marchaste
Si tú no existieras

Tú tienes el don de lo extremo no hay cómo evitarlo
Jamás fui infeliz y feliz como he sido contigo
Tú tienes el don de lo absurdo y hay que soportarlo
¡sería mejor desde luego que tú no existieras!

Si tú no existieras
Serían más cortos los días

Ricardo Arjona,"Te juro que es verdad esta mentira
Si no me crees te lo podría jurar
Perdóname mil veces cuando diga
Te juro que no volveré a jurar

Te juro que esta vez te soy sincero
Te juro que te acabo de mentir
A veces se precisa un embustero
Que diga lo que tú quieres oír

Te juro, te juro
Te juro por los santos sacrificios
Que mentir será mi oficio
Si es lo que quieres oír

Te juro, te juro
Te juro que te miento cuando juro
Aunque fuiste tú, lo juro
La que me enseño a mentir

Detrás de cada estafa hay un testigo
Detrás de cada historia, una ficción
Tu sabes cuando miento y de castigo
Me haces creer que tengo la razón

Yo nunca te mentí para engañarte
Te juro que no miento por mentir
Te juro que te juro pa' salvarte
De no perder el tiempo en discutir

Te juro, te juro
Te juro por los santos sacrificios
Que mentir sera mi oficio

Te juro que te miento cuando juro
Aunque fuiste tú, lo juro

No hay esperanzas sin luz
Y no hay verdad sin mentira

Ricardo Arjona,"Otra luna nueva y yo te quiero
Mucho más que tres lunas atrás
Te quiero mucho más de lo que puedo
Te quiero aunque decirlo esté de más
Yo te quiero

El mundo está al revés y yo te quiero
Quererte me hace ser alguien mejor
Te quiero a veces más de lo que quiero
Te quiero aunque a veces cause dolor
Yo te quiero

No voy a rebuscar en la academia
Palabras para ver quién me las premia
Si este mundo cabe en dos palabras
Te quiero

Te quiero mientras dure que te quiera
Te quiero porque es la mejor manera
De burlarme de tus enemigos
Te quiero porque así es como te quiero
Te quiero y sabes bien que me refiero
A no quererte más porque no puedo

Pensé que era importante que supieras
Que te quiero y nada más

Ya fui tipo duro como acero
De esos que se guardan la emoción
""Yo primero muerto que un te quiero""
Decía antes de hacerte esta canción
Te quiero

Te quiero sólo porque a ti te quiero
Que sería de mi si no es así
Como dijo Pablo a sangre y fuego
Como digo yo te quiero así
Yo te quiero

No voy a rebuscar en la academia
Palabras para ver quién me las premia
Si este mundo cabe en dos palabras

Ricardo Arjona,"Con mi copa en alto me levanto
Me toca dar un brindis en tiempos difíciles
Quisiera entrar con algo que inspire esperanza
O esa la trillada frases de “unidos venceremos”

A ver
Que les digo
Yo no soy adivino
Cualquier pronostico seria errático
Vienen tiempos buenos
No lo dudo
Pero que hacemos, mientras tanto

Solo hace fácil mirar alrededor
Ver tantas caras llenas de incertidumbre
Los mas viejos se les ve tan tranquilos
Por que saben que todo es tan relativo

Dicen
Vivir con miedo
No es negocio
Solo para los noticieros
Lo que digo, es si el futuro es negro o blanco
Que vivamos
Mientras tanto

Mientras tanto vivamos mientas tanto
Corramos en la lluvia, pies descalzos
Brincando de charco en charco

Mientras tanto busquemos a esa chica
La que nos tiene delirando
Robemosle un primer beso o unos cuantos

Mientras tanto

Vivimos con el miedo del ultimo día
Desde que murió el ultimo dinosaurio
Se acercan grandes cambios según los optimistas
Mejor no dar un paso por si acaso

El pasado es cuento
Y el futuro no ha llegado
Se nos va la vida esperando
Todo el mundo apuesta a que algún día saldremos de esta
Y ami lo que me interesa es el mientras tanto

Mientras tanto
Gocemos mientras tanto
Gastemos los pulmones en la ducha
Cantando desafinados
Mientras tanto y por que no mi amiga
Agarra algún extraño
Regalale un primer beso, o unos cuantos

Fuiste tu disfrazado de ti quien pario a tus enemigos
Fue Dios disfrazado de ti quien curo todo el castigo
Mientras tanto a improvisar
Y como dijo una canción sigo aquí
Que yo sigo aquí oh…

Mientras tanto
Amigo mientras tanto
Contemos las historias que de niños nos contaban los abuelos
Para que esto mejore mis señores
Las mejores intenciones
Pero en lo que esto se endereza
Mientras tanto vamonos pal campo
Tirémonos de nalgas cuesta abajo
Cojamos terapia en el fango

Mientras tanto busquemos a esa chica
Que nos tiene tan enamorados
Robemosle el primer beso o unos cuantos
Mañana pues ya veremos
Por hoy no nos congelemos
Mientras tanto

Ricardo Arjona,"I want to be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some, somebody twice as smart as I

Yo quiero estar ahí
Para saber que hay alguien
Que te hace justo lo que tú a mí
Sentarme a observar tus lagrimas caer
Para mi placer

Wait and see
I mean, I want to be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits

Y ver como caen al suelo
Tus sueños

And that’s when I’ll discover that revenge is sweet

Y verte en mi butaca en primera fila
When somebody breaks your heart like you, like you broke mine


And that’s when we'll discover that revenge is sweet
As we sit there applauding from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, you broke mine

When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, broke mine",I Wanna Be Around,2012
Ricardo Arjona,"Fuiste tú
Tenerte fue una foto tuya puesta en mi cartera
Un beso y verte hacer pequeño por la carretera
Lo tuyo fue la intermitencia y la melancolía
Lo mío fue aceptarlo todo porque te quería
Verte llegar fue luz, verte partir un blues

Fuiste tú
De más está decir que sobra decir tantas cosas
O aprendes a querer la espina o no aceptes rosas
Jamás te dije una mentira o te inventé un chantaje
Las nubes grises también forman parte de paisaje
Y no me veas así, si hubo un culpable aquí
Fuiste tú

Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez
Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque
Que encendió la luz que hoy se desaparece

Así se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia
Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas
Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte
Nada más que decir
Sólo queda insistir
Dilo

Fuiste tú
La luz de neón del barrio sabe que estoy tan cansada
Me ha visto caminar descalza por la madrugada
Estoy en medio del que soy y del que tú quisieras
Queriendo despertar pensando como no quisiera
Y no me veas así, si hubo un culpable aquí
Fuiste tú

Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez
Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque

Después de autoflajelarme en adjetivos
Si me das lo que to sobra me consagro

Ricardo Arjona,"Eran las diez de la noche
Piloteaba mi nave
Era mi taxi un wolkswagen
Del año 68
Era un día de esos malos donde no hubo pasaje
Las lentejuelas de un traje
Me hicieron la parada
Era una rubia preciosa llevaba minifalda
El escote en su espalda
Llegaba justo a la gloria
Una lagrima negra rodaba en su mejilla
Mientras que el retrovisor decía ¡ve que pantorillas!
Yo vi un poco mas
Eran las diez y cuarenta zigzagueaba en reforma
Me dijo me llamo norma
Mientras cruzaba la pierna
Saco un cigarro algo extraño de esos que te dan risa
Le ofrecí fuego de prisa
Me temblaba la mano
Le pregunte ¿por quien llora?
Y me dijo por un tipo, que se cree que por rico
Puede venir a engañarme
No caiga ud. por amores, debe de levantarse le dije
Cuente con un servidor si lo que quiere es vengarse
Y me sonrió

¿Que es lo que hace un taxista seduciendo a la vida?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista construyendo una herida?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista enfrente de una dama?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista con sus sueños de cama?
Me pregunte

Lo vi abrazando y besando a una humilde muchacha
Es de clase muy sencilla
Lo se por su facha
Me sonreía en el espejo y se sentaba de lado
Yo estaba idiotizado
Con el espejo empañado

Me dijo dobla en la esquina, iremos hasta mi casa
Después de un par de tequilas, veremos que es lo que pasa
Para que describir lo que hicimos en la alfombra
Si basta con resumir que le bese hasta la sombra
Y un poco mas

No se sienta usted tan sola, sufro aunque no es lo mismo
Mi mujer y mi horario, han abierto un abismo
¡Como se sufre a ambos lados de las clases sociales!
Ud. sufre en su mansión
Yo sufro en los arrabales
Me dijo vente conmigo, que sepa que no estoy sola
Se hizo en el pelo una cola
Fuimos al bar donde estaban
Entramos precisamente el abrazaba a una chica
Mira si es grande el destino y esta ciudad es chica
¡Era mi mujer!

¿Que es lo que hace un taxista seduciendo a la vida?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista construyendo una herida?
¿Que es lo que hace un taxista cuando un caballero
Coincide con su mujer en horario y esmero?

Sé que roncas por las noches y que duermes de revés

Sé que odias la rutina un poco más que a la cocina

Dime si él te conoce la mitad
Dime si él tiene la sensibilidad
De encontrar el punto exacto donde explotas al amar
Dime si él te conoce la mitad
Dime si él te ama la mitad
De lo que te ama este loco que dejaste en libertad
Reconozco lo que piensas antes que empieces a hablar
Sé de tus 150 dietas para adelgazar
Sé que padeces de insomnio y que fumas sin parar
Imagino esas charlas que en mi honor han de entablar
Y hasta sé lo que este viernes le has de hacer para cenar
Y es que tanto te conozco que hasta sé, me has de extrañar

Dime si él tiene la sensibilidad

Y el mañana cuando esté yo ya me fui

Hago apnea desde el día en que no estás
Caigo hasta el fondo del mar, arañando la burbuja en que no estás
Imposible respirar

Colapsado caigo al fondo y en picada
Y no tengo ni el valor pa’ ser cobarde

Imposible respirar
El oxígeno se fue de este lugar

Prisa de rendirse y claudicar
Descenso en espiral profundidad
Amnesia de pelear por respirar
Deseo de rendirse en soledad

Oxigeno golpeando una pared
El pulso tropezando sin radar
Colapsa corazón a su merced
Morir será mejor que recordar

Te quiero aunque te sueña a demasiado

No entiendo y pesa mas que una montaña
Como es que un corazón invertebrado
Se quiebra por lo mucho que te extraña

Como es que un corazón tan desahuciado
Genere encima nuevas de esperanzas

Y el sol la desbarata
Mas débil que la anemia
Mas tonto que un disparo
Mas suicida que un minuto
Mas tarde que mañana

A la luna en bicicleta
Pedaleando hasta morir
A treparme de un cometa
A rearmar con tu silueta
La galaxia que perdí

Aterrizo en la cornisa de un satélite perdido
Tan perdido como el tiempo
Que me gasto en encontrarle
Quinta pata a un gato cojo

Ir a la luna en bicicleta
No es cuestión de ir a buscarte
Es cuestión de distraer esta sangre que circula
Sin tener ningún motivo

Mas triste que estar triste
Mas lejos que el pasado
Mas inútil que un consejo
Mas tarde que mañana

A la luna en bicicleta
Pedaleando hasta morir
A treparme de un cometa
A rearmar con tu silueta

De seguir sin recordar
Escapándome de todo

Tu risa que trae primavera
Aun que el tiempo este fatal

Lo poco que tengo es tan poco
Pero es esencial

Tengo un aguacero para mi verano
Y una ola para surfear
Una sombra que me sigue a donde voy
Y 2 pies pa' caminar

Lo poco que tengo es tan poco
Que hay pa' regalar

Tengo la noticia de que no es noticia
De que no me importa nada
Aprendí a graduarme en todo de aprendiz
Y no imploro agua pasada

Lo poco que tengo es tan poco
Que me hace feliz

Que lejos esta la fortuna
De lo que venden en la tele
Si es gratis ir a ver la luna
Que no se queje al que le duele

Lo poco que tengo es tan poco
Que no hay quien me ordene

Tengo un reloj entre las nubes
Un sueño que se va de fiesta
Tus pechos como 2 querubes
La tarde para hacer la siesta
Aun que el mundo esta al revés

Lo poco que tengo es tan poco
Que garante es

Tengo un aguacero para mi verano
Y una ola para surfear
Una sombra que me sigue a donde voy
Y 2 pies pa' caminar

Lo poco que tengo es tan poco
Que hay pa' regalar

Tengo la noticia de que no es noticia
De que no me importa nada
Aprendí a graduarme en todo de aprendiz
Y no imploro agua pasada

Lo poco que tengo es tan poco
Que me hace feliz",Lo Poco Que Tengo,2014
Ricardo Arjona,"Conviertes en oro el adoquin
Que pisas descalza por la casa
Alquimia en tus paso de jazmín
Vendimia de pasos cuando pasas

Vas dilatando mi pupila
Mientras preparas el café
En pantaleta en la cocina
Agua de luz para mi sed

Tan de marfil, tan delicada
Tan elocuaz, tan alocada
Como lluvia en el verano

Nube de luz bailando reggae
Vestida de Eva en el sillón
Nube de luz bañada de sol
Flotando del techo hasta el balcón
Nube de luz, nube de luz

Persigo la estela que me deja
Tu linea perfecta lo miro

Tienes mas luz que la mañana
14 secretos mas que el mar
Y un milagro entre las manos

Ricardo Arjona,"En algún lugar del tiempo y del planeta
Un milagro se fraguaba para mi

Cada juego del azar y el porvenir
Cada ancestro tuyo propagándose en la geografía
Para ponerte hoy justito junto a mi

Ya me vi, ya te vi
Por los siglos o minutos junto a mi
Ya me vi, ya te vi
Por el tiempo que nos dure el porvenir

Ya me vi gastando fechas del futuro junto a ti
Como otro eslabón del pedigrí

Ahora soy otro accidente en la cadena
Solo otro eslabón del pedigrí
Otro actor que se ha colado en tu historia y en tu escena
Por la culpa de quererte más que a mi

Ricardo Arjona,"Todo era perfecto antes de ti
Aunque debo añadir algo aburrido
Sabía que eras peligro y te seguí

Tu piel el pasaporte del pecado

Como si fuese propiedad privada
El tráfico a tus pies y voluntad
El norte se acomoda a tu mirada

Bipolar de diabla y cenicienta
Tanta calma anuncia una tormenta
Una tormenta

Besas, muerdes
Bailas después del amanecer
Fiesta, exceso
Nada que te pueda detener
Tu cuerpo es un bebe con metralleta

Boca que te exige ir a probar
Tus muslos como guardias de un tesoro

Archivan toda la jurisprudencia
Tatuajes cincelados en la roca
Castigaría más tu indiferencia

Tu boca fue arsenal de la humedad
Tu boca hoy te delata en soledad
Tu boca se desboca
Tu boca se equivoca
Ayer me daba besos y hoy dispara contra mi

Me dicen que escucharon a tu boca
Manchándome de pies a la cabeza
Te olvidas que el que olvida nunca invoca
Y si hace lo contrario da tristeza

Con carmín del rojo y huella digital
Son retrasos de tu ausencia universal
Que se agrupan como nada en un rincón

Ni cuando será el final de lo que fue
Para que carajos tanta libertad
Si no hay de quien escaparse para que

Luz de neón, tarde gris
Y los minutos duran una eternidad

Hay ausencia tuya en la cocina
Y sudor en el colchón
Hay aroma a sexo en cada esquina
Y una huella en el sillón

Mientras tu fantasma se me inclina
Deteniendo la pared que da al desván

La cocina era un motel de carretera
El sillón el molde justo a la medida
Eras nadie comaneci en la escalera
Y en la mesa eras el plato y la comida

Como fue? Yo no se
El pasado no quiere salir de aquí

Ya mordió el silencio
Ya apagó la luz, se prendió un incienso y a cargar la cruz
Como golondrina ya se despidió

Todo lo demás es un hotel

Vencerá el infierno con su libertad
Domará al demonio de la soledad
Burlará al insomnio con oscuridad
Vencerá la culpa en el sofá y todo lo que es bueno volverá

I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, What's his is hers

I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you

I was afraid to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground

I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you

Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

Catch me, don't let me drop!
Love me, don't ever stop!

So close your eyes and let me kiss you
And while you sleep I will miss you

Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

Y yo aquí recordando

En noche de navidad
y debiera estar feliz
Y ya ves que no es así
Porque no estoy en mi lar
No dejo de recordar
Mis viejos y mis hermano
Y me siento tan lejano
Que quisiera regresar

A lo lejos de la noche
Y se esparce en (así) un derroche
Que impregna mi corazón
Me encuentro otro maracucho

All results of dues being paid
Known as free trade more than the atf raid
Remember shaun nickname, pawn got more blonde in his wig than
Goldie hawn and his girl named laura
We call her sue in and out of court trying to take a penny out of you
Check your speciwoman
Victims got more rage than up in harlem,
Evacuate the premisice like a chemicist

Daforce known as the runnaway bandit getting swormed as I landed
Seen on candid camera remember baltimore and atlanta
Creeping through the back door bo ya on your whole show
While I flip script
Nutting but embarrassment like busta said they abandon ship
Yes im on target, you better spark it
Call the 5.0 to chalk it
Locking niggas up in the closet like I tell you I see fools flee
When u brand em wit da mic chey ya
Trying to intimidate wit a mug on ya face
When you speak but youz weak obsolete
I put a nail up in dat beat

What's the racket, what's the racket

Homeboys get tipsy now dey got lip gee
Dey wonder why dey pushing up daiseys
Youz a student now youz crazy
It really phaze to amaze me how the mood change
People was trying to be smoove like kane,
All of a sudden now dey mad in dey brain
From macking to packing straight off set jacking
And guns clapping two shots in your backing
You tell me that your violent
Remember death is silent
Program 911 in your cell for speady dialing
You ain't a killer
Your mom wants you at church
You fronting you weren't brought up to do dirt
Raise your hands to the ceiling instead of drug dealing
Two to the chin you lost that feeling,
Sleeping wit your lights, cuz your 40's gone
Hoods be fighting like in iran

What's the racket, what's the racket

Im coming to you again fool
You never did time in a pen, never saw a body fall,
You fummble your gat like a football
Don't even know about a hit you talk all dat hard shit
The only thing you see caged was at the zoo,
How can you live when your life ain't true
Come on it aint true and you know it
Freestyle session from DaForce and lord jayze Whats up G money

Gonna hit you with a verse 2
Yeah yeah, rise up I told you I'll be back like a booby trap
I'm stop stalling punk and gimme my snaps
Imma twist my style up in yo head
Yea yea troubled minds of a nigga nigga
Troubled minds of a nigga
Troubled minds of a nigga
Undataker giving shivers, taking 'em out with no doubt
Tripping from the clippin
What about putting 'em on putting 'em off
Breaking 'em off something proper, hip hopper
It's copper, and kicking like walker
The shocka, I rocka footmarks from reeboka
The bombs in tha locka
The stocker surrounded, and hounded,
Bodies rounded but not founded now count it,
How it sounded twisting

They capps when we rap
Flippin' money when we slouch
Taking the maps on they backs
No straps maybe perhaps shackle 'em down
When we pound creeping from the underground,
Homeward bounds recognize the renowned in your town
Hear me now check it out visualize the D.A.F.O.R.C.E
Deeply kicking it in your don't you sleep
And you peep and you cheap
'Cause you weak in yo knees cuz you weak in yo knees
Baby 'cause you weak in yo knees

Tell me what you want to do and where you want to go
Ain't no need to rush it baby we can take it slow
I swear it must be cupid shooting arrows with his bow
I notice in your eyes a certain glow
Have me wondering now
Is it really me or tell me do you feel the same
I feel like I'm in love and I don't even know your name
I know what I am saying to you may sound pretty lame
Your love is like an everlasting flame

Please give me a signal so I know you understand
Maybe I should start by making gestures with my hand

Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer

And if she claims ah you tell her baby no way

For the pain that I've caused

Ricardo Juarez & His Orchestra,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

I would be, caught in the undertow

Cuando la lágrima de pronto asomó 
Y te das cuenta que el tiempo voló

Cómo no voy a acordarme cuando amasabas en casa 
Y jugaba a las escondidas para robarte el pan de la cocina 
Y los domingos en familia èramos más de veinte 
Rodeando la gran mesa y el asado a la parrilla 
El vino, el fútbol después 
Y las famosas discusiones de los mayores 
Que si la política, que si la plata
Que si aumentó el costo de la vida
Que si el perro viejo mordió a uno de los chicos yo no sé
Terminábamos siempre igual 
Como todos los domingos, a las patadas

Volvíamos como siempre a casa de la abuela

Ricardo Montaner,"Lady Juan es asiduo
A los perfumes caros
Se fue de su ciudad en tren
Huyendo de un traspié

Lady Juan vende flores
Devoto, fiel de sorte
Le teme al tiempo y la vejez
Es hijo de la timidez

Como otra lady
Asumiendo su virtud
De ser un solitario más
Es señalado
Por la pulcra multitud

Ahí va lady Juan
To night luces y carmín
To night vida en boulevar
To night quiero ser feliz

Cuando llega la noche
Quiere que le quieran
Envuelve su cabeza en tul
Y sale La boheme

",Lady Juan,1991
Ricardo Montaner,"Ven acá un cuento te voy a contar
Se trata de tu soledad
Why el rollo que en mi mente hay

Ven aquí o deja que me acerque yo
Why luego intenta complacer
Tus ansias locas de un amor

Muchacha sin amor
La vida es un lugar fatal
Acércate un poquito más tranquila
Que todo marcha bien

Un, dos, tres con mente nueva why al revés
Dame un minuto para andar
Como chiflado del amor por el mundo
Tú, solamente tú puedes conseguir hacerme feliz

Muchacha hoy, va a salir el sol
No hay nada mejor para mí
Muchacha

Oyeme si no te logro convencer
Me huele que tu posición
Me va a poner de mal humor

Muchacha por favor apaga la televisión
Concéntrate en mi corazón
Mira que puedes terminar peor
Baila muchachita, muchacha bonita
",Muchacha,1991
Ricardo Montaner,"Acostumbramos mirarnos
Más allá de la boca
En una reunión
No somos nada discretos

Nuestro porte y glamour
Llaman la atención
Procurando siempre la oscuridad
Encontrando excusas para escapar

Una pareja superior
Un modelo Dior
Ella un poco alocada
Y yo peor algo superior

Algo de imitar la pareja del año
En la sociedad dos turistas
Sueltos en la ciudad seduciéndonos
En medio de un bar

Acostumbramos tocarnos
Más abajo de la ropa en el comedor
Nos damos juntos un baño
Bajo la lluvia bailamos una balada de amor

Una pareja superior

",La Pareja del Ano,1991
Ricardo Montaner,"Aqui no corre el tiempo tras la prisa 
Jamas se ven pasar las mismas golondrinas 
Aqui no sale el sol 
Pues no se oculta 
Quisiera estar contigo hoya why neblina 
No tengo que gritar para que escuches 
Ni tocarte la cara para que me sientas 
Si me notas perdida la mirada 
Es que ahora te miro con el alma 
Te espare en la ultima pagina del libro 
A media tarde urgente de cariÃ±o 
Te espare en la altura sublime del silencio 
Para hacerte el amor en una nube 
En una nube al final del arco iris 

No tienes que seguir estando triste 
Solo me puse alas why me fui volando a las estrellas 
why si me notas perdida la Mirada 
Es que ahora te miro con el alma 
Te espare en la ultima pagina del libro

Con amor, con amor
Puede un vagabundo
Encontrar su vagabunda

Puede que una guerra
Se termine hoy

Hoy una pareja
Toca las estrellas
Con amor, con amor

Hoy se reza el credo
En una discoteca
La gente baila y canta
En una iglesia
Y los políticos ya no interesan
Un mundo nuevo está por renacer

Puedo arodillarme
Y pedir perdón
Con amor, con amor
Puedo revolcarme
Contigo en la arena
Con amor, con amor

Hoy la gente
Ya no quiere que le mientan
La porquería ya nos da vergüenza
Se ha enfurecido la naturaleza
Un mundo nuevo está por empezar

Mira lo que pasa
Con la gente que no quiere
Se lo come el tigre
Sale de su casa

Lleva al mundo lo que tiene
Tiene cucarachas en su corazón
Qué le pasa, qué le pasa
Qué le pasa pobrecito

Dame la mano que puedo caer
Con amor, con amor
Llámame hermano y cuenta conmigo
Con amor

Uh, eh, epa, yo, tu, hey, que pasó
Cómo pago hacienda
Si no tengo plata

Si no tengo voz
Cómo conquistarte
Cómo enamorarte

Eso, eso mismo

Una aureola nos cubre
Nos llenamos de sueños

Cuando llegan las luces
Del color que buscamos
Somos una pradera

Cuando nacen amores

Somos como los niños
Que de nada lloramos
Somos unos felinos
Que buscamos el roce

La mirada y el mimo
De la mano del amo

Cuando nacen amores
Los amores

Una emoción como ninguna
Nos justifica ante la vida

Amor del mío
Intenso y puro
Siento que vivo
Cuando te miro respiro

Amor eterno
Dame una excusa
Para amarte otra vez

Amor del mío incalculable
Puedo morir
Si estoy muriendo contigo

Amor del mío
Ámame ahora
Que acaba de empezar la canción

Cuando nacen amores
Somos seres de veras
Y la gente que pasa
Nos arroja las flores

Y miramos al cielo
Porque el cielo es pequeño

El universo está en la cama
Y las palabras son la luna

Amor del mío ámame ahora
Que va a terminar nuestra canción

Cuanta falta me hare ahora... 
¿Adónde vas así? 
Me miraba de perfil... 
why no pronunció palabra... 
¿Adónde vas mujer?

Hasta el rio why abrazarla...

De la sonrisa de un niño
Cuando toca en la luz roja
Mi cristal

Su pensamiento estaba
En la luna o en el limbo
No me daba la mirada para ver
Que está queriéndome decir

Que ya es hora
De ayudarlos a vivir

Sufro, si en una calle de América
Se duerme friolento un corazón
Jugando a la rayuela con su vida
Se pierde a diario algún hijo del sol

Siento que se humedece mi alma
Y que mi continente entristeció
Paciencia soldadito de hojalata
Que mañana sonreirá el hijo del sol

Y lo dejo a la mitad

Un mensaje telefónico
Me obliga a comprender
Que no crea en los milagros
Que no espere, para qué

De momento no persigo
Ser feliz en un lugar
Ni encontrar otra pareja
Que me ayude a olvidar

Es injusto y no pretendo
Utilizar a nadie más
En el mar de corazones
Solitarios naufragar

Estoy parado en medio de la vía
Y el autobús que espero ya no pasa por aquí

De dolor natural

Lo malo es que mis nervios
No se van a acostumbrar

Anclado en un puerto a orillas del miedo
Queriendo hacerse a la mar
Soltar sus amarras

Piel adentro suspiro sin ganas
Caramelo que no sabe a nada
Y lleno mi vida y sigue vacía

Piel adentro la recuerdo
Este amor que se acuesta conmigo
Este amor que vive en mí

Este amor convencido, va
Por mis cinco sentidos, va
Recorriéndome todo

Piel adentro, no aguanto más
Este amor hecho polvo, va
Evitando mi mente va
Caminando dormido, va

Piel adentro caliente, va
Este amor convencido, va
Por mis cinco sentidos, va
Caminando dormido

Piel adentro tengo el sentimiento
Clavado en el medio de mis lamentos
Queriéndome desangrar, cortando mi alma

Piel adentro, también sus palabras
Recordándome que lo siento

Lejos de lo que llaman 
La felicidad

De esta cara en que me ves, 
De lo que puede ser un tipo sin mujer

Amado, acariciado por manos frágiles

Ricardo Montaner,"Viene corriendo despacio
Saltando contenta que abrió un girasol
Vive alegrando mi vida
Y apenas existe en mi imaginación

Sabe cantar muy bien, pintar muy bien
Revuelca en el pasto su amor

Cuando estarás aquí, sonriéndome
No te sigas haciendo esperar
Cuando estarás aquí en la vida real
Alegrando sonriente mi hogar, angelical

Cubre de pecas mi espacio
De mil carcajadas y trozos de pan
Desenredando sus rizos
A pasos tranquilos me viene a buscar

Suele mirar el tren alejándose
Y compra mi amor con amor

",Angelical,1993
Ricardo Montaner,"Voy de mal en peor otra tarde de aquí para allá
Provocando la casualidad de verte pasar
Busco un sitio común donde
Exista alguien común

Que teniendo algo en común
Me pueda decir la posición, que debo tomar
La próxima vez que quiera desertar

Cada vez que te vas
Se me eclipsa el sol se reseca el mar
Cada vez que te vas
Una simple lluvia es tempestad

Cada vez que te vas
Se me mueve el piso al caminar
Cada vez que te vas

Cae en contradicción, mi cerebro y mi corazón
La balanza se inclina del lado de la emoción
Sigo caminando hacia atrás en un caracol
Me quieres transformar

",Cada Vez,1993
Ricardo Montaner,"Es una chica más, que toma el ascensor
Del hormiguero gris donde trabajo yo
Ojos de sueño en el personal
Todos los días igual

Jamás la vi charlar, jamás la vi reír
Ayer imaginé que se fijaba en mí
No tiene nombre ni dirección
No sé de donde salió

Dentro de este laberinto
De cemento y de cristal
En algún lugar perdido
Ella piensa en mí

Quizás la chica del ascensor
Me hace subir la tensión
Es una chica especial
Es un pecado mortal, para mi corazón

La chica del ascensor
Me hace perder el control
La tengo que liberar
De su prisión de metal, para escapar los dos

No es una chica más se sale del montón
Es una realidad y una alucinación
Me vuelve loco tal como es
No pregunten porque

Tomar el ascensor y no salir jamás
Es mi definición de la felicidad
De los Domingos mejor ni hablar
Los odio cada vez más

",La Chica del Ascensor,1993

Dame con un grito 
La felicidad

De llevarte a la cima del cielo 
Donde existe un silencio total 
Donde el viento te rosa la cara 
Y yo rozo tu cuerpo al final

Y llevarte a la cima del cielo 
Donde el cuento no pueda acabar 
Donde emerge sublime el deseo 
Y la gloria se puede alcanzar

Dame un tiempo nuevo 
Dame oscuridad 
Dame tu poesía 
A medio terminar

Ricardo Montaner,"La otra tarde salí a caminar por ahí
Preocupado en una escuela observé
Como un tipo entrega a un niño
A través de la reja algo envuelto en papel

Le vendía la ruina mental
Le vendía un arma mortal

Ciudadano enmascarado
Has creado un imperio devastando la moralidad
Ciudadano enmascarado
Ante tus hijos eres algo ejemplar

Dales un poco a probar

La otra noche salí a pasear por ahí
Preocupado en un disco observé
A una chica delgada y bastante agraciada
Con intensa alergia en su nariz

Hasta el fondo quería beber
Hasta el fondo quería caer
Hasta cuando aguantar tu veneno
Nadie puede evitar tu visita al infierno

",Ciudadano Enmascarado,1993

Sales a bailar, oh, reina de la noche
Robas la luna, mis deseos y te escondes
Tarde o temprano apareces como sombra
Te esfumas y me asombras, dejando la huella de tu olor

Es tan sensual tu cuerpo de sirena
Tan ideal que me hace ver estrellas
No está de más tu pose glamorosa
Tan tropical

Pones de pie a todos en la fiesta
Sueles causar asombro cuando entras
Mueren los hombres al paso de tu aroma
Provocas la euforia y no te dejas conquistar

",Reina de la Noche,1993
Ricardo Montaner,"Esta noche te presiento
Estés donde estés
De mi locura no respondo
Es más que amor lo sé

No imaginaba esto antes
De conocerte
Aunque me oculté me descubres
Al encender tu luz

Siento que me estoy acercando
Inútil es que diga que no
He roto mi promesa y es cierto
Que quien se ha enamorado soy yo

Te presiento
Sé cuando llegas antes de entrar
Si piensas irte de repente
Presiento tu mirada y tu piel
Que me convencen

Te presiento
Inútil es que diga que no
Si te deseo y pretendo
Ser único en tu vida
Único en tu piel y en tu amor

Esta noche te presiento
En mi corazón
Haz conmigo lo que quieras
Que yo te seguiré

Hasta no ver la luz

Y dime qué y dime qué debo hacer

En milagros de pe a pa'
Conozco tu paisaje de norte a sur

No me sorprende nada
De tú fachada o tú interior
Si todo sigue así, será peor

Una mujer transparente
Como el cristal
Es una melodía sin variedad

Un corazón sin velo no es
Un modelo que vaya bien
Si quieres complacerme, dedícame

Un toque de misterio
Y de nocturnidad
Que a vive mi deseo
Y mi curiosidad

La sombra de un secreto
Flotando entre tú y yo

Un toque de misterio
Que salvé nuestro amor

Exigen la novedad
En el amor
Yo busco complicidad

Un aire de impostura
Y de aventura vendría bien

Qué buena la conga va

El baile me llama, hay gente en la disco
La noche es joven, te meto un pellizco
La chica sensual ha llegado a la fiesta
Tiene movimientos de gata traviesa

Arriba con la conga
Se quita la ropa delante de todos
Arriba con la conga
El novio furioso la vino a buscar

Arriba con la conga
La madre del novio estaba en el lugar
Arriba con la conga
Con un caballero que no era su papá

Vamos negro pa' la conga
Mira que quiero arrollar
Mi cuerpo desesperao
Oye sonar la bongo

Me pongo a bailar, bailar
La sangre se me alborota
Y me tengo que remediar

Vamo' pa' la conga, dice mi mamá
Vamo' a la pachanga dice mi papá, ae, ea
La pequeña Habana vive el carnaval
Todos los cubanos salen a bailar

Ricardo Montaner,"Es el momento, acércate a mi
Quiero ver tu cara, hablar de ti y de mi
Aveces parece, que tratas de correr
Y alejarte de mi,no sabes fingir
Mírame no me evites mas
Por que tanta vergüenza
Tengo mi razón
Ya en las noches no me sientes

Y sin alma te entregas
Yo que te ame con ilusión
Que te di mi corazon
No merezco que pretendas olvidarme
Yo que mis suenos te entregue
Mi pasión te regale
Sin guardarme nada que pudiera darte
Yo que te ame con ilusión

Di que no es tarde, para hablar
De una oportunidad
Pero tu silencio, me destruye
No hay piedad
Aveces parece, que tratas de correr

Amo como me sabes decir
Lo que me gusta oír, despacio

Hago un gran muñeco en la nieve
Hago una canción de abril

Una casita
Con fotos en la pared 
Una postal de pareja feliz

Amor de roca 
Que resiste el temporal
Amor de hierro
Que se funde al palpitar
A dúo el corazón
Amor a prueba de erosión
Que deja en el balcón olor a piel 
Y estrellas que nos ven

Amo cada detalle de tí
Amo toda la magia que hay
En una mujer, mi dueña

Para amar, nos exigen por lo menos la fidelidad
Sentirse protegidas, las latinoamericanas, son mi vida

De una perla perdida en un rincón
Soy más un arcón que no se puede abrir

Que no puedo negar que me amas
Que me hablas

Sobre la arena de una playa sola
Mientras el faro alumbra el risco

Para siempre
No olvides que te quiero para siempre

Remójate los labios en mi amor

Y por si fuera el siempre poco tiempo 
Te quiero desde ahora hasta lo eterno
O amarnos de ida y vuelta, de aquí al sol

Yo puse una almohada en el sofá
Para verte escribiéndome poemas
Eran mías las alas que rodeaban tu pecho
Y son mías las alas, que volaron con tus sueños

Yo soy el recuerdo inmenso 
Tan grande que hasta soy presente 
No puedo sacarte de mi mente
Ni arrancarme el alma

Soledad y luna llena, nostalgia en el aire

Yo fui una semilla en campo abierto

Y crecí en mil flores a tu alrededor

Y juntos construimos, este amor que ya es eterno

Que no dejes que me quede así
Oculto entre las ramas y sin ti

No bastaba con mis alas
Si desiertas mis abrazos de tu piel
Si me arrancas de raíz

Se cambian los amigos
Se irritan los humores

Se pierde la costumbre
De acostumbrar amarnos

Se pasará la espera

Quizá cuando te llegue
No sea tan hermoso
Habrás estado en vano
Calentando motores

Cómo podré, cómo podré, cariño mío

Si no te tengo el corazón casi no late
Con pálpitos normales

Cómo podré, cómo podré, yo no sé cómo
Si siento un muro que se opone a que yo te ame
Si mi universo, si mi estrella más brillante
Se oculta en el poniente

A veces pasa todo
Se pasa el poco tiempo
Que tienes para darle
A las cosas más sencillas

Luego no te lamentes
Después si no las tienes
Si el tiempo es inclemente

Se pasa todo
Derribaras a alguno
O habrá quien te derribe
Con tal de hacerse un futuro

Y a ti que te interesa
Sin ella no hay historia
Y el mundo nos estorba

Sería una pared igual a las demás si no guiara el viento
Nuestro olor para llegar vagando soplaría
Perdido en la ciudad

Si enfermase el tiempo pienso que se acabaría
La práctica del beso pasando a la teoría
Si enfermase el tiempo el beso sólo alcanzaría
Un vértice de labio trepando a la mejilla

Si esto de mirarnos tanto no fuese normal
Si se hundiera la sonrisa en pozos de dolor
Si olvidáramos lo bueno de hacernos compañía

Esperando en la parada

Yo te pido que me des olvido
Para que recuerde
Siquiera mi fecha natal
El país donde vivo y su capital

Yo te pido que me des olvido
Para que la olvide
Aunque sé de memoria su olor
Su teléfono nuevo y su dirección

Dame olvido, dame olvido
Tu valor de mujer
Premio Nóbel de paciencia
Aunque en silencio me grites
Que me calle y que te quiera

Océano de besos
Salpícame palabras
Inunda mi desierto
Y germíname de ganas

Porque se destiñe
El azul de la mañana
Y porque me ha dejado
Esperando en la parada

",Dame Olvido,1997
Ricardo Montaner,"Como serena es la brisa 
Cuando el sereno la empapa 
Como la flor de los montes sí 
Frotando como cascada 

Como sabiendo que estaba aquí 
Por ti esperando en la vía 
Yo te iba abriendo los brazos sí 
Yo iba pensando en tu venida 

Te metiste por mis poros 
Para alegrarme la vida 
Se unieron dos solitarios más 
Para hacerse compañía 

Un giro de amor me has dado 
Desde la tierra a la luna 
Hoy tu sol transpira para mí 
Agua bendita en mi boca 

Yo te amo 
Y por tu amor me hago santo 
Porque con este gran milagro 
Olvido todos mis pecados 

ES así es así 
Como llenaste mi vida 
Es así es así 
Con el amor que me das 
Yo respiro 

Es así es así 
Como me amarro a tu vida 
Es así es así 
Con el amor que me das 
Yo respiro por ti oho

Ricardo Montaner,"Este amor capaz de todo
Que suspira a bocanadas
Que se enferma, que se sana
Este amor hace que lo viva urgente

Bien calmado e impaciente
Este amor sin un manual de instrucción
Me hace comer de su mano
Y beber savia de árbol de limón

Un amor capaz de todo
Que nos baja el cielo al piso
Para ver como es el hilo
Que sujeta al infinito

Un amor capaz de todo
De elevar el piso al cielo
Desde allí ver una lluvia
De rosales en invierno

Este amor que nos amarra
Y nos ata con cadenas
Un amor a veces cuerdo
Y a veces no

",Este Amor,1997
Ricardo Montaner,"Si tengo que contar de amor 
Pensarán que exagero 
Yo amo a una loca incurable 
Que usa mi ropa, no me ve defectos

Si tengo que contarles más 
La conocí en la oficina 
Yo era el más nuevo de todos 
Siempre le dejaba 
Una nota sin firma 

La mujer de mi vida no es normal 
Demasiado sublime, demasiado
¿Qué hice yo para ganarme 
El milagro? 
¿Cómo puede caberme tanto amor? 
Si apenitas la pruebo sabe a cielo
Y su luz puede alumbrar
Con sus ojos, con un beso
El pueblo entero

Si quieren que les diga más 
Ella es de corazón bueno 
Me da una dosis de mimo 
Ella es mi columna 
Cuando me deprimo

Y ya para finalizar
Porque los noto aburridos
Hoy cumplimos una semana
Me voy porque es tarde 
Le llevo el anillo

Abrazándonos, los dos
Bailamos en el boulevard
Abrazándonos, los dos 
Jugamos al amor",La Mujer de Mi Vida,1997
Ricardo Montaner,"Hojas sueltas
Ojalá que vuelvas aquí
Hojas sepias
De un libro antiguo

Hojas de carta
Que me dan llanto
Palidecí
Lleno de frío

Hojas secas
Dejan tus huellas en mí
Hojas muertas
En tu libreta

La que dejaste
Junto a la puerta
Como olvidaste
Olvidar olvidarme

Ojalá me recuerdes
Ojalá, cada tanto
Ojalá, en tu olvido eterno

Dime si esas hojas
Que vas pisando como a mí
Dime si este llanto
Que ha rebasado todo el mar

Es suficiente
Cada tanto, ojalá
Ojalá, en tu olvido
Te acuerdes un poco de mí, sí

",Ojala,1997
Ricardo Montaner,"Vuelve a mí otra vez, necesito amor
Vuelve a mí por Dios
Juro que no habrá más

Ni una palabra tuya, ni una palabra mía
Ni una palabra más, ni una palabra
Ni una palabra tuya, ni una palabra mía

Le arrancaré sonrisas a tu árbol de dolor
Vuelve a mí otra vez, necesito luz
Vuelve a mí por Dios, ven y alúmbrame

Ni una palabra tuya, ni una palabra mía
Ni una palabra así, ni una palabra
Ni una palabra tuya, ni una palabra mía

Haremos en silencio un refugio del amor
No veré pasar la vida y mientras discutimos
Y al tiempo se va

Pronto va a pasar el tren de la felicidad
Prepárate a saltar
Porque no se detendrá

Necesito verte ahora
Vuelve a mí por Dios
Juro que no habrá más

",Una Palabra,1997
Ricardo Montaner,"Creía que llorar era muy fácil
Que bastaba con pasearme
Por la soledad y el miedo con sufrir así
Y pensarte junto a mí, creía

Creía que el amor era una luna
Que llorar era preciso
Que lo hicieramos a dúo
Nunca imaginé intentar romper en lágrimas a solas

Para llorar me hace falta tu alegría
Para llorar quiero aquí tu compañía
Para llorar me hace falta tu calor
Y hasta el frío de tus pies cuando acaba de llover
Te pido por favor

Para llorar me hace falta tu alegría
Para llorar quiero aquí tu compañía
Para llorar me hace falta tu calor
Y hasta el frío de tus pies cuando acaba de llover
Te pido por favor, que vuelvas

Creía que nuestro llanto y muestra risa
Moriran en mi camisa y en tu bata de algodón
Y que la lágrima le jugaba una carrera a la caricia

Para llorar me hace falta tu alegría
Para llorar quiero aquí tu compañía
Para llorar me hace falta tu calor
Y hasta el frío de tus pies cuando acaba de llover
Te pido por favor

Para llorar me hace falta tu alegría
Para llorar quiero aquí tu compañía
Para llorar me hace falta tu calor
Y hasta el frío de tus pies cuando acaba de llover
Te pido por favor, que vuelvas

Y hasta el frío de tus pies cuando acaba de llover
Te pido por favor que me prestes tu una lágrima
Que vuelvas, que vuelvas

",Para Llorar,1997
Ricardo Montaner,"Más de uno
Se atrevería a apostar
Que mi regreso
Era algo imposible

Que hundirían mi voz
Y hasta mi libertad
De cantarle a tus amores

Más de uno
Se ha sentado a esperar
En la tribuna
Para ver mis fracasos

Y quisieron tirar
Hasta mi vocación
A la jaula de un león

Tengo tanto que decirte
Yo tengo tanto de mí
Para contarte

Tengo tanto
En mis adentros
Sudor de prosa y poesía dignas
De un concierto sólo tuyo

Regreso hoy
Para soplarte los oídos
E invadirte para atascarme
En tus sentidos ¡oh!

Muchas noches
Lleno de soledad
No hice otra cosa
Que escribir pensamientos

Yo tomé tu lugar
Reí y lloré como tú
Adivinando tus sentimientos

Alguna tarde
Cuando no sospechabas
Yo te espiaba
Y construía unos versos

Y en alguna ocasión
Te podrá parecer
Que es tu historia
La que cuento

Tengo tanto

Regreso hoy, volví por ti
Regreso hoy, para soplarte los oidos
E invadirte para atascarme
En tus sentidos

Tengo tanto
Que decirte
Tanto, tanto

",Tante Que Decirte,1997
Ricardo Montaner,"Hoy vale mi vida una cuarta parte
Ando moribundo el pasto de este parque
Hoy no voy a sangrar en la afeitada
Mi cara arde por otra cortada

Hoy me valen dos pesos los valores
Me queda de humildad sólo unas fichas
Hoy buscaba tu amor en un diccionario
Y me pasé completo el abecedario

¿Valen mis caricias algo en tu memoria?
¿Hay en ese olvido algo de mi historia?
¿Vale que lo grite a cada transeúnte?
Que todavía te pienso, todavía te pienso
Te pienso

Hoy el ruido del mar me deja sordo
Ahora mis olas no llegan a tu orilla
Me robé de tu playa unos corales
Y algo de tu agua para no secarme

¿Valen mis caricias algo en tu memoria?
¿Hay en ese olvido algo de mi historia?
¿Vale que lo grite a cada transeúnte?

Al que peleó tiene su alma de duelo

Ricardo Montaner,"Y si te miro congelo el fuego
Incendio el agua
Y me derrito ti si te miro
Divido al mundo en universos

Y soy vecino de la luna
Y si te miro al poema veinte
Lo hago mío veo estrellitas
Que se fugan ya
De cada hebra de tu pelo

Y si te miro
Me guardo el mundo
Y el infinito en un bolsillo
Y si te miro

¡Veo a la octava maravilla!
Y la hago mía
Me traigo el lago de los cisnes
Hasta ti para ponerlo en tus jardines

Y después cuando sospecho
Que me miras otra vez
A través de la ventana
Y después cuando sospecho

Que me miras así no
Casi no puedo respirar
Si me distraigo
Y si me sorprendes

Con un beso mudo
Aquí en el cuello

Congelo el fuego

Ricardo Montaner,"Cada mañana el sol nos dio
En la cara al despertar
Cada palabra que le pronuncié
La hacía soñar

No era raro verla en el jardín
Corriendo tras de mí
Y yo dejándome alcanzar
Sin duda, era feliz

Era una buena idea
Cada cosa sugerida
Ver la novela en la televisión
Contarnos todo

Jugar eternamente
El juego limpio de la seducción
Y las peleas terminarlas
Siempre en el sillón

Me va a extrañar, al despertar
En sus paseos por el jardín
Cuando la tarde llegue a su fin

Me va a extrañar, al suspirar
Porque el suspiro será por mí
Porque el vacío la hará sufrir

Me va a extrañar, y sentirá
Que no habrá vida después de mí
Que no se puede vivir así

Me va a extrañar
Cuando tenga ganas de
Dormir y acariciar

Al mediodía era una aventura en la cocina
Se divertía con mis ocurrencias, y reía
Cada caricia le avivaba el fuego a nuestra chimenea
Era sencillo pasar el invierno en compañía

Me va a extrañar, al despertar
En sus paseos por el jardín
Cuando la tarde llegue a su fin

Me va a extrañar, al suspirar
Porque el suspiro será por mí
Porque el vacío la hará sufrir

Que no habrá vida después de mí
Que no se puede vivir así

Ricardo Montaner,"Qué mal negocio
Fue ofrecerte mi amor
Nunca pensé
Que me ibas a engañar

Jugaste a quererme
Te burlaste de mí
Aposté mi futuro
Y lo perdí

No me quites tu amor
No robes mi ilusión
No me arranques
El corazón

No me dejes
Por favor
Que no puedo
Estar sin ti

Quise de ti hacer
Algo especial
Poder construir
Un mundo de los dos

Te hablé de mis sueños
Te entregué mi pasión
Busqué tu cariño
Sólo hallé dolor

Qué mal negocio
Fue ofrecerte mi amor
Nunca pensé
Que me ibas a dejar

Te día de mi vida
Sólo lo mejor
Ahora me pagas
Con un triste adiós

Y llevarte a conocer caracas

Para recorrerte toditita entera
Dame tu soberanía 
Quiero ver tus límites y tus fronteras

Ricardo Montaner,"Contaré hasta tres
Y sin respiro alguno
Iré por ti tras los de polvo
Y aire puro estás tú

Ya no puedo más
Se muere así mi fe
Y yo también y perdóname

Si te hablo un poco fuerte
Es que yo hablo así
Yo hablo así

Yo, solo te contaré
Que soy un rey sin trono
Llorando tu retorno
Como llora el mar ya sin nosotros

Yo si fuera un rey por horas
Te compraría una historia
Y algunos mares del mundo
Y te enamoraría en un segundo
Tan solo en un segundo

A dónde voy ahora
Con pinta de infeliz
Y lo soy

Me iré a nuestro bar
Y brindaré por ti
Y por mi
Aunque no estés

Yo solo te contaré
Que soy un rey sin trono
Llorando tu retorno
Como llora el mar ya sin nosotros

Yo si fuera un rey por horas
Te compraría una historia
Y algunos mares del mundo
Y te enamoraría en un segundo
Tan solo en un segundo

Que raro verte 
Esa semblanza blanca, blanca 
Da honores a tu palidez 
Y la casualidad es tan casual 
Si la miras mejor 
Sabias que vendría por aquí 
A ver si te veía

Luna llena, estoy de confesión 
Y como es sábado es peor 
Yo siempre tengo un sueño 
Repitiéndose 

Tocando su carita 
Y armando sus sonrisas rotas 
Yo siempre tengo un sueño 
Repitiéndose 
Y me pongo a perseguirla y no la encuentro 
Y me despierto 
Y aún despierto 
Creo seguir durmiendo

La posibilidad de convertir mi sueño 
Realidad va lejos 
Como tu palida luna
Lejos, lejos, lejos 

Luna llena estoy de confesión 
Y como es sábado es peor 
Yo siempre tengo un sueño 
Repitiéndose 
Tocando su carita y armando sus 
Sonrisas rojas 
Yo siempre tengo un sueño 
repitiéndose 
Y me pongo a perseguirla 
Y no la encuentro 
Y me despierto y aun despierto

La brisa 
Sola, como un cuento de hadas 
Sin si hada madrina
Sola, sola sin mí sin la gente
Sin la fatiga de andar mis amores 
Sin compromisos, tu vives por ahí

En cambio yo, vivo en el mar
Con tus recuerdos casi como eternidad 
Con tus olores que van 
Casi como el viento
Con tu alegría siempre a mitad 
Y en cambio yo, vio en el mar 
Con la nostalgia que no quiere que 
Olvide tu piel

Sola, como solo tú sabes 
Como un pájaro herido en un desierto 
Sola, con tus malos humores 
Como un volcán que fuma y que arde 
Sola, sin amor, sin futuro 
Vas viviendo en tu mundo 
Sin hacer ningún ruido 
Casi no te conozco 
Una sombra que no eres tú

En cambio yo vivo en el mar

Ricardo Montaner,"Donde brillan los mares
Y sopla fuerte el viento
En un viejo balcón
Frente al golfo de Sorrento

Un hombre abraza a una mujer
Sin contener el llanto
Se despide un vez más
Y vuelve a empezar el canto

Te quiero tanto amor
Te quiero tanto, tanto y tu lo sabes bien
Y en la distancia amor
Hoy suenan mas que nunca tus palabras

Donde hay luz entre las sombras
Como el brillo de una estrella
Va dejando tras el barco
Una infinita estela

Otra gira, otras ciudades
Otra vez lejos de sus brazos
Todo gira en torno a él
Y los años van pasando

Otra carta, una llamada
Los recuerdos ya son cientos
Hay lagrimas en sus ojos
Y su voz es un lamento

Te quiero tanto amor
Te quiero tanto, tanto y tu lo sabes bien
Y en la distancia amor
Hoy suenan más que nunca tus palabras

Pronto llegará a su tierra
A su patria tan querida
Pero sabe que es muy tarde
Apenas ya le queda vida

Toda su fuerza y su energía
Se la ha dejado a América
Y ahora regresa casi acabada
A su amor que aún la espera

Solo quedan más allá
Los triunfos y los fracasos
Solo los sueños de un ayer
De la espuma tras el barco

Y así cerca del final
Su corazón se va apagando
Y no habrá más despedidas
Y vuelve a empezar el canto

Te quiero tanto amor
Te quiero tanto, tanto y tu lo sabes bien
Yen la distancia amor
Hoy suenan más que nunca tus palabras

Te quiero tanto amor
Te quiero tanto tanto y tu lo sabes bien
Y en la distancia amor
Hoy suenan mas que nunca tus palabras

Ricardo Montaner,"He venido a comentarte
El porqué todo este tiempo
Fui agotando mi paciencia
De tanto esperarte

Tantos días de pelearme
Con el reloj por ser tan lento
Vi morir en cada hora
El sentimiento

Se acabó lo que aquí tanto se daba
Fue tanta la pasión
Que ya no queda ni un beso
Fue por ti por ti

Terminábamos en la madrugada
Presos del amor
Sin ser amor ni nada
Fue por ti por ti

Un amor exagerado
Un amor un tanto endeble
Un papel que se humedece
Y se pierde

Universo de tensiones
Dos ilustres desconocidos
Una estrella con recibo de luz
Que ha vencido

Se acabó lo que aquí tanto se daba
Fue tanta la pasión
Que ya no queda ni un beso
Fue por ti por ti

Terminábamos en la madrugada
Presos del amor
Sin ser amor ni nada
Fue por ti fue por ti

Tantos días de pelearme
Con el reloj por ser tan lento
Fue a parar al piso roto

Sin ser amor ni nada

Ricardo Montaner,"Vueltas y vueltas sigo aquí
Te juro que no quisiera
Llámalo poca fantasía
Llámalo costumbre pienso siempre en ella

Dice que no me quiere más
Ni siquiera en fotografía
Yo no le creo, no es verdad
Que colgara el teléfono si la llamo un día

Yo sin ti, quien sabe qué vida llevaría
Oh, yo sin ti dejaría todo para ir
A buscar soluciones donde no las hay
A probar mas emociones si porque

Yo sin ti viviría en la soledad
Oh, yo sin ti habría un gran vacío en la ciudad
Parece fácil olvidar, pero no es así
Tendré que arreglármelas sin ti

Vacio las gavetas, que ironía
Están llenas de sus cosas
Esta su licencia y su alcancía
Y una foto mía que se le olvido

Yo sin ti, quien sabe qué vida llevaría
Oh, yo sin ti, en la mañana no despertaría
De vez en cuando un restaurant buscando compañía
Le diría a algún extraño, sabes, ella es mía

Parece fácil olvidar, pero no es así
Si tocan a la puerta deseo que seas tú
Quién sabe qué vida llevaría, oh, yo sin ti

Por donde corre el rimel cuando lloras
Voy a llenarte, amor, con aire y selva
Y ser laurel lo que fue hiedra

Respirar profundo la luna
Para que el alma se me vuelva blanca
Para llenar de noche mi romance
Para rociar mi corazn de calma

Respirar muy hondo la luna
Para soplarte estrellas en el pelo
Para sentir el cielo en mi suspiro
Para dejar sin aire al mismo aire

Y mojar la lluvia nuestro abrazo
Y pasear en tu cara la llovizna
Quizs querramos esperar que aclare
O hablar bajito y respirar la luna

Respirar profundo la luna
Para que el alma se me vuelva blanca
Para llenar de noche mi romance

Y descolgaron la luna
Y te pusieron a ti

Y ha plantado bandera
Más al centro, hacia el sur

En tu cara
Se inaugura la belleza
Se detuvo el universo
Se quedó a vivir allí

En tu cara
Se saluda la sonrisa
Con tus lágrimas que hacían
Un intento por volver

En tu cara
Mis miradas camparon
Encontró razón
Para latir mi corazón

En tu cara
Se estrellaron dos estrellas
Y si antes eras bella
Hoy tus ojos brillan más

En tu cara

Que cayeron de mis labios hoy
Cuando te besé

Que me causan ardor

Pasé a ser un inútil todo un infeliz 

La luna llora también del horror 
Al ver que estoy vencido a punto de estallar 
Convencido que la luna 
Jamás se ha enamorado como yo 

Y que de besos solo sabe mirar 

Necesito que me digas como explicas 
Que la luna llore tanto como yo 

La luna llora también de dolor 
Al verme caminando en sentido contrario 
En sentido figurado me extinguí 
Pasé a ser un inútil todo un infeliz 

La luna llora también del horror 
Al ver que estoy vencido a punto de estallar 
Convencido que la luna 
Jamás se ha enamorado como yo",El Llanto de la Luna,2003
