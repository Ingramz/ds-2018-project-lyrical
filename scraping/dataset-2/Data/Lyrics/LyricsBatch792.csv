Norman Granz Jam Session,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,2011
Norman Greenbaum,"Skyline, fadin' away from me
I can no longer see
Skyline, no I'm goin' away
But I'll be back eventually
You know that I miss you
There's lots of things that I gotta see

I know, there are many things
Waiting for me
I know that these many things
Are waiting there for me
And I gotta see them
There's lots of things that I gotta see

Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
I'm comin' to you
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
I'm comin' to you

Skyline, fadin' away from me
I can no longer see
Skyline, a thousand miles away
I'll be back eventually
You know that I miss you

Norman Greenbaum,"When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's the best
When I lay me down to die
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's the best

Prepare yourself you know it's a must
Gotta have a friend in Jesus
So you know that when you die
He's gonna recommend you
To the spirit in the sky
Gonna recommend you
To the spirit in the sky
That's where you're gonna go when you die
When you die and they lay you to rest
You're gonna go to the place that's the best

Never been a sinner I never sinned
I got a friend in Jesus
So you know that when I die
He's gonna set me up with
The spirit in the sky
Oh set me up with the spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
Go to the place that's the best",Spirit in the Sky,1994
Norman Greenbaum,"I hear some people get married in the park on Sunday afternoon
And all their friends bring pretty flowers while the band plays a happy
Tune Now do you want me, do you need me, Do you love me like I love you?
Ooo

 What are you doing Sunday baby? Would you like to marry me?
 What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
 What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you
 Oh, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?

Maybe we should wait 'til night to join hands 'neath the stars above
And we'll be kissing our first kiss by moonlight as we vow eternal love
Now do you want me, do you need me, Do you love me like I love you? Ooo

 What are you doing Sunday baby? Would you like to marry me?
 What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
 What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you
 Oh, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?

Now do you want me, do you need me, baby
Love me like I love you?

 What are you doing Sunday baby? Would you like to marry me?
 What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
 What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you",What Are You Doing Sunday,2010
Norman Hackforth,"In a dear little village
Remote and obscure
A beautiful maiden resided
As to whether or not 
Her intentions were pure
Opinions were sharply divided
She loved to lie
Out 'neath the darkening sky
And allow the night breeze 
To entrance her
She whispered her dreams 
To the birds flying by
But seldom received any answer

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice would love to stray
When it came to the end of the day
She would wander away
Unheeding
Dreaming her innocent dreams she strode
Quite unaffected by heat or cold
Frequently freckled or soaked with rain
Alice was out in the lane

Who she met there
Every day
Was a question
Answered by none
But she'd get there
And she'd stay there
'Til whatever she did
Was undoubtedly done

Over the field and along the lane
Both her parents would call in vain
Sadly, sorrowfully, they'd complain
'Alice is at it again.'

Although that dear little village
Surrounded by trees
Had neither a school, nor a college
Gentle Alice acquire
From the birds and the bees
Some exceedingly practical knowledge
The curious secrets that nature revealed
She refused to allow to upset her
But she thought
When observing the beasts of the field
That things might have been organised better

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice would make up
And take up
Her stand
The road was not exactly arterial
But it led to a town nearby
Where quite a lot of masculine material
Caught her rolling eye

She was ready to hitchhike
Cadillac or motorbike
She wasn't proud or choosy
All she
Was aiming to be
Was a pinked-up
Minked-up,
Fly-by-night floozy

When old Rogers
Gave her pearls as large as
Nuts on a chestnut tree
All she'd say was
'Fiddle-di-dee!
The wages of sin will be the death of me!'

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice's parents
Would wait
Hand in hand
Her dear old white-headed mother
Wistfully sipping champagne
Said 'We've spoiled our child
Spared the rod
Open up the caviar and say ""Thank God!""
We've got no cause to complain!
Alice is at it again!'",Alice Is at It Again,2007
Norman Hackforth,"I'll see you again
Whenever spring breaks through again
Time may lay heavy between
But what is mean
Is past forgetting
This sweet memory
Across the years
Will come to me
Though my world may go awry
In my heart will ever lie
Just the echo of a sigh
Goodbye
I'll see you again
Whenever spring breaks through again
Time has lain heavy between
But what is mean
Can leave me never
Your dear memory
Throughout my life
Will come to me
Though my world has gone awry
Though the years my tears may dry
I shall love you 'til i die
Goodbye",I'll See You Again,2007
Norman Hackforth,"In tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire
To tear their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules that the greatest fools obey
Because the sun is much too sultry
And one must avoid its ultra violet ray
 
Papalaka papalaka papalaka boo
Papalaka papalaka papalaka boo
Digariga digariga digariga doo
Digariga digariga digariga doo
 
The native grieve when the white 
Men leave their huts, because
They're obviously definitely nuts!
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to
The Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindoos and Argentines sleep 
Firmly from twelve to one
But Englishmen detest a siesta
In the Philippines
There are lovely screens

To protect you from the glare
In the Malay States
There are hats like plates
Which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon
And no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete
They're quite impervious to heat
When the white man rides every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he
Will impale his solar topee on a tree
 
Bolyboly bolyboly bolyboly baa
Bolyboly bolyboly bolyboly baa
Habaninny habaninny habaninny haa
Habaninny habaninny habaninny haa
 
It seems such a shame
When the English claim
The earth that they give rise to 
Such hilarity and mirth

Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The toughest Burmese bandit
Can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon
Is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down
And lie down in a jungle town

Where the sun beats down
To the rage of man and beast
The English garb
Of the English sahib
Merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok
At twelve o'clock
They foam at the mouth and run
Slut mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The smallest Malay rabbit
Deplores this stupid habit in Hongkong
They strike a gong and
Fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate
Who's in late

In the mangrove swamps
Where the python romps
There is peace from twelve till two
Even caribous
Lie around and snooze
For there's nothing else 
To do in Bengal to move 
At all is seldom, if ever done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun",Mad Dogs and Englishmen,2007
Norman Hackforth,"They're out of sorts in Sunderland
And terribly cross in Kent,
They're dull in Hull
And the Isle of Mull
Is seething with discontent,
They're nervous in Northumberland
And Devon is down the drain,
They're filled with wrath
On the firth of Forth
And sullen on Salisbury Plain,
In Dublin they're depressed, lads,
Maybe because they're Celts
For Drake is going West, lads,
And so is everyone else.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Misery's here to stay.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
There are dark clouds hurtling through the sky
And it's no good whining
About a silver lining
For we know from experience that they won't roll by,
With a scowl and a frown
We'll keep our peckers down
And prepare for depression and doom and dread,
We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag
And wait until we drop down dead.
 
From Portland Bill to Scarborough
They're querulous and subdued
And Shropshire lads
Have behaved like cads
From Berwick-on-Tweed to Bude,
They're mad at Market Harborough
And livid at Leigh-on-Sea,
In Tunbridge Wells
You can hear the yells
Of woe-begone bourgeoisie.
We all get bitched about, lads,
Whoever our vote elects,
We know we're up the spout, lads.
And that's what England expects.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Trouble is on the way.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
The horizon's gloomy as can be,
There are black birds over
The grayish cliffs of Dover
And the rats are preparing to leave the BBC
We're an unhappy breed
And very bored indeed
When reminded of something that Nelson said.
While the press and the politicians nag nag nag
We'll wait until we drop down dead.
  
From Colwyn Bay to Kettering
They're sobbing themselves to sleep,
The shrieks and wails
In the Yorkshire dales
Have even depressed the sheep.
In rather vulgar lettering
A very disgruntled group
Have posted bills
On the Cotswold Hills
To prove that we're in the soup.
While begging Kipling's pardon
There's one thing we know for sure
If England is a garden
We ought to have more manure.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Suffering and dismay.

There are bad times just around the corner
And the outlook's absolutely vile,
There are Home Fires smoking
From Windermere to Woking
And we're not going to tighten our belts and smile, smile, smile,
At the sound of a shot
We'd just as soon as not
Take a hot water bottle and go to bed,
We're going to un-tense our muscles till they sag sag sag
And wait until we drop down dead.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
We can all look forward to despair,
It's as clear as crystal
From Bridlington to Bristol
That we can't save democracy and we don't much care
If the Reds and the Pinks
Believe that England stinks
And that world revolution is bound to spread,
We'd better all learn the lyrics of the old 'Red Flag'
And wait until we drop down dead.
A likely story
Land of Hope and Glory,
Wait until we drop down dead.
 
 [When Noel later used this number in his Las Vegas cabaret act, he adapted it to the American milieu, as he did with many of the topical numbers]
 
 There Are Bad Times Just Around The Corner
 [American Lyric]
 
They're nervous in Nigeria
And terribly cross in Crete,
In Bucharest 
They are so depressed 
They're frightened to cross the street,
They're sullen in Siberia
And timid in Turkestan,
They're sick with fright
In the Isle of Wight
And jittery in Japan,
The Irish groan and shout, lads,
Maybe because they're Celts,
They know they're up the spout, lads,
And so is everyone else.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Trouble is on the way.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
There are dark clouds hurtling through the sky
And it's no use whining
About a silver lining
For we know from experience that they won't roll by,
With a scowl and a frown
We'll keep our spirits down
And prepare for depression and doom and dread,
We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag
And wait until we drop down dead.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
The horizon's gloomy as can be,
There are black birds over
They grayish cliffs of Dover
And the vultures are hovering round the Christmas tree
We're an unhappy breed
And ready to stampede
When we're asked to remember what Lincoln said,
We're going to un-tense our muscles till they sag sag sag
And wait until we drop down dead.
 
They're morbid in Mongolia
And querulous in Quebec,
There's not a man
In Baluchistan
Who isn't a nervous wreck,
In Maine the melancholia
Is deeper than tongue can tell,
In Monaco
All the croupiers know
They haven't a hope in Hell.
In far away Australia
Each wallaby's well aware
The world's a total failure
Without any time to spare.
Hurray,  hurray,  hurray!
Suffering and dismay.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
We can all look forward to despair,
It's as clear as crystal
From Brooklyn Bridge to Bristol
That we can't save Democracy
And we don't much care.
At the sound of a shot
We'd just as soon as not
Take a hot-water bad and retire to bed
And while the press and the politicians nag nag nag
We'll wait until we drop down dead.
 
There are bad times just around the corner
And the outlook's absolutely vile,
You can take this from us
That when they Atom-bomb us
We are not going to tighten our belts and smile smile smile,
We are in such a mess
It couldn't matter less
If a world revolution is just ahead,
We'd better all learn the lyrics of the old 'Red Flag'
And wait until we drop down dead.

Norman Jay,"Go 
Go to the mountain if you must
Go to the burning bush
Happy would ease your troubled mind
How do the fade just stay behind?

I know you better than you think I do
Don't worry .. this is why I fell in love with you
The man in the looking glass
Is looking back at you at last

You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide

If happy times are too few and far between
It's a pity dear, we can't erase the things we've seen
So disappear, vanish if you wish
Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness

And the truth is you can't hide from the truth
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
I realized some time ago that I would have to let you go

May not be true to see that you would return one day
But in your present state you may as well not be here at all
You wear a thin disguise, it's from yourself you hide
Just take a look at us, we are heading for a fall

Now presiding in this quarter: hip-hop
Justice, my rap forté
Judge, jury, bailing for prosecuting D.A.
Et ceteras, paraphas
My modus operende
It's carpe diem whether the fact or word is your way
Comprende?
The people versus, you ain't no Sensi
Teaching that style of word-play
We got the words they
Regardless of what your friends say
They're all disable
Striken from the record and deemed indimissable
And this long arm of the law grabs a mightier
Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
The sentence of this live litigator
Close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
Stenonographer, that study law again, the jargon
Let your counselors 'a barking, in hopes of a plea bargain
But when you read back verbatim
What they're saying to persuade them
They realize exactly how I've played them
I come with the truth, whole truth and nothing but
'Cause the truth hurts just as much as in' with lies will
I brew skill with free fills from now until
Plagiarizing MC's get their flows distilled

Baby I don't die without you by my side
As long as you return into these arms that burn
Baby I won't die just take a look inside
Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn

I won't die, if you leave me high
I won't die if you're not by my side

And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is

Und überall brennt Licht

I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do? 
 
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came 
And though I should beware
Still I don't care you thrill me so

Norman Luboff,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

Are you to give me

Invade my soul

Hello means the birth of a smile

Then the skies will seem more blue

Until the dawn

Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round

Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that

Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

Or I'll never, never, never give my heart

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

Lars: Hey yo Ill Bill – will you sign this for me?
I found it at Amoeba it's the Green CD
Bill: No doubt kid, what's your name?
Lars: It's MC Lars
Bill: Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours
He played me your joint Lars: What'd you think of it?
Bill: I think it's bugged out, it's hot
Lars: Thanks, I like your last record a lot. Your lyrics are
Graphic, much like your brother Necro, is he psycho?
Bill: I don't know, it really depends though
He's Psychological, half psycho, half logical,
Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital
Lars: Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are
And the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
Bill: I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide
When the realness pops off one time for your mind,
And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot

CHORUS
As many places I've been. As many people I've met
As many haters I've dissed. There's people that I respect
As many times as I've failed. As many times as I've won
As many lives as I touch. The dialogue has begun

Bill: I grew up on heavy metal and hip-hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
Lars: Nine Inch Nails, Primus, “Weird Al,” and King Missile
Influenced me like a postmodern epistle
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
Who's your favorite rapper? Bill: Rakim, G Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA, Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day,
What type of metal stuff you listen to?
Lars: Old school Slayer CD's, Biohazard and
Bile were the bands for me
The first time that I ever heard Chuck D
Was the Anthrax CD, “Attack of the Killer B's”… chorus!

REPEAT CHORUS
Lars: So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church/state fusion tip?
Bill: I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with
Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit,
Lars what you think of it?
Lars: Out in Iraq, a lack of dialogue
Between the people is whack!
Bill: In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers
These gas prices got my people
With seeds having to gank pampers
Lars: The answer is not plutocracy.
The answers is not hypocrisy,
The answers is true democracy
Bill: The answer is the dialogue constantly

Oh, baby those mem'ries come crashing through,

I've done ev'rything I can to ease the pain.

The moon, the sun, and all the rest
The loving son, the faithful wife
The burnt out wreck of a poor man's life
The father, son, and holy ghost
They all turned away love when they needed it most
It's the last ride
Their little game is over
It's the last ride
It's time to take them home
And they can't cry 'cause they seen it coming
No use running, take it slower",The Last Ride,1978
Norman Smart,"I have a place where dreams are born
And time is never planned
It's not on any chart
You must find it in your heart

Never never land
It may be miles beyond the moon
Or right there where you stand
Just keep an open mind

And then suddenly you'll find
Never never land
You'll have a treasure if you stay there
More precious far than gold

For once you have found your way there
You will never, never grow old
And that's my home where dreams are born
And time is never planned

Just think of pleasant things
And your heart will fly on wings, forever in
Never never land",Never Never Land,1978
Norman Smart,"Your Daddy runs sheep and my uncle runs cattle
Nothin' can keep us out of this battle they wage
As it burns up the range, 'til no man is left
In the saddle
Your ranch is upstream and they dammed up the water

Thirsty cows scream for my uncle to slaughter
The sheep while yore Daddy's asleep
And I do the same for his daughter
If I had my own way, we would be together

Back in Pittsburgh
It's the only town east of the river I know
And I feel kinda bad, bringin' our grief
Upon this pore old farmer's house

But we ain't got nowhere else to go
Three years on this range since they started the range war
Nothing has changed except maybe change for the worst
If I'd married you first,

There might not have been any range war
You wouldn't be lost to the range war",The Range War,1978
Norman Smart,"Sometimes I don't know
I just don't know what to feel

Sometimes I don't know what to feel
Everything I thought that I knew starts to look so unreal
There's a ringing in my head that keeps me awake at night
Sometimes I don't know what is right

Today I saw a car crush my little dog under its wheel
It did not even stop, it just sped off and out of sight
Sometimes I just feel so afraid
But I know that no one else has it made

So if I just believe in myself
I won't need no help from nobody else and I can make it alone
And everything will be cool, I got to keep on keepin' on
There's nothing else I can do

Sometimes I don't know what to do
Someone said the world's going to end and I think its true
I thought there was some love in the world
But I guess I'm wrong

Sometimes I just feel so alone
I don't want to admit to my friends that I feel confused
I wonder what I'd do with myself if the world was gone
Something makes me stay on my feet

Don't you dare admit to defeat
And if I tell myself it's all right
I can comfort myself through the night
And watch another day dawn
And everything will be cool",Sometimes I Don't Know What To Feel,1978
Norman Smart,"Pretty bird with feathers falling
Pretty as a lady calling
For her pink and midnight lover
As she stares into the water

And a yellow moon is rising
And there can't be no disguising
That the pretty bird is dying
With a silver arrow lying at its side

Rivers of blood,
Oceans of tears,
Life without death,
And death without reason

To the whole United Nations,
To your greatest expectations
To the moment that you realize
As a dark figure slips from out of the shadow

Pretty bird closes its eyes, pretty bird dies
Another pretty thing dead on the end of the shaft
Of the Zen Archer

A man in parts forgotten
With an outlook that is rotten
And an attitude to match it
Finds relief inside a hatchet
And he halved someone in Boulder
Justifiability is in the hands of the beholder
And you just don't know what people will do next

Mountains of pain,
Valleys of love,
Death without life,
And life without meaning

To the promise kept and broken
To the love that's never spoken
Just as surely as I'm in your ears
A dark figure slips from out of the shadow",Zen Archer,1978
Norman Stanfield,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

Norman Williams,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene

And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

North Carolina Ramblers,"Now I've been all around this whole wide world
Down to Memphis, Tennessee
Any old place I hang my hat
Looks like home to me

Now I left my little girl crying
Standing in the door
Throwed her arms around my neck
Saying 'Honey, don't you go'

Now I've been all around this whole wide world
Done most everything
I've played cards with the King and the Queen
Discard the ace and the ten
                                  
    Oh it's don't let your deal go down
    Don't let your deal go down
    Don't let your deal go down
    Before my last gold dollar is gone

Now where did you get them high top shoes?
Dress you wear so fine?
Got my shoes from a railroad man
And my dress from a driver in the mine

Who's gonna shoe your pretty white feet?
Who's gonna glove your hand?
Who's gonna kiss your lily white cheeks?
Who's gonna be your man?

Now Papa may shoe my pretty white feet
Mama can glove my hand
She can kiss my lily white cheeks

North Carolina Ramblers,"A handsome noble-looking man came walking down the street
Beside him strolled a little girl both beautiful and sweet
Unconscious of the many eyes so lovely they were cast
On the father and his little angel child

From over the way there came a lady
Burning tears seemed to blind her eyes
""Oh, look, Papa, there goes Mama,"" cried the little innocent
But the father quickly drew his babe away

    She has fallen by the wayside
    She has gone beyond recall
    Not a hand would stretch to save her
    Not a friend that she could call
    Every door has closed against her
    Not a (friend/soul) for her will mourn
    She has fallen by the wayside
    She has gone beyond recall

In a cozy little cottage sitting close behind the trees
All around the porch grew ivy 
    and a pathway strewn with leaves
In a cozy little parlor sitting close beside the fire
Was a happy little family at home

Pressed close beside the cottage window
A sad face was looking in
""Take me back,"" the poor one whispered, it came
    from an aching heart
It was Lucy, she had gone beyond recall

Of the sweetest girl in town.
I'm never gonna ask her if she'll marry me
'Cause I know she'll turn me down.

Because I'm just a country boy

And gold in the morning sun

With a sparkly diamond stone.

It's the only one I own.

You were everything in my heart,
And my heart will go on, without you

And don't forget the things that you say
Could all come back to you some other day

You're dreaming of the things that you're holding in your hands,
I keep my head low, I stay in the know,
I break down the door with the renegade flow,
Professor Plum with the candlestick in the conservatory,
Dr. Prynn mixes rhymes in the underwater laboratory,
You know I flow I don't drink joe coming every Friday night I know the hottest place to go

I'm the hottest girl rapper that you know you ever seen,
Northern States it's a new beginning, gonna throw the first pitch top of the first inning,
Coming from the island where the sun is shining,
The flow is smooth like a vinyl lining,
It's like dumb de dumb I keep my eyes underground,
I'm walking down the street I'm the purveyor of sound,
It's like dumb de dumb de dee 1,2,3,
I'm speaking loud and clear so you can understand me,
The things I do so easily,
It's like dumb de dumb de dee 1, 2, 3,

Cause I'm 5'4 and I've got brown eyes,
Long brown hair and I'm medium sized,
You thought you knew me before, you thought you knew me when,
But now I've got the strength of a million men,
We bring the optimism and the opportunity,
You can feel the power of the possibility,
If you could see half the shit I see,
You see I caught the disease on the 1,2,3,
Beats passing through my system faster than I can spit it,
If you don't feel my style then you're not down with it,
I'm a saint not a sinner I am the prize winner,
Gonna get the NSP and host my own spaghetti dinner,
I'm a vegetarian, humanitarian, imaginarian, not a libertarian,
The country's getting ugly and there's more in store,
But don't blame me cause I voted for Gore,
Keep choice legal, your wardrobe regal,
Chekhov wrote the Seagull, and Snoopy is a beagle,

I'm running off my mouth, my engine running clean,
I'm running til I'm raw like I'm running down a dream,

I'll tell you all the reasons.
Girl gotta look good in every season.
Just ask yourself this, girl, who are you pleasin',
Starin' in the mirror, squeezin' and tweezin'?
If I could turn back the hands of time
And have a dime for all the hateful thoughts in my mind,
Like ""I can't do this"" and ""I can't wear that""
""Are my hips too big?"" ""Does my ass look fat?""
Might as well be superman, not a supermodel.
There ain't nothing you could buy in a fancy bottle
That'll ever let you love your own reflection.
Girl, close that magazine with your introspection.
'Cause you could feel good winter, spring, and fall
And when summer time comes, you gonna have it all.

I'll be your girl for all seasons.
I'll be your girl for all reasons,
Fulfilling all of your needs and
I'll be your girl for all pleasin'.

All the four seasons,
All of your needs, and
Stay with your man for all the wrong reasons.
All of your screamin', all of your demons.
Not enough time in the world for my healin'.

Girl, it's a setup and you're meant to fail.
You'd be better off on a live third rail
Just a few pass the skin test;
They don't care about the rest.
And yo, they mix lies into the cement.
We drink poison water and spend 'til we're spent
But youth it fades, crumbles, and ferments.
Eyelash curl, this is the first world
But vanity don't look good on the girl.
Oh, no, so when they line us up for roll call,
Let me make it clear on which side I fall.

Northern State,"Service and devotion, I motion to continue
With the style I bring you-the style I bring you
In the Hotel California and they're turning down the beds
And I came to spread love to the west coast heads
Love letters to Brooklyn from the Hollywood Hills
No frills, a thrill seeker seeking real cheap thrills
Like rain crying into a reservoir
Come out, come out wherever you are
I said come out, come out wherever you are
To all the MC's/to the gay MC's (but they grow orange trees in LA)
To the hearts of gold
NYC seasons change, summers fold
And I know I'm geeting old

Service and devotion, I motion to continue
With the style I bring you-the style I bring you

We're driving round, our feet are flying over the ground
No time to sleep
I'm writing rhymes and you're counting sheep
From the east coast to the west coast
There is always one ghost-hiding in your dreams and lurking unbeknowst
Asking what are you afraid of-why you have the chills?
Said we rock the bottom of the valleys to the top of the hills
Now you're paying close attenion to all of our verses
Said you're learning all the words and counting all of the curses
And I don't know where I'mm going cause I can't seem to see
Beyond tomorrow through the haze, through the cloouds how it'll be
And the past is nothing but a memory to me

Service and devotion, I motion to continue
With the style I bring you-the style I bring you

Towering and cowering and tumbling and falling
My telephone keeps ringing but I said to stop calling me
My head is filled with cotton, now it's soaked up in the years
And it's soaked in the tears and the fears and the beers
Everyday I be rotting up in urban decay
You know I'm headed to the Betty said this girl in the worst way
Insanity and vanity, I'm giving into sin I said
""Oh the humanity"" and pass another valium
And Muggs not drugs-hugs and french kisses
I'm that crasy bitch who flips all of the switches
Oh boy-listen to me When I say hop that plane
'cause you've got nothing to lose
And everything, everything, eveerything to gain

Service and devotion, I motion to continue
With the style I bring you-the style I bring you

Yo! This for all my motherfucking niggaz
On the West Coast, on the East Coast
In the mid-West, the Dirty South
Nigga, I don't care what you doing
Who you wit, or where you at, nigga
Go Crazy, nigga
Go motherfucking Crazy, nigga
Get motherfucking sick wit it!

[Chorus 2X: Tonebone]
Sometimes I might get a little Crazy
Dipped and sticking doors with one-eighty
Ever since the G's raised me
The streets couldn't fade me, go Crazy

[Christ Bearer]
Yeah, all why'all niggaz go Crazy
Leave the bitch-ass niggaz braindead in the daily
Too many ho's yelling, ""Christ Bearer, save me!""
Bitches can't swim 'cause the water too wavy
My nigga, get a little nuts
The Wu don't give two fucks, Clan like Klu Klux
Lace the Digi with the 'dro
Tai Bo, bust ya fo'-fo', let ya hair down, ho
Ya gotta get a little sick
Let niggaz try to play you like a step-child and click
Fuck the dumb shit, nigga, trip
Lose ya grip, pull a semi-automatic out the whip
Get psychotic, neurotic, they want it, they got it
Bang it to the boogie, hypnotic
Dip a stick and do a quick one-eighty
Like G's that raised me, a Long Beach baby
Taught me the difference of a bitch and a lady
The streets can't fade me when I'm liable to go Crazy

[Shoshot]
Crazy, like hitting a bank with a three-eighty
And maybe, flip and pistol-whip an old lady
That's shady, ya think that's shady?
Hell, not as shady as the bitch that had my first baby
And maybe, that's why I blow big dope on the daily
And maybe, I'll fuck ten more bitches and have ten more babies
And lately, I've been wanting to take shit back to the eighties
And maybe, I'll drive-by shooting at niggaz that hate me
See baby, you know my story and that's the way it still goes
Real crazy, I'm still rapping baby and I still hate ho's
Shoshot is sick wit it, gots nothing for ho's
but conversation and some dick wit it, can you dig it?
I'm a zipped down fool, and niggaz pause when I spit it
I might strip to my drawers, when I trip off the liquid
See maybe, I need to get fucked up 'til I hurl
'cause I'm Crazy like 2Pac screaming ""Fuck the world!""

[Chorus 2X]
[Christ Bearer]
Yeah, fuck that, go looney
Screaming ""Bitch, sue me"", off the wall like a young Paul Moonie
Break a rule, act a motherfucking fool
Roll a cutty on D's, solo at the carpool
Play Clyde Bearer's like a young Warren Beaty
Let Bonnie be ya lady so the bitch go Crazy

[Meko the Pharaoh]
While niggaz go Crazy I stay amazing
Doing what I do, straight blazing
Re-arranging, the time structure in the streets
Rotating planets like my people far out, you can't see
Believe it or not, a drop
NorthStar make ya heart stop
Too hot.. yeah, my shit stay live.. wit a vibe
that makes niggaz go Crazy when they get high (pass that)
Bitches button down ya button-fly
Niggaz bust ya fo'-five, get real live
'cause ya only live this life once
So bounce to this motherfucker like you own one (bounce)
Dip a stick and straight trip on a nigga
Take a sip and straight spit on a nigga
'cause the streets straight raised me
But they couldn't fade me (nigga), go Crazy

Sheila Park was at 3 desks in front of me
Her skin was dark 'cause she was always makin' fun of me
Tryin' to bag when I speak of what I'm gonna be
That's kinda sad, 'cause a pick-up she's-a gonna be
want to be in my videos with ho's, 4's
The pose with pretty toes and clothes
She goes (Destiny.. Destiny.. Destiny)
I remember when the bitch wouldn't mess with me
Told the homies from the block I was a flea
Matter of fact that she used to hate see back in '93
Now I push up on the block
22's in the limp fuze in the Alpine's knocked like..
(Destiny.. Destiny..)
Now she's on my ballzac's desperately
She says all she wants for Christmas is a real G
Throwin' with the key that could set her mind free
A father full of mockin' breed
The 6 figure fee and the S.U.V
I'll holler later as I dipped off the gator
'cause she wanted me to date her when she used to be a hater

[Chorus w/ Christ Bearer singing]
Oh I love weed..
I love my sweet..

[Beretta 9]
Her name was Destiny, I met her at a show, right?
Fly as shit, didn't seem like the ho type
21, she grown and free for the whole night
She got a man, but he won't even know, right?
I give her then, but she say she don't get down like
""O.K., man, I heard that shit the other night""
""So that's yo' plan, met with me, that sounds right""
At 12 AM I'm no psycho but it sounds like
Probably the lobby and, defintely in the room
We won't be watchin' T.V., but I keep you in tune
And I ain't all that easy, must be her perfume
There sayin' that she needs me and I guess she assumes
that it'll be O.K. to teast me, """"O.K
Get right on to head, bitch, let's play""
A dry hump and attempt later, guess who in the mix major
Destiny, blessin' me..

[Chorus 2X w/ Christ Bearer singing]
Oh I love weed..
I love my sweet..

[Meko the Pharaoh]
High-healed shoes, toes like pearls (yeah)
Diamond baby chain that hangs down to her pearls
Her features real vivid when she walks right on the curl
Niggaz blow their horns, scream and yell ""Hey girl""
Waitin' for the day when she would, pause her world
And give a brother a chance, or even a glance
to elevate the night for the perfect romance
But everyday I wake up I'm screamin' again
I stay focused and aimin', expanded the game
Hooked up with RZA and planted a flame
Now it ain't nuttin' to make a girl stop in her tracks
Actin' like she never knew the Stars way back
But I ain't even trippin', 'cause it, be's like that
Nobody can't see it, 'til ya, blow up the map
Nobody can't hear ya, 'til ya, blow up an act
And now she just smiles when I blow out her back

Like.. niggaz want the secret recipe
They I-D-E-see-I-double E from the L.B. (Long Beach)

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

But I just handed my pinball crown to him.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

All the fun we had on New Year's Eve,
How we danced 'til dawn,
Then darling you were gone,
Now it's almost too good to believe.

Seems like old times, having you to walk with,
Seems like old times, having you to talk with.
And it's still a thrill just to have my arms around you,
Still the thrill that it was the day I found you,

Just like old times, staying up for hours,
Making dreams come true, doing things we used to do,
Seems like old times, being here with you.",Seems Like Old Times,2000

From the moment that you came in view,
I could truthfully have said
""I love you.""

So if love is shining in my eyes,
It should come as no surprise.

How sweet and fresh the mornings come,
As I wake from my dream of you,
And the dream of you running through my heart,
Makes my day happy too.

Love has wings, and other magic things,
To the heavens we could climb,
If we could be together,

The only one my arms will ever hold

Norwich Cathedral Choir,"Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing",Good King Wenceslas,2004

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

When I was the age of two

And when I was the age of four
I was bustin' out shows with the rhymes galore

Alone where we have walked together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Norykko,"Es sólo una historia más
La bella y la bestia

Ella era bella
Frágil como una rosa
Él era una bestia
Esclavo de sus impulsos

Único día que les ataron esposas
Ya no eran niños
Crecieron,se hicieron adultos juntos

Todo marchaba bien
Eso parecía en su primera luna de miel
Juró serle de por vida fiel
Y ella a él
Una historia como otra cualquiera(sí)
Quién les ve y quién les viera

Pero el tiempo pasa
Y las relaciones se agotan
Se cansan
Ella ni lo nota
Porque esta ciega
Ciega de amor

Pero no aguanta la monotonía
Ya no quería ser dueño de una sola tía
O eso le decía a sus colegas de copas

Yo salgo con otras,pero ella ni lo nota

Bella estaba ciega
Pero no era tonta
Ya dudaba

Tantas noches sola
Cuantas horas de la madrugada

La primera vez fue la mas dolorosa
Te regaló una infidelidad por cada rosa
Y es que el perdón será tu debilidad
Pero lo que pasa una vez
Siempre sufre de una vez más

Este cuento no es eterno
Debo salir ponerle un fin
Ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Debo salir
Quiero vivir
Quiero vivir

Tantas cicatrices ya no puedo más
Me duelen las entrañas
De tanto sangrar

No existe un maquillaje que pueda tapar
Este moretón que es mi corazón
Ya no se cuánto más tiempo podré aguantar
Ya no me quedan lágrimas para llorar
El peso de estos años me doblan la edad
En cada rincón tengo un moretón

Dime que esto no ha pasado
Tu dime que el barrio ha olvidado
Mañana todo habrá cambiado
Y esto será sólo un horrible recuerdo

Sé que me quieres mi vida
Yo sé que no habrá más heridas
Mañana sera un nuevo día
Y otra vez seremos felices de nuevo

Empiezan las discusiones
Parece que a él no le gustan
Se vuelve insensible y agresivo
Y a bella le asusta

Lágrimas caían,tras un empujón
Y el primer puñetazo,
Te conformas con un perdón
Y un simple abrazo

No quieres darle importancia
Porque no quieres perderlo
Pero sientes impotencia
Y a la vez pánico y miedo

No puedes creerlo todavía
Después de tantos años
Te preguntas por qué te has caído en el puente

El silencio no te ayuda
Sé que no sabes que hacer
Sabes que fue la primera
Y no será la última vez

Créeme sé que no quieres más problemas
Pero no te quedes en silencio
Si tu marido te pega

Porque no le perteneces
Te mereces mucho más
Ese cretino tienen autoridad
Se la das y él se crece

No puedes detenerle
No puedes defenderte
No puedes hacer más que rezar por tener suerte

Cada día más normal
Pasar del amor al odio,
Se convirtió en algo habitual
Otro mal episodio

Bestia no te quiere
Pero quiere que seas suya
Para siempre

¡Si no eres mía,no serás de nadie entiendes!

Bella no podía más
El cada día era más bestia

Cuando ella quiso hablar
Ya era demasiado tarde
Se dio cuenta que vivía junto al mal
'La bella y la bestia'
Prefiero no contaros el final

Este cuento no es eterno
Debo salir ponerle un fin
Ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Debo salir
Quiero vivir
Quiero vivir

Tu final atravesó mi alma en sólo un compás
Callaste mis lamentos con brutalidad
Me has convertido en un triste numero más
Tu triste corazón fue tu perdición

Es demasiado tarde para ir hacia atrás
No volveré a tener otra oportunidad
Seré sólo un mal día en la prensa local
Pero mi dolor será tu prisión

Y si yo ahora puediera cambiar en algo tus miserias
Daría todo porque entendieras
Sólo un segundo de mi sufrimiento

Espero que al menos mi historia
No quede sólo en la memoria
Y traiciona nuestra trayectoria
Que no se repita jamás este cuento

Este cuento no es eterno
Debo ponerle un fin
Ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Quiero salir
Quiero vivir (trastorno bipolar)

Sé más fuerte que esa bestia
Debes salir
Vuelve a vivir

Sé más fuerte

No te quedes en silencio",La  Bella Y la Bestia (Con Norykko),2009

Through with my masterplan,
Now it's time to act
If I wait it'll be too late to save our beloved state

I have seen my only chance in my wardener
He's a corageous and good man but he has a naive mind
""Help me wardener, I'm not feeling well help me, I beg you, please, the ache is killing me""

Run quick now Soldiers hunting for me now
The time has come to take the power in my hand
To escape and save the land

Screaming loud in unreal pain.
I hope they'll hear my cries
The doctor's chamber with aid is just down the narrow hall.

Break loose fly away,
I'm running for my life
To the suburbs I set my course.
There I'll disappear.

Run quick now...

I must sleep, can't go on,
I must charge energy
Quiet and peace in a dead end street,
I'll sleep here 'til the dawn Run quick now...

The time has come to take the power in your hand
So act and understand




",The Escape,2001
Nostradameus,"[Narrator:]
In the royal court there was an evil man, telling prophecies
He was the advisor to the naive king who was poisoned with his lies
Ruler of (the) kingdom was really this man, making future plans
Infecting the king with his sweet sounding voice, but heart as cold as ice

Evil prophecies- Always fooling the king
Evil prophecies- Breething chaos and war
Evil prophecies- He invents them himself
Evil prophecies- To destroy the fine land in our hearts

[Hister:]
I am a wizard
I have thousand names, call me what you want
The people who think I'm a prophet of peace are calling me Hister
I will now agitate to anarchy, into civil war
To destroy the kingdom is my one great will, this will be for real

",Evil Prophecies,2001
Nostradameus,"[Intro solo Michael]

[The prince:]
Here we are, we stand together, fighting for what's right
We're marching on towards the palace, soon it is in sight

Does the evil prophet knows that we're coming, will he be prepared to die
Has he understand the signs that's written in the sky

The prophet of evil is standing proud and tall until the end of time
The prophet of evil he doesn't know the time is running out for him, I curse his soul

What is this, an ambush, it's a smaller unit enemies
It seems to me we are expected, I wonder how he was able to see...

As we're marching into the city I see, enemy troops on the streets facing me
Hundreds of them, thousands of them, behind them there I see:

The prophet of evil...

[Prince / The people:]
We still remember, how it used to be
In this fair land, before he came
To tear apart, he is to blame [x2]

[The prince:]
We fight, we fight, the sun shines so bright.
We fight for our brothers and for what is right
We fight, we fight, we can see the light.

Defeating the enemy before the night
Our arms are strong, we're fighting what's wrong.
Respect our opponent, we know that he's strong

See you, see me, and what we will be.
Guardians of justice, strong proud and free
Our men are fighting brave in front of me.

And I don't believe in what I see
The evil forces seems to kneel for me.
The prophet escapes and now I see

Now I understand, they're in my command.
Get after the wiz someone says in my mind
I follow him into the palace, my home.

And suddenly I find myself all alone
But then I see, up the stairs there he is.
I'm grabbing my light-sabre, how can I miss

He's facing the wall and got nowhere to go.
I look into his eyes, I'm making this slow
Now you will pay for what you did, you see.

To my father, to my mother and to me
I stab my sabre through his heart.
But he's laughing and his clothes just falls apart

[Solo Michael / Jesse / Michael / Michael]

The prophet of evil is dead and gone, defeated by the son of the crown.
The prophet of evil he will no longer lead us into misery, cursed be his soul

I'm your prince that has been false accused of murdering the King
Lay down your weapons, listen now,
I'm telling you a thing

I'm gathering resistance to fight the evil one
Who's out there in the distance
Before the chance is gone

So come, join me now
Let us fight against the evil of the world
Come, join me now
Let us fight, against what's wrong

Why should we believe in you, your words might be a lie
Why risk the souls of all my men, may I ask you why?

With beautiful landscapes in our arms embraced
Together we sing our hymn to this land

Thrown into prison, into ""Crown's inn""
I'm sitting here all alone
Already forgotten by people I loved
Surrounded by walls of stone

Goddamn you prophet for putting me here
Anguish and hate strikes my mind
Darkens my senses, tearing my soul
The rage is making me blind

I must control my hate
Don't want to be like him now
I must fight before it's too late
Our kingdom is at stake

How / Can I be free from these dungeons of hate
I want out to face my enemy
Can I be free from these dungeons of hate
I / want to face the one who killed the king

",In Prison,2001
Nostradameus,"[Narrator:]
Deep in the chambers where time's standing still
There's mixtures and potions for all of his needs
The prophet is glaring with eyes cold as ice
A horrible laughter escapes from his mouth
Raving in madness when fumes are inhaled
The poison is ready to fulfill his dreams
He walks to the kitchen unseen by all
The kings food is waiting,
It's not what it seems

The crystal glassclear poison pours like wine
Soon it will steal the good king's life.
Murder !

[Hister:]
Soon it will be solved, the problems I have
Get rid of the fool king who sits on his ass
The prince he means trouble, must take care of that
Maybe I'll frame him for murdering the king
When my lethal poison has taken his life
I'll place some leftovers for someone to find
I'll place it with great care in the young prince's room
When somebody finds it, the prince will be doomed

Have faith and trust in me

To justify the crimes

When a cleanhearted young man
Will be standing alone

Will the ending be happy
Or will it be sad...

Will the future bring, your wisdom to me
Or will darkness rule the kingdom, for all eternity

I will feel, you're there for me
As I walk the road of life you'll help me fight for what is right

Not Breathing,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

No time for girls like that
That's why I love my down arse ting
Just hits me on WhatsApp
No Facebook
No Insta
No Snapchat
One for this gyal
One mega backchat
Perm me on mouth
My girl, just relax that
Having a epiphany
I'll get rid of her now she ain't getting rid of me
I had enough of this girl
Man, she taking liberties
I said ""Come and chill with me""
She said ""I'm going Liberty""

I got, love from everyone and every city, I got

I've been through trials and tribulations
Jury messed me over but my bro got it nice, he kinda owes me his life
Oh we laugh about them times
'Cause that was back then, we ownin' businesses now
And we just do our mothers proud
They just wanna see us down but that will never be the case
They just wanna see a tear drop from our black woman's face
Man they love it when we draw blood from a black brother's vein
They all secretly want us to pain
But I want them to pay
That's why I'm steady gettin' it in numerous ways
Grindin' through the nights and the days, keep up with me
I ain't bein' cocky, I'm just being honest
Nobody could ever stop me, I'm forever runnin'
I'm the truth, ain't you try some of this pudding
Catchin' fishes with the way I bring the hook in
While they're ravin' best believe that I'm playin'
My tunes out but physically I'm in the booth cookin'
To make another one, another one and another one
'Til the summer comes, even then I'm makin' another song
Haters on my body but I shrug 'em off, shrug 'em off
I could see them plottin' but I got the drop, got the drop

I'm the one, I chose the red pill, they took the blue one
I ain't got the same mentality as most these new dons
Your team should eat off your plate for now if they're just servin' you one
But I guess some people minds switch up when they start makin' new funds
That's new money, yet they ain't gain no knowledge from the queen's head
They gainin' more from mine, but it's cool, at least they know
Told 'em I got the power and they should take notes
Looks like they took it literally though
Oh, well, fuck 'em
If it was ever somethin' I could munch 'em but we way past that
'Cause we a five star pack, five star gang
Calculated like some dues 'cause there's so many where we grew
Loyal like the Turks on ends 'cause they were local too
Product of my environment, my city's all I knew
Hackney, London all I know
With Tottenham down the road
School D.A.K, sandwich well for all the toast
Now there's different kinda bread being made
All the walls were breakin' down all around me before
Now the crowds are just shoutin' my name
Put three with all of the greats in the UK
Oh, they think I'm overly irrational, I'm such an animal
Chewin' away copies of me, I'm a cannibal
Stick to how you're runnin' free and let them keep doubting you
But one day they will worship all the greatness that you've actually got
