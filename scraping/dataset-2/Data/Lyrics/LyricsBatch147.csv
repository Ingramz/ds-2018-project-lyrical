Digby Wolfe,"We're your friends
We're your friends
We're your friends to the bitter end

When you're alone
Who comes around
To pluck you up
When you are down
And when you're outside, looking in
Who's there to open the door?
That's what friends are for!

Who's always eager to extend
A friendly claw?
That's what friends are for!

And when you're lost in dire need
Who's at your side at lightning speed?
We're friends of every creature
Comin' down the pike
In fact we never met an animal
We didn't like, didn't like

So you can see
We're friends in need
And friends in need
Are friends indeed
We'll keep you safe
In the jungle forevermore",That's What Friends Are For [The Vulture Song] [From The Jungle Book],2014

Digga,"Yours was the perfect love; I swear it was
Until I had your love my world was cold
I did what most men do, and I messed it up
But when I got you back my world was whole

The playa thing I let it go
Thought our life was set in stone
But it wasn't and I'm here alone
Nothing is in front of me
I feel I can?t even breathe
Don't think that I can't handle this baby I'm so

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

Where do I go from here? I'm so lost
You know how hard it is?
Fighting my way through this
Shouldn't even be like this,
Shouldn't have to feel like this
No, no no

Can't even have company
Nobody can talk to me
I messed up, bound it up fought myself through
Looking through my gallery; drinking and smoking weed
I hate you for doing this to me girl I'm so

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

(Broken, broken, broken)
Never thought I'd be this low down in my life
I swear I'm?
(Broken, broken, broken)
Everyday I wished that it was me that had died
And I'm

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken",Broken,2008
Digga,"And this one is for a special someone
She knows who she is, she's out there
I just hope she's listening to this track
I hope she's listening to the words and the emotion
And I hope she knows

Yeah a lot of people say it but don't mean it
I've been through the stages and I've seen it
Before I didn't feel it
But now I really believe it
I wanna take you places that's nice like Egypt 
I swear you got me hypnotized 
I ain't feeling ripped inside

I wanna hold you so tight
Breaking up? there's no time
Make love all night, 
I think about you all day and dream about you all night

And until the day that my arms hold on to you
Just wanna let you know that I love you

And I miss you its well
I ain't seen you for months but I hope you're doing well
Have you moved on yet cause I ain't moved on too
But when you do I hope he treats you better than I did
I know I'm struggling but Ill fight it
I think about you even when writing 
You're the reason I'm writing
I hope you learn how to stop crying
Don't give up on love please don't stop trying

On account of you I'm guilty
I'm not even surprised that you want to leave
You're telling me your heart feels empty
I can't commit to you right now 
But

Ironik:
One day you're gonna be mine
Take the right step when I'm up you're down
If it's right that I went and left you alone
Baby does care for me Nina Simone
Yes good reception without needing a phone
Somethings wrong
Cupid's arrow don't work it's like he's in need of a chrome
To shoot me and make me bleed love
Paint pictures to make me see love
Throught the picture a frame and let me dream love
Actually let me dream you
My heart's broken sorta like T2
But if I'm in a G5 I'll breeze through
I can't help but let emotions seep through
Can't see me why not am I invisible
I'm a criminal if love's a crime

Digga: 
I know it may seem
I'm not the man you need
Promise me one thing 
Save a little love for me (x2)

I don't like to spend but your love I'll buy
Save your tears ain't worth the cry
It's too expensive ain't worth the time
See honey you came from a bee
If you come to my hive I'mma make you sweet
Even a little love I'mma make you keep
All up in your knees I'mma make you weak
Like SWV sing a long with me

In time one day you're gonna be
Be, mine, and I don't wanna see you cry no no
Baby I've waited my whole life yeah
So please understand me yeah

I know it may seem 
I'm not the man you need 
Promise me one thing 
Save a little love for me (x2)

I hope it's not to much for me to ask

Digger,"Put 'em on an island in some other place then we'll have them destroyed. 
They know what I want; know what I need. 
They leave me alone and annoyed. T
Hey make me burn they make me bleed. 
They dazzle me dirty. 
Dale, oh might as well be dead; 
Might as well be blind. 
I can't get a second glance half of the time. 
Must be something in the water that I drink that makes me like Dale. 

So sick and tired of meeting girls high off of hairspray. 
So much hair care and nothing to say. 
They make me tall, 
They make me short, 
They make me brown, 
They make me blue, 
They make me ugly, 
They make me go ut and kill at night.
I'm so sick and tired of being Dale.",Dale,1996
Digger,"I was wondering what you would think of a stupid guy like me
'Cause I was thinking it might be real cool 
To be with a popular girl like you
But you don't even look at me in school
What can I do to get you to notice me? 

Because I want to be just like Kurt 
I want to be your man
I want to hold your hand
I want you to be my girlfriend

We could be a team, oh baby, we could be OK 
We don't have to hear what they think
So why should we care what they say? 
It wouldn't make a difference anyway

Hey, hey, maybe I could call you on the phone 
Nobody has to know. 
Maybe I could walk you home from school
That would be my dream, baby, please

That would be so cool
You don't have to tell anybody
You could still treat me like a fool",September,1996
Digger,"I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me baby
This I know 'cause it's

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh so many times
Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love was all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear
I said

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove

And I'm gonna be true blue

Digger,"Up all night, maybe I'm crazy. 
I leave myself open. Naked but not naked. 
Everything's related. I'm wondering just
What I have to do to get it through your head 
That I don't want to go to sleep now. 
I just want to go to bed. (So what if I'm serious but fun. 
It's a place to rest my head. I'm confused. I'm not drunk) 

Break me down into pieces. 
Back together, what do you have? 
A mess in my head, get it to come out. 
One of many, one in a million. 
Sometimes it really sucks. 
I know what I want but can't have it. 
In a letter it leaves me stuck.

Your head that I just don't want to go to bed.

It's a place to rest my head. I'm confused. I'm not drunk.) 

No rest, no time. I wish I had more time to get you off my mind.

No rest, no time. 
I wish I had more time to get you off my mind.",Pieces,1998
Digger,"I used to think that I would always sor of have it good, 
And never need to try too hard to waste as much time as I could.
I'd never need to get a job, or have to earn a buch. 
Now I wish I could just quit it all. 
I guess I'm shit out of luck. 

You could call me a loser 'cause I guess I never win, 
But who ever's got my voodoo doll must be running out of pins. 
I'll keep walking down the road, holding up my chin. 
I'm here for the duration because quitters never win. 
Back when I first met you I was hopeless and confused. 
I never cared too much about my knack for self-abuse. 
Sometimes I feel like climbing in to a hole that's six-foot deep. 
But why should I quit on myself? 

You never quit on me. 
You could call me a loser 
'cause I guess I never win, 
But who ever's got my voodoo doll must be running out of pins. 
I'll keep walking down the road, holding up my chin. 
I'm here for the duration because quitters never win. 
Quitters never win.",Quitters Never Win,1998
Digger,"I didn't want to want you. 
I didn't need to need you. 
I didn't memorize your number, 
So I wouldn't be calling all the time. 

Now we get in a fight, 
And I can hardly sleep at night. 
My head is tired but my fingers dial your number one more time. 
Isn't it ironic that you and me are both moronic? 

I'll stick with you no matter what you do. 
And isn't it a gas when you and me are low on cash? 
Stick to me and you will see, 
I'll never peel you off of me. 

If you leave please don't forget the time the only hear that was stuck on you was mine. 
(I'm stuck with you)
(You're stuck with me) 
(Can't you see it was meant to be?) 

I'm not saying that you changed me, 
But I know that you rearranged me. 
You kicked me in the right direction when you kicked me out of bed. 
I know I'm far from perfection. 
At least I still have your affection.

I can turn off the radio but you'll never get out of my head. 
Isn't it a shame that you and me are both so lame? 
I'll stick with you no matter what you do. 
We have such awful luck. 
I guess we're lucky to be stuck. 
Stick to me and you will see. 
I'll never peel you off of me. 

If you leave please don't forget the time the only heart that was stuck on you was mine.

How much more of this can you take?",Stuck,1998
Digger,"It seems like you want me to be someone. 
I think I'm just another nobody. 
You can dress me up and send me on my way, but you'll never get the kid out of me. 
I know that I'm not half the man that you thought 
I should be, but one day I hope you'll see. 
There's no way that one hundred of your books could be equal to one hundred things 
I've seen. 
A new stage in a new world every night, and one thousand midnight highway dreams. 
I know I'm not half the man that you thought I should be, 
But I've traveled even further than their narrowed minds can see.. 
I know I'm not half the man 
That you thought I should be |*first time*|

Can't you realize that I'm just me, the real me? 
That's all I want to be.",Living It Up,2000
Digger,"When I saw you standing there, 
It was crystal clear to me that it just wouldn't be fair for you to be stuck with a guy like me. 
When I saw you yesterday, in my shirt that doesn't fit, 
It was crystal clear to me that you were meant to wear it. 

Every time I think of all the things we did (hanging out all day, trying to get drunk). 
I just want to know how I became the lucky one. 
When I was just growing up, luck would never cross my path. 
I'd break a mirror under a ladder in the path of a black cat. 

I never learned how to be smooth. The only ""F"" I got in school. 
I can't believe you talked to me after you watched me play the fool. 
When will it be forever? What was I really thinking? 
I wasted time wondering why when we could've wasted that time drinking. 

It will take more than a letter to patch things up this time. 
I only hope I'm lucky enough to win you back as mine.",Lucky,2000
Digger,"The last five years seem like they lasted so, so long. 
Is this hopeless, just fate, I guess, now you're gone. 
Is there a better way, to say goodbye, than in a song? 

If you would ask me just on question,
Would I do it all again? In a heartbeat. 
In a perfect world time heals woulds,
Cut down to the tissue. Is this fortune, or fortuitous? 

I am without you. 
And time goes by so slowly,
I feel like I'm stuck here and I'm all by myself, I'm so lonely, 
I want to be somewhere else. 
Not here, not where my heart beats.",In a Heartbeat,2001
Digger,"I can feel it getting closer, 
And the timing isn't right. 
It's time to go our own ways. 
Time to say goodbye. 
Scared when we are lonely, and alone when we grow. 
I can't justify these actions, so I'll let you go. 

Out of step, out of line. 
Who cares who was right? 
Push it to the limit. 
When the goal is out of sight. 
This scar's a reminder. 
A wrong chord, a wrong note. 
There's ways I can fix it, 
But not this time so
I'll see you later. 

Now's not the right time. 
(The right time at all) 
We've run out of time, 
This scar's a reminder. 
We've run out of time,

Out of sight.

Nostalgic moments feels like magic don’t it
Girl you killin' ‘em, my condolence
That’s how you on it? Yea that’s how you on it
And I’m gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic, tryna cut straight to the chase
Wanna be there when you wake
With no make up on your face
Not even gloss, before you brush
Love your dimples when you blush
It’s the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine
What’s yo sign? I’m an Aries, I’m a 90's baby clearly
I’ll make sure to make some time for you though my schedule may vary

We should get together soon so we can do some business
I got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya
Is you ready, what’s the hold up?
You ain’t ’bout no drama, you remind me of my mama
Smelling like flower balm and Escada
Shut it down and you don’t even try ta
You such a boss but carry yourself like a lady
The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating

Wait, hold up, hold up, hold up I know what they say
Every rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye
Don’t believe it girl, I promise I’ma treat you like my treasure
I’m a movement by myself but I know you’ll make me better

I just knew that they had it
And if I asked then I got it
It all started from trees
Then it turned to narcotics
All the whips was exotic
All the chicks was erotic

All you needed was product
And somebody to test it
Find a good place to try it
Never keep nothin' on you
Find a good place to hide it
If I'm in it I own it
Cause if I like it I buy it

Keep the loud in the air

Would you go?

At the rate I'm going I might end up being single

Got my head all knotted like that comic on the view

Would you go your separate ways?

Are you with me for the perks, using me as a provider?

Boy you preaching to the choir.
You don't have to answer I can hear you speaking through your silence,
Taking my love for granted like my weakness is my kindness.

Sometimes I feel all alone in a crowded room,
Gathering thoughts as I watch how everybody moves,
Shaking my hand, taking photos, Twitpic-ing
To an opportunist, opportunities are Slim Pickens.

Your mouth says, ""What's Up"" when all I hear is meal ticket.
It's hard to say who's real, even harder to say who isn't
Since I don't know the difference, I come off as distant
Without a warm reception, people taking it as ya dissing
Are you kidding, where's the hidden cam?

Girls say they love you all along, it just a scam.
And they got it all planned out,
Friends got they hands out
Tell 'em no, They say ""how you turn your fam down?""
Oh, we fam now?
I ain't get the memo, funny that I didn't know you before I put out my demo.
Now everybody want a slice, Kimbo,

We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no, no, no

Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I kicked the attitude and how you actin' like you own the bar
You got me flashin' keys and I don't even own a car
It's not like you ain't feelin' my charm, cause I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
I'm sorry, my name's Travy, and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you never heard of me? 
That sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What you say we exit stage left so me and you
Could possibly reconvene and play some naked
After all the blouse you wearing is kinda see through
And its obvious I'm heading' wherever you're leading me to
Such an angel with a devilish angle
And quite the certified sweet talker
And you buyin' every line of it girl
And now I'm really playing you
If I was in your shoes, I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus]

Here's another bar going for the slow
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop right around the corner from your mom and them
No turnin' back so you better buckle up
Shit don't be concerned with my
I got you on speaker spell, I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull that string, reply that shit
I changed my name to diddy, did he really say that shit?
Yep, I take a ride if you let me
Six-five, twenty plus is so sexy
My legs going numb from keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide that fact that your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I been trying to never mind it, man
But every time I get a new number she finds it, damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around the clock when I showed up

Thin chics, brown chics, black white yellow and brown chics

Good grief girl, you givin' me goose bumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste the less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl, that's how I am girl
Peter pan I'm a sucker for smuckers jam girl
Its clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like

Matter of fact, you're more than just slippin
You're way beyond control, you're on a mission (on a mission)
You walk right through a wall
To get a twenty, a forty or an Eight Ball

There ain't nothin scarier, all I want to say to ya

[OK, I want these two boxes of three
And give my blondy here, and that one that says orgy
And, by the way, I need something for my woman]
Sure, I got guy packets [Cool, give me some of em]

Now let me tell you how to take it:
Either sit of lie down, and you really should be naked
Otherwise you're gonna mess up your clothes, know what I mean?
This is more then just a dream

It's very realistic and it's gonna blow your mind
So be careful: only take one at a time
And never take one behind the wheel
You'll black out and hit a pole [Cool, let's make the deal]

These are 40, these are 80, and this one here is 10
Just give me a hundred dollars, I'll call it even
But don't pull your money out yet, see
There's one or two narcs in this area that sweat me

Over here, [Yeah, this looks kinda cool
20, 40, 60, 80 a hundred, shmoove]
Here's my number, in case you need to reach me again
And remember, you need to be as safe as you can

There's only one thing safer then using your hand
Dial that beeper number, and call the packet man

Yeah he's the packet man
Yeah he's the packet man
Yeah he's the packet man
Yeah he's the packet man",Packet Man,1990
Digital Underground,"[Chorus]
S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

[Shock G]
Now we would like to ask you
Have you ever heard this style befo'
You gotta say no
Cause there ain't no denying
And if you say yes you're lying
People are always wondering
What's up with the Underground
Are they down?
Or is just another new sound
We're saying things
And when we use a beat we use it right
Cause we're not just playing things
Spitting rhymes
Like a Tommy gun spraying things
So when you see us onstage
Don't just stare us down
Or compare our sound
To any other crew ya like
Yo, judge how ya like

[Chorus]

[Money-B]
Riding this like a roller coaster
Hugging the curves and dipping
Like I'm supposed to do
For the Underground troupe
Cause I know I'm the poop
Steaming hot
Stinking up the dance floor
Gonna do it freelance
For the funk, my friends
And all the others in the industry
They want to get with me
(Shock: Why is that, Mon?)
Maybe it's my smooth flow
They know this guy is dope
So they get hip to the style I'm using
It's called Raw Fusion
Ain't no time for ego-tripping
Let it be known
There'll be no slipping on mine
Cause all I want
Is a chunk of this Underground funk

[Chorus]

[Shock G]
Yo, Money-be	

[Money-B]
What's up cold Shock G?

[Shock G]
Check it out, would you tell the people what we mean

[Money-B]
What do you mean what we mean?

[Shock G]
You know what I mean
Tell 'em what we mean
When we're are-H-why-M-I-N on the funk
Let 'em know that we got spunk

[Money-B]
We got it

[Shock G]
And when I count to three
Go on and hit some of that humpty-hump
One, two, three

[Money-B]
Well, I'm humpty-humping
You know that I'm saying something
The funk's in your face
Gonna keep the place jumping
As the beat keeps pumping
I'm tick-tocking 'em
Dope rhymes, I'm dropping 'em
On the twenty-four track
And there ain't no stopping 'em
It's too late to put the tape on pause
Because we're

[funk sample interlude]

[Money-B]
Tell me if you think the beat is nasty
Well get ready, we're going to get sweaty
Just in case I hope you brought a towel in
I'm on the prowl when I hear the bass growling

[Shock G]
Growling like a big bass monster
On a rampage, it's like we were onstage
Shock G speaking from the Underground

[Money-B]
Do they understand?

I really don't give a damn
Cause we're

It's so real				It is real",Sex Packets,1990
Digital Underground,"We'd like to ask now that all passengers please hold 
Their breath, as we take you through an underwater hip hop extravaganza.
Now last night, underwater, I saw a French mermaid,
Treated her to caviar and wine over shrimp brain,
In the raw, on the ocean floor, need I say more?
You never heard nobody kick it like this before,
Pink champagne, octopus brains, 
Saw your DJ underwater through the window pane.
That sucker tried to hit a mix, but the mix didn't happen,
Records kept floatin' all the fish kept laughin'
A blowfish blew my mind and started to rhyme,
As the octopus cut nine records at a time.
Your boy said, ""Show me how to keep my records down,""
But the shark ate his amp, your boy got clowned.
The rhymes he say have no particular order
Un-derwater, Un-der-derwater,
Go 'head bite his rhymes if you think that you oughtta
Hold your breath, MC's, my rhyme's underwater.
I tried to mix a cut from a TV blooper,
Got pulled by a deep sea state trooper,
Told me that I didn't have the right to bite,
I said, ""Your wife looks just like a fat blue grouper.""
Sittin' in my aqua-blue jail cell, didn't have my bail,
I had to break out with the rhyme,
Shrimp scatter on a platter, I rock like a mobster,
Told an MC, ""Yo, you look like a lobster""
Qualified to wreck your mind, I get busy one time,
Like fish on a dish, you get served with the rhyme.
...if you need a fo' instance,
Watch the people stop, they don't want to miss this.
I'm tweakin' your speakers, and I'm makin' no sense,
'Cause on your turns, this record burns like incense.
The rhymes he say have no particular order
Un-derwater, Un-der-derwater
Go 'head bite his rhymes if you think that you oughtta
Hold your breath, MC's, my rhyme's underwater.
Uh, 1, 2, 1, 2, Yo, this is MC Blowfish,
And we're gonna do a little something like this:
Well I'm a deep sea gangster, underwater prankster,
Kissin' all the girl fish, dissin' all the ...
Because I blew your mind and started to rhyme,
Doesn't mean that I'm cool, 'cause you'll be back next time,
With a hook and a line, so you can hear that fryin' sound,
I'm tellin' you I'm down,
I'll spin your boat around, leave suckers lost in the bay.
You want to play? I'll hook your line to a stingray.
Get out of here with that boat and a stick,
Get out of line, I'll call my homey Moby Dick.
I'm not thinkin' 'bout dyin', fool, stop tryin' to test me,
People fishin' don't catch me.
And when you get home, sad 'cause you missed,
Just remember MC Blowfish 
Keep on, you don't stop.

Digital Underground,"[Shock G]
Now this trip's to let you know the Underground can flow
We'll go toe-to-toe with any bro that wants to go
But those who go need to know that we're an elite fleet
of very unique MC's and as a treat Jeremy programmed a beat
that I could flow on. I'ma go on; the D-Train's about to roll on
The day I pulled out my fat marker and I wrote on
The windows of the train, wrote my name, bout to do the walls
Had to pause, cause, two police
officers get on, they barely fit on - the train was packed
We're standing back-to-back cause there was nothing left to sit on
I'm looking around to see who's down - realize I'm all alone
Mostly people coming home from work, a couple of sisters and a fag
Yes, this would have been a drag
but I'm chilling with my tall can in my brown bag
And I'm sipping, your boy Shock was cold dipping
Sipping real slow and dipping real low so 5-O don't be tripping
Check it though, a minute or two later
I finished my brew with nothing to do, broke out cold made a
Pimp move to the next car looking for trouble
Rub the stubble under my chin and squeezed in between
A pair of big, bubble butt freaks:
Two Russet potato and bacon eating sisters
One had too much make-up on but yo, I didn't diss her
Cause she was kind of cool though
Both of them was cool enough to do you know
We picked more people up at Broadway Station
Being down I had to clown and make use of a situation
So I'm rubbin the girls booty behind me
Right near the bottom where the booty and thigh meet
My middle finger's riding down the line of the seam of her jeans
But she don't seem to mind me
But then she shocked me, almost clocked me
Tried to slap me, caught her hand and said
""You better be glad my name is Shock G,
 Cause if my name was Dre, from N.W.A.
 I'd cold slap your ass and tell you have a nice day.""
She said, ""Wait a minute, Shock G! I know that name
I seen you on Arsenio, what you doing on the train?""
I said ""I'm trying to stay normal."" She said ""Really? That's a winner,
I'm studying law, don't live too far, would love to cook you dinner.""
I said ""Cool. Bring your friend, I like the both of youse two.""
I knocked the boots, the sneakers and the house-shoes

It's like that baby, ya don't stop
Cause my name is Shock you know that I like to rock
One time
Yeah, you got the sound of the Underground
doing it to you in your ear orifice
(Yeah, don't you know 
the Underground's doin it to ya flowin on the D-Line)
Yo, 2Pac is in the house. Got a big grin on his face
Jay-Z, cut that shit up stupid",Flowin' on the D-Line,1991
Digital Underground,"Alright parents go head tuck the kids in, PG time is over
This goes out to all the macks in the industry
Huh, alright roll the tape
(Yo, rest day ain't for hoes)

It's a good thing that we're rappin'
If it wasn't for the rappin', we'd be mackin'
It's a good thing that we're rappin'
If it wasn't for the rappin, we'd be mackin'
It's a good thing that we're rappin'

There was a time when they called me Smooth Eddie
Playing the hoes and shook the red card steady
It was Mike to those that knows
Matter of fact, Icy Mike 'cause he was cold on them hoes

We was east coast niggas headin' west
I was rollin' shotgun, coolin' with my man fresh Wes
The royal blue Brougham was a drop top rag
You could tell we was pimps from the Las Vegas tags

'Cause that's how we flipped it
Hit a lick, paid cash, said nothin', pimp shit
All of this was around spring eighty one
I was in the life and had a good three year run

Anyway, one Friday on the side of the road in L.A.
My man Wes says hey, ""I got a bitch in San Diego""
""Cool"", I said, ""I'll see ya in a couple days
I'm gonna stay and play some L.A. hoes""

He said, ""Alright player yo, I'll see you soon""
Yeah, that's how real players kick it see there ain't no rules
We roll from city to city, like kids playing hookie
Later that night I knock a bitch named Cookie

She says, ""I love you and I want to make you rich""
I says, ""Oh yeah"", I swear I worked the shit out this bitch
She was fine too, niggas couldn't tell me nothin'
Had brains too, did more stealin' than fucking

A real thoroughbred, played con like a pro
Man I'm tryin' to tell you, I had a money makin' ho
But the Sunset track got stale, Cookie went to jail
Had to sling a little yale to make bail

She said, ""I'm hot baby, I can't work in this town
The vice pick me up just as soon as you put me down""
I said, ""Shut the hell up ho
Who asked you to run your mouth?""

She was right though
It was time to take a trip down south
And to this very day, when I think of how
I was livin' back then I got to say that

It's a good thing that I'm rappin'
If it wasn't for the rappin', I'd be mackin'
Good thing we got music
If not I'd be stuck with findin' a way to get ahead
And then we got to use it

It's a good thing that I'm rappin'
If it wasn't for the rappin', I'd be mackin'
Good thing we got music
If not I'd be stuck with findin' a way to get ahead
And then we got to use it

They call it ho po when your leakin'
So you know ho po is when yo po, 'cause you ain't got no ho
I was po but I wasn't po ho, 'cause I had one ho
But we was leakin' 'cause the money was slow

Coppin' blow means your goin' up and down
I went from Cadillacs in Vegas to the back of GreyHound
San Diego off Broadway, there used to be a spot
I think E Street and 5th where all the players flocked

One night I was cooling outside
Saw my man Wes said, ""Ah shit yeah, it's gonna be live""
I was working a double breast silk leaf suit
With my five hundred dollar brown knee-high Ballsy

Wes said, ""It's pimpin' how you wear 'em outside ya pants
And by the way my ham sandwichs in the alley""
Ham sandwich meant Brougham Cadillac
Quarter inch stripes, wheel kit on the back

It was snotty nose, that means the extra chrome
Plate on the grill, for sunroof we say it had the brains blown
I said, ""This bitch is inside, you ready to attack?""
Wes looked at me said, ""Mack mack mack mack mack""

My mans pimp stroll was cold gansta limpin'
We stepped inside, both of us screamed, ""It's pimpin'""
I was drinking cognac, Wes was drinkin' gin
Wasn't there twenty minutes fore my people walked in

I said, ""What's up Cookie? How'd you do?""
She said, ""Cool, reach under the bar, so I can give you these feelings""
We always did it like that, case the vice squad was peepin'
This time they wasn't, but this nigga who was leakin'

Walked up and said, ""y'all gonna sell?""
Wes said, ""Nigga don't ya recognize the P when you see it?""
He said, ""Oh, yo I didn't know, I thought she's doin' business""
I said, ""Yeah, well it's true that she's a ho""

He said, ""She with you, playa? 'Cause I'd really like to buck her""
Looked at her, said, ""Baby, I'm a raw mother fucker""
I said, ""Yeah, that might be true, but she don't need another nucka""
Ain't no choosin', jump off slick, this one here's my snucka""

He said, ""Whatchu mean by snucka?""
""It ain't too hard to figga
You call your nigga nucka, snucka means she-nigga
And figure this too, the bitch is down for my dirty drawers
Find another ho to go for yours""

He said, ""But, I like her""
I said, ""You must be a rookie""
Now figure this three, he cut me off and stepped to Cookie
He said, ""How do you feel about this, my dear?""

I said, ""Nigga you don't check my bitch like I ain't standin' here
Now I told you that this woman sells pussy for me
You and her ain't the two, and we ain't the three
But most of all nigga, I ain't the one
Now back the fuck up off me son""

He said, ""To buck another man's game is a shame""
I said, ""Leakin' ass nigga, game recognize game
Now I told you that's my people and I gave you a chance""
Reached down and started pullin' up the two from my pants

Shoulda capped his ass, instead
I look up and Wes done wrapped a pool stick round this nigga's head
So I put my shit away, we beat him down cowboy style
Cookie runs up and says, ""Baby you okay?""

I says, ""Yo, all this excitements got you dizzy
What cha watchin'? Bitch get busy
Go back outside and finish gettin' my money""
The bartender laughed, said, ""You pimp niggas is funny""

And I'll tell you once again
It blows my mind, when I think
How I was living back then
'Cause yo

It's a good thing that I'm rappin'
If it wasn't for the rappin', I'd be mackin'
Good thing we got music
If not I'd be stuck with findin' a way to get ahead
And then we got to use it

It's a good thing that I'm rappin'
If it wasn't for the rappin, I'd be mackin'

Uh, I give my man props 'cause he's living
(Why wait until the heartbeat stops)
Don't you know that proper respect is what we're giving
(We're giving heartbeats props)

Seems like you wondered each day if the Underground
Is going to stay down with the funky beats
Even if you know that I'm a junkie for a bump that's funky
And a fool for the loop, see, a groupie for the old one-twoiee
A bass freak would say ?Oohwee,
Peace to do 'cause I like the way you do me?
I love to go on about the funk, matter of fact
I'd love to be another funk front runner
But first we gotta deal with the fronters
So I can't go on, it's time to drop a few bombs
(Get busy, G, go on and take ?em to school)
Yeah, it's time spread the jewels
I ask you about Malcolm and you tell me that he's wicked
Farrakhan comes you can't seem to buy a ticket
And check what my man has to say
Right or wrong, don't you think that he deserves a play?
'cause he's living for you and you and you and you
The brother X tried but he died trying to get through
So why wait until the heartbeat stops
Yo, go on and give my man his props
If you're really that down then act what you say
KRS and Chuck need support today
I see you posing with the Dr King hanging on your wall
Only difference is Chuck might give you that call
To march on Friday, yeah, it's kind of frightening
Let me move so I don't get hit by the bolt of lightning
Striking you down 'cause you're fronting
A dead leader can't tax your mind
Therefore he's not a threat to your personal time
All the lagging and the dragging
(Yo, I got something to do that day)
Yeah, you sound like an old bitch nagging
Fuck that fronting! We're pumping up the brothers
'cause the brothers keep it pumping
You got it all wrong
When you wait for the TV to tell you what's going on
I thought you're hype on the mic
Yeah, they never get it right
That's why you see we gotta thank God, y'all
For niggas like Ice Cube
'cause they'll tell the record straight
(Yo, my man's a prophet too)
Yo, god, you think he ain't?
So do the right thing, it's not a black or a white thing

I'm the type of guy that's sly like a fox
An honor roll student in the school of hard knocks
There was different type of brother that I used to look up to
But I'm still giving props where the props are due
But let me start with a fool I don't give a fuck about
I wanted to give a Fuck You out
To the nigga who went out on a whim
He was a roody-poo for shooting Huey Newton
But I'm thanking God for niggas like Iceberg Slim
And the chick the honky's ran to see
She was the honky-tonk's fantasy
Tina Turner, the living legacy
And she's still got you tripping off the legs you see
Another chick they used to beg to see
Was Josephine Baker, she had them hooked
They loved the way she shook her money-maker
But why did it take them so many decades
To give a little praise to who they ran rave to see

With a dark complexion she was sex symbol befo' Marilyn Monroe
But her heart stopped before they gave props to the old pro

It took a great man to mould those
So I want to give props to my pops because he told those
But there's a time to break necks and throw bolos
Be a cold bro and throw low blows
When you want to close the shows of your foes
'cause foes are those that you got to break like windows
Check it, when respect goes it's time to break a nose
But give respect before the soul goes

Well, I suppose respect is what respect'll get ya
So I'm giving them gifts before they're stiff like the pose
In the pictures of Vogue and flashy fashion magazines
You be thumbing in ?em, props to Beverly Johnson
She was the first black woman in ?em

Pee, drop the bomb and end the pressure with the menace
Smith & Wesson clear the lesson that your mama gave

Mama gave PeeWee the same threats, she used drastic measures
Told me to give her the full respect or get my ass kicked
It was my intention to relent just till the last kick
When she goes she'll roll over in a solid gold casket
When I was young Muhammad Ali had me sprung
'cause he was the champion, as the champion he was my idol
Yo, they took his title when he wouldn't take the gun
And fight in Vietnam the only way he felt, then he won the bet again
Now they want me in the army but they can't harm me
'cause I ain't no punk, I ain't [??????] man to Uncle Tommy

Blast out, before we're all assed-out

Obsessed with creating another author
Now I remember back when everything was On the One
(Nah, they couldn't get none)
Let me take you back a little further than that
The Mothership Connection and the rest of the pack
But think back, when Bootsy's Rubber Band hit the stage
With the star-shaped bass, he'd send the crowd into a rage
Stop, look up, and what do you see?
The Mothership landing in DC
So, yo, thank God for Parliament
Everybody funky knows that they was heaven sent
There's Michael Hampton at one end of the stage
Banging out Maggot Brain with Eddie Hazel
Yo, I remember that and you do too
He would always call the Mothership down for you
Ga-ga goo-ga, ga-ga goo-ga, ga-ga goo-ga
Yeah, you can do it, Humpty, don't be shy

Tell the guitar player that I brought my friends
She was fine, sweet with a touch of class
No Head, No Backstage Pass
Funk used to be a bad word to you
I couldn't stop myself writing a funky rap or two
So Free Your dull-ass Mind your funky Ass Will Follow
Your funk is watered down, in other words it's kinda shallow
Get Up to Get Down, I said I'd Rather Be With You
George and Bootsy, what a hell of a crew
But since you've been lost, yo, I've been so lost too
So Flash your Lights in the air
And don't forget that the funk Mob is everywhere
Don't be Standing On the Verge of Gettin It On
And George'll be the first to tell you when the funk's gone
There's funk in everything you do so don't be stupid
You might imagine me funky though like Cupid
What is this? This is a tribute to the Mob
D'void of funk so my set don't Slop
I'm kind of Cosmic like Vernon
I rap around the mic like Fuzzy
And like Starchild and Grady
I grab the funk by the neck and let it take me
To the Aquaboogie, with a giggle and squirm
And if you ain't funky you will learn
I confess you've got to clean your chest
And don't forget that Everything is On the One

[Chorus]

So would you, could you funk, do you want to
And if I ask to funk are you gonna
Get stopped, cream always rises to the top
See pop ain't where I'm coming from
So haul to the left and don't forget to bring your Bop Gun
Do that stuff like you knew (Shorty B)
And if you're down with the funk, that's me and you
And now that I just took you back to the future
It's time to wake you up so I begin to suture
Stitch you up, and then I mend your wounds
But Red Hot Lover's got the Loose Booty
My lyrics amaze the vital juices, want to do me
Like Too Short, too many funky words sooth me
(Yo, I'm tripping) Trojan on my tip and won't trip
About the articulation from my lips
So here we go, I'm about to show
All the homies in the hood that I can flow
With the Underground, with the P-funk in the sound
And if it ain't gots the P it ain't down
I'm like Al Capone on the microphone
I'm blasting lyrics through your dome, all through your home
But like Ice Cube said, once again it's on
I won't bite though just to write a funky rhyme
I go platinum, for the very first time I wrote my rhyme
With the Parker, not Paisley
And if Prince is on my tip it don't phase me
I'm from the old school of funk
Yo, I got Knee-Deep bumping in my trunk
This is not a trivia or a quiz
I just put the funk back in showbiz, y'all

[Chorus]

Ain't nothing but a party, y'all, haha

Haha, once again, 1991, Shorty be	
Hitting you off with mfstbc (??)
Still kicking it for the Acorn posse
Yeah, Jerry Hodge is in the booth kicking it
Yeah, want to send a shout out to Shock G
Cause without him there would be no me

Digital Underground,"Yeah, well we're back with another one
Comin' hard and got suckers on the run
You say, ""You guys are known for havin' fun""
Yeah well we'll do what has to be done for us to be number one
And you ain't never heard nuthin' this funky son
You ain't never heard nuthin' this funky ever, it's too clever
Rhyme goes through your mind like a guillotine severs the head, my friend
And you will never hear nobody rap like this again

You ain't heard nuttin' this funky brother, it's like no other
You feel the bass bouncin' off the walls like rub-bah
The real McCoy this ain't no toy or another
How do we do it?  (Shock G: Yo go ask your mother)
The freak needers, the beat leaders
Let me tell you somethin', you ain't heard nuttin' this funky Peter
So listen up as we begin
Aiyyo Fuze rub the record in

[Repeat x4]
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin this funky 

The definition of a rhyme breeder, beat needer
We're the cold party heaters, comin' through the woofers and the tweeters
Funky dope MC leaders
Rhyme hungry hip-hop listener feeders

The definition of a rhyme sayer, beat layer
Mothersucker perpetrator slayer
Layin' down the law like the Mayor
You're out of luck, Hucklebuck, I'll suck you up like a Now or Later
You say that you're a trooper, then I'm Darth Vader
You're a Cowboy, then I'm a Raider

You can't compete cause you're incomplete and need to be completed
You're style is weak you're obsolete and need to be deleted
Short on the things that you needed
So what you got a top ten song, cause you cheated

If you worked in a kitched, it'd be sweeter
From the rappin' that I hear, you'd make a better egg beater
A teeter totter, or should I say, totter teeter
You're through, you're a court and we're leaders
We got the style you admire, the rhymes you desire
Well you ain't heard nuttin this slick you trick
'Cause you're a flick from a Bic and we're a bonfire

'Cause you ain't heard nuttin this funky (4X)

'Cause I roll up fast, like a cheetah, get out the two-seater
Walk up on a girl named Anita, or Rita
Ask her for change to put money in the meter
Didn't really need it just a smooth way to meet her
Or a fly way to treat her
She said, ""I'm hungry"" so I took her out to feed her
She was a pocket feeder chicken, fajita pita eater
I said, ""Yo, eat how ya like"" then took her home and G'd her

The definition of a funky rhyme master
Clevely put together but not necessarily sayin' it faster
Ya see, that style isn't hard at all
The object of the game is to have a ball y'all
And to see who can come the funkiest
Lot of MC's think it's just a speed contest
They want to brag about the neighborhood, oh you want to boast?
We come from different cities and we're coast to coast ya see
but right now we're based in Oakland (Odis: Oakland)
Everywhere we go we leave the microphone smokin'
Yo bro I'm not jokin'
Leave MC's standin still with their mouths hangin' open
Walk offstage and leave the next act scratchin' his head like a monkey
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky

'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky (Repeat x2)
Leave a sucker standin' still confused
'Cause he never heard nuttin' this funky
You ain't heard nuttin' this funky
Ahh yeah
Why don't you tell em Hump
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky

 These guys came on by in this, tch, car man playin some beat)
You ain't heard nuttin' this funky nigga, how ya figure?

""Yo man, what's up with the Underground, man?
 You guys old school, new school, R&B or hip-hop?""
What should I tell em?

Now this is not your average everyday rap song
We won't be rockin bells that go a ding and a dong
The bass drummer hipper won't be lingering on
Check out the way we kick it on the microphone
The funky beat is playin and we're swingin along
The Underground is rockin with the hip-hop song
The drums are ringin with the serious tone
Ah clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah MC's, you like the way we swing
Well listen close and make sure you don't miss a thing
Don't you know that we're the microphone masters
Known to MC's as the raw dog bastards
We bust rhymes, and write everyday
So listen close, to the things that we say
Triple-slippin MC's will get verbally raped
We'll send you home with that look on your face
And just rock this, you can't stop this
Ah just rock this, try and clock this (try and clock this)

I hope you do, cause if you don't it don't mean a thing
See we don't play for other hip-hop crews, it's not about you
We do the things that we want to do
We're MC's to please the loyal followers
But you you're just a sucker hip-hop borrower
Your real name is probably Bradworth or Bennett
Your verbal baggage ain't got nuthin in it
You think that you're rockin but you're not hip-hoppin
So you best stop jockin at the masters

Yeah, cause America, likes the way we swing

About convincing as a preacher, who smokes reefer
Why don't you give it up just put the mic down
Get out of town with that noise, this is the underground

I bought her food and fed her
My brand new sweater

Baby said, ""Ooh baby shoo-be-dooh
Let's hook up again cause the loving is cool""
I said ""Yo, I gotta go, I got a show""
She said ""I know, after the show let me cook for you
If you're hungry, you never know
You might need help with your laundry
Don't hesitate to call upon me
Before you go, would you meet my mother
She lives right around the corner
It's not a bother, meet my mother!""

Hate, hate, hate the way I felt like I dissed her
""Wait, wait, wait"" cried the pretty, young sister
She said, ""Shock, while I got this chance
I've got let you know that if you rip your pants
I'll beee there, to sew the hole for your butt
Want a nut? Call me up, I'll pick you up in my jetta

While I was sleeping she was up
Creeping around writing letters to me
Man, I hate somebody all up in my face when I'm sleep
But I ain't sweating it
""Look, I'll hook-up with you next week""
She said ""Wait, let me walk you to the street, baby

I've been sporting sweaters ever since I was a child
But nowadays sweaters kind of cramp my style
Cause up around the collar they be getting me hot

The freak of my nature, my sweet, stick thing
But like George of the Jungle she had trouble with the swing
[Shock-G: Was she funking up the flow?]
Yeah, brah, she couldn't hack it
Started cock-blocking like a full metal jacket
Fingers did the walking, calling, tying up my phone
Boo had me under heavy surveillance at my home
Word to Mac Mone, suffocated my bone
Pulling on my hoodie in a nagging little tone
Where you going? Where you been? Who's Kim? Who's Felicia? 
But I don't see no ring, I never met the preacher
I got to play you out, I mean the loving was phat
But you're a sweater, riding so heavy on my back

I got a brand new sweater
But I didn't get it from Mervyn's
Her friends be pulling wool but
My syringe pulls bull from the lens
Even then, I'll send you back for a refund
Plus she sport a good hat-terin (?)
That'd have been the end
If I let the sweater lay upon my skin
Great Scott, time for a rebate sale
We make mail, more than you think
As long as they're strong
And the cotton don't shrink
We can spend doe on a jane doe
Cause hoe got to have clothes, so
I buy the thread and let them weave
Leave it alone if you don't want to get worn out
I've got legions of sweaters for the seasons
I got blue when I'm sad, red when I'm mad
Pink cause I'm ticklish
When I'm being laid in green
When I'm getting paid
I don't have a problem if you want to jock me
See cause, gs is what you're gonna clock me
Go ahead, knock me if you think I'm not shit
But when it comes to sweaters?
Saafir's a perfect fit

[Chorus]
She was real go-getter
Her cheese smelt like cheddar
She let me use the credit
Yeah, but just forget it

When father hits the forty

When the collard green juice gets the bread wet
When you're up so close that you can smell the sweat
Off a black, funky Tennessee butt
Like a bite into a salty Tampa Bay boiled peanut
(I hit a jet black ass in the back seat of a Nova)
Oh yeah? Well a hoe five-oh pulled me over
I swear, doing about a buck thirty
Instead of jail she took home and got flirty
The deal was a $1000 fine and a ticket:
""Or you can stick it.""
""You're pretty but I haven't had a shower today""

Tie me up and do anything you want

A lot of people like rice better when it's brown
Like having sex on the ground
Instead of in a bed, instead of receiving head
A lot of people like going down
I side-stepped the line for a fresh cut
And instead, I keep my nappy curls in my head
I like to hear brothers spit game using dirty words
I like things colourfully stated
Everyday speech sounds dated
I like the freaks in the jeans
When the booty part's faded
Like my homegirl Rita
I used to chill on her sofa with my feet up
By the heater with my toes getting toasted
One day she came naked out the kitchen
With a bag full of groceries
She said ""Like a blunt I want to toake you
And with this bottle of wine I'm going to soak you
May I Cherry-Banana Float you?""
I said ""Is this a joke, boo?""
She said ""I love you, my baby
And I wouldn't do nothing that would hurt you""
She took my clothes off
Started pulling food out the bag
And said ""Yo, I'm 'bout to work you""
Yeah, I let her get the best of me
She was sitting next to me
Then baby started sexing me
Poked me with the peanut butter
Rubbed me with the jelly
She spread cottage cheese on my belly!
I said ""Woah, baby, what you got in mind?""
She said ""Relax""
Popped the top on a bottle of wine
Then she poured the wine down my back
It prickled and tickled when it reached my crack
I said ""Oooh, I feel real freaky, my butt's real squeaky!""
She said ""Cool"" and then proceeded to eat me
Ate me up till my body was squeaky clean
Must have been a sex fiend
Like the freaks in the magazines
Poked out her lips, made her mouth like a funnel
Spun a brother round, went down on the tunnel
I said ""Oh! There she goes""
She got live and let the tongue slide
On the black hole
And, yo, this was it
Baby was on some freshfruitfreakyfoodshit!
Honey on the side, jelly on the head
Peanut butter on the bedspread
Baby said ""Do you like it dirty?!""

Or better yet go put some rhythm in your hips
I'll flip, never will I slip
On a front took her bust up
So now what? I'll tell you what:
Why don't you get a clue from within, mark
Otherwise I'm gonna creep beneath your skin

[Chorus]

[Shock G]
A wing-ding ding-a-ling, listen to me sing
I like chicken wings
All living things get treated like a brother
Cause I'm a planet Earth lover
And I'm surviving, I keep striving 
Alive in my blood's the God from up above-uh
I gain strength from my mother
I'm potent cause soul is what I'm toting
Style runs deep in my family tree
Yeah, that's me
See, it's gonna feel good when I run right through you
So let me do you
Open up and take a bite of me, chew me up
Try to swallow my blackness. Go on, taste it
Face it, it's fact that you're attracted to my style
But still you lie to me
You see, being afraid is the same as being shallow
So why follow the masses?
We're in the Nineties
Try to release your mind and be deep
Peep/peace

I know a girl named Holly, I'm tellin she's sinkin
Thinkin about sellin that body
Contemplatin rollin up the stroll like a trolley
Wants fast money like Three-Card Molly
Oh look now, here comes Holly
Look at that smile, look at that body
Look at those eyes, Holly's real fly
Holly's real smart, Holly's real pretty
Holly got flavour but she's got no pride
Holly wants to hide in the corner of the city
Holly ain't sick, Holly ain't crazy
Ain't got it bad, the ho's just lazy
Now she's lookin into hookin
Quick money on her back so the ho can live fat

Born with a gift, think she'll ever use it?

Holly likes to ho and use dildoes as long as my bills grow
I'm not trippin, she be dippin in wallets, all it's
Gonna get is me rich, I tried to dis the bitch
But she slits her wrists every time, she said:
'I want to grind and make scratch with my snatch'
Cool, latch onto my belt buckle
One time she came short all she felt were the knuckles
Beating her down I saw her on Geraldo
After the show MAD calls for the ho
You can save all the chit-chatter and all the bitchin
By this time next year you'll be fuckin politicians
Every one in a while I catch her home she be callin
Bawlin, but I'm only sensitive when I bust a nut
After I bless you with the dick you've got to cut
And make my bucks, giddy-up giddy-up, giddy-up!
Oh, time to go, when it comes to male personnel

STOPPED and BLOCKED it

Don't have to waste a lot a time trying to get her in

Fishing and camping
Out renting boats in the Hamptons
Eating good, working out, and giving charity
Working on my vocal cord clarity
Hell, no, I can't front, I been at the crib G-ing
Slapping poontang trying to be the mack pappy
40-dog and pina colada peeing
Making my rounds to keep the Humpty girls happy
If you missed me I was laying in the cut
Wrecking big butts
And scratching my knees

Representing how we been living
That's how it is

It'd be a big fat gooey gold plated loogie
But I was born a yankee so I use my hanky
The way I wear my clothes freaks the hos 'cause I'm lanky
Speaking of hankies, I like hanky-panky
Especially when the hanky-panky's stanky
Of course ain't gonna be too much stanking

So fat that it makes me shout
Ah ha this beat's got gout
Not from the worms, from the pork
That you eat with a fork
But it weighs about a ton when it plays
Back to the honeys
The play-booty-bunnies
You know what's real funny to me
When they get up for the downstroke
The look on their face when they almost choke
On the lean butter bean brown hamhock

It's time to pull out my funny bone and get ready for the fun

But can you sling the food like this?!
You better bite this
If you want to make the people move like this

Flame broil base, my pickle make ya wiggle
You're busted, my mustard will wax your whole plate
By itself, not including all my funky condiments
Nod your head to this and DUCK DOWN
As I commence to lock and load a fresh cantaloupe
Yo, I'm illin! I'm slingin melons
Like the felons are slangin dope sacks
So max but I wouldn't stand so close up in the light
Either bring it or hide
Cause it's about to be a food fight!

I counteract it with the Shock with ham hocks
From brothers who might Tupac
Fifty-seven black [????] and lots of flows
Fat like hippopotamoes, still caught em though
In the face with excrements, peep my testaments
I bring the seasoning paprika
Eureka for the weaker, and smoke the reefer
Dribble up the funk in the beaker
And, yes, about to say ?speaker'
It leaks in your ears and years ahead
I went to Japan and they was throwing pork balls
But I'm calling protocol, stooop!

Get ready, we're coming fetti with the groceries
(Gotta bring food to the food fight!)

Now if I am what I eat I hope I ain't a big couchie
Gotta substitute the ?ouch' for the ?ooch'!
If so, I hate to see my man Donnie O, he'd be a butthell
Substitute the ?ell' for the ?ole'
Actually, factually hella fools I know would be toe up
If you was what you ate, no fakin
My man Nate would be a plate of bacon
My brother Shock popcorn, and my cat would be a rat
My girlfriend would be some super sperm and things
My rich nigga Pac would be a lobster with hot wings
It's quite simple, if true that my temple is wrecked
I'd be some mushrooms and cognac
I'd be a pinto bean gravy smothered neck bone

And there's way to muff without the fluids touchin 

Never hide the truth if my body and hair is sacred 

Then why we can't be naked in public 

It's totally natural like sex is but this is 

A law that had to be made by men with itty bitty penises 

The streets of this world they are my playground I explore them 

Meet somebody I don't like and I ignore them I don't destroy them

Cut with verbal scrapes and nicks 

I'm as ill as chicks with dicks 

Scuff my kicks I'm bustin licks 

Openin somebody up like Vicks

'Cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to.
I look funny,
But yo, I'm makin' money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me.
Now gather 'round
I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground.
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty.
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee.
And all the rappers in the top ten, please allow me to bump thee.
I'm steppin' tall, y'all,
And just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me.
I like to rhyme,I like my beats funky,
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy.
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, come here - are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat.
Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak
I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy.
Allow me to amaze thee.
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, be,
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,
Both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance.

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do, check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ""Ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty!""
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
Jig around, shakin' ya rump,
And when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
Tell him ""Step off, I'm doin' the Hump!""

[Chorus]

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

All all around the world same song

I came for the party to get naughty get my rocks on
Eat popcorn watch you move your body to the pop song
That I'm singing dinga linging funky beats ringing
Everybody's swinging in the place
As I kick the J A Z Z why is my style
R&b mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long till I'm gone
It's just the same old song

It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kickin
Sweat drippin, girlies in the limo eatin chicken
Oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezin, but still I'm pleasin to all the slimmies
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny
If it's good and plenty, don't you know
There I go, there I go, there I go
But I don't go nowhere without my jim hat
If I'm rappin, cause she's clappin
Then I'm strappin cause I'm smarter than that
Then girlie maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song

Money B, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky up and down
As a matter of fact ill be right back I gotta take a leak
So I'm drainin entertainin, but I got fame
And the bases I touch to much for me tryin to be namin
Aiyyo, you saw me on cable and gip
I busted in and I was goin legit
Clark Gable back in Pakland its the same old song
Sport these shorties, same freckles and hat
Drinkin the same 40's

Hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip
Just like butter, my ryhmes are legit
Cause I'm the humpty. Not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump
Here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump

Ah shut up and just listen
Not dissin don't get me wrong
But to me its just the same old song
So just watch, my name is shock, and I like to rock
And you can't stop this
2pac go ahead and rock this

Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls use to frown, say I'm down, when I come around
Gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me
Harrass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, want to live they life high
Same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
(Clamin that they must have changed,just because we came strong)
I remain, still the same (why Tu'?) cause it's the same song",Same Song,1998

Is it happiness and blissfulness? Well let's go down the list 

You got the ""Real Deal For Real Real"" smile

No grudge, til you turn your back and learn the facts 

It's called learn the truth 

The tree is only known by it's fruits

Sometimes they sexist, sometimes they want your Lexus 

Sometimes they be your family members remember,

If you can't take me home with you
Then a lap dance will have to do
If you can't take me home with you..

Anybody got change for twenty?
Mmm, shake it up, shake it up
Yeah, I know it's rough out here, love
But we got your back

[Chorus x2]
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world

[Shock G]
Now tell me, can you tell the difference
Between a fast-tracking, skank-gaming tramp
And a man's girl
Kind of seems the same with just one glance
See, both of them cause erections from afar
But upon closer inspection it becomes clear
Money be	 gonna get you in there

[Money B]
See, a clever girl knows
Not just hoes work them skirts that's mini
Prostitutes that dress this way
Try to imitate most of the uptown bitties
Now we don't really want to speak upon
Those girls who act real slutty
But we will talk about those man's girls
Those are the one we're studying

[Shock G]
She's real secure, pretty toes pedicured
Baby got her own money
She thinks brothers who floss are funny
Ain't afraid to lick that honey off my body
Feminist party issues she don't care about
Understands men well and knows the power of long hair

[Money B]
I doubt
If she'll fall for the type whose pants are tight on
His pookie
Likes her sex fresh and fruity with the light on
That booty

[Clee]
Oohwee, she popping! Gotta be, got me jocking
Even Nike and Reebok, the girl I'm talking about be rocking
Them pumps with the toes out
Super saucy when we go out
Or with her patnas, she can blow clout
Cause she's the shit, no doubt
She's so about her scrill, that gives it all the more thrill
Can't lie, a little high
Couldn't get a better ride out of an automobile 
Never make it hard to go chill
Let me do my thing, let a brother breathe
But she make it so convenient when she around
I don't ever want to leave

[Shock G]
She's never stressing who
What I'm gon' do, how I've been riding with my crew
She says play on, ain't nothing wrong
As long as eventually I come home
(Money B: Ooh, she cool) When a brother finally do
The joke's on me cause she's gone
Taking care of she instead of worrying about me
(Money B: For shee?) For sheezy, she pleases me
Knowing that I got her back with what's important
Knowing that I'm down and when I clown with my homies
It's a necessity Â­ she gets to me, yes, I confess it
Secure with her intellect
Never afraid of flexing them hoe-ish dresses

Look what the cat dragged in

The mack's back in, we snap-crack in

We got the jokes for you

Uh, look who the Hump bumped into

The old one-two, rhyme sayer, the paper maker

Biz lay the vapours



(Biz Markie)

I'm the vapour sprayer for the himilayas

The M-iza A-ya are-iza K-aya

I'm the mayor

Leavin' emcees in a ditch



(Humpty Hump)
So get ready, we 'bout to start a fight in this bitch




(Biz Markie)

Humpty dumpty had a fight with his moms

He broke both her legs and both of her arms
Tidy Bowl Man tried to throw a fit


I told his punk ass he was full of Shhhh...



(Humpty Hump)

Shut your mouth biz


See you're allways trying to take it further
I heard you bit a burger, with a funky worm in it

well you had to play stupid 'cause you didn't clear the sample

and lordy lord, got you pushing hot dogs



(Biz Markie)

Tupac was the only one that was living large

And Humpty your nose is a two-car garage

I know you got sooooul

I heard you don't eat pussy you be eatin' booty hole




(Humpty Hump)
No my nose be in the booty, my tongue be in her vertical smile

I heard your sister had sex with Colin Powell



(Biz Markie)


Your moms don't brush her teeth
I heard her breath was strong



(Humpty Hump)

Yo you wrong

Why can't we just get along?




Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends
Why can't we just get along?

Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends

(Biz Markie)

The city so nice, they had to name it twice

New York, New York, the land of lights

We got the fashion, the widget, the project ditches

The Apollo, the Broadway, The Garden, the Pictures



(Humpty Hump)

So? We got the palm trees, Gs being Hollywood swingin' large

Cars around the block with the stars on the sidewalk

Every stop lights a show case, not lexuses

Brothers in Hummers following other friends in Benzesus



(Biz Markie)

Ya, that's cool, y'all doin' your thing

But look what they did to that man Rodney King

They beat him, and stomped him, like a bunch of grapes



when I seen him he looked like the Planet of the Apes

(Humpty Hump)

Ya you right, police don't act tight but in the riots yo

California niggas wasn't scared to go

at poh poh




(Biz Markie)
So yo, I'll take you down like Mavis

Every Burrough is Thurough, don't forget Larry Davis

We got Dre and Quincy Jones, homes



Primo and Puff, Hump



Easy E and Tupac nigga



Scott La Rock and Biggie nigga



Compton



Bronx



Oakland



Brooklyn Bridge



Golden Gate, plus Huey Newton



Malcom X




You got rats


Earth quakes




Well at least you'll never catch me wearing wigs in my videos


Oh, you don't have to go there, with your big, plastic nose



What about your big ass head?



What about your buck ass teeth?



Your moms so black, I looked at her and thought that I was asleep



Your nasty ass moms gave me ear infection over the phone



Come on man, why we can't get along?



Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends

Why can't we just get along?

Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends

Take the rap sheet and part it 
Let my dog take a spill on it 
Never phoney on it, ya I still want it 
But those shmoes knows how it goes so yo let me flaunt it

The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny - but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to hump thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky, I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, come here are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Wenn es kein guter Grund ist zum Sterben was dann
Vielleicht komm ich nicht mehr wieder reich mir zum Abschied ein letztes Mal deine Hand
Ich küss den Ring der uns für ewig zusammen schweißt,ich hab's dir geschworen
Egal was ich schütze euch vor jeder Bedrohung
Denn ihre Freiheit und Freude heißt Heirat mit dem Teufel
Sie legen Feuer, wer wir sind hat für sie keine Bedeutung
Und unsere Werte sind wertlos für sie ihre Liebe, findet nur drüben statt
Hier sind sie so herzlos, bitte schau mich nicht mehr an,

And I'm not going anywhere
Without him by my side
And I'd love to bring him home tonight
Yes I'd love to bring him home
Out of the danger zone
He'd do the same for me
And what traitor I would be
And that's why I'm going there

A lot of match to insense I'm tense with every sentence 
Dense is how my weed is I rock them ill Adidas 
Yo my feet is in deep peep my twist linguistics 
Loud like Steve Ripkith but most of y'all won't miss it 
To some it comes slower others much faster 
My rhymes stand out like calliped at the Masters 
Ask the question ""Yo let me step up"" 
I say you can't try us cause fools dying 
Before they get the chance like Len Blias 
Ride by us they walk well I be hidden in shade 
More content then when rent is paid 
And renitent like raider spraid 
Oow yo first date is made for those who needed evidence 
Becoming ill never defeating the purpose 
But I propose my flows goes off the deep end 
Living everyday of the week like a weekend 
That's just my lifestyle I'll cut like a knife while 
You'll dull like shine never mind it's the end of the time

While some crash the backboard I slash the blackboard 
With permanent chalf I decode your thought 
Thee eraser I will rip apart to make a marker 
Flooded with more sheets now lines are darker 
But who would of thought when nine years have past 
The lines will contain the signs of the pat 
And when my day finally comes at last 
I resound taking out mad fools in the blast 

Evidence will keep it on lyrics hi tech like tron 
Visualize pictures drawn in neon 
With subtle backdrops black for silhouettes 
Torn up cities that floundered nothing left 
No fish in the streams no natural greens 
Like a dream or a scene from 2014 
But that's the next let my stay on the line 
Evidence violated till the end of the time 

It all comes down to this it all comes down 
It all comes down to this it all comes down 

I pick up vibes like God part of Quarty Hey 
Through my brain sends my arms back signals of pain 
I take you where I need to go from the scheme to the store 
I travel when i flow we can do Mars like Joe 
Then stroll back to Earth critique your transmission 
You must renovate then innovate in a dimension 
Not just of sound and sight but of mind like the twilight 
Your rhymes are incomplete like a piece without the highlight 
I be that artist painting pictures lyrically 
In 3D to make that picture pop out spherically 
When I rap I do laps like Tyco race tracks 
So I bomb exact I sue my aerial map 
Poetic contractor design and build 
Many intricate messages are messed with skill 
Prescriptions are filled by traditional 
Medicinal appressional rhymes 
To break down before the end of the time

The name is Iriscience

I go through rivers (what?) so I don't leave a scent
I travel both directions but leave one set of prints
It's just a little trick, of the indigenous
Developing inner visions of what religion is
I caught the understanding and the underhanded
I plan to build my ship and man it to another planet
Under heavy surveillance, many different agents
Some are camouflage, others are very blatant
I study weapon systems and vocal fighting forms
I'm many moves ahead, the thoughts are highly formed
Like time times time times time is time squared
Went there, sayin' ""Rakaa you don't rhyme fair""
But I never dummy lyrics and they kick it to my people
It's about communication not a rappers ego
Messages I sneak in they seem to seep in
Mixed with alcohol and weed on the weekend
Shared among friends like various sins
One day it clicks it's no longer dim
Time release capsules humble the headstrong
Your thoughts of takin' me head on are dead wrong

[Chorus]

It's the master of Aikido
I let go, karate confrontations 
Evidence scientist in innovation
I locks on when I travels around planets
Smooth but got a rough edge like Wulitzer pianists
Display mucho attack, receive payments for the cadence
A in this, you get fit fowl with flagrance
Free agents on the dotted line more hard to sign
Not easily impressed with gold mines and whole nines
I'm somewhere in-between never rushed and in a hurry
And when I swing my bat I don't think I'll miss like baseball
Fury the jury's hung, from verdict and got no chance
Dilated comes first the rest are second like Stu Lance

Oh yes it get better everyday 
The A-1, is my mind on vintage display?
Unattended in this case 
(The Ace two steps ahead)
Everyday is Mayday and best friends are Feds
But I know this that's why they closest
In a crisis situation you negotiate first 
I'm perfectly focused
Strategic and in a zone 
It was radar detected but my speed was unknown
Anonymity, that's my key to survival
Ev is not for Evidence it's for all the dense on trial
Just remember in this game it take two to tango
Don't go to them let them come to you 
And work the angles

So, better back up 'cause DJ Romes is gonna go off and 
Bringing his Technics turntable style straight out of his coffin 
I'll continue to pull out my menu of styles and bend you 
In half then laugh on behalf of my whole Lootpack staff 
Brothers be like ""I want to hear y'all ish"", at least you've waited 
First heard it hear, negative criticism is mad appreciated 
My direction takes course of a fraudulent, fake endorserer

Yo to me it don't matter how dope you write or look
MC's without a voice should write a book
You heard me properly, claimin that shit you didn't, oh really?
My crew's more dedicated than Rocky training in Philly
Put your gloves on, about to get more than can withstand
The comp they left baffled coffee shops in Amsterdam
I never got redemption from an honorable mention
So my lyrics hug the beat wit the tightest suspension (watch out)
Don't fear on turns, of course floor the corners
Yo, that's my drive, got tracks like beehives
You can't pass my gate, a great mistake, you paid the cost
You bigger than me? You screaming ""Shorty No Mas""
Yo, some think I'm clever
Others think I'm the one who makes too many references to weather/whether...
Or not I'm feelin this beyond words explain

Everything is merging, no matter who you bank wit
Imagery battle hymns, political poetry

Who don't scheme, but knows more lines than coke fiends
Closing dark plates, it's hot and smoking
Sneaky green slow flow, thought provoking
Leaves mics, turntables and stages broken
Dilated y'all, Irisciece y'all wide awake
Babu revolve while Rakka rocks the break
Revolution is a cycle to turn, vital to learn
Next time other neighborhoods are liable to burn
Toys meet the same fate steppin in range
Ain't your folks hollering at you 'bout playin wit flame?

But not getting caught in a kind of killing
See paranoia will destroy ya
And I got a lot, maybe too much for ya
My veins are swelling, stress wracks my brain
The point where my head and neck connects is in flames
We've come a long way since the first mainframe
And there's more going on than computer games
We got inter-net, world wide web sites
Which you might get caught in if you don't keep your head right
Organize and educate the youth
But most would pass up revolution to loot
Won't fight for your rights but you'll die to look cute
Most would pass up revolution to loot

Ay yo it goes without saying whose delivery is nicest
So I'll say lady liberty represents Isis
Execs don't think midas will touch science
(well fool?)
My mind got me on the verge of violence
Or stopping this whole rap wrote in silence
But going against the negative grain is my defiance
The enlightened titan might win
I'll see the symbols at libraries and schools
Lodges, churches and temples
It be fighting for peace
Got me mad enough to shoot
But most would pass up revolution to loot
Won't fight for your rights but you'll die to look cute

My peeps are like 'release steam!' but I seem unable
I trip on microchips and ponder transponders
and feel the radio waves and satellites upon us
Zoom on the earth, zoom on California
Zoom on Los Angeles, zoom on me warning ya
If they shoot a slug and strike me like a baddamyst ?
Understand that government and industry's the catalyst
A battle was lost but quiet war still wages
Police engage us, like potential bigamists
Page is the limitless ?, cages for sentences
Till this anti-material particle finishes
With this unworkable body, oh lord
Rough child ? figured how to get the rich and poor
Extra promisory notes still but they can't afford
Then collect on collateral, financed your war

I work for victory though
I'm taught by history
And ignorance as a status symbol makes no sense to me

Things I ??? I find shocking like Raiden ?
Voyage to self-discovery but no it's not maiden
It's just that it's never been made in this form
This storm I will weather till the weather gets warm
I work for victory though
I'm taught by history
And ignorance as a status symbol makes no sense to me
I speak especially to kids of the pyramids
Built with the symmetry
Raw gets the energy
Enemies throw me off the path that friendlies show me

It's no retreat, hit the street, get my plane confirmation
To the other side of the world, a daily operation
First stop in Vegas, can't keep these lions locked in cages
We rock in places where alcohol's for all ages
On stages, in great heights land in London at night
LAX today, MP tight
A 2000 Technique cha, cut and freak
Detonate our drums, heat the plastique

[Evidence]
Ayo funky, straight up with the force to keep fighting
Samson, Atlas, Collossus, Titan
In the dark night the torch that enlightens
Our strong cast-iron, harder the lion
A mighty foundation, many mouths to feed
With the energy needed to turn a seed to weed
We're fortified tight, sturdy sound construction
Make rappers ""Duck Down"" like I'm Boogie Down Productions

Hustle in the same industry I don't trust
I know California dig it like a gold rush
And worldwide no retreat, we cold crush
Beef up support, insulate your stage or pay
Make way for the prophets of rage
While they engage to let you know we're in a new age
Babu will make a DJ turn a new page

[Iriscience]
Cause that's a dangerous man that can speak with his hands
Watered-down lyrics on dirty tracks turned to sand
To sink in, better watch the X that you ink in
Or on, disrespect us, step on my lawn
Skip the death threats, MC or graph and test these wrong
Your letters are wack, they get blown like mailbombs
I'm on the next train to your thought that's caught
Where I'm going, no retreat, hit the beat, exit the plot

Cuff the mic that's wack, develop tools to tap out
No doubt, Dilated's turning pros to flows

And now you rocking with the camp that rocked last at Tramps
Worldwide, collecting little passport stamps
From the body to the mind like I'm Jesse Ventura
This millennium and mark 2000 like Futura

Bet, rest assured vaccines ain't far from cures
PLant some new shit, hit me two weeks into tour
But I'll adapt, guaranteed make it through

I still rock the party till the needle starts skippin
I'm trippin like pippen, spice rum sippin
We're mentally fastest, head of all our classes
You couldn't pass us wit a rocket like nasa
We all up in the house like cocky-roaches
Snatchin mc's out the game like hockey coaches
Fuck it, I'll break you down like a bucket
I like the bass hittin like a ?
Close encounters of the likwit kind
I'm sick wit mine, writin rhymes on picket signs
It's the j-are-o, you didn't know?
Goin off in your face like a dirty pist-ol
You in the house of brews, crime scenes wit no clues
You walkin home bruised, confused wit no shoes
You lose! 'cause you got the dilated blues
Here's some news, my dj rock the mic and the one's and two's
And I'm out

And I'm in
My words are like swords cuttin the paper wit the pen
Yo, dilated could never be annihilated
I waited two albums too long , somebody violated
We migrated to global positioning
All the dj's listenin, babu mixin it
""E-swift"" yeah, the man, the myth
I pass the mic to evidence for the assist
Then I'm ooouuut
And I'm in

Yo only one meal, get sliced to four courses
I'd take me serious, collect your man and forces
I strictly run off select input
Played yourself, don't have to shoot you in the foot
'Cause you stepped outta bounds without making your rounds
Now you come to my town
Ask rak (yo you on deadly ground)
These last four bars, I'ma heal all my scars
I'm a underground cat but still like money and cars
A cali classic, that's my word, and my word's my bond
Dilated peoples, alkaholiks, this joint's right on

My homie king t told me ""big tash, right on""
So I'ma (right on, right on)

To my dilated homies that be rippin the mic
(Right on, right on)

Whether you writin or ridin, right on
Fresh mc's must write on
Even if you skateboardin, ride on
Some of these freestylers need to write on like my homie tash

I got my write on late at night
Burst a verse until they flow right
My rhymes be action-packed, I wrote these lyrics to a strobe light
I'm tashy, the flashy nigga jumpin out that fast shit
Your rhymes won't impress me if you said em doin backflips
I crack whips on phones, blow smoke out nose
Niggas peepin out the style, hoes peepin the clothes
A million flows off the slang, bizz-a-pow, bizz-a-bang
Likwit crew is in this bitch, my click be off the chain
Rap off the plane while crackin champagne
Tash for president, you know my campaign
First things first to get ya'll niggas off the street
You get twenty-five years if you part wit wack beats
You coulda came to ev, you coulda came to swift
That's why we escalatin while ya'll niggas need a lift
So give me two secs while I crack this beck's
And once I drop the mic, my nigga rak is up next
And I'm out

And I'm in
I pick it up for everybody in the house that spins
My name is rakaa, innovator of rhyme communication
Wit data like star trek: the next generation
It's dilation, fan appreciation
Connected nationwide, worldwide likwidation
Cali hard-hitters, we bump like car fenders
(It's all chips) we only get boo's from bartenders
Better be sure, aim high, we top gunnin
When we touch down, we hit the ground runnin
Feds pull strings and watch me like truman
But I can't front, I love l.a. like randy newman

To all the homies locked up writin home, write on c'mon

Dilated Peoples,"Ay, yes y'all
The only thing constant is change
With that, it's the shape of things to come, yeah

Yo, I'm the open-est emotions, I'm a river in straight
A crystal clean lake, yo, the essence of skin
The form of a luminescent bright light fluorescent
(You got light?)
Don't wait till it's dark to ask questions
I been sparkin' in sections and blessing mics with my presence
Since many were pre-pubescent puberty adolescent
Perhaps you need a lesson in, addressin' with respect an'
Too many feel inadequate without their little weapon

It's like I got the whole world against me, need to get intensely
A head full of headache he's and a hand full of sissies
Them so flimsy so why there one MC
There wasn't one before hasn't been one since me
A gangster of love, I come from up above
I give the mic a tug, I give the world a hug
I give the skies a kiss, I give suckers a kiss
Some people like my old styles better than this but

Yo, I'm Spacey like Kevin and some do knowledge of seven
Praise Jesus and Jah, Buddha, Allah or just Heaven
Yeah, and some like it moderate and some like a lot of it
Whichever way I go we got somethin' to get you move up out of it
Some will be statistics and some will be reverends
Dimes become pennies like dimes become eleven
To some we kind of thought of it, as teaching the dumb
Ace-One and dilated, the shape of things to come

I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares
Triangles to test if indeed you're prepared
This is the shape of things to come
This is the shape of things to come

I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared
This is the shape of things to come

I wax 'em I tax 'em, here's Iriscience, ask him
From Arkansas to Aspen, the futuristic jazzmen
I'm telepathic, movin' through hella traffic
I know my demographics, see how this was crafted and drafted
There's precision in the incision
I'm not Christian or Catholic or any other religion
I'm just man with a steel in his hand
I shoot the gift from blessed to spark where it land

And it landed in the sand where the pyramids blaze
And this is how the dictionary defines such a place
A polyhedron with a polygonal base
Median and common vertex, triangular face
Who came in the home and ripped the cats stole
Stripped the limestone to line they fine home
I cram to understand, their dirty deeds in song
While we bringing you the shape of things to come

I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared
This is the shape of things to come

Aiyyo, I center punch punchlines, shine when it's crunch time
I back to beat box, rap battles at lunchtime
I sketch a piece and fill it in with design
Ooh no, Aceyalone, raw bright like sunshine
Platform squad, standin' on the brink
Yo I touch the world, got three but two blink
Rakaa aka Iriscience lenscrafters
And blend with hash the self defense master

Yeah, it's too bad we control fire, wind
I know that you bad you batted a thousands I remember
Who's the baddest with the apparatus tell me again
Take ahold of your heart without penetratin' the skin
See I didn't invent it, I just perfected it
I never intended to really connect with it
But once I got in it, I redirected it
Now I change the world and get respect with it and a check with it

It ain't nothin' new under the sun
Fool, I ain't afraid of the size of your gun
The flesh is weak plus they speak foul tongue
Take the breath from their lungs as they swung
And they hung and they sunk

I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared
This is the shape of things to come

Yo, my first verse, from '90 to '94
Mostly peepin' cats' styles out and hittin' the floor
A little bit, in '91 that's when we got down
Different sides of town, on the bus I made rounds
I was involved in graffiti heavily
My people were Self, Tau and Freck RIP
At night I heard beats next door by QD III
Inspiration, destiny, Ev producer/MC
Now at this point, my face wasn't known and unfamiliar
And when you look how I do, most cats won't say they feel ya
So I was mostly, humbled by rejection
But in my heart, I knew my shit would always pass inspection
Correction, travel east and hit the inner section
Hip hop shop to rock, blow the spot wit Hex and Pen One
Also Iristyle, a cat who worked there
I said ""I want to bust first"" he said ""It's all fair""
I went, he went, you can't beat em, join em
I said ""As a team in the game, we'll leave em maimed""
He agreed, so we did till '94
Till we had to change our name from the one we had before
Now at this point, we were five years in the making

And as for mine, I'll be sixty in my prime
Still science and theories, and droppin rhymes on time

""You want to front war""

Chorus 2x

[Iriscience]
Aiyyo I seen apathy, met love and know hate
I'm heavy on the mic, can you handle the weight?
Either you learn to adapt or you're sealin your fate
Only brave when you get more dusted than home plate
Rockin D&D wit the Alchemist and Babs
And after the lab, we send Ev to catch the cab
Platform troop, make moves and stay true
Rock Steady-Zulu creates a devastate crew

[Evidence]
Yo I Platform my strategy, mix words wit alchemy
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony
Between you and I, I'll tell you, here's the diff
Gun to your head, your dead, pointblank, I shapeshift
That's right, study Chemistry like Al
Life, use your potential or Steve Howe
I'm about to call it quits, like too much weight'll break your rack mount
The man'll make you move yo, so make your move a backout

We got tension in suspense, theme in variation
Train robbery panic, description of equation
I'm after the gold, and after that the platinum
You want what you don't have so far neither one's happened
But I was told by my peeps play your cards right
Spit hard, never look back, disregard hype

Say what?  I bust a you and come back (hey!)
Reach under my seat for that heat that blaze tracks
Face facts, you're facin' poker faced cats
Dilated made our way through the maze, ""so take that!""
For boom bap rap brought some state of the art shit (hey!)
After two L's, I'm cool like James Todd Smith
Made ya burn while the, tables turn

Lot of people talk with their game with their mouth
Dangerous people to hang with

that's a dangerous man who speak with his hand
Hit the turntable listen
That's a dangerous man who speak with his hand
Dilated junkies make the rookies drive slow

He don't need no introduction, he just bust in
Grab the turntables and then start hugging
DJ?s are ducking, tucking their tails running
Well, blending, rocking at twelve hundreds

Or vest tax, one of them fresh cats
The type you definitely wanna bless with rats
So recognize that you met your match
But check out Babu with the cold, cut, scratched

Break it down
Break it down
Break it down

Yo, bring it back Bab?s one more time, that's fine
Face off on tracks while you walk the plank
And now drums are come back
With redemption of Shawshank

that's a dangerous man who speak with his hand

Junkie is the keep, junkie is the keeper

The world USA and CA rock, LA rock
The funky presented J Rocks

Keep it movin?
And show my cats how it?s done
Visionary Redmatic, next up, hit the one

You know the fucking concept
Whenever we step to this set is no contest
Come on, come on, come on

When I do my thing I?d be on some more of shit
To service qua two, Babu with another hit
?Cause if you ain't a beat junkie then you ain't said shit
Like that

This is with an expansion team

Live and direct, on the ones and twos

I'm so outlandish, my rhymes the paint, the track's the canvas
Find me puffin' tampons on your nearest college campus
McEn-Ro, servin' up heat like Pete Sampras
Drinkin' Jose Cuervo like some Spanish bandits

Make women panic when I tell 'em I'ma vanish
Don't take it personal, these are eight-one-eight antics
Hoes, break your pockets like car mechanics
Every mornin', I bow down and pray like a mantis

Most women can't stand this but I, ain't romantic
So that thought you can banish to the city of Atlantis
Me and Tash met this tan bitch, made a Likwid sandwich
I consume strictly green leaves like pandas

Dig through ice for my brew, like they dig for woolly mammoths
I'm volcanic up in bitches that look like Dorothy Dandridge
Your style is Major Damage, it's played out and ripped up
It needs a bandage, how do you manage? I can't stand it

Hops, barley, water, yeast, grain
Distillery alcohol for the brain
So check it out, smoke fills the area
Drunk as fuck, launch off the aircraft carrier

Your vision blurred eyes start to blink
You overdid it homes, you had too much to drink
(Cut it out)
This bout's set for twelve rounds of pain
Tequila limes and salt, these cats hard to hang

Sixteen bar shark, teeth to fangs
Open off Tha Liks duck season, you're in range
Turn the page here comes the next chapter
Battle Ev? You sign with Blue Cross or AFTRA

I crack fans with funk then burn rubber like the Gap Band
Batman can't walk through my hood, it's no love
Tash'll jack him for his cape and sport that shit to the club

Is it love or is it buzz, that got my thinkin' patterns
Thinkin' yo' bitch is mine that's why you see me winkin' at her
She'll be drinkin' at a tavern, out of a glass size 8
Likwid Crew and Dilated make that ass gyrate

While you ask I take, anythin' that I could lift
Your rapper's rappin' like CaTash y'all DJ's rappin' like Swift
I was born with a gift, you niggaz used to average rappin'
Your styles is old as fuck, that's why my clique start cabbage patchin'

I do this for the beer, and for the ones that ain't here

Night life..
Ready to spit
Tags what? Evidence
Cross the planet
Step it up this year weather man
The times right, sleep all day to wake up for night life
Ready to spit
When it drops, gonna hit
We step it up, no doubt the times right
Sleep all day to wake up for night life

Start every verse with something to quote:
""The devil you know, is better than the devil you don't""
Last year.. a test, true colors where shown
Kings remained in chess on the board and life in thrones
Music catch the force of my mic
that's why at night I be out postin' up my own snipes
For years I sat back, played the role, what for?
This here disc, hear us raw
Can't fake it anymore
Check it out: You now witness the scenes
2nd release, Expansion Team
Shit thumps, shine bright headlights seen on
The like laser beams drive fast things and tee green

(chorus)

You know these nights ain't gettin' any longer
Put your best out and bail
You never know, you might get stronger
I stood back a bit, take punchlines out raps been more legitimate
Solidify our place in the game, pleasure with pain
Tropical flow: see sun but feel rain
Its easy to seclete yourself up in the mix
That's why its good to get out at night and holler at chicks
I take it back before studio racks,
before I understood the concept of seperatin' tracks
Before...
Around the time my life when I swore
That the mic was a device not to be taken light

chorus

Night life...
Graffiti artists get armed
Cans get shook, the walls get bombed
This is the time when shadow rocks get thrown
At your tinted car windows sound off the alarm
This is the time you execute your plan
While other people sleep, jewels get ran
In get away vans exit off ramps
Smaller operations are shops bigger one camps
Rock knots in pocket pants
Got the advance, and back for my back end in hands
And things ain't always what they seem from a glance
But up close shit'll change your whole prespective
Shadows close in, you realize you ain't protected

The difference between a hero and a coward? There 
is no difference. One time or another everyone's felt
fear. It's what one person does that the other person
doesn't do that makes him a hero. But I'm about to
step the fuck up. 

(Evidence w/ Iriscience)
Yo panic y'all. Back against the wall feel the pressure
No way out. Situation getting closer
Time is ticking, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one who's chosen
Panic, adrenaline rush. Master mechanic
Play your position, blow wigs back with cannons
Colors of rythym. No options left to chose from
Cooperation can cock thoughts that's grouseme
Like, glock for murder with three strikes in Houston
Or foreign countries that chop fingers for boosting
Main objective-don't become an example
Either run or get ran. Stampede or get trampled
I spit hard and respect my guard
Got vision like x-ray, that's how I read your card
Yo we got the upper hand and still play by the book
The truth? It's always the last place you look. 
That's right here

(Iriscience)
Uh-oh. You feel that? That's the croud staring
That's the spotlights that shine that damn near blind
Sing a swim-time kid. What's your first line?

(Evidence w/ Iriscience)
I spit hardcore. Menace to flows
Time to panic for crews who don't rehearse for shows
'Cause yo this year it's time to reclaim game
Used to sit up in the shadows and rebel against fame
Until my peep worded me up. Might have the mightest touch
And the only way to find out is to blow the fuck up
I listened, put that thought under my wing and in my brainstem
Now I think ink can bleed through paint pens
Or spray cans. Dodging trains it's the panic zone
East L.A to the beach. Welcome to the terror dome
When the feelings gone, here comes artillery
To penetrate my zone takes a mind of a military
Blown off exotic trees from Yosemite
California's cannibus chance dodging felonies
Melt my trees with heat. Guns the remedy
Do what I do? You might panic and call emergency

(Evidence)
Set your own standards. Not everybody can do what we do
We can't do what everybody else does. a lot of people get
comfortable playing follow the leader. But if you want to 
see change you need to be the leader to follow. Let's make it happen

(Evidence)
Panic. Abondoned ship, iceberg titanic. 
Time to steal fans from other groups they take for granted
The way we came up nothing was handed
So when we drop the mic its hot. Pick it up, you might get branded
Might not like your plane the way we land it
But get the job done and then some. So panic
And it ain't the last. Coming from the fast
High-tech shit so feel the blast
Catch the wordplay, hype sends the survey
Instead of stripclub chop meats Monday through Thursday
Friday through Sunday. Blown off the runway
Ev the Weatherman use words instead of gunplay
Perfect caintance, can't catch on radar
Speak the truth yo don't run with traitors
Equator hot. The artic cold
Everything between turns to green and gets sold

With scratch, with dance, with graf protectors

Then takes over the stage 'til the morning breaks night
Word of mouth crew, make sure we pay right
Then Hendrix takes over my body, I blaze mics
Spray 3-d outlines and highlights
I know lowlifes that are livin the high life
At great heights I exercise my rights
So much smoke, when I'm this high, I sky-write
Raaka raps to build, or raps to ruin
Your whole career, yo, watch what you're doin

I rock hills and valleys, rap shows and ralleys
Record stores and schools, live shit from Cali

Near the intersection of Crenshaw and Wiltshire
Where, as you can see in the background
Military personnel are mobilized and waiting orders

Despite the quiet and the deceptive calm, tension is still
thick in the air after last night's concert and rebellion
The incident was allegedly sparked by police officers trying
To shut down a reportedly peaceful concert by hip hop artists

Hardcore reporters with orders from headquarters
Behind enemy lines, sidestepping the borders

With press passes, we bring it to you as it happens

'Cause the pen gives the word sending swords to war
They twisted it when they quoted Mao Tse-tung
They said political power comes from the barrel of a gun

The officer meets his fate, by .44 .38
It was a dirty deed, but that don't mean a dirty case
Witnesses against the state are shushed
Facts overlooked so the judge can throw the book

Perhaps for politicians with something to prove
In the city where they blew the roof off and move
Yo, questions when answered leads to more questions
Why'd it take months to remember a confession?

The principles are the same even without the name
But I still say M-you-M-I-A
I have to fight, it could easily be me
But just being the thinker than speakin it freely

Although I use my brain before using a fist
Don't push it, wake up, refuse and resist

This is self defense. x2
This ain't no threat man, ???
This is self defense
Ain't no tough guy talk,
we're just doing what we have to

[Verse 1 - Iriscience]
I think ya better let it go
You need attention?  I send medical
Basically you're trying to harm me, you're crazy
Musically, I'm blazin'.  Physically, I'm gracy
Triangle choke ya
And what the fuck could have provoked ya?
We don't know eachother kid, and I did not insult ya
Don't make me feed the fish, feed the trees, or feed the vultures
I don't know stones, I throw statues and sculptures
I block flows with strikes and strikes with blows
I slice flows with my mic (get showns)?
I counterattack and turn the tables in an instant
Move out of range and step into close distance
Resistance, relax with less friction
Leverage and technique bring jokes and submissions
You got heart, you plan to make it happen
But none of my family are chumps or never have been
Respect mine, protect myself at all times
Build twice next time before you cross the line
I guess this is what you call a turn of events
And the best offense is a good defense

[Chorus]
Yo, you want to hit us?  We can hit back
If you talk that talk, you got's to live that. (This is self defense)
Whenever you front out, you gonna get back. (This is self defense)
Self Defense, you wish you never did that. (This is self defense)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Evidence]
Yo, stay ready for the worst
Paranoid, straight, smart
enemies hit ya where you think you're safe. (Self Defense)
I cut my fingerprints with razor blades
I'm in the cut, the kind you don't recognize with shades
Tattoos, learn two tricks
only thing between me and the borders and the straight face
Answers to questions, four eye contact
this confrontation ain't physical, but still combat

Leave ya'self left with options to choose
The last line of defense of my crew, (dope rules?)
Psychic, precise, right and exact for songs
Only time we've been wrong is when we thought we were wrong
The science are format's own conclusive, but peace first and war, last.  
These words are crucial
Conflict resolved, but to those that want to brawl:
Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional
Also, dropping the ball ain't recommended
when life or death decisions are made within seconds
Of course we make the right ones, strategically through
Self defense, but not by myself.  Babu

   (Chorus-Iriscience)
   Trade money
   Different color and shape money (money)
   Money that looks funny but never no fake money
   Make money, money, but please don't waste money
   We don't love money but we don't hate money

(Evidence)
Yo, if you live day to day then you proabably live life
More than a cat who got a Benz, bank roll and a wife
'Cause yo, I seen a lot of folks whose so-called success equals depress
And look up to broke peeps who hold mics now
Play the role, reverse and understand
Your friend with no dough might be closer to earth
Take the pressure off the weight and see how it equates
If you hold yourself back to make papes, get it straight

(Iriscience)
You can use cash for tools, to get parks and pools
Community centers, rec rooms and schools
Book money, off the books and food money
Rent money, electronic money and crew money
First thing, flippin over dollars, searching
For the eye in the chief corner stone in thirteen
Stay beyond hungry and thirsty, (""dilated"")
We're damn near starvin and we're dehydrated

(Chorus) 2x

(Iriscience)
No credit, everybody has to pay
Dope music, spittin everything from hash to yay
Watch the traffic or you're gonna bring crash this way
Then have 'em swingin at my door like Cassius Clay (no matter)
The game don't exist without roles and rules
But comma manifest as the golden rule
Rolled on wheels in the eighties, they would jack them fools
Flashin trucks and jewels, but not tuckin they truck jewels

(Evidence)
Yo, since last year I've accumulated more money
More big breaks, been dressy a little less bummy
But more headaches and more pain in my stomach
On top of that I got a lot of people actin funny
But dummies get exposed when your weapon's are chose
Power to spit out your mouth cold could leave a man fold
Yo, been to certain places where the term ""green"" don't mean shit
'Cause money's blue and that's what it takes to pay rent

(Chorus) 2x

(Jamaican man talking & Babu mixing)
""Everybody got dreams of making cash money""

Yo, trained to be patient but still wait eagerly
Approach easily, backed by walkin Evil Dee

Navy be	, Henny be	, Beat Junkies sound
Expansion team, independent dollars, word a mouth
There's cats with twenty/twenty that'll never see money

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
 From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

Who you stepping with, Skandalous fucking dangerous
Bitches brains I bust, feel the lust in God we trust

Been in this game for too long you bout to lose your face

As I take another hit on this shit nigga you dead
Never ask forgiveness told the Lord to give me grace
You talked some shit front your boys and as result you lost your face
Blood all over the place I'm counting the fucking bodies dropping
I know my destiny cause I can hear the devil knocking
I done sent body and soul to my eternal flames you best believe
I numb them bodies and play my fucking game
I sold my soul at an early age
And now my hearts releasing daemons in a rage
My eyes in a daze
Evertime I close my eyes to go to sleep I see the visions coming
Is juices running when ya done in
Fear only make me curious, I'll never be afraid
But if you slip you pay your life here come the light now nigga they
Dead
Crack scarfs for my fucking glory
Talking shit up in my territory
Another day another world's sad story

Get ?? when them bodies fall hitting them prisoners hard
Its your final call bitch I'll smoke you like menthol
Fuck all you bitches I'm putting you in them bodybags
Tagging toes, nigga drive slow
Creeping up out they indo scheming for they cheese
Slanging oz's and quarter keys niggas dressed in army fatigues
Freeze your whole coalition
Strapped with ammunition
Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads

Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door
But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales
Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail
Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale

Spit the facts I'm bout the Lex and the Ac
My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat

Or this, cause I piss on competition
And have all you hoes in submission

Tired of chasing apple pie dreams
Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know

Followe by your second line of flowers
I devour competition, causing complete submissions
Cooks more dope in my kitchen
Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls
Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed
Boss chick you don't want to see her
Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters

To wire your mouth, knock your grill out

So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip
Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit

till then ?? - how your gonna win
and how to turn your buds over to our next king
and how your gonna stay focused to read the game
and how your gonna see if you try to stop the bang

[Chorus and Cuts by DJ Babu]",Love and War,2004
Dilated Peoples,"No questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
That hides the snakes of America
So they watch it, now I walk with caution
More careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
But I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
War is big biz, ask an economist
Speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist
I want black and brown unity
But cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line
We call it art, some call it a crime
It's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
On drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
The villain trained by the hero for the killing
Now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
They might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
Just listen to the knowledge I give
If more than half the budget goes to military spending
Less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
And justice for all who are miserable

You're like, what's ya name ma 
Should've run from her 
The girl's (Poisonous!) 
You made a bad move 
She's from a bad crew 
They're all (Poisonous!) 

[Chorus: x2] 
She ain't the one to trust 
She'll treat your heart like Toys are Us 
She's dangerous to touch 
Stay away she's poisonous (Poisonous!) 

Some chick in the club you can't trust 
Front like they fans only out for your buck 
Front like they don't have a man and such 
You start holdin' hands, that's when the van pulls up 
It's tight situations like this 
You know the risk, roll the dice, hit or miss 
She feelin me? Well, she got different motives 
A candy shell to cover up the poison 
I don't have to pretend 
You know the type to fuck around with a mans best friend 
You know the type out to do you wrong 'cause you don't spend 
Enough time or enough bread (Poisonous!) 
It's the chicks that I let on the bus 
I took one in the back, the other stole my stuff (damn) 
It's the season of the vict', that night I got picked 
I'm telling you now, they're dangerous to touch (Poisonous!) 

[Chorus] 

She's poisonous, can cause serious harm 
Just one touch, play with your heart 
Like she was in Toys are Us, ignore your trust 
She's poisonous (Poisonous!) 

You thinkin' its love but that's lust 
You feelin' like she's a drug with that touch 
She breaks hearts 'cause her heart got crushed 
And loves cash, but she loves credit cards as much 
She like the creole, for real, maybe Puerto Rico 
No self-esteem, but fronts the biggest ego 
Never knew her father, her mother used to drink though 
Her step-father had a peep show through every keyhole 
Sweet and wholesome, he stole her innocence 
Now he's up in foursome, and she's the venomous 
Hates men, and dates them to rape them 
For payback, to pay bills she breaks them 
Catch her at the bar, Vanilla Coke and stoleys 
Now she throwin' bait, reelin' them in slowly 
She wants celebrities, 'cause she can hustle that 
A cat from the Mavs of the Cav's double back 
They threw a couple back, they had a couple laughs 
He was in trouble when he offered her a bubble bath 
He didn't strap up, she 'bout to make him splash 
Plan B was the get the hat up out the trash 
And get the turkey baster, she's thinking tall paper 
She cracked a smile when he told her that he'd call her later 
She's gonna hit the lotto, she wants them all to pay her 
Especially all them entertainers and ballplayers

Yo
I kill ciphers
That's how I went from good to God
I ain't perfect, yet n' still the hood is ours
And it's worthy, good people here work good and hard
But the news really only shows crooks and stops
It hold you for commercials and talk you into buyin shit
I was taught to learn from life and learn from my environment
Rocka walks the street as the son of a preacher
Who's the son of a preacher with people tryin to reach ya
I visualize the rise and realize the falling
High as time flies I recognize the calling
Went from lavish life to savage life back to lavish life
But never average, might be caught like Christ for the sacrifice
I still roll up my trees
For ? I meditate to roll up my sleeves
We adjusting readjust
I said I touch the world and the world said

Reach us
Reach us
Open up the world people ?

You know these days ain't gettin any longer
Now, it's do or die
Now or never, time to hit the street
We on the move
Ride out with shit to prove
Everywhere we go they like:
It's a green light for you
Got lyrics about pleasure some about pain
From Southern Cali where they say it never rains
It's different dames that make me count blessings
We burn for our peeps that ain't here as we sing
Reach us
In God we trust no doubt that's a must
A hundred times see us but still catch the rush
And when we fly bless the sky
Let your mission unfold
You in the car we in the bus bless the road
How could I reach you if I wasn't real
Might have to go before you really studied the flow
And understand the deal
This year fuck before mad, loud  and clear
You know that's the truth they can't

Reach us
Reach us
Say this cause I mean it from the heart
Reach us

Yo
What happened to me, nah what happened to you
The crew ain't changed the numbers the sames
The lack and the fools, the check for Cali dimes down to Georgia peaches
At our shows to book us, ? is how you reach us
Got ho's girls I see got queens
Got friends got enemies and in-betweens
Teacher are students, students are teachers
Low key or prestigious I reach you, you reach us
I see lines around the block in the snow it's cold now
I see people gettin hot when the shot is sold out
I see dime pieces to the front to rap along
To every word, word for word to every song
I raise every head and every arm
In every jam from every stage we stand on
People climbin over barricades and still
I tell security chill, they only tryin to

I tell nickel and dimers try not to be dealers
If they deal at least help, try not to be villains
And if they caught dealin', try not to be squealers
If they do try not to be shocked to see killers

Yeah, I'm crazy eyes killer, triple optic
Cold man go Guerrilla, pure with no filler
Rakaa's that real-I, bend steal at will
Eyes open, wide awake, y'all keep your eyes peeled

I never ratted, just rat-a-tat-tatted
Fully automatic, you're whole aura shattered
I got beats and rhymes, either or it never mattered
Flow fast or slow like I did on, ""Eyes Have It""

I don't waste days away glued to John Madden
So when the sun sets West, I ain't mad at it
I gravitate towards those cats who ain't dramatic
And seein' 20/20 money stacks is a habit

Yeah, hindsight is 20/20, let's toast to the past
But here's to the future time to split this money money
Hindsight is 20/20, a toast to the past
But here's to the future, 20/20

Last couple years shit been off the wall
Many tears lost my mom I'm stayin' strong
Regroup myself, dust my shoulder off
We back once again then poof we gone

I seen shit go down like Alc' almost die
Now I see why they say it's safer to fly
In the same breath, breathe life accept death
Until then 20/20, one of the best yet

I've had experiences that were out of body
Cops still probably clocked me comin' out of parties
I've seen scandalous verdicts make Los Angeles uprise
Black Tail bottoms and Cannabis Cup highs

Create to Devestate taught me how to bomb
From Radiotron, to the German autobahn
Trade money still different color and shade bills

Say I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Now I float like a brother's high, swing like a beast
I'm from Mid-City, when the bell rings I'm released

Hustlin', fightin' and eatin' still bringin' relief
To my people, if they're in your reach, each one teach
Runnin' through so much grass my shoes need cleats
Got that ""Vente Vente"" pumpin' through these streets

Last LP was odd, the score's even at last
Now we got enough trees to make you take 4 and pass
Now we got enough in fact don't even pass that back
It's free weed on me, you can hold me to that

When you see me in the streets, it be for that 20/20
Better than diesel, better than kush, it ain't funny
But trust me this Cali, my block's best product

A food service worker and a telemarketer
Dreamin? 'bout goin? to [Incomprehensible]
Maybe CalArts or even the Arts Center

But music was my passion, part of my callin? to
Hustle year 'round, spring, summer, fall, winter
Will stop for nothin?, you shouldn't start with us
For the people, by the Dilated Peoples, hard hitters

Life is goin? by fast, I try to grab it
Can I get a aye? Aye, the eyes have it
For the people, by the peoples
The eyes have it, once again it's your people

Yeah, life is goin? by fast, I try to grab it
Can I get a aye? Aye, the eyes have it
For the people, by the peoples
The eyes have it, once again it's your people

Once again life is goin? by fast, I try to grab it
Can I get a aye? The eyes have it
There are exceptions, people use their ties
Without the eyes, only way to win is lies

And some keep you under false pretense
And any half-truths fall under this roof
You gotta watch for these types, they be plottin?
Subliminally waitin? for you to get gotten

From Lost Angels to the rockin? Apple
Some get lost or caught by the shrapnel
Shoot your mouth off ?cause ricochets, watch for that
You never ready when the city fired back

Never ready for a hard day's night
And at home life ain't right so they dreamin? 'bout a flight
A getaway to divert the day's traffic
But life is right here goin? fast, you better grab it

Life is goin? by fast, I try to grab it
Can I get a aye? Aye, the eyes have it
For the people, by the peoples
The eyes have it, once again it's your people

Yeah, life is goin? by fast, I try to grab it
Can I get a aye? Aye, the eyes have it
For the people, by the peoples
The eyes have it, once again it's your people

For the people, by the peoples
For the people, by the peoples
The eyes have it, once again it's your people

y'all know my get down, my day to day
You can't spell Dilate without L.A.
Majority rules, some are outnumbered
It's a jungle out there, sometimes it makes me wonder

Why there's so many rats chasin? the cheese?
Cats facin? disease, cats facin? police
People bendin? the rules, just playin? to eat
It?s like connect the dots every day on the street

Life is goin? by fast, I try to grab it
Can I get a aye? Aye, the eyes have it
For the people, by the peoples
The eyes have it, once again it's your people

The mind/ People scared to be themselves/ Seem happy
To live a lie/ Give thanks for collie weed/ Never ever
Sniff a line/ Conquering Lion/ 225th in line/ If we say
We're ""Pro-War""/ Only in the fight for peace/ Man, that
Means no war/ Think the price of life is cheap?/ But
We're saying ""No More""/ Righteous recognize the beast/
Fireman'll baptize/ Burn 'em the light and heat/ Forward
To the power in a phrase like/ ""Acts Of God""/ Prophet
Said he saw the flood waters rise/ And the flow was hard/
I was really shocked to see/ The truth was exposed as hard/
While the media was focused/ On the words by Kanye/ What
Was it I just heard the President's Mom say?/ People here
Are frustrated/ Still got a long way/ Fed up but remember/
Self Destruction is the wrong way

Dilated Peoples,"Don't you take, my kindness for weakness
Don't you take, my kindness for weakness
Don't you take

I might flip, but usually a calm individual
Armed with accountants, my lawyers and other criminals
Network with armies, street wars are critical
And revolutionaries so streets are more liveable
(C'mon) Fuck what your ego say
Don't take shit for granted homey we don't play
All's fair in love and war, piece of cake
But beef is rare like a bloody piece of steak (Don't you take)
Your eyes off the quiet ones, the silent ones
With the assassin smile, the most violent
Train until their bleeding, crying, perspiring
And gun rings firing (Don't you take)
The wrong side, that's the wrong idea
Untangle it, we could get it on right here
Never back to broke, you get tapped or choked
I might smile, but I ain't no joke (Don't you take)

My kindness for weakness
Don't you take, my kindness for weakness
Don't you take

Love or fear, the fear last longer
But love is stronger, so I stay loyal to love with honor
You got those who wanna take that for weak
Be prepared, they'll test you in front of your peeps
Some easy advice, buy your way out my life
It's the principle, the pockets fat not flat
Some borrow dough and relax on payin that back?
C'mon cat(Don't you take) me for weak, give an inch they take feet
Give 'em feet, they take the street
My city's called Everybody Eats,
The operations don't skip a beat (Don't you take)
My squad as chumps, punks or fakes
Quick to dump, pop trunks on snakes
That's of course, push came to shove otherwise love is love so (Don't you take)

My kindness for weakness
Don't you take, my kindness for weakness
Don't you take, my kindness for weakness
Don't you take, my kindness for weakness
Don't you take

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest tonight in the house
Talib Kweli (Don't you take)

You'll never fit up in my shoes so don't try 'em on
I always tear it up, I'm 'bout as calm as a quiet storm
Legendary lyricist, nice guy persona
My songs celebrate life and you can play 'em for your momma
But don't make the mistake of tryin' to play me
Unless you a DJ, don't get it twisted I'm still from B.K.
Wanna front? Better keep it in your mouth like Flavor Flav
Where I'm from even a chick spit razor blades (Don't you take)
Me for a sucker or I'll take you back to school
Fool can't play the wise but the wise can act a fool
I stay cool and mild mannered and just put in my work
Don't push you don't know what's up, under my shirt(Don't you take)
Me for soft, I got a heart that pump
Like a twelve gage shotty when it start to dump
Youse a mystery, 'cause you don't know who you runnin' towards
And got history, that shit is told by those who won the war (Don't you take)

Six deep, packed in a Ford Explorer
I toured the whole world but never been to Florida

They holdin' my shit, all winter
By the time the shit drop, I done already been there
The game's fucked, a thousand soundalikes, it's sad
Hard to tell the difference like they fake Louis bags

I don't fuck with that industry flow
What I do fuck with is that industry dough
BMI, EMI, gimme all that
A side deal with who? Why not, where I sign at?

I used to do unto others, this the difference
This year fuck with things in my best interest
This ain't the new, it's the old from way back
Click it or Ticket, man they forcin' us to stay strapped

Act like you know, right now if not ASAP
This way was different shit, I ain't afraid to face that
This time, made up my mind, on my grind
On some James Brown, it's the Big Payback

Four by four, eight by eight
Twenty by twenty bars, I demonstrate
Four by four, eight by eight
Twenty by twenty bars, I demonstrate

Still blastin' away
Spit and put the cash away, passion to play
Mashin' my way through this Babylon
Out the gate I get up, I'm the one to gamble on

Holdin' me down, pride and truth

Beat this down the block and you'll be like G's
Movin' on up like George and Louise

I knock and I bump, like 8:15's
They lock, brothers up, for eight fifteens

Hey 'are you is divine
Pure like sunshine, just one rhyme

I'm on that Richard Pryor, Bruce Lee, Muhammad Ali
Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, Salvador Dali
Now we rap Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou
Out the disco Xanadu, hip-hop for the streets

Now the beat swing numchuk style

Heavy artillery with the heavenly spittery
And third strike energy, rockin' cleverly pitchin' heat

Fernando Valenzuela, original slangster
Lost Angels, Atzlan to beautiful danger
Call my travel agent, have her arrange
South America, South Africa and Southeast Asia

Then back to Mid-City we stack and get busy
In fact, Drev's barbecue and Hustle got 'gnac
The way I manhandle bully muscle the track
Thank God, I never focused on hustlin' crack

It's Rakaa with that educated animal rap
I still fight back and question when they handin' me scraps

This is Nissan truck hop
I bombed the RTD driver's side then hit the bus stop
Create to devastate, scene from New York
Hit the Hollywood sign in LA

Cheech Wizard kickin? the lizard, that shit was crazy
In the grass grazin?, now it's kush y'all

Never find shit to match

I caught a body, they called it a verse
Called the cops, I caught the life, they calling a hearse
Pain is easy in reverse, I think pleasure hurts
The first rule is win, the second's don't forget the first
I think the worst now behind us
Hello first-timers, it's welcome to one-liners
Question anything against the center of alignment
This rock ain't a diamond until it's polished up and shining
Decide to ride the retro minutes to the summit's peak
Others fall trying to climb it because their stomach weak
When we climbing in the summer heat
They throwing shade against the team when the others meet
Despite the ?
After this drops, nothing’s best kept but nothing’s secret
If nothing’s nothing, then what the fuck is getting even?
Just an odd man out, another duck in season
What’s yours is yours, what’s mines is mines
It seems as simple as it simply rhymes
I keep the simpleton spit in all the sympathy lines
I mean it’s Craig G rap came on symphony shines

Slay the Nazarene, you just fire water, I’m gasoline
It ain't A day in Philly if I don't pass a fiend
It’s blood everywhere, similar assassins seem
Purify the water, correlate the tour to a maccabee
You think that you could box a Vinnie? 
Dummy, that’s obscene
The nine milli, silly, dummy, but the mac is mean
The downstairs wild pretty, but the attic clean
You have unbearable lightness and just a lack of being
You ain’t built to shoot the fire with me, that’s the thing
I’m only after one thing, money, that’s the rings
I’m only after one head, money, that’s the king’s
A rack on a bigger rack and so he have to sing
I got an Ingraham Mac Eleven and it has a beam
And that’s a beautiful love there, it has a gleam
You wasn’t in a platoon, cousin, cause that was Shane
Old school, still loaded the guns with Vaseline

Selling the J dirty boogie, gray hoodie, hit the dougie
Pinky rings on racks of chicken nuggets
Shit’s like shooting fish in a bucket, damn the hummus
I’m in Japan for the summer, land the plane
Or Jamaica, black rain in the forecast
Four-four class, open a stolen Accord door and haul ass
Body disposed by Albanian doorman for four grand, aw man
I throw the lamb in the ground and leave it overnight
You ain’t ever seen this in your life
You ain’t used to being where I been to, Curly and my men do
You ain’t been through shit I been through
This is limited edition, 666 driven

Dear mama dropped them jewels that I never ran through
The most driven never sat up in the back seat
The most forgiven never flagging down a taxi
That’s my word if it’s meant to outgrow
Like I used to run home to catch the last of my show
Some move to the future other's living it slow
Old tunes trying to find where the memories flow
You know I try to chase ‘em down no dragon
Shit, they shot a Beatle, do people still imagine?
I think the world could be a better place
No fam but I still set a table and I said it's grace
I think I'll let you in my life all access
Gift and curses, cursive closed captions
Misinterpreting the passion
Saving face ain’t a game, ain’t a time for retractions
I learned one way then front the opposite
I learned behind the beat, now I learned on top of it
I do go against the grain
I do take bigger pictures that don’t fit in the frame

Dip the scriber in the inkwell
Thoughts sketch a snapshot
Vibrant check the detail, now the family eats well
Used to cut the mold off bricks for grilled cheese melts
Wandering the crumbling castle wondering how the things fell
Mansions and lap pools to sleeping on back pews
Pictures and statues where roaches and rats moved
Faithfully I've seen it all alive, and I’m grateful
With Curtis Mayfield singing “Just be Thankful”
Slapping loud out a glasshouse, pearl enamel tooth color
Seasoned old cats then the ragtop, roof covered
Nodded and they nodded back, respect acknowledged
Got a fine arts degree plus the streets are a college
California campus, I've studied abroad
Bloodied the canvas, pondering atlas, ""What if he shrugged?""
The rich lady asked, ""What if we thug?""
Humanity said ""I’m feeling drowsy what is the drug?""
Wake the team up, never alone but on my own two
Held the elevator, check the levels that we've grown through
Philanthropic maybe 'cause I did my dirt
There, I’m haunted, honestly I never fronted all is all I ever wanted
Keep an eye on hustlers, watch out for the schemers
No more kid gloves for the dreamers
Awake trying to live dreams physically, energy is extreme
Lessons of infinity are vivid on the big screen

I was getting buried alive
Heard the dirt hit the coffin top, I barely survived
But I broke through my grave ripped the pine box seal apart
Head first yelling “maggot break, funkadelic art”
Fear is a dark side fair-weather friends fly, Hitchcock
Same birds scatter when the end stop
Couple let their guards down, figure they was there for certain
Talking about “time to pull the plug and close the curtain”
Eyes wide, bug like, holy leaping Lazarus
I thought that y’all were, never mind, material still hazardous
Hazmat, clutching their chests like asthmatics
For mathematics, a natural dash of black magic
Salute to new voices flexing power advancing
The ballot’s a modern branding, classic sound clashing
Took heavy fire, survived the crash landing
Smiled to walk away from the wreckage, the last standing
They thought that it was gone for good
They figured it was good as gone

Devise a plan and I execute it ‘til I’m undisputed
If the record never stated, I’ve been showing most improvement
At a time where my peers declined, I used it as a booster
Used the dedication as a plus, I ain’t used to losers
Lock the randoms from the safe, then I change the combination
Then I set the pace and settle down, then I lay the conversation
Juvenile blind, made me think, is this a new beginning?
Kept an older frame of mind when I’ve been spraying all these feelings
So God bless us, cut from different cloths and different textures
Different walks of life, some act, some are directors
Some are extras, and those aren’t easy to find
And I ain’t easily defined, what’s fame? A thin line
I been thinking walking over the edge but keep blinking
Taking two steps back to my zone for no reason
Call it comfort, that is not the best for my heart
Not the best way to end and not the best way to start
Good as gone

I was out of mind and sight
Dark clouds all around me, trying to find the light
I took flight with the dot dot legs dangling
Cliff-hanging never docking my spot
I stand by what I say, ‘cause I’m easy to find
Dates posted every day of the year in bold lines
The more that I roam the more that I’m free
The more I’m in Rome the more that I’m me
The more I’m at home, the more that it’s stress
The moral is, we be touring it best
I’m not the same old run of the mill
Who keeps running until, the feet tell him “put the runners to rest”
I’ve seen the last come first
I’ve seen the first, last
I double majored in life
Some of the worse passed
Back to school learning secrets that the Earth had
Sat in coach and studied business before my first class

Lifting up what I don't touch, designer the same
In the line of fire is fortune and fame

From the Angel City politics
Heaven's what they call it, but there's angry spirits haunting it

Empty promises and COINTELPRO policy legacies put us all at risk
Punch the code in place where the passport's safe
The mind travels continents from L.A

On my block they said stacks are king
So once I got a couple stacks, I started packing things

Cutting through dark clouds even when the sky's grey
Dreaming even though we're wide awake

Say what's in your heart till the clock tics don't move
Between the hourglass sand I've been zoning on cruise
So check it out, a world premier and this my ""moment of truth""

The coldest road is now heating up the snow and the rain
Between the heavens till I'm boarding the plane

I'm miseducated, Lauryn Hill made it possible
Undo anything I've known becomes the obstacle
I'm trying to go blank and throw the old paintings out
Garage sale, Sunday when the rain is out
'Tis the season for no reason, time to let it go
I didn't smoke today cause everybody's on that medical
I'm on a schedule, maybe on a edible
And history is to repeat itself then it ain't set in stone

High as fuck, head in the clouds, I'm on that null and void
Control the substance of my language, when I laid it out I said it's dangerous
I said what goes around is coming back around in angles
Lord forgive my sins
From when the first one started till the last one ends
For every time I thought about sales and spins
Worship of a Benz and birds before friends
Was certain when I came until the game and still the same today
About the crowd I keep, sound the beats, about the moves I make
About the rules at stake
Moving with a jewel to take and still rock a gold chain
For Slick Rick the Ruler's sake

Never saying that I'm out of my league

Some fight to live, others settle for survival
It’s your world, you can write the line you live your life on
It’s heavy but you’re strong, just hold on until that light dawns
It’s started now, pardon me we’re partying
Escalating, redefining the state of the art again
Celebrated, elevators open up to secret floors
Different rules and secret laws, from the roof you’ll see the stars
Only fear boredom in a world of raw materials
Excited by potential, inspired by adventure
Calculated circles, circumference and radius

Energizing, on the darkest streets I shine
Saw the light up on the mountain, to the peak I climbed
Breathtaking new perspectives on the life I grind
First tear of joy fell, looking like I’m crying

Not needing a dollar or a cent

Will I ever be the same?
But you see the miles just fades away
When I dream of holding you
Relieve my breath a peculiar day
When time pass us by
But we'll stay
Yes we'll stay
And I wonder as I sit alone
See leaves building up a tree
I couldn't hear what the moon whispered today
But he lives in the sky you make
I will dream of holding you
There is nothing to lean on but the stars
I hope I'll find you
Wishing the same
When the roads are long

",We'll Stay,1997
Dilba,"So unconditional, my love you.
All heart and faith, angel you're so true.
Pure and white. II blend like stains,
Beside your light, that reveals my pain.
Never satisfied, but who dares to be,
Happy, well it seems not me. 

Though I used to be the one,
Who struggled for this moment to come.
I've always been the one who cryies
For love beyond life. 

Grandmas sight in black coffee
Or read my palm, just say that Ill be happy
Wedding-dress in red, someone like you
And your Kurdish princess
Swears you to be true. 

Don't you know I'm usually the one
Who struggle for this moment to come
Don't you know it is in my blood to cry,
For love beyond this life.",Beyond Life,1999
Dilba,"So many things to do
I should run,
Oh no,
I missed my bus again
Ill make it up to
you next time 

So many people to see,
and I just stopped
To get the keys or something,
but damn, I forgot,
Let me have. 

Only a couple of minutes
where I'm blessed here in
the arms of god
Maybe just a few more seconds
where there is just me and I
Only a couple of minutes when
I rest here in the arms of god
Maybe just a few more seconds
where is just, me and I 

I want be present,
but still in time
To discover the mood right now.
can't help but wanting to
stay a while
And to enjoy this moment
by my self tonight 

I want to:
Move a little
play around
dance just a little and maybe
sing something nice.",A Couple of Minutes,1999
Dilba,"As I taste the thought of you
The lights slowly changes
Just like this morning,
I'm doomed
To see the birth of this morning
Through a hounded phases 

If I only knew,
Your thoughts,
Then baby I would be
Your bravest
But for now, what's only true,
Is to await a greater day 

Mysteries of tomorrow,
While sunshine brakes through
It's time for a dream,
So dreams and time Ill borrow,
While awaiting the love
Of you",Meanwhile (A Greater Day),1999
Dilba,"No one is leaving here
Not until we get this clear
I'm tired of all your accusations
I'm tired of all this pain

Loosing all that I hold dear
I demand, that you sit down and hear.
You tell me that I'm untrue
That I'm breaking your heart in two

You've had enough of my excuses
You say you're getting out
But I haven't had my say
It won't hurt you to wait one more day

See I don't have your strength anymore
I don't feel that strong anymore
I don't have your strength anymore
Can't hold back my tears anymore

No one loves you as I
But my tears are silent and dry
Through all my counting downs
Plus and minus was never none

And now you want to share your precious time
Though it hurts me, I still think we should try
But I don't have you strength anymore
Can't even feel tour pain anymore

I don't feel that strong anymore
Can't hold back my tears anymore
No one is leaving now
Not until we've worked this out",No One Is Leaving,1999
Dilba,"Words I never said
I never shared , with anyone
And things I never did,
We should have done,
Though we never did. 

Its all with me now
Born within the love we shared
To late, but somehow
In some way it all remains
Like tonight when all
Those never said and dones
Makes me think that
You where the one 

You love me, so now
Please let go of me
If that is how your
Story is supposed to go
All I never knew
Feels like nothing
Compared to missing you",The One,1999
Dilba,"I love it, when you blush
Too shy to look me straight in the eyes
And you are blessed with the worlds sweetest smile
I don't want to do wrong, but I can't hide

Darling I, sometimes forget
And then I do things I regret
Will do right and only my best
But I'm not perfect 

Its like a hug, you know when, its been held on ""a bit to long""
Its like that kiss , that I'm sure you dreamed of
It is all my best wishes gathered in this song
Its about thinking right and doing wrong

When I smile, though I feel like crying
Its not the time , I say, though I know I'm lying
Wish I could hold you but I can't stand being held 

I really do my best and only my best
But I'm not perfect",Perfect,1999
Dilba,"We've gone too far now
Too far my eyes just can't see
How we passably make love now
And despite the circumstances
I love you dear
You hurt me and make me cry
You leave me one million times
But when you need me, you know I will be down
And you haunt me when you're not around 

What kind of love is this,
When we both hide behind our fences
You want to be with me,
But you won't take your chances
What kind of love is this, is it enemy or shelter
Rejecting or tracing me, when you say,
Things will get better.
It better 

If I'm your star dear,
Then my force should be in your plans
Because your my universe dear,
So my heart belong in your hands
Go on and hurt me and make me cry
Leave me, one million times
You know you need me and
You know you're mine so why don't you just
Love and let the sun smile",What Kind of Love Is This,1999
Dilba,"Memories of long ago
are slowly coming back to me.
The bright once was buried
underneath the darkness
Thought I was born to witness
my own heartless destiny,
Til I discovered love and so I
left the loveless and their kingdom,
And now its 

You and I
You and I,
no more running,
no more chasing shadows.
just you and I 

I'm done with sadness,
and I'm so glad its over.
This little girl grew up and
became a woman
At first I was afraid,
but now I'm glad I got to knew her
Because the girl kissed frogs and the
lady met a man and that's why I am
So glad its 

Memories of long ago
are slowly coming back to me",You and I,1999
Dilba,"Bored I was! Tired of getting less of what I gave
Oh, what a mess When something is missing, and you don't know what it is
Suddenly everything is here, when I tell you this
From that day I felt for sure, that I could die for another kiss 

Because You are The dream I didn't dare to dream The things I didn't said
The thoughts I never shared The love I never had
The smiles they never read And the eyes that never met
Now you are, you are, you're mine. 

In my mind The stains are gone and someone else, free from my self
My souls got no control, but that's OK
Suddenly everything is here, when I tell you this
From that day I felt for sure, that I could die for another kiss 

Because You are The dream I didn't dare to dream The things I didn't said
The thoughts I never shared The love I never had
The smiles they never read And the eyes that never met
Now you are, you are, you're mine. 

My love, the future is a mystery I know. But well be fine.
Because right now stops, all those times
What wasn't then, is here right now and what will come
Never mind because you are, you are the one. 

And you are. The dream I dare to dream And the things I start to say
Well the thoughts I share with you is, for the love I never had
And the thoughts I share with you is for the love I never had
And the smile they never read And the eyes that never met
Now you are mine",You Are,1999

Dillon Fence,"All of the nights when the light was low and day seemed so far away
Darkness was endless and I kept seeing ghosts turn in shades of gray
I wanted to see things just the way they used to be
Don't want those shadows hanging over me

[Chorus]
Daylight, I want to see daylight
want to see daylight that shines all around
Daylight, I want to see clear blue light
want to see daylight that shines all around

Hours and hours in towers on the back road of tragedy
Voices are calling and fingers come on crawling all over me
Then when I sit up and my hands begin to shake
Suddenly there I see the dawn break

[Chorus]

Only one thing keeping me sane, oh

[Chorus]",Daylight,1992
Dillon Fence,"I look into the mirror
I see you stare me down
Poor poor lonely
Get up off the ground

You hide in all your drawings
Think that they will see
Poor poor lonely
Why can't you let it be

Why can't you let it be
Your listening to them talking
Is making your ears burn
Poor poor lonely

Why can't you wait your turn
'Cause your train of thought is leaving
And you want to go
Poor poor lonely

You're too afraid to know
You're too afraid to know
So you jump into the water
To wash off your regret

Poor poor lonely
You aren't even wet
Can you move it forward
Can you make a sound

Yo
Alright let me just cool this right now quickly

Super trippy riding through the gritty inner city roll with the committee
Handle your business or handle the pity all I see is lots of titties
I know bunch of hippie chicks that's ready to show me tricks
They doing the splits I'm all up in the mix, a choir out the mist
I'm taking trips, I'm in the Ferrari looking sick, I'm in the Ferrari looking slick
Letting the engine rip and getting a tire
A' grippin' ah slippin' and slidin'
Turning the music up I'm vibing now I'm flying
Lord strap me if I'm lying I ain't perfect but I'm trying
Going super sire and buying anything that catches my eye
Cause I'm a provider getting it in from here to China
It's so minor I'm a survivor, never retire
I'm a black tiger ready to blaze to the fire, live wire
Now I'm rolling through the shires blazing the green to get me higher
Now I'm inspired putting the pressure on the back tires
Making a hasty get away having a better day in every way
Than yesterday, I guess there’s nothing left to say

Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)

Wind in my face, chilling in Versace shades
Wearing a fresh pair of gaze looking like car just been paid
Stupid I don’t play no games switching out lanes on these lames
Switching out dames simple and plain
No I can't be contained plus I'm raw and untamed
I'm so far from mundane getting ghost is my aim
I suggest you do the same taking a trip out to Spain
With my girl Mary Jane and she stays on my brain
Like a big gravy train paparazzi on my case
Giving chase cameras flashing in my face
All up in my space gotta pick up the pace
Singing amazing grace I'm in an amazing place
With crazy papes, I ain't like them other lazy apes
I used to blaze the tapes so now I stays hoping for my break
Making no mistakes now I rolling with the breaks
But still book time for my original mates
So we don't bubble with hate we just get on with it
You brothers are constipated and your shit is over rated
You should save it

I have all the hoes on my pelvis
'Cause I look like black Elvis

I be sonic, I can do it like it was a bigamic
Part of my body get level to me and get speed
Like I was electronic
The crows and rocking beat off the chain
And the party be mad decent
Come and fall through see the weather
We chilling but we kill them whatever you have recent
It's difficult with all the led beefin'
Just come in and follow the twista
Got hundreds of bottles of liquor
With hundreds of models and niggas
And I'm rollin with them
Like dillon francis I'm stuntin on them
Kill 'em chances no walking hold 'em
I'ma go in the club and tell them we up
I be with a little bit of hoes when I brawl
Every party when we in the house
We got put my feet on the couch
They go see me and they shout
We gon get wild like ign them out
While wig in they mouth
Doing whatever that we wanna do
When we get to everybody fall back
And if you ever come asking me how was the party

With a charm on it, when I make in a flick
Up with a bad bitch I wanna crawl that
And I blowing the flame in the big truck
Give it to the mob that I picked up
Blowing a blob before I go in the club
And I feel they wanna get my dick sucked
Look at the haters, I call on them
Get drunk and I fall on them
Lift up by my designer jeans
And my phone parts as I ball on them
Throw on a party get ratchet
Then I make a toast I hope it don't stop
Too many hoes I don't want no drama
Even though I got the toast I hope I don't pop
And I've got a bag of money, come and show me
That you work the crime up, all the way to the top
And when I drop it gonna twerk it
I'ma throw it and crush it and when it's over I take them all of that
And when she ask me what I want I'ma look at the fatty

That's what's botherin' me, ma 'cause you're goin' on different
And I ain't never seen you loved up like this before
Why's it everybody but you who can see that you deserve more?

Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that

When I first met him, thought he was cool
Had a few things in common like supporting Arsenal
I saw the way he made you happy like a love fool
Coming down when times were hard up stressful

But all that don't matter to shit
When he starts acting like a little kid
Treating you as if you was some kind of bitch

Mama, you ain't rich but stills he borrows your money
And never pays you back
'Cus any penny he gets, he spends on that bad habit

Fuckin' takes the piss bringin' that slut in to our house
Is the ultimate diss
Now I know you threw him out for that
But how long is it gonna be before you take him back?
Mama, know you're lonely but you're the only

One who can't see that this bloke is a phoney
And he don't really care bout ya, mum
He just says he does 'cus he fuckin' thinks ya dumb

Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that

My mama loves a crack head?
Is that what I'm supposed to tell my friends?
When they ask me how I'm doing, am I supposed to pretend?
Act like there's nothing's wrong when there blame there is
Turn the other cheek when he's takin' the piss

Fuck that that's not how the man of the house acts
I gotta defend my territory, guard my patch
When I know he's doing doggy shit behind your back
Put my foot down, stand my ground and that

This has got to stop whether the guy buns crack or not
His head ain't there he's fuckin' lost the plot
Dead and buried is the act phrase can't even act right
Can't even act his age that's so fuckin' lame
Thirty something years old, he should feel ashamed

If I was him, I'd slit my my veins at the mains
In a lukewarm bath and sit in it till my arteries drain
Do it right this time so I don't have to do it again
Cause there's nothing more pathetic than a cry for help

Either you do or you don't, wanna kill ya self
Everybody knows you got a problem so it don't matter if you admit it
But what you gotta do is be a man 'n' fuckin' deal with it

I know the truth hurts, mama
But this shit gotta be said
He don't love you, he never has and that's a fact
The only thing he really loves in this world is crack

Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that, no

I can't go for that, no, no can do

I can't go for that",Mama,2008

Cause it's a thin line
Between love and gate

I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
And now it's time to let you know what's up

Come over
Cause of the cold and rainy weather""

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you-whoahhha-ohh-yeah

I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want right
The lovin' that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb

You curve thoughtways when you're handlin' the candleabra
So you sittin' on the baby grand
Transmittin' like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that

[Unverified]

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together no pepperoni
Yeah, you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora

Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with reppin' for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claimin' never been gone
Niggaz who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some [unverified] to dial)

Yeah, I give that ass a number and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick
(Or show me lovin' by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shakin' my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all

Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan

You see them kids be schemin' on what we done copped
Always out there schemin'
They steady fiendin' for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiendin'?

Your people might have your back
But you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothin' guaranteed
That's the truth, things ain't goin' like you think they should

A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Aight then, here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here, keep a clear head

Tryin' to keep my pockets on stuffed like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't faze
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me

Dimitri Tiomkin,"In the southern part of Texas
In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins that the weeds have overgrown
You may look in vain for crosses and you'll never see a-one
But sometimes between the setting and the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marching by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky.

Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for.

Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
""Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo.""
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free.

Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo.

""You may ne'er see your loved ones,""
Travis told them that day
""Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay.""

In the sand he drew a line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line
With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancing
On a horse that was black as the night.

Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousing rebel yell
Santa Anna turned scarlet
""Play deguello!"" he roared
""I will show them no quarter
Every one will be put to the sword!""

One hundred and eighty five
Holding back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again
Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were coming
Never came, never came, never came...

Twice he charged and blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed 'em, one and all
Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers...

Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...
In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone
And he sees the cattle grazing where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazing and the cannons used to roar
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly...

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which 
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Dimitri Vassilakis,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Johannes Brahms is often mentioned 
In the same breath as Bach and Beethoven

These models inspired him 
To write some of the greatest music
Of the romantic era

Once during a rehearsal 
Brahms said with great conviction:
Gentlemen
I'm not Beethoven
But I am Johannes Brahms

Phat Brahms

To revel and feast in undelivered grace

Pledged to judgmental arrogance in drawn principles of ignorant falsehood
To comprehend that the sin of life is life itself, a tyranny in torment, an inner-sanctum stealing sleep

So sinner, mourn well
Make all the swans suffer in hell

In the dimness surrounding the towers of the castle where the reavens spread their wings out wide
Dwell in depths of the darker self at any shore of infinity and watch the relentless paint the soil black
What is being formed echoes throughout eternity as the painter chooses color no more

The venomous tongue - The inevitable poison - Paralyze the angels
Freeze the forgiven - Baptize in fire - Unleash the devil at heart

As the days of mourning seem to be the days of joy
Fragments fell from the sky in order to penetrate the eyes

",Perfection or Vanity,2001
Dimmu Borgir,"Let chaos entwine on defenseless soil
Remove errors of man and sweep all the weakening kind

I am war, I am pain
I am all you've ever slain
I am tears in your eyes
I am grief, I am lies

Bygone are tolerance and presence of grace
Scavengers are set out to cleanse the human filth parade

I am pure, I am true
I am all over you
I am laugh, I am smile
I am the earth defiled

I am the tiny worms
I am fear in the night
I am bringer of light",Puritania,2001

Cloaked by darkness
The thundering echoes of great destruction to come
Mankind's mysteries
The dying world

[Chorus]
Madness in it's sweetest form
What shrivels and dies must face the tempest
The angelic heaven bows to the ultimate truth
And melancholy grew

Anticipation mender through madness
Condemned to the same horrid fate
Insanity applauds
How sharp the awakening
Pale as disease
Mocking, maddeningâ?¦
Give up the ghost
Cease the gloomy awakening

History foretold
The hidden stigmata
Totally annihilating the ecstasies innumerable
Materialize the vision
Give up the ghost
Cease the gloomy awakening",Sympozium,2001

",Fear and Wonder,2001
Dimmu Borgir,"Cuddled through a cold womb he was 
Pitch black and without sunshine rays 
Hell patiently awaiting him on blood spilled soil 
A noble grief stirred heart, always ready to die

In sinister systematisation, submission is golden 
As an apprentice to violence, slaughter and bloodshed 
He was like an object that is being processed 
A force-fed destructor ready for abomination

The vast solitude in him witnessed it all 
Those self afflicting eyes
And their fear painted faces 
Made out of utter discipline, failure unacceptable 
Hosts to oblivion
Exploring the darkest of places 
Stench of rotten flesh breathing down his neck

Every day seemed like an endless night 
When would he ever wake from this void 
No other voice than his own will ever tell
What was real and where he had been 
What he had done

Did you bleed for the cause 
Like the rest of his men 
Did you capture the euphoria 
How it was like to kill
Such a necromantic force behind it all 
They sure did battle till the end

But when came all the glory 
And who got spared to carry his body 
Just pure death and too profound to be shared 
Was it all a fabricated vision in his memory
To serve the wastelands of insanity 
At the front

Life forever lost its innocence 
Never to see the light of day again 
He pondered his last few steps
Into the realms of death 
With his hands bloodstained

Bravery and valor 
Honor and pride 
For what was it all worth

Dimmu Borgir,"Man and his faithful ethics 
Intoxicated by the fruits of the earth 
Diabolical fanatikism, so cold and grim 
The perfect perversion, bestiality incarnate

As instruments of torture 
And leaving no room for sympathy 
We bring forth the monstrous birth 
To the worlds light

As all great art is made from suffering 
So are we 
Good in nature, but evil by our own free will 
Incestuously created by the will to kill

Time is here to walk the final abyss march 
Bound to the force of the last holocaust 
Pour free the gifts of grace 
And slaughter the entire human race

Not permitted to redemption 
When pain rises high in purgatory 
A reality so convincingly justified 
Feeding from Death Cult's gown

We bring forth monstrous birth 
To the worlds light",Blood Hunger Doctrine,2003
Dimmu Borgir,"Are you born from the abyss
And have you sought the creed 
That drape the shadows
Of your own thought?

Is your heart mesmerized 
By the fire that burns forevermore
And do the secrets from the flames 
Hold the mysteries over which you preside?

Reveal the infantile wound and regain strength 
Free your spirit from those who lead in praise 
Recollect the anger and the hate 
For not shall your morals dissolve in pity

Righteous warmth accompanied 
By deceitful tongues 
Stay away from processed promises 
Let them fear what you know 
A malicious smile on their lips 
To keep us all under control 
Now it's time to rise and demand our due 
The whores and their illusions left us bitter and cold

Drench them in their own poison, spit back the scorn of their ways 
Out win their defect morality, and the words they pray 
Consolidate the troops and expose the lies in their eyes 
The ones deprived from the ecstasy that binds the neglect

Better lead than being led, earn any victory 
For you stand superior above the plague and it's mass 
The burden of proof rests on your shoulders

Are you born from the abyss
And have you sought the creed 
That drape the shadows

Dimmu Borgir,"As mortal manufactured waste
And part of the commonly infected
You prevent the ones worthy the gift of life 
To surface on once a prosperous soil

As superficially bewildered whores 
And succumbing to fictional truth
You are taught to preserve and profit 
The life institutional lie

You worthless piece of shit 
May we all depart from this world 
And dissolve into nothingness 
Compassion will not be granted 
When life's value 
Is point below zero

Human depravity is at our disposal 
As the perfect tool to destroy mankind 
The worst kind of them all 
Modern times' ignorance, the world disease
Appeal to death of every man

A living hate smoldering abyss
Nurtured through centuries with quietly exercised wrath 
Seeks the easiest way to the feed the engine 
Praising the final bloodbath

Uncertainty and guilt 
Will no longer endorse our fate 
There will be no remorse, we kill to kill again 
Killing all

Go ahead end it all, we deserve no better 
As a forever unblessed detonation 
The great plutonium chord fulminates 
Blinding the eyes of creation

Cutting off all life support
Sweeping away existence instantly 
Iced desolate ruins linger 
Leaving traces of our lovely humanity

Death and destruction's devotees revel

Into the arms of Armageddon
Let it pour, more and more

Dimmu Borgir,"Devoted to your own opiate 
In escapades from discontent 
Are you shutting off from the outside world 
To reflect on your mind shallow gutter?

For this is your empire, this is your intrigue 
Here you own them all, here you seal the deed

Contaminated from the spree of self salvation 
To keep the fever flowing in the veins 
Prominently manipulating heaven and hell 
Does your sophistically discreet interlude 
Maintain stories not to be revealed?

In your search for redemption 
Greed and lies become the savior 
Through the lecherous eyes disgust withstand

Repeatedly unlocking the vaults to the holocaust

Dina Carroll,"Ring out the old 
Bring in the new 
A midnight wish to share with you 
Your lips are warm, my head is light 
Were we in love before tonight? 

I don't need a crowded ballroom 
Everything I need is here, if you're with me 
Next year will be the perfect year 

No need to hear the music play 
Your eyes say all there is to say 
The stars can fade 
And they can shine 
Long as your face is next to mine 

I don't need a crowded ballroom 
Everything I need is here, if you're with me 
Next year will be the perfect year 

We don't need a crowded ballroom 
Everything I need is here, if you're with me

Dina Carroll,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

It seems like yesterday in September 

We started off as the best of friends 
No intention of falling in love again

My heart was set free 
What a sweet memory

The day I fell in love 
It was so beautiful 
His hands, his tender touch 
I remember the day in September 
When we fell in love 

It was an unexpected night 
The sun was somewhere, but out of sight 
So familiar, yet unexplored and new 
We surrendered to our love in bloom

You make it all worthwhile

In all kinds of foreign lands

Baby the best is yet to come

They don't understand
Just what it is
That we have found

Well I don't care what they say
I've made up my mind anyway

And I wouldn't change it for anything

That we spend together
And I love the things
That you say to me
When we're alone
There isn't any doubt
In the way I'm feeling
And I hope the way
That I'm feeling now
Will never go

Desire was to strong to put up a fight
I don't understand the way I feel although it feels so right
I really shouldn't be here tonight

In your eyes there's a sign of intensity
I sense an atmosphere 
No need to hide from the way that you feel inside
There's nothin' left to fear

If only for tonight (don't be a stranger)
I want to take this chance risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight (don't be a stranger)

Your on my mind all of the time
I really shouldn't stay with you tonight 
But the more and more I think of it
The more it just seems right
I really shouldn't be here tonight

Now I find I don't know who I really am 
I'm lost without a trace
So take me high take me low 
Anyhow you know
And help me if you can

Why I don't know I'm into deep to say no
Hold me close don't let me go

Dina Rae,"Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
(Aight, guess what? I ain't coming in yet
I'm come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this)

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
(Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so)

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no""
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, ""Yo, what the fuck we do?""
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably going
To catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm going to try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no""
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no""
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay

Cause they realize that niggaz do shoot
Don't like a chick that act too cute

And don't be askin me, all kind of questions
All harassin me, callin stressin

And the cactus hurts my toes

Dinah Shore,"I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day, father started digging in a field, hoping to find some soil
He dug and he dug and, what do you think?

The money rolled in and I rolled out
With a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination

What it takes to make 'em gel

When they had an axe to grind
They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostest on the ball

I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes round
If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you, all you need
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostest on the ball

Entertaining vodka drinkers
Is a job they give to me
Making nice guys out of stinkers
Seems to be my cup of tea
What they really need behind the iron wall
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

There's a book of regulations 
As to who sits next to who
But there might be complications
When the blue blood's not so blue
So the priestess with the leastest protocol
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

An ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves
He can come and let his hair down, ooh!
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall

Nor the hostess with the mostest

You made me glad, I made you sad
I made you lonesome and blue

Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you

Dinah Shore,"Everybody's mambo crazy
Cha-cha happy, but I'm lazy
I don't dig that frantic turpsichord

When I trip the light fantastic
I don't wanna be gymnastic
That's not what a dancing floor is for

What I got in mind is a big improvement
With a very minimum amount of movement
Let the other couples push and shove
What I got in mind I think you're gonna love

I got a new-fangled tango
And there's nothing to it
You just sort of stand there
And just sort of do it

You stand close together
There's no wasted motion
A new fangled tango
An old fashioned motion

The floor may be crowded
But that doesn't matter
It's not necessary to move
Don't move, why move

It may be crowded
But that's all the better
It's just like romancing, while dancing
Who's dancin'

You start off with one step
And cling to each other
And you know how one step
Can lead to another

Oh, there's nothing wrong with
A waltz or fandango
But oh, what can come from
A new fangled tango

You cling to your partner
And sway to the rhythm
You can't lose your partner
'Cause you're right there with him

You don't have to be worry
About fast or slow steps
The nice part about it
In this dance, you don't need steps

You don't have to worry
If your dancing won't do
It's not what you do do
It's more what you don't do

You don't need a waltz
Or a fancy fandango
You just need a man
And a new fangled tango

Forget the fandango
Give up the mambo
Do the tango",New-Fangled Tango,1992

Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay,
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Born is the King of Israel!

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie:
One entered in then for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty:
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense.

Mankind hath bought.

Dinah Shore,"O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.

You and the song are gone

Dinah Shore,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

He's not worth fighting for
Besides, there's plenty more where he came from

And he can just return where he came from

I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies, one for every year
So you see

I don't wan' him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't wan' him
For he's not the man for me

I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers, and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed
So you see

I don't wan' him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't wan' him

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street cafÃ¢??

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

And those who danced at night and kept our Paris bright

Can anyone explain the wonder of love 
No! No! No!
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh

I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I think it's marvellous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell
Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces

You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

You said that Edison would never make that light
You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite

Dinah Shore,"I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
And send him on his way.

I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms.
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,
And send him on his way.

Don't try to patch it up.
Tear it up, tear it up!
Wash him out, dry him out.
Push him out, fly him out.
Cancel him and let him go!
Yeah, sister!

I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,

If a man don't understand you,
If you fly on separate beams,
Waste no time, make a change,
Ride that man right off your range.
Rub him out of the roll call,
And drum him out of your dreams.

If you laugh at different comics,
If you root for different teams,
Waste no time, weep no more,
Show him what the door is for.
Rub him out of the roll call,
And drum him out of your dreams.

Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm gonna rub, wash, wave, rub

Dinah Shore,"Though we're called a people of serious mind,
'Tis often we dance, 'tis often we sing.

And bein' as human as all human-kind,
We arrren't superior to havin' a fling.

I'm taking the fling of a lifetime.

The fling of a husband and wife-time.

A-when I a-went rrromancing
I a-gave no thought to any wedding rrring.
Every bonnie lassie was
My highland fling.

A-no chance was I chancing
I' a-m not the man ya dangle on a strrring.
I was canny waitin' for the
Rrreal, rrreal thing.

A-though I danced each girrrl in a twist and a-twirrrl
Ney one would do.
And I went a-my way 'til the fatal day
In the fling I was flung a-with you.
Ohhhh

Now my hearrrt is prancin'
A-gay as a larrrk and happy as a king.
The yearrrs I'll weatherrr, in the hame on the heatherrr,
With my one and only highland fling.

I thought you werrre fallin' for Andy MacPherson.

Ney, ney. He became an impossible person.
But what about you and that Connie MacKenzie?

She talked when I putted and drrrove me to frenzie.
But what of the lad known as Bobby MacDougal?

It pays to be thrifty, but he was too frugal.
And werrren't ya daft about Megan McDerrmot?

I tasted her cooking. T'would make me a hermit.
How jealous I was of McDonald McCutcheon.

His neck had a head on, but therrre wasn't much in.

And what about Sandy?

His hands were too handy.
And wasn't therrre a Jenny?

I'm not wantin' any
I'm not wantin' any but you.

When I went a-dancin'
No special lad I was encourrragin'.
Every lackly laddie was
My highland fling.

No glance I was glancin'.
Well, nothin' rrreally worth a-mentionin'.
Hopin', watchin', waitin' for the
Rrreal, rrreal thing.

Though they spoke me soft in the moonlit oft',
Ney one would do.
'Til it came to pass to this lucky lass
In a fling I was flung with you.
Oh...

Now my hearrrt is prrrancin'.
Nothin' about ya I'd be alterin'.
The yearrrs I'll weatherrr, in the hame on the heatherrr,
With me one and only highland fling.",My One and Only Highland Fling,1998
