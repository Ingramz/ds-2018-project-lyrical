Moby,"Where were you when I was lonesome
Locked away in this freezing cold
Someone flying, only stolen,
I can't tell, this night's so old,

I don't want to swim the ocean,
I don't want to fight the tide,
I don't want to swim forever,
When it's cold I'd like to die.

What was that, my sweet sweet nothing
I can't hear you through the fog
If I holler let me go
If I falter let me know

I don't want to swim the ocean,
I don't want to fight the tide,
I don't want to swim forever,
When it's cold I'd like to die.

I don't want to swim forever,
I don't want to fight the tide,
I don't want to swim the ocean,
When it's cold I'd like to die.",When It's Cold I'd Like to Die,1995
Moby,"Oh, come and take me away,
Oh, 'cause everything is wrong today,
Look to the east, there are colors in the sky
The sun and the flames, and tho I started to cry

'Cause every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born
Every time you touch me I feel like I need some more
Love's so high, never feeling bad,
Used to be alone now I feel so glad,
Every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born

Anytime you need some peace
Come along and stay with me
The forest burns, there are fires in the sky

'Cause every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born
Every time you touch me I feel like I need some more
Love's so high, never feeling bad,
Used to be alone now I feel so glad,
'Cause every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born

Want time in your fist, you got to be free
Want time in your fist, now come stay with me
Cause I pull it to the left
Pull it to the right
Mass this song wid dem dat uptight
Want everybody just feel alright
Mass it 'course to make you excite

'Cause every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born
Every time you touch me I feel like I need some more
Love's so high, never feeling bad,
Used to be alone now I feel so glad,
Every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born",Everytime You Touch Me [Beatmaster's Dub],1995
Moby,"Now close your eyes and relax
Feel the warmth of the sun
And imagine yourself as a beautiful dolphin

You are swimming and playing in the vast ocean
You sail up and over the waves, glistening in the warm sun
And snapping your strong tail

Now you're going deep, swimming and exploring
The wonders of the mighty sea
Schools of brightly colored fish and banks of coral
All illuminated by the blue light of the underwater sun

There in the distance you see a vast school of fast Tuna
And you start to chase them
And suddenly you're caught in a drift net
Laid by commercial fisherman and you start to panic

",Everytime You Touch Me [Progressive Edit Mix],1995
Moby,"I told you lady
Take me for one day

Get down
Can you make my love console myself
Could've broken with no-one else

I was so a fear, but I know that life was everything
Love was a one-time thing
But I only brought my hand to my knife when I sing
Love, make it dog-style

Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby

Love myself with a broken-hearted love
What I never saw what do I care?
You don't want a sick celebration love
Think about a broken time was soulless
And oh and I was fear and I was on my knees
You gonna tell me, would you break my love you're stealing my love

Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby

Love come on baby
Come on baby

Let me feel my gift to god grow
And I love one time when your life goes suck
And you did it with an open heart now
I feel it, I am awake 'till my only time

Want to go down so you can wake up tired
I was holding my
And I was looking for something else, but I want love
Come on baby

Love come on baby

Broken darkness my cold end 
I look for places I've never seen

Isolated walking long hard hours 
Winter cold just brings me winter showers 
It's so brutal with the cold sky 
Wrapped in cold late at night

Come clean  there's no sun yet 
The only lights here are made 
I can't speak, I can't hear, but I know I'm real

You remember the sun but it sank 
In the water that eats the light

Moby,"Thick black soul
Moving slow, moving close to you
This life I don't know
It seems kinda sick to me
Hold each other tight
Walking through to our destiny
This glitter in my eye
Catches light catches sympathy
This glitter in my eye
Catches light catches sympathy

Stars are falling but you still feel the same way

What is real
Is believing

That help me out late at night

Dirty basements, dirty noise
Dirty places coming through

And closed my world and never opened

I had to close down everything
I had to close down my mind

Too much can make me blind

So many heartaches, so many faces

A gateway to hope
Just like a feeling
I need, it's no joke

And though it hurts me
To see you this way
They traded by words
I'd never heard
To hard to say them

Up, down, turn around; please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I walk alone to find my soul desire to go home

Up, down, turn around; please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I walk alone to find my soul desire to go home

Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time

Each way I turn
I know I'll always try
To break the circle
That has been placed round me

From time to time
I find our lost
Meaning
That was urgent

To myself
I don't believe

Oh, up, down, turn around; please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I walk alone to find my soul desire to go home

Oh, up, down, turn around; please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I walk alone to find my soul desire to go home

Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time

And I've never met anyone quite like you before

And I've never met anyone quite like you before

And closed my world and never opened

With padded rooms like a sofa
They told me it's for my hova
My voices on my shoulder

Let the vultures divulgin'
To keep revolvin' the spot
Works on my focus
My culture, but no one knows it

Walking across the ocean explosives with co-motive I'm hopeless

I will always stay
Till all this light

Slaughtered like Gods
When the silver shines so hard

Thought I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
I used to cry like a clown

And the heavens burn

Moby,"Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mind

From a broken bough
Fall into finite space
With the roof torn down
This house is an empty place
So tired of wandering around and starting over
No garden grows here now just the one leaf clover
And when the windows shuttered
It’s always dark inside
Sometimes the pain is absurd
Still it’s what fate decides
Thought I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
I used to cry like a clown
And now I’m older

Here come the lonely night
Can’t escape my mind

And the grinding wheel turns
And the heavens burn
As the pilot ignites is a lesson learned
A sullen look of concern
It might make you sad
Like the fluttering bird in a dream you had

Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mind

I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
Once I cried like a clown
Now I’m older

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

Walk over bones in a laundromat
Holding onto ghosts as a portion of war
I'm seeing, and I'm waking and I'm propping them up
Echoing the love for a machine of war
Dying in the tremors of the home anymore
I want to walk into a night where I was open to care
I would've walked forever just to wake up there

Pushed to the limit of a living was there

Y'all car hoppin', cause now we got it locked and
We dedicate for ya'll feather weight

I'm the same cat from the same tracks
That hadda bring crack when you played that
When I spit move way back, you get sprayed at
I write my own shit bitch, can you say that?

[Chorus 1: Missy]
A lot of y'all MC's talk mo' shit
Talkin' bout hits and all the whips you dip
I know most of y'all rappers live dead broke
I go to your accountant and he say, ""No dough""
Rappin''bout the weed and you can't even roll
If I blow you a gun nigga, can you smoke?
Why you gotta front when you whack as shit
Me and Mocha, we ain't braggin' bitch
I ain't gotta rap about the dough I hold
And I ain't 'bout to talk about the cars I drove
And I ain't gotta front about the shows I blow
Turn on your radio, see me control

[Mocha]
It's best that thee put on the bets wit' me
And testin' me? I hit your chest wit' three
Let's make it clear that we gon' take it there
The way it appears, there ain't a club shakin' rears
Mocha here, call me the richest chick
With the thickest chips, and the quickest whip
Get a grip, why can't you try wit' me
Dumb variety, I get it done lively

[Chorus 2: Nicole]
My rhymes, they like
They really, really like

And if you do, then you've been practicing
And no one even told you who I was
Well I'ma set it off, show you who I am

And while you sleep I snatch out all ya teeth

Se tu volessi il blu, della notte che più
Ti piace io non esiterei a cercare
Due ali per volare, volare fin lassù
Per prenderti quel blu, e poi tornare giù

Che meriti piu' di quello che
Che un uomo come me,vorrebbe dare a te
Ma non e' escluso che,io cambiero' per te
Se il temporale poi, verrà a cercarti per
Portare la tristezza dentro te allora
Io più in alto volerò,I tuoni vincerò
Sole diventerò e ti sorriderò

Vorrei darti di più,di quello che non ho
Vorrei poterti entrare dentro al cuore in modo che
Che quello che vuoi te,che quello che non c'è
Lo cerco dentro me e lo regalo a te

Per dare un senso alle nuvole

Cosa vuol dire vivere
Se poi bisogna piangere
Ditemi che cosa devo fare
Per stare sopra una nuvola

Per cercare le parole, le parole per una canzone
E le note per uno spartito
Voglio scrivere agli angeli

Sognatrice per una notte
Tu che meriti bene 
Tu che stanotte tremavi
Mi ascoltavi e sognavi
Sognavi un angelo 
Che ti accarezzava e il mondo che spariva
Volevi solo quella panchina 
E quell'aria che ci sfiorava

Io parlavo fumavo e tu mi ascoltavi 
Ma senza parlare
E sapevi anzi pensavi che fosse finzione
Ma non sapevi 
E non immaginavi quanto eri

Bambola fragile e bella
Sul tuo naso una perla
Somigliava a una stella
Ma tu che ne sai di me
Di quello che ho visto e che ho fatto
Ma stanotte tu no tu non vuoi saperlo
Vuoi sognare un momento
Anche un piccolo istante
E pensare al presente
Cancellare il mio dentro
E farti tuo per un solo momento.

Poi ad un tratto sospiri mi guardi 
E provi a parlare
Ma hai paura di dar fine al tuo sogno

Ma non t'interessa vuoi scoprire 
Che cosa stai vivendo
E dici domani non ricorderai più niente 
Sei solo un sognatore

E io ti sposto I capelli e ti rispondo 
Che chi non sogna non fa sognare 
E che stanotte scriverò per te 
Dolce bambola sognatrice di una notte.
Ed eccomi qui come promesso cercando brividi ed emozioni 
Che possano farti tremare e poi 
E poi scaldare il tuo fragile corpo ch'è così bello 
Da accarezzare da proteggere e amare
Bambola dove sei 
Voglio averti 
Ma a quest'ora dormirai e riposerai

Questa notte di vento di odori e di colori strani
Deve rimanere tua e mia ricordo particolare
Che non si può cancellare
E tu
Bambola mia troverai 
Uno spazio nel tuo cuore da colorare col mio colore
Ed uno spazio nella tua mente da riempire

Le risposte che tu stavi cercando al male che 
Che cerchi dentro ad ogni singolo pianto

Rimpianger tutto quello che mi hai detto

Non è riuscita a proteggere

Non aprirlo troverai soltanto 
Un motivo per rimpianger tutto quello che mi hai detto

Che ora si che ora si ritrova 
Da sola chiusa in casa pregando che, 
Che il suo angelo torni con in mano una rosa

Perchè per noi stare insieme
Sta al di sopra di tutto

Disegno l’erba verde come la speranza
E come frutta ancora acerba

E adesso un po' di blu, come la notte
E bianco come le sue stelle con le sfumature gialle
E l’aria, puoi solo respirarla!

Azzurro come te, come il cielo e il mare
E giallo come luce del sole
Rosso come le cose che mi fai provare

Per le tempeste non ho il colore
Con quel che resta disegno un fiore

Farete fatica a credere 
Perché parla di una principessa 
E di un cavaliere che 
In sella al suo cavallo bianco

Alla ricerca di un sentimento

Prese un sentiero che portava 
A una cascata dove l?aria 
Era pura come il cuore di quella 
Fanciulla che cantava 
E se ne stava coi conigli

Come i petali di quei fiori che 
Portava tra i capelli

La guardò per un secondo 
Poi le sorrise 
E poi pian piano iniziò a dirle 
Queste dolci parole: 

Vorrei essere il raggio di sole che 
Ogni giorno ti viene a svegliare per 
Farti respirare e farti vivere di me 
Vorrei essere la prima stella che 
Ogni sera vedi brillare perché 
Così i tuoi occhi sanno 
Che ti guardo 
E che sono sempre con te 
Vorrei essere lo specchio che ti parla 
E che a ogni tua domanda 
Ti risponda che al mondo 
Tu sei sempre la più bella

Modena City Ramblers,"Modena City Ramblers - Canzone Dalla Fine Del Mondo
Ho sognato che il vento dell'ovest mi prendeva leggero per mano,
mi posava alla fine del mondo tra isole e terre lontane.
Camminavo al tuo fianco sul molo, guardavamo le barche passare,
mi cantavi una musica dolce, piÃ¹ dolce del canto del mare.

L'orchestra suonava ""The blackbird"" nel bar sulla strada del porto,
i pescatori gridavano forte fra il vino, la birra e le carte.
Raccontavi le storie di viaggi, di strade, di amici caduti,
di amori incontrati lontano e di amori che il tempo ha perduto.

E i giorni correvano e il tempo nel sogno volava,
stringevo la donna delle isole, ballavamo leggeri nell'aria.
E i giorni passavano e l'oceano li stava a cullare
e il vento alla fine del mondo portava un canto del mare.

Seduti fra pietre e brughiere guardavamo i gabbiani volare
Raccontavi la storia del bimbo che un giorno scappÃ² con le fate
Ma il vento dell'ovest chamava ed il cielo d'Irlanda svaniva,
mi svegliai in una stanza deserta ubriaco mentre il sogno finiva.

E i giorni che passano sono lunghi e coperti di nero
mi trascino perduto nei vicoli a maledire una terra straniera
E i giorni son secoli aspettando di poter tornare
di nuovo la fine del mondo cullato dal canto del mare",Canzone Dalla Fine del Mondo,1999

Modena City Ramblers,"Non avrai altro Dio all'infuori di me spesso mi hai fatto pensare;
genti diverse venute dall'est dicevano che in fondo era uguale:
credevano ad un altro diverso da te, non mi hanno fatto del male,
credevano ad un altro diverso da te, non mi hanno fatto del male.
Non nominare il nome di Dio, non nominarlo invano.
Con un coltello piantato nel fianco gridai la mia pena ed il suo nome:
ma forse era stanco, forse troppo occupato, non ascoltÃ² il mio dolore;
ma forse era stanco, forse troppo lontano, davvero lo nominai invano.
Onora il padre ed onora la madre, e onora anche il loro bastone:
bacia la mano che ruppe il tuo naso perche' le chiedevi un boccone.
Quando a mio padre si fermo' il cuore, non ho provato dolore,
quando a mio padre si fermo' il cuore, non ho provato dolore.
Ricorda di santificare le feste, facile per noi ladroni,
entrare nei templi che rigurgitano salmi di schiavi e dei loro padroni,
senza finire legati agli altari sgozzati come animali,
senza finire legati agli altari sgozzati come animali.
Il quinto dice ""non devi rubare"", e forse io l'ho rispettato
vuotando in silenzio le tasche gia' gonfie di quelli che avevan rubato:
ma io senza legge rubai in nome mio, quegli altri nel nome di Dio,
ma io senza legge rubai in nome mio, quegli altri nel nome di Dio.
Non commettere atti che non siano puri, cioe' non disperdere il seme...
Feconda una donna ogni volta che l'ami cosi' sarai uomo di fede.
Poi la voglia svanisce ed il figlio rimane e tanti ne uccide la fame.
Io forse ho confuso il piacere e l'amore ma non ho creato dolore.
Il settimo dice ""non ammazzare se del cielo vuoi essere degno"",
guardatela oggi questa legge di Dio tre volte inchiodata nel legno.
Guardate la fine di quel Nazzareno, un ladro non muore di meno!
Guardate la fine di quel Nazzareno, un ladro non muore di meno!
Non dire falsa testimonianza ed aiutali ad uccidere un uomo...
Lo sanno a memoria il diritto Divino, ma scordano sempre il perdono.
Ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio onore e no non ne provo dolore,
ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio nome e no non ne provo dolore.
Non desiderare la roba degli altri, non desiderarne la sposa...
Ditelo a quelli, chiedetelo ai pochi che hanno una donna e qualcosa...
Nei letti degli altri gia' caldi d'amore non ho provato dolore.
L'invidia di ieri non e' gia' finita, sta' sera v'invidio la vita.
Ma adesso che viene la sera ed il buio, mi toglie il dolore dagli occhi.
E scivola il sole al di la' delle dune a violentare altre notti:
io nel vedere quest'uomo che muore, madre io provo dolore;
nella pieta' che non cede al rancore, madre ho imparato l'amore",Il Testamento Di Tito,2004

y te pediré que me acompañes

Podría ser que al final, rompiste el cristal en mi
Podría pasar, que me hagas hablar

Siento que debo encontrarte, sin embargo
Paso el tiempo yéndome
Hacia mi mismo, a mi centro, que jamas encontraré
Yo quisiera tenerte, y tratarte de modo decente
Pero ves que ya no puedo despegar de mi papel

Deberé tranquilizarme y jugar al juego que me propones
Bajo la guardia, te recibo y me abrigo de tu piel

Tu palabra, me nivela y detiene mi caer

Del tráfico, el smock y el ruido de la ciudad

Por medio de la publicidad

El cielo y el mar, en calma total
Las playas tan doradas que me pongo a llorar
De emoción,
En cuanto tengo el ""sí"" de papá

Un par de minifaldas, tenis
Bañador
Y media tonelada de bronceador
La radio, maquillaje,
Mis lentes de sol

Los músicos tocando hasta el amanecer
Por favor
Ya basta de relajo, por dios

Bikini sensual, pulseras de piel
La arena pura brasa que me quema los pies
No señor, no quiero comprar nada, que no
Resaca brutal, contaminación
Las olas traen grasa negra de montón
Ni un solo lugar, para estar en paz
Me largo, no resisto
Vuelvo a la ciudad

I thought of caring
As a reason for some to praise me, in envy
“So humble and kind”

Ruthless, ungrateful, always trying to turn up tracks
Be it about me or you

With tricks of trust and gluttony
I don’t wanna wait for anyone

When I was younger I thought of deep space
Pick me up swiftly, carry me away
Drop me off willing, light-years long gone
Never again seeing those who I loved
It’s not about me this time, there I go lying again
Please save my soul
I don’t know what I’m doing anymore
Seeking out the faithful in me with singles and a pen
Is it possible I’m overthinking this?

It’s not what I’m not, it’s what I believe in
It’s not what I’ve got, it’s my peace of mind
Too early to see if I’m still in the past
Too hopeful to be wasted time
It’s not what I’m not, it’s what I believe in

What a world of solemn thought their monody compels
For all the sound that floats
From the rust within our throats
And the people sit and groan
In their muffled monotone
And the tolling, tolling, tolling
Feels a glory in the rolling
From the throbbing and the sobbing
Of the melancholy bells
Oh, the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells
Oh, the moaning and the groaning of the bells.

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special

Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

Full of crazy contradictions, like a child.

And I like a fool, try to cope, try to hang on, to hope.

Saturday is calling, and I'm feeling alright
And I get, tired of, being alone

Sunday was calling, see the morning light
And I get tired of to being with this girl

And I try and try to send her home
Called her a taxi, want to be alone

If you choose my love, that means you never lose
Never have the chance to be there for you

And from Italy to Germany
And from San Marino to Canada

With my father and brother, Ansel

I made a mess of myself and the trip on the whole
My father stayed patient with me; why? I don't know

That's the last time I'd see my brother, Ansel

Troubles on the head winds, troubles on the tail winds
Troubles on the head winds, troubles on the tail winds

Me and my sister we hung on the phone
Watching the news as they looked for Ansel
On top of that mountain, underneath the snow
Their dogs were sniffin', I guess you never know
You can't know, well, you can't ever really know
Would you really want to know?
How the hell would you know?

On gears around an uncaring sun
It doesn't know what it gave
As the bone moon winds 'round again
Again this allows one sphere's heart to pump
Pumping waves of hearts that come and go
And then come and then

You can't know, well, you won't ever really know
Would you really want to know?
No, you can't know

Modestep,"Let's go back
Listen, power

Let's go back in a day
I'm talking back in a day
Before I used to MC
When D-Power D he was just a DJ
I was in the jungle vibe
Selling records from 9 to 5
I used to go old school
...
And skip a bus right then
I lost a vibe
Then UKG come alive
I'm talking munchie
Talking...
And then came one two three
And then came Wiley then came Dizzy Kano and D Double E
...
And grime is alive
It was hard but we still survived
I know music evolves through time but
I thank you Lord that grime still alive
And I bust the mic
Now I'm on lord of the mic
Now I've linked on with modestep
2012 is a whole next hype

Alright where do I start
Let me come back let me go from the start
My life without music is a thorn in the heart
This marriage could have end in the park
It's like taking tea from a shop
English way Jamaican herry
The rivals listening to Morgan Harage
UKJ hard ass crew
Beating of the drums
LIstening to ABBA
I knew like when it was like Jacobs
...
Bob Marley, Gwen Steffani James Brunt
For you they may hardly relate
But for me they're all in the same playground
And it all comes together like a rain and cold weather
This is my Darwin Theory
Not like humans and apes
It's more like ...
Then you got dubstep
Then party like a rockstar
A rockstar
Yeah, yeah

For as long as I remember
I've always had music on my agenda
Yes! Number one contender
Yes! Lyrical skunk never heard of my scent
I used to listen to Call Fm!
Black market...
Couple a years later
Lyrical sniper
I was a raver
Me and my man got briefing everywhere
Goin' on horrid
Heartless bears we are so solid
To be a MC ouh it was so funny
After years and determination
I'm part of a world known organization
Undefeated no other teaming
...
And no formation
Me and my mate is a Jesus
I was broke
Everybody loved me
Get paid up
...
I'm sick understatement
Me and your mate work in a basement
I used to have one pair of nikes
Now I've got countless trainers

Been doing this thing since TDK
Now it's all like top cd Djs
The way that I know that's PBK
Hardless fun I bust your mind
That man there was leaving away
...
That's what I was back in the day
But I still represent the sounds of the UK
Little bit of dubstep little bit of grime
...
Be my
Doing this for awesome crew
One for the a track and dynamite boo
I don't wanna tell them what to do
They'll deal with a nasty crew
Park your crew

Y mido los gemidos y quejidos que se escapan
Y así hago mío todo lo que siente

Pero no sabe que quiere y mucho menos a quien
