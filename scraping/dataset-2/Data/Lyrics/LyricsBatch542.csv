Kenny Baker,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Kenny Baker & His Orchestra,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Kenny Baker's Dozen,"Don't even go to a movie show
If you're not by my side,
I stay home by my radio,
But I'm satisfied!
All my flirtin' days are gone,
On the level from now on!

Don't go for any excitement now,
Books are my best company.
All my opinions have changed somehow,
Old-fashioned as can be!
When you really learn to care,
There's a thrill in solitaire!

Keepin' ou of mischief now,
Really am in love, and how!
I'm through playing with fire,
It's you whom I desire!

All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me!
I've told them in advance
They can't break up our romance!
Living up to every vow,

Kenny Ball,"From Russia with love, I fly to you
Much wiser since my goodbye to you
I've travelled the world to learn
I must return
From Russia with love

And smile for a moment
But, oh, you haunted me so
Still, my tongue tied young bride
Would not let my love for you show
In case you'd say ""No""

I suddenly knew you'd care again

Kenny Ball,"Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
Cause that's the night that my sweetie and I
Used to dance cheek to cheek
I don't mind Sunday night at all
Cause that's the night friends come to call
And Monday to Friday go fast
And another week is past

But Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week

Until I hear you at the door
Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week

Kenny Ball,"Stillness in the grove
Not a rustling sound
Softly shines the moon clear and bright
Dear, if you could know
How I treasure so
This most beautiful Moscow Night
Lazily the brook like a silvery stream
Ripples in the light of the moon
And a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Yes a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Dearest, why so sad, why the downcast eyes
And your lovely head bent so low
Oh, I mustn’t speak, though I’d love to say
That you’ve stolen my heart away
Promise me my love, as the dawn appears
And the darkness turns into light
That you’ll cherish dear, through the passing years

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

And your temper starts to rile up,
That's the time a fellow needs a song.

Doctor, Banker, Butcher, Baker,
You can be a merry maker,
If you'll keep on singing all day long.

If you're hanging in suspense from eight till five,
And you want to keep the sense of humor alive.
Just, whistle while you work (whistle)
Put on that grin and start right in, 
To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

When there's too much to do,

Kenny Ball,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

My little memories, those precious memories

On cheap talk and wine

What's gonna happen today.

We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Kenny Burrell,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

People who need people,

Kenny Burrell,"Here we are
Alive and free
Far away in time from our darkest day
That took our young and brave

From the cradle to the grave
70 years ago on July one 1916 on the Somme
The enemies had never seen fighting like this before
Such a simple plan--

How could any German man
Survive through that ordeal?
Company 'A' to Company 'be	'
""Morale is high here, sir, but I don't think it's safe to go""

Company 'A' from Company 'be	'
""Mister you have your orders and you must obey""
So the first line rose, and the first line fell
And a poet who survived later wrote about

A ""Sunlit vision of Hell""
And ""Larks singing""
Because after all it's just another summer's day in France
And the Tommie's on the Somme sang

""We are fighting to turn no-man's land into a common ground""
A common ground",The Common Ground,1968

Another day
Well, well, well

Up in a tree, jaybird

Everyone looks, you can't see
We can't be ignored easily

Soft within the wayward things
Like ecstasy
The sound of trees

One million balloons, all used
Drive over hills, forget your fear

With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up

Kenny Burrell,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses

But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Kenny Burrell,"The things I used to like, I don't like any more,
I want a lot of other things I've never had before,
It's just like my mamma says, I sit around and mourn
Pretending that I am so wonderful and knowing I'm adored

I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,
I'd say that I had spring fever,
But I know it isn't spring.

I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented,
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever,
When it isn't even spring? 

I keep wishing I were somewhere else,
Walking down a strange new street,
Hearing words I have never never heard,
From a man I've yet to meet.

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,

That it might as well be spring,
It might as well be, might as well be,
It might as well be spring.",It Might as Well Be Spring,1993

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

And candle lights on little corner tables

The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2005

When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.

Does it mean that our love is ending.

You're out of my heart,

Drank to much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama, and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

Yeah we went out last night
One thing started leadin' to another
Out last night
Hittin' on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah life was good everywhere
We went out last night

Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in East Tennessee
But last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

Yeah we went out last night
One thing started leadin' to another
Out last night
Hittin' on everybody and their mother
There were people doin' body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I'll live to go out with
My friends again tonight

Oh we went out last night
One thing started leadin' to another
Out last night
Everybody started lovin' on each other
They were dancin' on the tables, howlin' at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a soul in sight
When we went out last night",Out Last Night,
Kenny Chesney,"I was lost in the wild side of life,
I was blinded by smoke and neon lights.
I was drinkin` and sinkin` without a prayer.
Then she showed up right out of thin air.

She took me to heaven, oh my Lord, what a ride!
And I've never been higher, on her love I could fly.
I was hell bound, on my way down, then I found what I need:
Oh, an angel loved the devil out of me.

I thank God for her love each day.
He saved me when he sent her my way.
Now each night, I drive by those neon lights,
And go home to my own paradise.

In a world where roses wither and die

Mistakes you make, the hearts you break and the price you pay

Said he'd been living a life of denial and he cried

Rattled through the rings and the willow trees beyond
Daddy in his good hat, mama in her Sunday dress
Watched in pride, as I stood there in the water up to my chest
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground
And my sins went for many, were washed away and gone
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

This road is long and dusty, sometimes the soul must be cleansed
And I long to feel that water, rushing over me again

Down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth

I promised I'd never love again
And still doin' what I'd said I'd do

Is get on with my life, but I can't take another day
I can't face another night, so I just take another breath

I'll take a chance with someone else
And if my heart takes chances too
Someday I might get over you

So I can't help but wonder if you do?""

She said, ""I only want us back the way we used to be ?""
Then she said

Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Hold me, hold me like you want me

She said, ""Show me that you really love me""
And then tell me
'Cause I really need to know?

'Cause deep inside I knew that she was right
I said, ""I know we've drifted and there's only me to blame""
But I don't want to waste another night?
And somewhere in the darkness there we found a brand new start
As I took every word she whispered straight to heart
When she said

Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Hold me, hold me like you want me
Like you'll never let me go?

To the heartbroken past
Before we found each other

What a difference lookin' through the eyes of love

Life is good, the grass is green

Gonna knock on wood
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look

People stop me on the street, thinkin' I'm the old me
Talkin' about the bad old days

Over by the gate, yonder here she comes
With a basket full of chicken
And a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
I open up the throttle and stir a little dust
Look at her face, she ain't a foolin' me

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me

She likes the way it's pulling
While it's tillin' up the land

She's the only one who really
Understands what gets me

We ride back and forth till we run out of light
Take it to the barn, put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft, sit and talk with the radio on

She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny weenie ride before I take her home

I was wastin' her time, waitin' on dreams that just weren't comin' true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leadin' me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doin' all that I can to get my mind off us

What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on

Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's goin' down on my broken heart
Lord, I gotta go back before I get too far

What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown

Something in your voice called me, caused me to turn my head.
Your smile just captured me, you were in my future as far as I could see.
And I don't know how it happened, but it happens still.
You ask me if I love you, if I always will

You won me, it was over from the start.
You completely stole my heart, and now you won't let go.

You had me from ""Hello""

Inside I built a wall so high around my heart, I  thought I'd never fall.
One touch, you brought it down
Bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And I swore to me that I wasn't going to love again
The last time was the last time  I'd let someone in

Its unstoppable, baby anything is possible

Anywhere I ever go
With all of my heart I know I am the man I am

One bottle of wine, two Dixie cups
At three a.m. I fell in love

'Bout a football jacket and a high school ring
And it sure looked nice
When you wore mine
That late October at a homecoming dance
We slipped outside and we took a chance
In the middle of the night
Man it sure felt right
We let go right then and there
We were loved and we were scared

For the first time
Lovin' blind we dove right in
For the first time
We gave everything and then
Graduation came
And our dreams called our names
With broken hearts we moved on with our lives

Your a Sunday school teacher got the pta
Got a real good life
Your a real good wife
I'm livin' in this circus world
No I ain't married but I got a girl
And I'm her man

Kenny Chesney,"I had a hundred dollar ring in my hand,
So weak and tired,I can barely stand,
From being up all night, praying she'd say yes.
So with a hopeful heart, I hit one knee
With a tear in her eye, she looked at me
It was the moment of truth, I was scared to death.
My life hung on what that tear meant,
Then she smiled at me,
And I lost it.

No one can make me cry,
Make me laugh,
Make me smile,
Or drive me mad,
Like she does.
It's like a curse,
That is the cure,
Better or worse,
One things for sure,
It's real love,
And I don't know what I'd do,
If I lost it.

Well the honeymoon ended, and life began,
Jobs and bills, losing touch with friends,
And the apartment got smaller every day.
Then one night, the walls finally closed in,
I came home late, she said ""Where have you been?
You used to call and tell me, ""you're on your way.""
She said, ""If this is how this is gonna be, then I quit.""
She walked out the door,
I lost it.

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight
To twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud

Down at the end lookin' half asleep
But he walked up and said, what'll it be?

Another race I'm glad I get to run.
Another chapter of my life I'm writin'.

Workin' six days a week.
Wearin' holes in the soles
Of the shoes on my feet.
Been dreamin' of gettin' away
Since I don't know.
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico

No shoes, no shirt, and no problems
Blues, what blues?
Hey I forgot 'em.
The sun and the sand,
And a drink in my hand with no bottom,
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,
No problems.

Want a towel on a chair
In the sand by the sea,
Want to look through my shades,
And see you there with me.
Want to soak up life for a while,
In laid back mode.
No boss, no clock, no stress, no dress code

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues, what blues?
Hey I forgot 'em.
The sun and the sand,
And a drink in my hand with no bottom,
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,

If you got 'em.

No problems.","No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems",2002

She was born to see the world.
All I got is a picture she mailed me.
Barefoot in the snow white sand;
A bag of sea shells in her hand.
She finally found a paradise it seems...

On the coast of somewhere beautiful,
Trade winds blowin' through her hair,
Sunlight dancin' on the water,
And I wish I was there.
Don't know how I'm gonna find her,
All I know so far...
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful,
Runnin' with my heart.

Sometimes when the sun goes down
Shadows fall across this little town,
And I close my eyes and I drift away
To another place in another time,
When the world was ours and she was mine,
I dream of holdin' her again someday...

Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'
Went out and hopped in my old Ford

I'm the same old story same old act

It's the same thing night on night
Who's wrong baby who's right
Another fight and I slam the door on
Another battle in our dirty little war
When I look at myself I don't see
The man I wanted to be
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back

There's a girl across the bar
I get the message she's sendin'
Mmm she ain't lookin' to married

We were growin' our hair,
We were cuttin' class,
Knew it all already there was nothing to learn,
We were strikin' matches just to watch em burn.

Listenin' to our music just a little too loud,
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd,
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer,
It was a long train tressle but we had no fear,

Man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that,
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young, young

Talked a good game, we were right with the guys
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain,
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change

Let me put a bug in your cute little ear

Then we'll string some lights in a coconut tree
I rub some oil on you and you can rub some on me

I can see us baby, on the beach hand-in-hand
Rocking to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean

Ooh, I can almost feel my toes in the sand
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

I'll buy you some shades and a brand-new bikini

There are shepherds fallin' to their knees, and Angels blowin' horns
But in their golden halls the Pharasees
Scoffed and drank their wine
They said it's only Hebrew prophecy
We don't care and besides, He just a kid
That's all He is
One more pebble in the gravel, one more rumor in the rabble
How can He be king, he's just a kid

Well in no time He seen the world was knockin' on His door
Performed miracles and wonders they had never seen before
Soon the Pharasees stopped laughin
The silver sun was paid
And near the end He knelt down in the garden and He prayed, I'm just a kid

That's all I am
I'll need Your strength too see me through it
If it is Your will I'll do it
But how can I be king, I'm just a kid?

Now I think about the Baby and the Man at Christmas time
Of mothers, sons and fathers and children just like mine
About the power in unselfishness, love and sacrifice
The Gift that we were given and the price

And how the news spread through Jerusalem, tonight a child is born
There are shepherds fallin' to their knees, and angels blowin' horns
I wonder how on Earth the Pharasees, could scoff and drink their wine
And say He's only Hebrew prophesy
We don't care and besides He's just a kid

Drivin' my first love out to the levy

Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks

Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back

Wrote a few songs

To the way that I see it,
To the way that I see it,
To the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair

From that chair I've caught a few fish and some rays
And I've watched boats sail in and out of cinnamon bay
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart
I prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start

And he was raised to think like his dad, 
Narrow mind, full of hate,
On the road to nowhere fast,
Until the grace of god got in the way,
Then he saw the light and hit his knees and cried and said a prayer,
And rose up a brand new man, and left the old one right there.

(Chorus)
Here's to the strong,
Thanks to the brave,
Don't give up hope,
Some people change.
Against all odds,
Against the grain,
Love finds a way,
Some people change.

She was born with her mothers habit,
Guess you could say it's in her blood,
She hates it that she's gotta have it,
She fills her glass up.
And she'd love to kill that bottle,
But all she could think about is a,
A better life, a second chance, 
And everyone she's lettin' down.

She throws that bottle down.

(Chorus)

Thank god for those who make it.
Let them be the love.

Some people change.

Kenny Chesney,"All he could think about was I'm to young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell I'm just a kid myself
How'm I gonna raise one

All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke
So much for ditching this town and hanging out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone

And he said
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all good-bye
There goes my life

A couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah...he loves that little girl.

Momma's waiting to tuck her in
As she stumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls

He smiles
There goes my life
There goes my future my everything
I love you, daddy goodnight
There goes my life

She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes and fifteen pairs of shoes and his American express
He checked the oil and slammed the hood, said your good to go
She hugged them both and headed off to the west coast

He cried
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you
Baby good-bye

Go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do, wouldn't have a soul I had to answer to

Got an old Corvette, got a new girlfriend, but only sees his kids every other weekend
When I think about leaving oh I think about him

I never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad, how he walked out on her
And her mom when she was just a kid

When I think about leaving oh I think about her
Only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt
With her little arms wrapped around his neck saying daddy where you going, are you coming
Back
When I think about leaving I think about her

You know the truth is, most of the time things were really great and I know we got something
Special
When I think about leaving I think about us
How we build this love we share on faith and trust, honest way we talk, tender way we touch,
All those nights we spent making love,
When I think about leaving oh I think about us

In my heart I know I would never leave, there's nowhere else on earth I would rather be

She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me.
I was gonna run the bank.
I was gonna run the map.
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath.

On the sidewalk
And by a cafe where
I hope to be workin' soon

And she said, ""Hey ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down?

Of the man from Tennessee""

Move up into the mountains
So far that we can't be found

And throw I love you echoes
Down the canyons
And then lie awake at night

And all that I ain't got
I need someone to cling to
Somebody I can sing to

Please come to L.A. to live forever

Is just too hard to live

I live in a house that, looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars
That fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill

Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
Get this laying low off to a flying start
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star
And be as you are

Gettin' stuck sure would be easy
In this palm tree paradise
Ambition fades with every wave
For the finer things in life
Maybe I'll just hang around here
Go home later next year

Swears he won't go back again

I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

My friends all grew up; they settled down
Built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
They work in their office, drive SUVs
They pray for their babies, and they worry 'bout me

'Cause I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

I'm always runnin'
Son-of-a-gunnin'
I've had a good time, it's true
But the way I've been goin'
It's time that I toned it
Down just a notch or two

Oh yeah

Well, I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

Yeah, I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

Yeah, I need to rewind real slow
Yeah, I still got some miles to go",Living in Fast Forward,2005
Kenny Chesney,"Ain't nothing out here but me, the road and the radio
Looking for an exit and a song that I might know
Counting down the memories and adding up the miles
Searching for a feeling I ain't felt in a while

Clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:
The road and the radio

Spent the night in Carolina, got up early out of bed
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and a old Stones cassette
Setting my sights south bound, no reason or rhyme
Threw up a prayer just lookin', just lookin' for a sign

And some clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:

That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on forty nine
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

Temperature says ninety three
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimmin' hole
It's nice and cold

Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

The more things change
The more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah baby when you got

Two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle rollin' on the floorboard

I feel you everywhere I go
I see your smile, I see your face
I hear you laughing in the rain
I still can't believe you're gone

It ain't fair you died too young
Like a story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no one could take your place
Sometimes I wonder who you'd be today

Would you see the world, would you chase your dreams
Settle down with a family
I wonder what would you name your babies
Some days the sky's so blue
I feel like I can talk to you
I know it might sound crazy

It ain't fair you died too young

My strings all get tangled, my wires all get crossed
Every now and then I'm right up on the edge
Dangling my toes out over the ledge

Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
Cause when I'm a firecracker comin' undone
Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby, you save me

It's hard lovin' a man, that's got a Gypsy soul
I don't know how you do it; I'm not sure how you know

I know I don't tell you nearly enough
That I couldn't live one day without your love

When I'm a ship tossed around on the waves
Up on a high wire that's ready to break
When I've had just about all I can take

Kenny Chesney,"Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare

This is where the rubber meets the road
This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didn't know
This is where the truth don't lie

You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas get their fast
Never stop to think 'what's in it for me?' or 'it's way too far.'
They just show on up with their big old heart
You find out who you're friends are

Everybody wants to slap your back
Wants to shake your hand
When you're up on top of that mountain
But let one of those rocks give way then you slide back down look up
And see who's around then

This ain't where the road comes to an end
This ain't where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off

You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas get there fast
Never stop to think 'what's in it for me?' or 'it's way too far.'
They just show on up with that big old heart
You find out who you're friends are

When the water's high
When the weather's not so fair
When the well runs dry
Who's gonna be there?

You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas get there fast
Never stop to think 'what's in it for me?' or 'it's way too far.'

Kenny Chesney,"I move on like a sinner's prayer
Letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
I get reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates, it's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

I'm never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
I never stay, but then again, I might
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build the walls too high to climb out
I'm honest to a fault, it's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

I see you lean in, you're bound to fall
I don't wanna be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer, nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late

'Cause good-bye's are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning, then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
One day you're gonna find someone
Right away, you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
Was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment
You'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
Better as a memory than as your man",Better as a Memory,2007

Five miles away it's almost time for bed
They're brushing teeth and hearing one more story
And in the mirror, she paints her lips bright red

But the boss man says no calls go out or in
So she puts on a dress that might feel pretty
If she didn't have to take it off again

She's dancin' for the rent
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday
Smiling while she dances, is the price she has to pay

They tell her in this job there is no future
So get it while you can cause looks don't last
There's money in those pockets for the taking
And if you do it right it makes the time go fast

The music's loud, the drinks are mostly water
Whatever her name is tonight she can't recall
The business men stare at the single mother
Who's smiling while she's staring at the wall

Someday she'll have a house out in the country
Someday she'll see the other side of dawn
And no one will ever know what it was she did before

Ghost underneath the bed

And in words better left unsaid
They hang around like perfume
And haunt me like an ancient melody

There's things I can?t leave alone
'Cause they won't leave me alone

Still I reach for the things I crave
Better try to runaway
Maybe I'm afraid of being free

Says she needs my company

Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe

Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink

Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your ""better half""
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
""Best start putting first things first""
Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

By a deep little spot on white sand creek

It's toys and clothes in backpacks
Is everybody in okay?
Let's go see dad
Same time in the same spot
Corner of the same old parking lot
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad
We trade a couple words and looks
And kids again
Every other weekend

Every other weekend
Very few exceptions
I pick up the love we made in both my arms
It's movies on the sofa
Grilled cheese and cut the crust off
But that's not the way mom makes it, Daddy breaks my heart
I miss everything we used to have with her again
Every other weekend

I can't tell her I love her
I can't tell him I love him
Cause there's too many questions and ears in the car
So, I don't tell him I miss him
I don't tell her I need her
She's over me that's where we are
He's over me that's where we are
We're as close as we might ever be again
Every other weekend

Every other Saturday
First thing in the morning
I turn the TV on to make the quiet go away
I know why but I don't know why
We ever let this happen
Fallin' for forever was a big mistake
There's so much not to do and all day not do it in
Every other weekend

Every other Sunday
I empty out my backseat
While my children hug their mother in the parking lot
We don't touch, we don't talk much
Maybe goodbye to each other
As she drives away with every piece of heart I've got
I re-convince myself we did the right thing
Every other weekend

I can't tell her I love her
I can't tell him I love him
Cause there's too many questions and ears in the car
So, I don't tell him I miss him
I don't tell her I need her
She's over me that's where we are

We were strikin' matches just to watch em burn

We were hangin' in there with the outkast crowd
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer

Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly young, young

Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are somethings that are never gonna change

Four houses down from me
Was a family with an only child
She was the only girl
In this whole world that can make me smile

Down the road
I made up reasons to go

There was something she took a liking to
I asked her to marry me
She said she really wanted to

Down the road
To see what life's gonna hold

Her momma wants to know
If I'm washed in the blood or just in the water
Her daddy wants to know
If I make enough to take his daughter

Down the road
Before he could let her go

Now down the street from here
There's an engineer with an only son
And our baby girl says
She believes that he is the only one

Is he washed in the blood or just in the water

Playa del Carmen
That's when I first met Jose
He had a 12 foot Schooner
A 3 foot cooler
Full of the catch of the day
And he was wrinkled from grinning
From all of the sun he had been in
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand
He said ""Gracias senor"", when I paid him too much for
All of the Snapper he had
Now I told him my friend it ain't nothing
In the best broken Spanish I knew
I said I make a good living
Back home where I'm from
He smiled and said Amigo me too

He said I fish and I play my guitar
I laugh at the bar with my friends
I go home to my wife
I pray every night
I can do it all over again

Somewhere over Texas
I thought of my Lexus
And all the stuff I work so hard for
And all the things that I've gathered
From climbing that ladder
Didn't make much sense anymore
They say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet
They keep holding my feet to the fire
They call it paying the price
So that one day in life
I'll have what I need to retire

And just fish
And play my guitar
And laugh at the bar with my friends
And go home to my wife
And pray every night
I can do it all over again

And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made
When the truth is I'm really just dying
To live like Jose

And just fish
Play my guitar
Laugh at the bar with my friends
Go home to my wife
Pray every night
I can do it all over again

Since I had real peace of mind
So I'm just going to sit right here
In this old chair till this storm rolls by.

Like it was going out of style

Aw, she was believing every line I was laying

I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape I'm in
I done spotted me another queen
Sitting at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes, I thought I'd been blessed

Call the kids, tell 'em see you next summer

No more freezing their tails off
It's cataract sunglasses and a round of golf
Red skin, green plaid, margarita, dog track
Before you know it Mom and Dad
They'll go coastal on ya

Sounds so good, got me thinking
What do y'all say after I'm done singing

We just take a little getaway

Ah, it's tough out there, a good muse is hard to find
Living one word to the next, one line at a time
There's more to life than whiskey, there's more to words than rhyme
Sometimes nothing works, sometimes nothing shines

Sail away, sail away, three sheets to the wind
Live hard, die hard, this one's for him

Spilled hot coffee down the front of my jeans
It's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent
Not a minute left for me to be me

Been going like nothing can wait
I gotta get my priorities straight

I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

Friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath
Tell the band slow it down, there she is, think I found
Maybe Miss Wonderful, I haven't met yet

It just hit me like a wrecking ball
She's giving me a wake up call

I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

Step back, smell the rose
Feel the sand between your toes
Unplug, unwind
Step out in the sunshine

Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop

Ain't all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
'Cause everybody needs to break free from reality

Yeah, some days it's a bitch, it's a bummer
We need a rock and roll show in the summer
To let the music take us away
Take our minds to a better place

Where we feel that sense of freedom
Leave our worries behind, we don't need 'em
All we need is a sunny day and an old tailgate
And we'll escape

She said it was her first time to see the sea
Helping her climb across those jetty rocks
Was the first time I touched her hand

The rain and the way that felt never let up all week
By Thursday I knew everything about her
And God, the last day I didn't wanna leave without her

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name

I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand

Time was like the tide, it came and went
That old pier ran clear out into the mist
My mind plays back that Tuesday night
Again and again, and again

I taste that saltwater taffy on her lips
And Wednesday morning snuck in through the window
We just laid there and listened to the waves come and go

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name

I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand

Moments with her, now they're all a blur
Except for every second and every word
Every drop of rain, every single grain of sand

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain

I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you

You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you

Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

""I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.""

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say

Where Mama used to measure us
I'm proud to say that's my home where I was raised
But that ain't where I grew up

See, I gained a little on Father Time
The summer my Granddaddy died
The first time I saw Mama cry
Man, that sure was tough

Felt like I put on a few years
Watching Daddy wipe her tears
In my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud
That's where I grew up

My senior year, a case of beer out on the river bank
Getting a head start on twenty one
That's the place that made me feel just like a man
But that ain't where I grew up, no

See I gained a little on Father Time
That night I crossed that center line
I bet I rolled a dozen times

Next thing I knew I was waking up upside down
Praying ""God, just get me out""
Then I hit my knees beside what was left of my truck
Hey, that's where I grew up

You learn as you go, that's how you grow

See, I gained a little on Father Time
When me and her, had our first big fight
I said some things, I made her cry
She packed all her stuff

The boy in me said let her go
But the man in me said pull her close

Swore I wouldn't go back there again

Five hundred dollars
It was mine all mine

With a six dollar bottle of wine

He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun.

Where does he take a broken heart
Shouldn't there be some small exemption
If he does all that it takes
To admit to his mistakes
Til the truth batters and breaks his world apart

From the heavens high above
Tell myself my prayers are gonna somehow be enough
And lay down in some angels bed

I saw her smiling picture in his wallet
He said ""I call her 'baby' but her Christian name is Charlotte""

She spends her days downtown hooked up to some machine
The say time can heal but time can't heal everything
The Lord's gonna take her home real soon flying on angel's wings

I'm gonna cry right now and that's okay
We're all gonna die someday
You won't remember a single word I'm trying to say

It's all a grand illusion when you think you're in control
She's all I got left of sellin' everything I own
There's no good in a goodbye it's the beginning of the end
I left some songs in the guitar
Sing 'em good my friend

This old guitar and case has been in a million bars
Been a fools disciple miss dance recitals
And the birth of every child
Honestly honesty never goes out of style
So sing the pain my friend

So the world she's her as just desperate grey and old
All I see is my true love my heart my life my soul
At least for one more night, I got a beautiful wrinkled hand to hold
So sing the truth my friend

I'm gonna sing the truth within
I'm gonna sing them good for my old friend

Looked up at the crimson sky as the sun began to fade
And for the first time in a long time I swear
I think I prayed

A lady down on love and out of hopes and dreams
The ties that once bound her now are broke away
And she's like a baby, just learning how to play

She never thought that love could ever end so soon
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon
When he asked her to marry and she gladly said O.K
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday

Now she's a lady down on love
She needs somebody to gently pick her up
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her and never let her down

Well, I know the lady that's down on her love
'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch
But work took me a way from home late at nights
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust

Now she's a lady down on love

He ain't sure, and we ain't sure
Exactly what he said
But praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead

You won't find many hypocrites
That will take the chance on getting bit
But a true believer can survive
Rattlesnakes and cyanide

Now I'll bring you home that deadly viper
Keep the holy spirit in your mind
You might lose your concentration
That serpent's surely bound to strike
Either way you won't forget
The first time that you said
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead

Kenny Chesney,"Thirteen in the thick of a cornfield
I learned to fight, keep roads tied, and not chill
Never did change, stayed strange, hopped a train
My first chance I got out of Smallville
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?

My first stop was a pawn shop
Dropped a pretty penny for a cheap Fender with a song in it
I had a quick right hand, and an old band
I thought good friends would make a good band
Life has it's way of provin' you wrong, don't it?

And I've been right and I've been wrong
Somewhere in between for so long
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?

So there I was, a long way from nowhere
Fried mind, spare time and a blank stare
I was just numb enough not to feel a thing
After all we didn't share a set of rings
Besides, how bad could it be!
She never found out I'd never come clean
Life has it's way of leadin' you on, don't it?

And I've been right and I've been wrong
Somewhere in between for so long
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?

Well now, have you ever been down the old back road?
On time borrowed
It's a trip, it's a bitch, it's an on and off light switch

In Knoxville Tennessee
Hope none for patty and loveless,
November of ninety-three

Full of friends, mom, and uncle Butch
And the crowd was really small
He'd say I was a scared kid,
If this bus could talk

Some nights we'd dance with the devil
Some nights we'd pray to the Lord
Between vibrant passes and rubber arena glasses
He was never really bored

We were starry eyed dreamers,
Bouncing off the wall
And all the stories he could tell,
If this bus could talk

He'd sing of pool halls in Texas
And have a corn dog in county fair
Girls that we made cry,
Some crowds that didn't care

And Bobby road us down in Bama
He kept rocking through it all
All the stories he could tell,
If this bus could talk

Late night conversations,
Full of drunk philosophy
On politics and religion,
Football and family

The lovers that we missed,
And the lovers that we lost
All the secrets he could share
If this bus could talk

He'd seen Virginia Beach,
Caught in a hurricane
He roads I wish I never met
But he ain't naming names

We learned the code of the road at the grizzly rose
When we had a bone
All the stories he could serve
If this bus could talk

Many years of summers,
And I hope it never ends
Been down so many highways,
Full of twists and turns and bends

We caught lightning in a bottle,
Somehow we survived it all
All the stories he could tell,
If this bus could talk

As I leave the stage,
Still high from your applause
He'd tell you that I love you,

Had to keep on drinking,
Keep on sinking down, down,
Down, down, down to the good stuff

I hit that water back with a monster stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt

Spitting out Back In Black

Started bouncing back
Started bouncing back,

She's flying high tonight,
Just across town
There's a lone hillbilly playing Stardust Willy
Wasn't even getting off the ground

Tried to hang with the Hank but I had to stop
Got shot with the J Cash needle drop
Couldn't walk the line

We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were

We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror

Said ""Do you think we’ll live forever?""

My ole heart was racing as she climbed inside
She slid over real close and drove down to the lake road
Watched the sun fade in that big red sky

It's just been waiting for a night like tonight""

And one mistake don't mean you've failed the test
And as you lay beside me softly sleeping, this I know
There's nothing better once you've had the best

Within your arms I've had the best and I think the world should know
I don't care what you've said or done I'll always love you so

Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom, baby
And you brought me back from being too far gone.

And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time

Oh, I looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle always dry
So when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

Running for no reason and no reason to turn back
The salt and rum on my tongue, sails tattered and torn
Laughing in the devil's face, riding out the storm

Gonna get off of this highway
Wake up in Sun Bay
With the sunshine on my face
Saint Christopher on a silver chain
Say a prayer and sail away

At the end of our ropes or the end of the line
Got a few loose screws, got a couple too tight

So we got as fast as we could

If you wanna come howl at the moon
We can always make a little more room

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow

And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

That you stole from the skies

Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Ya, ya ya, give me oom-pa-pah
When I want a melody
Lilting through the house
Then I want a melody

It laughs, it sings, the world is in rhyme
Swinging to three-quarter time

Let the Danube flow along
And the Fledermauss
Keep the wine and give me song

By Jove, by Jing, by Strauss is the thing
So I say to ha-cha-cha, heraus!

The birds off the trees?

There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone,1968

Declining a Charlotte ruse, accepting a fig

Of paradise, where roses grew

To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again

Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
