Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra,"It's an old-fashioned idea, 
Marryin' for love! 
And that old-fashioned idea's 
What I'm thinkin' of! 
 
Where there's love, poets have said, 
Two can live as one! 
That's an old-fashioned idea, 
But it's bein' done! 
 
If she must have gold, let it be in her hair, 
Rubes, let 'em be in her lips, 
Diamonds, let 'em shine in her eyes! 
 
Just an old-fashioned romance, 
With the moon above, 
A romance, one that will end, 
Marryin' for love 
That's the kind of love 
That I'm thinking of! 
 
If she must have gold, let it be in her hair,

Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra,"On the outgoing tide 
I know that you're leaving today 
And my tears will be a part of the sea 
That's taking you, darling, away from me! 
 
But they can't take my dreams, they can't take the love in my heart 
And although I know we're drifting apart 
If heaven has meant you for me, for me 
I know I will sail at your side someday on the outgoing tide!",On the Outgoing Tide,2002
Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra,"Someone lights up my heart like the sun,
And that someone is you, please believe me!
You're my starlight when daytime is done
My darling, please darling, believe me!

You're the smile on my lips when I wake,
You're a faith that I'll never forsake!
No one loves with a love that I bring you
Please believe me, believe me please do! 

You're the smile on my lips when I wake,
You're a faith that I'll never forsake!
No one loves with a love that I bring you

And take her under your branches, Mister Tree! 
Whisper to her, Mister Wind, sing to her Mister Robin 
And Mrs Moonlight put in a word for me! 

Tell her how I feel, it shouldn't end this way 
Since you all are her friends, she'll listen to whatever you have to say 
Babble to her Mister Brook, kiss her for me Miss Raindrops 
And watch to see they all do please Mister Sun!

Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra,"She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! 
She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! 
She's as quiet as a mouse 
Why, she would never ever raise her voice to a shout 
Not unless somebody else is drownin' me out! 

Yes, She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! 
High floutin' ~ You're darn tootin'! 
And her manners are superb 
Yesterday I wore a gown of satin an' lace, 
You took me out dinin' to the ritziest place 
And when they brought the finger bowl, 
Why you washed your face! 
Ah! I'm a Lady! ~ She's a Lady ~ Oh yeah! 

He's a Lover! ~ I'm a Lover! 
He's big hearted! ~ Once I've started! 
Nothin' is good for you! 
Say, how do you mean that? 
I bought you a golden necklace fit for a Queen 
If that's a golden necklace, why's my neck turnin' green? 

He's Romantic! ~ I'm Romantic! 
He's the shy type! ~ Yes, it's my type! 
He's the kind that girls can't trust! 
Some guys take a girl out ridin' an' when they do, 
She may have to walk home, that don't happen to you! 
That's because I take them riding in a canoe 
Oh! He's a lover! ~ I'm a lover ~ Oh yeah! 

She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! 
She's the fine type ~ Home at nine type! 
She's as gentle as a lamb! 
She's the most refined girl that the city has got 
I will beat up anyone who says that I'm not! 

She's a High-Brow ~ I'm a High-Brow! 
You're what 'class' is! ~ You need glasses! 
You know just how things are done 
In a crowded bus, you find a guy with a seat 
Then you drop your hanky so it lands at his feet 
When he stands up to get it, that's when I grab his seat! 
Yes, She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! ~ Oh yeah! 

He's a Singer! ~ I'm a Singer! 
Like Caruso! ~ Learned to do so, 
In a barber-shop quartet 
I once gave a hair-cut to a fellow one day 
I started singing ""Mammy"" an' kept cutting away 
Yeah, now they call him 'baldy' an' he wears a toupee! 

You're a Lady! ~ You're a Barber! 
You're a High-Brow! ~ You're a Sin-ger! 
Hee hee, I'm a Sin-ger? ~ Ha, ha ha ha! 
She's a Lady ~ Ah! He's a Sin-ger! ~ Oh yeah!

I sent my love today 
A spray of tulips and heather, asking her whether 
Love's dream had gone astray! 

For there's a meaning to all the flowers 
They tell a story that never lies! 
This purple heather, means lonely hours 
And tulips weep for a love that dies! 

And so I pray when they reach you, if they can teach you 
All that is in my heart 
My spray of tulips and heather, bring us together 
Never again to part! 

( For there's a meaning ) My tulips and heather! 
( To all the flowers ) Are tied up together!

Pledging their love to the ground!
Lonely, but free, I'll be found,
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds 

Cares of the past are behind,
Nowhere to go, but I'll find,
Just where the trail will wind,
Drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds

Deep in my heart as a song,

Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra,"It's watermelon weather
That summer kind of weather
When people get together and sing

It's the time of year
The stars seem to dance with laughter
And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

So, why don't you meander
To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra,"'Twas the night before Christmas, 
When all through the house, 
Not a creature was stirring, 
Not even a mouse! 
 
The stockings all hung 
By the chimney with care, 
In hopes that St. Nicholas 
Soon would be there! 
 
The children were nestled 
All safe in their beds, 
While visions of sugarplums 
Danced in their heads! 
 
And Mom in her kerchief 
And I in my cap, 
Had just settled down 
For a long winter's nap! 
 
When out on the lawn 
There arose such a clatter, 
I sprang from my bed 
To see what was the matter! 
 
Away to the window 
I flew like a flash, 
Tore open the shutters 
And threw up the sash! 
 
The moon on the breast 
Of the new fallen snow, 
Gave the lustre of midday 
To object below! 
 
When what to my wandering eyes 
Should appear, 
But a miniature sleigh 
And eight tiny reindeer! 
 
With a little ol' driver 
So lively and quick, 
I knew in a moment 
It must be St. Nick! 
 
More rapid than eagles 
His courses they came, 
As he whistled and shouted 
And called them by name: 
 
""Now Dasher, 
Now Dancer, 
Now Prancer, 
Now Vixen, 
On Comet, 
On Cupid, 
On Doner 
An' Blitzen!"" 
 
To the top of the porch, 
To the top of the wall, 
Now dash-away, dash-away, 
Dash-away all! 
 
As dry leaves 
Before the wild hurricane fly, 
When they meet with an obstacle 
Mount to the sky. 
 
So, up to the housetop 
The courses they flew, 
With a sleigh full of toys 
And St. Nicholas too! 
 
And then in a twinkling 
I heard on the roof, 
The prancing and pawing 
Of each little hoof! 
 
As I drew in my head 
And was turning around, 
Down the chimney St. Nicholas 
Came with a bound! 
 
He was dressed all in fur 
From his head to his foot, 
And his clothes were all tarnished 
With ashes and soot! 
 
A bundle of toys 
He had flung on his back, 
And he looked like a peddler 
Just opening his pack! 
 
His eyes how they twinkled, 
His dimples how merry, 
His cheeks were like roses, 
His nose like a cherry! 
 
His drawl little mouth 
Was drawn up like a bow, 
And the beard of his chin 
Was a white as the snow! 
 
The stump of his pipe 
He held tight in his teeth, 
And the smoke it encircled his head 
Like a wreath! 
 
He had a broad face 
And a round little belly, 
That shook when he laughed 
Like a bowl full of jelly! 
 
He was chubby and plump, 
A right jolly old elf, 
I laughed when I saw him 
In spite of myself! 
 
A wink of his eye 
And a twist of his head, 
Soon gave me to know 
I had nothing to dread! 
 
He spoke not a word 
But went straight to his work, 
And filled all the stockings, 
Then turned with a jerk! 
 
An' laying a finger 
Along side his nose, 
An' giving a nod, 
Up the chimney he rose! 
 
He sprang to his sleigh, 
To his team gave a whistle, 
An' away they all flew 
Like the down of a thistle. 
 
But I heard him exclaim 
As he drove out of sight, 
""Happy Christmas to All, 
And to all a Goodnight!""",Twas The Night Before Christmas,2010

But the purdy-est sight to see,
Is the holly that will be on your own front door!

Is the wish of Barney and Ben,
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk,
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again!

And the thing that will make them ring,

The way you looked when we met,

I hear you whisper, ""I'll always love you,"" 
I know it's over, and yet, 
It's easy to remember, but so hard to forget! 

So I must dream to have your hand caress me, 
Fingers press me tight, 
I'd rather dream than have that lonely feelin' 
Stealing through the night!

You make me smile with my heart, 
Your looks are laughable, un-photographical, 
Yet you`re my favorite work of art
 
Is your figure less than Greek ? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, are you smiling? 
But don`t change a hair for me, 
Not if you care for me.

There's no one in the place except you an' me
So, set 'em up Joe, I've got a little story that you otta know
We're drinkin' my friend, to the end of a brief episode
Make it one for ma baby an' one more for the road

I got the routine, so drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feelin' so bad, I wish you'd make the music dreamy an' sad
Could tell you a lot but you've got to be true to your code
Make it one for ma baby, one more for the road

You'd never kno' it, but Buddy, I'm kind of a poet
And I've got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to me
Until it's talked away

Well, that's how it goes and Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close
So thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear
This torch that I've found, must be drowned or it soon will explode
Make it one for ma baby, an' one more for the road

Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra & Chorus,"When I was but a youngster
Christmas meant one thing,
that I'd be getting lots of toys that day

I learned a whole lot different 
when Mother sat me down 
and taught me to spell 'Christmas' this way: 
 
'see' is for the Christ child, born upon this day
'H' for herald angels in the night
'are' means our Redeemer
'I' means Israel 
'S' is for the star that shone so bright 
'T' is for three wise men, they who travelled far 
'M' is for the manger where He lay 
'A' 's for all He stands for 
'S' means Shepard's came 
 
And that's why there's a Christmas day! 
And that's why there's a Christmas day!

Bring to me the Christmas symphony

Was a jolly happy soul,
With a corncob pipe and a button nose, 
And two eyes made of coal. 
 
Frosty the Snowman, 
Is a fairytale, they say.
He was made of snow, 
But the children know 
How he came to life one day. 
 
There must have been some magic in 
That old silk they found,
For when they placed it on his head, 
He began to dance around! 
 
Oh, Frosty, the Snowman, 
Was alive as he could be;
And the children say 
He could laugh and play,
Just the same as you and me. 
 
Frosty, clumsy as he can be 
See him lopping along!
Off he goes on an icicle spree 
With a happy song! 
 
Frosty the Snowman, 
Knew the sun was hot that day,
So he said, ""Let`s run, and we`ll have some fun, 
Now, before I melt away."" 
 
Down to the village, 
With a broomstick in his hand,
Runnin` here and there, 
All around the square,
Sayin`, ""Catch me if you can."" 
 
He led them down the streets of town, 
Right to the traffic cop . . .
And only paused a moment, 
When he heard him holler, ""Stop!"" 
 
Hmm, Frosty the Snowman, 
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye, sayin` ""Don`t you cry, 
I`ll be back again some day.""

Take a look around tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked
'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself a while
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
You could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart

So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration

And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.

Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.

The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.

And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.

Spectators of the show always staying low.

Mitchell Torok,"Have you ever been down to Haiti
When the summer sun was sinkin' low
There's nothing but romance just everwhere you glance
And the native hearts are all aglow

But when the Cuban Queen comes upon the scene
They all stare like a statue out of stone
When they realize what's before their eyes
The other girls are left all alone

Down in the Caribbean it's not a dream you're seein'
When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm
And from miles away you can see her sway
To the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms

Up in a tree so high way up in the sky
Sits a wide eyed monkey on a limb
He wonders why the people go to so much trouble
Just to try to be like him

He doesn't understand that it's a lady's hand
That makes a heart feel so sublime
And before too long he starts singing the song
And then he gets in the Conga line

Columbus searched for spices but he missed the nicest
Part of the Caribbean
He didn't see the charms and the open arms
It was the gold that he was seein'

But I'm glad he missed the sweetest thing I've kissed
'Cause we're on our honeymoon
I'm so sorry Chris to talk about you like this
But you were five hundred years too soon

And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,

Fuck a jail I ain't going tonight
Quick to pull a four four in a fight
Under the street lights
Rollin' the dice

Racks in my jeans, gun still on my waist

You know I'm sipping on that straight like that ""oh, what a a taste!""
Tip the valet a hundred, I love to stunt
Pulled up in that mean machine, leave it up front
This passed out thing beside me, I barely know her
But you can just imagine the shit I'm 'bout to show her
Snow way, them streets too cold, them bitches polar
Expectations out of this world, I'm thinking solar
That's why I do it for that Kalamazoo
And then NOLA, that's what happens
When you learn to mix it with that soda

I wake up just to bake up, get my cake up and rise up

I boast and bang, pour some pain in that thing

Maintain my fame, get you new pictures
Just to put in your frame

Foot in the cane, walking just like I'm an Indian chief
With no beef, real brief, with a wreath
You may think it's a leaf!
With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth
When you smoking with the dogg, shit, you might not eat!
It's OK, cause we lay, in the cut, on the hill, on the dip
With a fit on Crip, don't trip

The coffee that I had, it was good to the last drop
But now I'm fresh out and you know it don't, stop
So please man, somebody call the weed man
I'd call mine, but he's been low on herb even
I'm fiending, daydreaming of the times when I had
Much mota, many different kinds in the bag
I fell hard for the funk, I can't fake the love
I smoke dro, good Reggie, smoke shake to nugs
If it's weed, then I'm with it

Got a blunt? Let me split it down the gut

On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose

I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"".

You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top!

You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P.

Porque eu recebi uma cartinhazinha de você 
Se você quer ser minha namorada 
Ah, que linda namorada você poderia ser 
Se quiser ser somente minha 
Exatamente essa coisinha, essa coisa toda minha 
Que ninguém mais pode ser 
Você tem que me fazer um juramento 
De só ter um pensamento, ser só minha até morrer 
E também de não perder esse jeitinho de falar devagarinho 
Essas histórias de você 
E de repente me fazer muito carinho 
E chorar bem de mansinho sem ninguém saber porquê 
E se mais do que minha namorada 
Você quer ser minha amada, minha amada, mas amada pra valer 
Aquela amada pelo amor predestinada 
Sem a qual a vida é nada, sem a qual se quer morrer

É melhor ser alegre que ser triste
Alegria é a melhor coisa que existe
É assim como a luz no coração

Mas pra fazer um samba com beleza
É preciso um bocado de tristeza

Senão, não se faz um samba não

Senão é como amar uma mulher só linda
E daí? Uma mulher tem que ter

Qualquer coisa de triste
Qualquer coisa que chora
Qualquer coisa que sente saudade

Uma beleza que vem da tristeza
De se saber mulher
Feita apenas para amar
Para sofrer pelo seu amor
E pra ser só perdão

Fazer samba não é contar piada
E quem faz samba assim não é de nada

De um dia não ser mais triste não

Feito essa gente que anda por aí
Brincando com a vida
Cuidado, companheiro!

Sem provar muito bem provado
Com certidão passada em cartório do céu
E assinado embaixo: Deus
E com firma reconhecida!
A vida não é brincadeira, amigo
A vida é arte do encontro
Embora haja tanto desencontro pela vida
Há sempre uma mulher à sua espera
Com os olhos cheios de carinho
E as mãos cheias de perdão

Como no seu samba

Ponha um pouco de amor numa cadência

That's why I play the role, keep control
And throw them off wit' these dirty gators
See time was torn

'cause if I bought me somethin' to eat, shit
I bought you somethin' too, what's mine is yours
But now you'd rather bring me down and see me fall
Walkin' wit my head down, straight, dependin' on y'all

The call me Honcho, I like to sparkle
I'm 'bout to barbecue a bitch like the charcoal
Am I a star? No, ya' in my car? No

Now heffer don't act stupid, 'cause ya'know who I am
The nigga quick to talk shit and don't give a damn

I pimp across the land, better read ya' motherfuckin' press telegram

Snoop Dogg told me that
Now blow me back while I'm pimpin' on this funky track
Bang ES, we givin' it up, got the bitches singin' the rest

Better, hide yo chest and fasten yo vest
No bullshit, take yo bitches so quick and so fast

Fuck wit' us, I'll put a foot up yo ass

Collect calls from the pen so I catch it in the kitchen
The homie say, send him naked pictures of bitches
And if they talkin' backwards, he'll have a homie's jack up
That nigga fucked Pat up, fuck havin' a homies tack up

We slap hoes that step on toes of our dada's

I got stripes and bars from a life at war
Twice as hard, as niggas claim they sheisty y'all

Criminal, lay 'em down for their stacks and sacks
For the mic, used to trife with the mass and gats
Do or die to survive from my time of birth
Then I'm out for gettin' mine till I ride the hearse

My moves is swift, I'm stiff with mine
Remi Martin straight, then I hit it with lime
It's time to shine, to strike my pose
Five carats on my pinky, pickin my nose (BEATCH)

to let me see the ass while they backup dance
I glance and breeze - if the body is true
I'm off and on to part two (part TWO)

Now I done scanned at the club (what else?)
I popped my collar to all my folks with love (what else?)
And all the niggaz that didn't respond to me (what else?)
I got my dogs watchin constantly (what else, what else?)
With one hand in the baseball glove
Hella throwaways - and dangerous subs
For my protection and my protection only
This boss balla slippin whatchu thought I was phony?

Fresh up out my Coupe de Ville, I popped my collar twice
About my money this loot is real, plus I'm dipped in ice

Done washed my shoes, the gators they bite
Baby bright light but not my type
But if she want tonight, she come with dollars
She either holler, or pop a nigga collar

Without even sparing a thought on the freedoms we do have
It's ""please please please""

Freedom of Blame! Freedom of Abuse!
Spending money we don't have, every last penny
That's what you call freedom right?
Isn't that also freedom?
So, will you also sell that freedom?
Then, what in the world is freedom anyway?

When you reach out, there is freedom

Let's take a trip up the rainbow
It's sunny above the clouds

Get it back, Get freedom
Break it down, Break Kingdom

Isn't freedom to blame for that?
Isn't that what we need freedom for?
So, will we then buy freedom back again?
In the end, where exactly is freedom?

But what's that sitting right next to you?

It's gonna be a good night,
A good, good night.
She's showing me a different side,
What I've never seen before,
That I ignore.

'Cause when I'm up she's all about me,
When I'm down,
She spins around me,
Now I know I'm one and only,
So I might as well enjoy the ride.

The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.

That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,

I like Jack Benny's jokes.

I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

younawmsayin' son?
shit is real
yo, I'm from a place where niggaz get it on
and bullshitters get shitted on
and dead niggaz keep living on
and memories once the henny's pourin'
I see the sadness of so many mourned
yet the beauty of so many born
and the only man I trust is god
cause the devil come in many forms
on the day I rest eternally
I'll be a thug for eternity
the longer word is fire burning me
but you younger thugs could learn from me
love is love..",Intro,2004
Mizmarvel,"It's the sinister sister, leave mics so hot make hands blister
Try to catch me but all you heard was ""Damn you just missed her""
Daily means and whereabouts, more secret than a whisper
Cut sharper than a scissor, lookin for the love elixir
Like most listeners, let them know it's all in they reach
Spittin my verbal attack with the impeccable speech
How bout niggas, gotta keep your dog on a short leesh
Got 'head speak, If not they try to play us like suckas
The most commitment, wanted non commitment givin mothafuckas
Not sayin that all men fall in this category
But one look in his eyes and I can tell they whole story
Lookin for a friend or wife for late nate creep if he's horny
If he's sincere, got G, or pick up lines that corny
Tryin to say that he adore me, when he don't even know me
That type of weak game will leave a nigga, poor broke & lonely
Willin to go and stick anything that let's em stick 'em
'Cause through all that bullshit, he's lookin for anotha victim

Brrr, stick 'em, hahaha stick 'em

Perfect example, it was like Monday the 10th
Late afternoon, just on my king and it was time well spent
In any event, this niggas eyein me, it's evident
Try hard to cement, to ignore his twisted compliments
He seem hell bent for my time, a hundred percent
Asked to come to sit at my table, if I was the age of contended
And no why he would put himself through such torment
And despite the corny line, you could see the extent
That he would go, said he'd pay my rent, dress me and give me dough
Follow by cants and comments bout my bodies measurements
I said ""I don't drink moet, take loot to get bent
Or use niggas to pay rent, I'm independent""
His response that ""You heaven sent
But I haven't met a chick that ain't have a price yet""
I said ""Well, I must be a different type of female
While bitches waitin to exhale, I plot schemes to black male
Talkin bout, you wash your car, who you knew and your wealth""
A new expirement, thinkin this niggas playin himself
With just his arogance, not to exclude his rude attitude
How he pursued, relentless references to seein me nude
The wrong move, this jiggy nigga really thinks he's smooth
Like he got somethin to prove, and I got nothin to lose
I know his style, never ran into a femme fatale
Like you hearin right now, comin through ya ear canal
I smile politely, so as not to blow my cover
Carryin on conversation, knowin that I'm on some other shit
Should have stopped when he had the chance to quit
Talkin about his income, and how bout he want to get some
Next time we meet, he'll just be the next victim

[Chorus]

Like my girl Nina, bangin body and she was cute
But she'd only fuck with niggas if they had mad loot
Plenty ice, nice ride, but she'd always have to drive
Trying to compesate the shit, that as a youth she was deprived
She survived, only to end up to being 85
Talkin bout I played that nigga, keep it real baby...",Anotha Victim,1999

The first verse, perfect design conquest your desert thirst
Highly blessed, can't recept the evil luers curse
From the mansion to the slums, where the evil luers lurk
My life's work, want it so bad it hurts
I see three of a side, like nipples through at church
Mic experts, manipulate out through the universe
Bitches wit dicks, reveal how niggas livin in skirts
Perverts, I put to death and throw to hell head first
My word is plated gold, isin't equal the work
Mental birth can show signs of movin Heaven and Earth
Never deal or take car, wear your heart in your dirt
Rhymes baptised in fire and never been burnt

You can try me, until I can get under your skin like poison ivy
Words invincible, hit it strictly for the pledgin principal
Continual, pen is like my sword I feel the armor
Hypnotic melodies, never gympsy steak charmer
Hearts is eye, blaze a stronger than a marijuana
You think I'm done, no, got dot.comma

In camouflage, gone just like a desert mirage
Try to escape the fate, safe in proper sabotage

My verbal swordplay, bounces off the walls like richochets

While shootin stars wishing that I can shift my gears
So I raise my glass eye, I drink to that, say cheers
And let the fire water wash away the tears, burn like salt
On open wounds, thoughts consume all consetions
Give birth to these rhymes like an oral see-section
Uhh, positive connection throughout the galaxy
Time to switch to reality, make proper arrangements
for the souls of fatalities
It's the same for niggas that stuck with that slave mentality
Or these wack ass rappers, they got no originality
But my mentality, helps me travel around the galaxy
Time gets shorter, I'm on the water, run insanity
It seems like everyone was after me
Three's a nasty girl like Vanity
Make niggas wild, I smoke la, anything to keep my sanity
Ain't got no friends, everyone with me is family
If they standing next to me, nothing's what it seems to be
Sending energy, when I rhyme, but no time for idol questions
If freestyling is my bible, when I fall in hip hop sessions
Of the tribal blessings, lessons to be learned
Respect had to be earned and not given
On the fourth of them but not amongst the men that living
Guy collides, when selfish minds can't asked to be forgiven

when past spirits have risen

Into it seems like magic mushrooms, from the womb to the tomb
I got a meetin in the ladies room, I be back real soon
O-o-oh o-o-o-oh
And all pro, precise position, like a crossbow
To strike the deathblow, continue with a never ending flow
Friend or foe, gas heads go from C.E.O. to skid row
See the toxic green flow, it's poison waters overflow
Paint a mental picture, lyrical Michaelangelo
Words pierced with the sting of a scorpio
Beats mad bong, to collapse the Walls of Jericho
Overflow and explore, I hope you got your blunts rolled
'cause this is the same, no matter which zip code

Step on first month Capricorn, quiet storm

Elegants ruffness and innocence, if ever given a form
Hell have a fury like a women's scorn

It's more dips then dicks, and nobody get shot
Stay here a little minute, then go harvest my crop
By the moonlight, get lifted and call it a night
But first I bump in this princess named Shaniqua Albright
She was lookin mad right, and her body was mad tight
Total control of my will, she couldn't put up a fight
She said if you wan't me take, 'cause I have an early flight

Pimpin hoes was some shit that came easy to a playa
Cause ain't no way in hell a bitch could get me to a bail
And how in the fuck I'll ever make some money if I'm pail
My hoes sell pussy at the party for the mayor
400 for the chewin, 100 for the mackin
1,000 for the fucking, 200 for the jackin

Can't help it cause you don't know, ain't my fault that you stuck up
Ya parents didn't teach ya, the streets didn't reach ya
I'm makin easy money from the judge and the preacher
The mayor likes the bitches cause they beat him with a chain
The judge and the preacher love to hear dirty thangs
The governor was first on the bitch payin list
He busted a nut soon as the bitches touched his dick

[Verse 3: Eightball]
Comin out smooth, livin like a pimpsta
Gotta flee the bitches and they all call me mista fat mac
Pimp tight, what the fuck you want to do?
See me in the streets, sweep 'em off and down you and your crew
Gotta be ruthless, smackin hoes toothless
Suckas gettin dropped when I'm poppin with the glock bitch
And the niggaz that hide cap and act like hoes
When they see the 93 with the switches and the voes

[Girl]
Eightball, tell the truth
How yo fat ass goin be doin all that?
Talkin bout pimpin and shootin up niggaz
And braggin bout fuckin, what'z up wit that?

But I'll jump up quick, and stick my dick in yo ass
And for you niggaz that talk shit, don't step too quick
You know who got my back, a clip full of hollow tips
Tec, 9 millimeter, glock or 22

And plus the government ain't never paid dem tricks enough
And every time a cop bust some dope in the drug rade

While I'm makin money off the shit that I done fronted
Nigga fell short, shoot 'em up yeah I done it
MJG Pushin real not cut
Got the feds in my pocket, and the chief by his nuts

[Verse 7: Eightball]
Roll a fat bud, smoke the bitch and then I'm chilled
Fall off in the club drinkin yak dressed to kill
Niggaz that be jealous cause dem hoes be on the jock
Don't disrespect my pimpin or you I will have to drop
No I don't be playin, what I'm sayin what I speak
Some niggaz don't understand then I have to go and teach

My so called friends, they had no ends to lend me.
My job at Mickie Ds was fuckin me with no grease
I worked so damn hard, but the money, it never increased.
I quit my fuckin job, I had no job nigga
Put on the mask, get the gloc, it's time to rob nigga.
I hit the streets, but no victim had been chosen
Damn I was nervous, but my fear wouldn't stop my strollin.
Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I was struck
I felt the burn of bullets, so I knew I had got bucked.
Reachin for my tech, the bullets hit me in my chest
My eyes closed shut, and I thought I seen death.
I woke up at the med still woozy from my jackin
T-Money walked in and he told me what had happened.
I knew him from the hood, but I did not know him well
He drove a red jag, and I knew that he was bale.
He said he was rollin when he seen me in distress
He said he killed the muthafuckin niggas with his tech.
He offered me a job said he'd front me what I needed
I said that I was with it dreamin one day I would be..

8Ball: I hit the street slaning ya-yo, then I sold up my block
Sellin 8, sellin deals, sellin $20 rocks.
Sellin dimes, sellin nickels to the junkies on my tracks
Gettin my dick sucked with the crumbs from the crack.
Some fool tried to jack me, but he only had a knife
A clip full of hollow tips took the bitches' life.
Standin on the track, my mobile rung and it was T
""Hello?"" -- ""Yo Eight, be the fuck aroung 3"" --""Aight!""
I met him at the park, he had a job for me again
Rob some Columbians, and get my ass in.
Hit for 30 birds, if I live, I'd get five
I smoked them damn Columbians, and then got what was mine.
All the time, my clientel rappidly increased
My bank got bigger, that's when bitches started jockin me.
Cars and clothes had me fuckin different hoes
A fat bank roll was keepin me cool with the 5-O.
I had niggas workin under me to take the heat
I never touched the dope, makin a 100 Gs a week.
I gained respect, I'm the biggest playa of all time
Don't ever fuck with me, cause I'm ...

8Ball: Chillin at the club with T-Money and J-be
Lil Adrian and Boo, and my nigga, MJG.
I had the bitches staring at the twinkle of my diamonds.
Drinkin on this Yak, makin my way to the back.
When I saw this little bitch lookin finer than the rest.
With a long black weave and a tight red dress.
I started conversatin, but she didn't want to talk to me
Straight up to the hotel room, now the bitch is suckin the
Dick of this nigga that is smarter than the bitch thank
Then she got up, now somethin in the air stank.
She went in the bathroom and locked the door behind her
I got off the bed and grabbed the tech from the dresser.
Stood by the door when it opened, niggas came out
Grab my muthafuckin gun, ""Hey nigga!"" *pow pow*
Then, I grabbed the girl cause some more niggas had busted in
Shot that bitch in the dome with my muthafuckin chrome
Shot up all the niggas, but I took one in the leg
When the cops busted in, I was laying on the bed.
Walked up out the room, did I go to jail?
Hell no! They can't stop me..
Long live Mr. Big Ho!!!!

MJG,"(Eightball)
Ah yea
Eightball & MJG in the muthafuckin house
We came here today to talk to about this thing
called pimpin
It has been misunderstood over the years
so now we have come to set the record straight
niggas don't do this shit right
it takes a special kind of nigga
you know what I'm sayin
yeah

It takes a nigga dat hard from the start
you gotta have heart
to meet a bitch, mack hard down, then rip her apart
it's all in the game, a nigga can't change
if you don't break a bitch
then your game is lame man
see I'm from Tennesee
wit curls and gold teeth
so every were I go, bitchs strike up conversations wit me
about the way I talk, about the way I dress, about
how my gold teeth look so fresh
see how I bait a man, seen as a nigga speak
that deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
I'm in my cadallic, chillin like a fatmack
smoking on a fat sac, drinkin' on a pint of yac
I pick up my car phone, call the freak beat
It's my nigga baby mama, but sometimes I creap
that's just the way it is, niggas have to take a chance
when you ain't around, anybody could be in dat ass
But I just a young nigga, trying to make a dolla
and they way I live, to some it's hard to swalla
see livin' down south ain't what you think it be
nine times out of ten niggas like me
pimps

Ya that's right
we trying to teach all these lames, you know
how to do this shit
cause it's really a hard job
but them lame niggas
they make me get so high

(Chorus)

I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
I get so high
and I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

(MJG)

Now let me explain a pimp
a nigga about the m-o-n-e-why
see a hoe, break a hoe
and try to influence the bitch, to a trick the nigga who
persuaded her to sell ass like hoes suppose too
now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin
surrounded by all these hoes
that's going and givin me money
it's funny how a hoe can make you think she wit ya
when all the time
she's just another niggas gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
take care of your business
bring me the money, ya this shit is thick
hoe don't violate, bitch I know I taught you better
take all of cash, grab on his ass
write dat trick a love letter
train your woman to break a man
man meeting another nigga
just some shit in the game, same-o-same
to make you pimpin thicker
slicker the pimpin gets, freaker gets the bitch
MJG is rich, I'm coe-coe for this tricks
I pimp

Ya that's right baby 
I pimp
so uh, what you need to do is sat dat ass there
and uh, right about now, I bout to fire up one of these spliffs
and get so high

(Chorus) 2x

(Eightball)

Part 2
It's all the same G
trying to school fools, on this P-I-M-P
lession one
first you should pull a bitch, fuck her good
next time tell her no, the next time take her dough
oh, you better watch your back to man
cause there's a lot of bitchs in the world wit much game
lession two
watch dat hoe, don't trust her wit none of yo dough
never let a bitch know, how you much yo cash flow
lession three
if you don't tell dat hoe who is boss
bitchs like to run shit 
but end up getting smacked in the mouth
see a real nigga believe in beatin them hoes down
push they head into the wall until you hear dat crackin sound
drown in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
some niggas get pussy whipped and fall into them love bugs
buying hoes this, buying hoes that
then bragging to your friends
how you fucked her from back
never how you took they cash, never how you beat they ass
never how you pull hoes, fuck them, then dropping fast
I don't understand your plan at all man
but you should be around niggas like me 
pimps

Ya man
this niggas is a trip, you know what I'm sayin
but niggas like me, I have to smoke them spliffs
to get my mind off dat shit, and when I smoke um'
I get so high

(Chorus) 2x

Wherever there's a hoe
there's bound to be a pimp
the pimp supplys his bitchs wit some tricks 
dat they can tempt
a sucker will spend his money, till he ain't got nothin left
instead of blamming the bitch, he needs to blame it on himself
it wouldn't be hoe, if it wasn't for the tricks
but I suggest we keep em', so a pimp can keep his bitch
It needs to be understand, there wouldn't be one without the other
so why the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka
jealous suckers just mad!!!
they can't hang with the pimp thang, looking to sprinkle some salt 
in a pimps game
how in the fuck do you figure pimpin is dead when nigga you know it's alive
pimpin is misunderstood by those who can't, that's why they said it died
others tried pimpin, but were only makin chump change
one track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
rearrange shit dat they done seen in a movie script
dam ain't dat a bitch, niggas like me
pimp

MJ fuckin G, P-I-M-P
staying down on this pimpin bout' these hoes
but some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
and dat shit just makes me get so high

(Chorus) 5x",Pimps,1993
MJG,"[MJG]
1 to the muthafuckin 2 to the muthafuckin 3
The sound of the boom is sweatin ya hard like a mystery
Could It be
The pimps could rule the nation in '93'
And MJG is gonna start a new race
Replace the weak tapes we got in the first place
And chase that live on cops quick, out the hood
And beat that ass like a cop would real good
And keep that bud goin on like the Flinstones
And shake them bones when you feel the ? comin on
See up in the ground, down a hit and lean back
Look at ya self and see what I'm sayin is real fat
Society lives off what the media tells us
And niggaz be joinin up wit the shit that they mail us
See pimpin ain't dead yet, see pimpin can pay the rent
And pimpin is demonstrated by those in the government
The money they send you ain't shit but nickels and dimes
And you been stuck in the ghetto since 1979
But it's time to switch it up, unhook it and fix it up
Change it and rearrange it, complete and pick it
It's a book with hard covers that's packed with ideas
We rule the future years
Erase the black fears
And change the system, step up and dismiss them
Tricks from the White House
Move in and they move out
Now I'm runnin thangs, my workers walk wit a limp
My whole staff is bitches and all the judges is pimps
If ya weak in the game, thangs are bound to show
'cause a pimp got a stroke, and a wimp can't flow
And I ain't no muthafuckin fall guy, but Imma try hard
To let you know this pimpin ain't gone never die
M.J.G pimp tight
Young black nigga, no wife
No children, just hoes
Supplying the muthafuckin nation wit a dose
Of what, has been injected and now it's on
The muthafuckin pimp is in the house

MJG,"Good morning, class
This is your teacher, MJG
Look at me as I write my name on the board
Class, do you see my name?
Do you understand my name?

Well, listen
Okay
Class, today at Break-A-Bitch University
We will teach young bustas, playa-hatas
And all of these weak, narrow-minded young sissies
How to break a bitch
Now 
Really, it's so easy

Mister G, I have a question
Yes?
Pimpology today is different than it was in the 70s
Aha
I wanna know how can anybody stroll today 
And if so, what proceeds do we have to go through?

Well, check it out 
First here's what you have to do

{MJG:}
It's time to let the p-I-m-p in the fuckin front do'
One mo' nigga cuttin paper on the down low
It's so twisted in this white man's society
Why it be hard for a nigga when he try to be
Independent, on his own with a plan
You hate it cause you can't understand how I can
Rearrange and change how your daughter was raised
And teach her how to constantly get paid when she's laid
Ain't no use in bein the freak of the city, you still ain't got no ducats
You want a rolex or ride buckets?
Bitch, listen cause you gots plenty of competition from these other hoes 
Who think that you supposed 
To fall dead, short, lame to the game
Don't worry, put them bitches in your pistol range
MJ fuckin G settin your mind free with the type of knowledge
Class has started, day number one in Break-A-Bitch College

And today, class
We have a guest speaker, Mister Fat Mac
Please introduce yourself...

Good evening, players, good evening
Eightball the Fat Mac here
I'm here to let you know
That these bitches, mean these bustas no good
You see what I'm sayin?
Now first of all, class
Are there any questions?

Ah yes, Mister Eightball
You bein a Professor of Pimpology
Tell me how these niggas let these hoes
Get em caught up in that fuck shit

Alright buddy, check this out...

{Eightball:}
Once again here I come pushin that funk into your ear
Do you recall Eightball, the player of the year
Calm cause I'm cool, and I'm cool cause I'm calm
Leavin hoes shell-shocked like they fall in Vietnam
Mayn, some have game, but most of them can't handle this
Those that I think are stars, end up bein scandalous
Welfare recipients, crib full of rugrats
Boost a couple of shirts, and now the bitch think she all that
Freakazoids have a nigga noid steppin up to me
Hoes that'll fuck you fast might be packin H.I.V.
Me, I'm packin jimmy hats 
So a hoe won't give me that
Shit about she on the pill 
Knowin that her pussy kill
See, through my education illustrations were the key
See, where I'm from only bustas have to pay a fee
Now you might ask what can a nigga do to get started
Pull a hoe and go enroll in Break-A-Bitch College

Ah yeah 
Now that was a very nice lecture
And as I walk back over to the middle of the bulletin board
I - I kinda figured, I wondered to myself
And I looked at my class, and I
It seems that you have more questions
Is there any more questions?

Yes
Yes, Mister MJG
I have a question
Yes?
Ah - in 94
Do you think - ah
Any bitches are gonna come up?
Can - can any bitches be pimps?

Look here, look here
Let me tell you...

{MJG:}
Now these bitches got a lotta game for a nigga, so
That made me try to see how to break a hoe
What exactly would it take for me to make the bitch click
How damn quick could I make the bitch break a trick 
How fuckin long will it take to make my profit
And what kinda justice can this hoe do for my pocket
Talkin space-age pimpin, similar to the oldies
In ways like keepin our business tight, not by tryina be Goldie
These niggas gettin they game picked down to the bone
If you listen on what these hoes have to say, your money's gone
Nigga, focus on your own rhyme, make em follow your own rules
Don't be a fool, nigga, bring that bitch on by to school
I got a class for that ass, and it stars at seven
'I was a pimp' at ten o'clock, break till eleven
Future looks good for the smartest
Niggas in the school of Sir Break-A-Bitch College

Okay class, okay class
Everybody just needs to settle down
Everybody just settle down
We're gonna break in about 15 minutes
But we have one more lecture, one more lecture
Now ehm, eh 
Calm down, calm down
I'm gonna take one more question
I'm gonna take -
Are there any more questions?

Ah yeah - ah
I wanna know 
How can a ordinary busta like me 
You know, you know
...get in Break-A-Bitch College?

{Eightball:}
Not long ago I grew up as a youngster in this shit
When all I wanted to do is stick my dick up in a bitch
That dope made my ends, and my ends bought me weed
And all I wanted to see was them young bitches on they knees
Uncle Sam, damn, can I get a job, see
I don't wanna sell this dope, and nope, I don't wanna get out and rob
Today I was coolin like I usually do
I met this hoe after a show that wanted to chew me and screw
Now some busta-ass nigga woulda fucked the bitch
But at Break-A-Bitch College that's called trickin off your dick
On the corner ain't no pimps, real players are low-key
I'm on the verge of a splurge, settin up shop in Tennessee
Ain't no future for the lame, ain't no love in this game
Do you fuck them hoes and trust them hoes and love em with no shame?
9 times out of 10, trick nigga, if you do
Break-A-Bitch College got a scholarship just for you

Ah yes
Damn good class, damn good class
Wonderful graduates
I love em all, I love em all

Now class
Can you all join in with me
For our school alma mater
And let's sing it
I'm proud to be an alumni
From Break-A-College
I'm proud to be...

Grab me Swisher cut it up and fill it with weed, hit that hoe
In the head, and tell her get out of my bed you damn freak
Hopped into the shower for an hour, it was hot as hell
Got dressed and ran a gold comb through my curls
Walkin out of the house slow, tellin that hoe come on let's go
First I crack up the music then, hit the switch on my six-four
Candy coated paint, got the bitches at the bus stop sick
But at the same time on my dick, thick
Beat a bitch quick I'm sick, full of Swishers and malt liquor

MJG,"One nigga found dead in the bayou 
That's the beginning of this story that I'm telling you 
I was in the 9 tre smokin' a spliff on the strip 
Seen a little cutie with some bootie, stop to shoot the shit 
She was on my dick cause in the hood  I had a little rank 
She was the kind of ho tryin' to take a nigga for his bank 
But what she did not know  a nigga had a plan for that 
Take her out to dinner then knock that ass up in my Cadillac 
All of a sudden, my beeper started buzzin' on the side of me 
The code read 33, I knew it was MJG 
Step to the mobile phone, G was talkin' crazy 
This ho heard some niggas say them laws are out to get me 
That night, I was dumpin' that bitch in the ditch 
Did not know that I was doin' it in the presence of a snitch 
Got dope from the scenery, thinkin' I was scot-free 
And now, I'm ducki'n and dodgin' tryin' to keep it low-key 
Spliffed-out, ridin' in my hooptie on cloud 9 
Doin' about 50 when a nigga pass 1-Time 
Now they got a nigga faced-down on the sidewalk 
Talkin' all that punk ass rookie pig cop talk 
What was in my pocket, grabbin all my money and my beeper 
Ramblin' through my car, the pigs found my 9mm 
Now, I'm in the county callin' G to come and get me 
Wandering who is the snitch callin' these laws tryin' to sell me out 
Oh no! My mind is getting paranoid 
A nigga can't even trust his own homeboys 
As a result, I'm always alone 
except for some of the hoes I bone 
Most of the time, I watch the news while I get my smoke on 
Thousands after thousands on a lawyer who ain't doin' shit 
Locked up in this house a nigga 'bout to have a fuckin' fit 
Last night, I seen my face on the news G 
Some nigga who worked for me, slipped and lost an uzi 
Now, I'm on the run, livin' like a fugitive 
I thought to myself on the run ain't no way to live 
I thought I'd party hard and smoke and drank this century 
Now, I'm slowly dyin in this penetentery
No mercy, nigga",No Mercy,1994
MJG,"[ VERSE 1: 8Ball ]
Tell me what's goin on, damn, I need help to see
I have chains on my brain from the strain of the
Mental corruption eruptin through this industry
All I see is New York rappers back and forth on BET
See, I'm the first true southern funkadelic preacher
Drink a 'yac and smoke a blunt and watch it get deeper
But not so deep I have to perpetrate to gain respect
Instead of judgin me you need to get yourself in check
And I'm not gonna be the want to-be you want to see
Oh no, I cannot sell my soul

[ VERSE 2: MJG ]
MJG for the Nine-Fo, what's it gonna be?
Another year for the p-i-m-p in the street
Yes, it's me, the one who clocks when it's time to get explicit
It's comin from the truth when I kick it
So dear critic, you thinkin on terms of how it needs to be
I'm tellin you how it is and what I has to live and what I got to give
To the ears of the ones who want to listen
Some don't understand,, so they really don't know what they're missin
Hard times made hard heads in the South
You get respect bein real, no sell-out

[ VERSE 3: 8Ball ]
In '93 I was rappin about my curls and my Cadillac
The pimp blast, takin you fast, smokin grass and all that
Players got the message, busters didn't attempt to listen
Thinkin that we was talkin about that on-the-corner fake pimpin
Hell yeah, I'm that player from the underground
All-black assassin from the neighborhood of Orange Mound
They don't understand, why, they being society
The white people who run this nation got somethin against me
Me bein a young black male with an education
Teachin this pimpin, so the blacks will one day rule this nation
But every day another brother tries to kill me
Jack me because of the poverty in communities
Where you either have to sell crack or jack, man
What I'm tryin to stress to you is, don't step to the fat man
Because today I'm rappin, rockin shows and pullin hoes
But tomorrow I might be on the cut slingin dope
See, in the studio I'm killin fools vocally
But if it came down to it, I could do it silently
Fuck the President, the media can quote me
Listen to them lyrics, fool, I ain't sellin out, gee

[ VERSE 4: MJG ]
You gotta be hard in this business, ain't no suckers, ain't no sell-outs
It's the way that you go in it, that's the way you gonna go out
First of all: never break up with them hustlers that you started with
Long as this happens you and your click won't accomplish sh...
Should've thought about it real hard
Now how could any group that's meant to be together be apart?
And if you start with a strong mind, think with a strong mind
be	-you-s-i-n-e-ss time
I'm in the lab, chiefin hay, comin up with gold
Pimp mobile, hit the reel, let the platinum roll
See, I was taught, not the easy, but the hard way
Hustle after hustle after hustle each and every day
I gotta stay down to earth, cause I'm from Orange Mound
See, that's my hood, understood in the M-Town
Memphis-bound players, pimp type, black, strong, young 
Level-headed Tennesseee, hustlers got it goin on
Bad to the bone when I roam through the area
Carry a, automatic weapon for my burial
When it's all over what it is and what it's all about?

Graduated and made it from the college of dicks 
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me 
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key 
 
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckers go 
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well 
How the hell you been since I had no job 
Hum, why don't you give me some 
 
'Cause you know I flow and run for Suave 
Nah, all of that was on the couch 
No doubt why y'all records spin, why y'all shippin' in gold

Can't stay out the club 
All in the hoe's face 
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased 
 
I see him in the back 
Countin' up that cheddar 
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
I think I know one 
 
I remember you, oh yes I do 
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
What time the club close, at 3 
What's up, you comin' with me 

We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
You want some cheese 
Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
Hoes around my nuts like knots

Wants to get close to me

Let her loose or let her remain

A bigger name 
Look, this thang with bigger game 
And she claim she ain't heard my music

I said, ""What's really happenin?"" He said, ""I gotta pocket full of stones""

Now P, be dat new kid on the block
36 OZ's choppin' up rocks in my rock shop
And label me a drug deala, just anotha hard nigga
Rest in peace to 2Pac and the rest of y'all thug niggas

Playaz hookin' up, tryin' to make work
Sendin' work from FedEx to UPS trucks
Now P livin' lavish, caviar and cabbage
Peppers and beans and grits and cabbage

Down south hustlin', ballin', slangin'
Niggaz teamin' up, some niggaz gang bangin'
Used to drink 40s, now it's mo whet
Used to roll cutlass, now it's Benz's and vets

Beckett on my fingaz, Rolex watches
Hoes on the block, bounce that ass, I mean pussy poppin'
Label me an alien, just like Outkast
'Cause I made my money from the ghetto and I did it fast

'Cause I'm 'bout it, y'all know I'm rowdy
Ask Big Mo and John Henry if y'all doubt it
Hooked up with 8-ball and MJG
'Cause we tryin' to get a meal ticket from these streets

Tryin' to get a meal ticket

A nigga came to mention these hoes can't touch my pimpin'
Mobbin' through the swamp, P and me and G and UGK
Somethin' that a muthafucka fuck, what these hoes say?

'Cause we each be lookin for meal tickets, witches drivin' me crazy
Lady, can I claim yo' baby? Honey, call me the Shady, maybe
Construct the thinkin', we're turnin' to duckies bankin'
No laws somebody save me a slice of meat up in my grave

Captain save 'em, pay 'em, before you get to lay 'em
Got a real nigga's job, so damn hard tryin to play 'em
Weigh em, no weigh me, cause that's what they gon' pay me
Pimpin' ain't dead baby, just ask MJG

Who be I? MJG, he be me but if I was he
And you was I, who would you see? One of us is just
That when ya hungry, I do it only, pertainin' bustas
Fakes, and phonies, about that money, where my ticket?

Bad ass bitches can't leave my dick alone

Qhen bitches still givin' me head? Lickin' my ass if he'd be the deala

Suck the nut up out a [Incomprehensible] bucket slow down suave nigga
Now bitch I be the prison pushin' everythin'
A 4 for 4 doors, king of the quarters
Fuckin' with nothin' but queens and they daughters

Get cleansed, weeded, and watered, I flow like a Asian, Malaysian
Saudi Arabian, African I be blazin' in the Golden Gate, swish it out
Holdin' weight, I hits the block, I'm rollin' bait, them fiends come out
They know they got to stole the cake, I motivate

Fiends dealas, ballas, hatas, shops and boppas
Jekyll and Hyde, Bonnie and Clyde, and niggaz
That ride with glocks and choppas where we out

Here comes the one they call the P.I. -- M.P.
Straight out the cut no one can see I -- bust these
Way out of touch with all them bustas in my rear view
but see they game, so lame, I can hear through
I Hens doggin at the bar, actin real nice (real nice)
Six pack of Hen, straight up, with no ice -- tap me twice
Did you really want my full attention?
Sometimes my mind (intertwine) with the tenth dimension
I see you inchin to my ride, tired, rest them legs
Soon as you open up your mouth (uhh) there's the head
Now who I be, MJG, certified, mic controller
(Uncle Sam, I want you!) Trick bend over
I'm a petrified rapper talkin, and you ain't nuttin
but an electrified shyster walkin, I'm tired of savin
people from takin these dead end trips, I'ma just go
and bust this champagne upside your ship, alright you hip?
You in a hurry? You can't relate?
Don't ever say that I ain't try to set it to you straight
I'm out the gate before you hate but I'll be back again
You saw me faintly through the crowd but now I'm in the wind
Once again

[Chorus: Eightball and MJG]
In the wind, it's a bird, it's a plane
Now it be them hustlers with that skin tight game
In your mix, scopin you, scopin me
Eightball and MJG to the end, bustas we in the wind

[Verse Two: Eightball]
I sold my soul to this hustle, homeboy scratch what you heard
T front me a keyboard, I flipped it like a bird, word
on them streets be them Suave House beats
In the Benz blowin Sweets got your gal between my sheets
Speak -- I ain't have to say one little thang
The fame of my name blew the ghetto freak brain
Lookin for a meal ticket, she let me stick it
Wicked when she lick it, tryin to make me trick it
Girl, when I was broke it seemed all about the luxury
Now I got cheese, I got a pay a girl to love with me
But I'm a jelly worker, like Smuckers
Workin against them suckers, big facin just to love a
broad that done been around the world in a day
Bear lovin whoever got cheddar to pay
Ball like no trick ass, them shakers if I tip
I be drunk, in the club, smokin sticky cat nip
Slip, as if a banana peel was dropped in my path
into a body bodyworkin not discussin no math
Playa haters all around me as I stumble and grin
Snatch my vest, twist somethin, hit the rumble and then...

[Chorus 2X]
[Verse Three: MJG, Eightball]
I flip scripts on young dips who think they hip
Smoke up your whole zip, sess hydro or crip
Time and time again, stories have been told
About the super hustler dyin tryin to get the gold
Concrete jungle full of, carnivorous firearm
Hunger for flesh, and pray on who ain't strong
Heavy weighters, with plenty hoes that buy em alligators
In the wind, breakin all big ?

Pick artificial tricks stolen money makers
Money trees come in please, help a player shake a
million down to the ground, feel them hits fall
Ride with me I'll run your game into a brick wall, trick why'all
is what this false literary do, then reality come
(and snatch the natural dust out you) who speaks the truth?
Whose your leeches? Whose your friends?
I plan to bring the realness back again, but until then
I'm in the wind

Don't hold back, baby throw it don't front it
Give it to me good like you friend, girl touch it
Run it, straight down the center like a sprinter
5-4-3-2-1 enter

[Verse 1]
They talks a lot about ya vibe, ya makin' me feel ya inner thoughts
MJG, want to dip in the sauce
Knock it off, fantasy scenes of me and you
Plenty other women that dream of being you
Cute face, good attitude, small waist
Girl ya number one in the race the rest chase
Baby first of all ya look at me close searchin' for lines
Thankin' that you can get in my mind, thankin' that I'm
A lightweight, left fly straight in one wait
Lay it down over the world in one date
Pure P-I-M-P-I-N-G
Both of us grown no need to pretend we
Ain't prepared for the houses with the marble floors
Three staircases with the antique doors
All day, valet hit the place your ride
With thirty-five rooms just in case you tired
Amazon, let's have a marathon in the bedroom
Come stout, 6'3"" with any leg room
I know what to do if ya know how to act
Now say it to yourself baby don't hold back

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
As we begin ya perfume clouds the room, Soft Rain
Sprinkle down homie massage away the pain
I been standin' here scopin' ya girl from across the club
Suave House outtas for real, show us some love
We can peel  off into the night and do it right
And leave two streaks in the street and we outta sight
Space-age, still don't nothin' move but the hits
So baby shake it to the front and the back right quick
Last call for alcohol, what do you prefer (Baby I don't drink)
Well that's cool what about hers
Swang it over to me sugar I don't need no slack
Let me see it, let me see it girl don't hold back

[Hook x2]

I see you lookin' at the ice
Thankin' bout a way to be my wife
Dollars signs in ya eyes, not tonight, skirt tight
To the hip, bend over bust a whole to the slip
Now mesmerized gauging at the lips on the tip, of that thang
Shaved down lookin' high hay
Freaky thoughts travel through my brain all day
Listen baby, when I saw you in that mini-skirt
It made me want to really go to work
Wonderin' could I get them legs straight up in the sky
Lay down and watch the silly fed blaze roll by
You and I kick back when we through gettin' high
Intoxicated folks don't lie, don't try
I can picture us posted in the bed buck wild
Humpin' like it's goin' outta style, stay awhile
Now smile, naw better yet say ahh
Do it in the back of a car like a star

[Eightball]
It was some what early, I was on my way
To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I'm full of them trees
A dog want to hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please
These H-Town freaks be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin' on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin' machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin' grinnin'
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin'
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain't you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be
Imagine it, you and me, in the middle of the night

[Hook]
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really want to hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here

[MJG]
I was chillin' at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I'm bored I ain't did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That's a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what's up
She said (What's on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We straight ya ain't gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin' at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin' there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she want to romance, did she want to hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin' on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin' on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I'ma be a lil' late gettin' in)
Now I was feelin' kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these windows is around
Let's me and you do what we gotta do to get through
The rest of this episode, hold on tight
Let's re-write in the middle of the night

[Hook]
[MJG]
I'm on late night mission top let down
That's the way I gotta flip when I be
Feelin' 'ike I want to take a dip in the wind
Night-life livin' all the way to the end
It's just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin' in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I'm gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin' in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin' in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin' out the few tail I'd like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin' out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees in a fresh set of keys
Now I'm fixin' to break em' to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I'ma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin' me off from my flight

160 miles per hour on Greentrees 
Really ain't no reason to try and pretend these 
Hoes ain't down and willin' to bend knees 
I ease 
Up off of my gas to smash brakes 
I'm gazin at a stout piece of ass at high stakes 
To make it to the top of my game what will it take? 
I gots to get some glue in my life  before I break 
Shake rattle and roll hold the dice until I can't 
It's time for G to toss up in the paint 
Pimpin' ass real nigga 
I squeeze big ass and big trigga 
And leave hard weak ass niggas in big rivers 
Who in the fuck got stuck you bucked and outta luck 
Lookin to find trouble with me, now that's enough

Bust on wax and rip tracks by T-Mix 
Hated 'cause I talk real shit bout a freak bitch 
Peep this I don't give a fuck about what

The bullet just an inch from your brain 
Live and he'll stop 
You talkin cash shit but you writin' them rubber checks 
And still don't know the way to commit with a brotha yet

Shame to find they in a hurry for a death day

Bringing action to the field whenever you niggas ready
When you hear the rubber burn, I'm hanging up out the Chevy
With a straight aim, nigga I blew em' up out the frame
Street tops scattered with tricks with false game
You can't pull me off of my toes, I'm still tippy

Say look at me baby, I've been looking at you too
Trying to understand the thing that you want MJ to do
Ain't it funny how the time easily slips away
I've been thinking about you sugar every moment every day
And we lay upon the beach we can each get cosy
On the other end where the people don't know me
Show me, any little thing that you feel like
Let me know the spot that gets you hot and make it feel right
Introduce some plans, to the elementary game
We can be connected with a number and a name
Strange how women make you chase them for awhile
Then when you approach them they get timid like a child
Ain't no sugar in my tank, no deductions in my bank
Never never, mad mad this steels to clever
But I'm trying to get her on a trip of my world
Seven days, six nights -- that girl

That girl, that girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

Take a nigga baby can we get out, go oversea
Don't mind at the house bring you body with me
I've been really taking notes on the way that you maintain
You're one out of akind entitled to the same thing
Opportunity knocks for you girl let it be
Yet it don't stop to the ?
I know you've wondering how long could it last
But trust in the future and let the day be the past
I'm taking you dancing, you've just got good legs
But all I vision is some real good times
That we could be having in the blink of an eye
Impossible dream we can achieve if we try
It's the brother who cut for youMentally and physically
What would it take for you, do you really want to get with G's
My mission to hold my angel my pearl
But we still live as strangers -- that girl

That girl, that girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I should surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

You look marvellous in your jeans, that queen
Thinking about the entrance you made at the club scene
You know you're looking goodSo I just let it ride
Too many in the hood that have already tried
They said you be looking for things I can't produce
Like a fast life, and quick dreams
To tell you the truth, competiton is blowing my hustle about position
Concidences keep us apart
It's hard to listen to somebody that you don't even trust
you don't know
Places that I want you to come, you don't go
Half all playing the game of cat and mouse
But before you start running your mouth or getting out
You don't want a man, you want somebody to play with
Knowing it's impossible for you to stay with
So real don't forget that I said
Probem is went to her head

That girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl) x2

I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)
I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
Girl if you don't want to (don't want to)
I won't force you (force you)
I want to find someone who wants to be right here right in my world
I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)

One time
Beyotch
Yeah, you know how they like it baby, nigga you can't retire!

From nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight
I don't stop rappin' like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell em instantly (instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (pimp in me)
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin' to sleep with me
Every night, sold out, turnin' young hoes
Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin' on twenties wearin' nice clothes
but ain't nuttin' like pimpin' hoes, and ridin' Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin' this
opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song

Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin' white boys, bumpin' dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin' it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin' sellin' cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin' raps
All about my snaps, tryin' to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin' it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin' hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
$hort Dawg, I don't know why you tryin' to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin' more than them niggaz movin' weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin' game, now let's get out here and make this loot

I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
We some presidential players, with money by the layers
Ain't nuthin' you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
and meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes

I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin' crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin' eyes scarred, bein' weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon' help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin' fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin' straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
was rappin', sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game

I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I live the fast life of a MC
and I sell a lot of records makin' pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin', sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway

My way (pimp til I die) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin' me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin', how far this shit is goin'
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin' bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes

MJG,"[Eightball talking]
Ay dawg, check this out (uh)
Peep this..
I met this lil' chick the other day (yea)
Talkin 'bout some super stout
Super stout, she put it on ya boy
Yea I promise ya, she put it on ya boy

[Eightball]
It all started in the mall
She said ""Hey, ain't you Eightball?""
I said ""I'll be whoever you want me to be""
She was fine like a supermodel, Naomi
Out to the truck me and this ho bounced
Thirty minutes later we was on my couch
Remy, X.O. and green sticky weed
She hit it like a pro, didn't choke, didn't heave
We talked for a minute, you know how shit go
Two people get close and they jump off bro
I kissed her on the back of the neck, she got wild
Beggin me to hit it doggie style
Long story short, shorty got that fire
If I tricked off, I'd trick it on her
She said she got a man, but he ain't shit
He give her everythang but love and good dick
Time went on, we kept in contact right
But never really hooked up, and never got tight
I wish I coulda got with her one more time
Then maybe, I woulda never wrote this rhyme

[Hook - Eightball] 2x
She's always on my mind - I want to be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her
She's always on my mind - I want to be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her

[MJG]
She was 5'6, redbone and lye chick
Ain't no way she could disguise it
When her eyes hit, my eyes, it was a trance in it
Only thang that I was thinkin was in her pants
She was holdin my wood with a tight fist
I whispered, into her ear ""I know you like this""
She said ""I'm ridin wit'chu"" Damn right bitch!
I'm a pimp and I ain't got all night shit
I got a reserve ticket for a ho want to kick it
Get down lick it, 'cause I'm feelin you down wit it
She was certified, equipped with pussy grip
I ain't buyin a bitch a room, I'll fuck her off in my whip
Feel my rib-tipped, that triple bit Trojan
Fo' den hunnie, it's up in ho land
Up to the windowsill, knockin it off
Then I stuck it in your grill, I'll beat it up
Seein as how you, treated me - Knowin that I was pimpin
Before I understood what it meant, I broke women
MJG, breakin 'em in - mentally and physically
Mind, body, and money - shimmy shimmy

[Chorus] 2x

[MJG]
She was always right there, on the tip of my mind
Makin me look at other women blind
Every motherfuckin time I find myself lookin for a phone number
I'm gone, I'm alone, I want that women
When I see her, I'ma let her know how I feel about her
Be a pimp tight, real nigga with skills outta town
Lookin for the one that got me hypnotized
Hips and thighs, glimpsin eyes, trippin now
Go'on the same, ready to knock it off friend
When she admit it's time, I'm lock it in
Head straight to the hood, and snatch a six-pack
Tell the folks that I'm with, that I'ma get back
I think her name was uhh.. shit I can't remember
But I know she was a cute, lil', stout tender
Ready to put it down, whether rain or shine
She always, always, always..

[Chorus] 4x

[MJG whispering] 4x
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind

You hide we find you
Creep up from behind you
And leave you with some heat that will always remind you

You niggaz need to quit givin cheese out

Yo' wife wanna leave out
But when she pull them keys out
A bunch of that please baby please

But what we be'z bout is big body 
When we roll up in ya after party
Been smokin wait but hold up, stop, don't tell nobody

Unless you stressed to be an absentee perminately

Bout that real shit and bout these shady ass hoes
I hit the block when I was 12 and I ain't never leavin'
Kept a grip and kept on tippin' right through drought season
Never been a hater even at my lowest level
Some niggaz get some change and sell they soul to the Devil
I'm drinkin' Dom, man I'm chiefin' on some green sticky
Space Age Pimpin' and my real niggaz rollin' with me
Glocks and K's and Rugers with the rubber grip
Got 'Tel two-way transmittin' on my hip
Keep it real with them niggaz that be real with me
Orange Mile forever reppin' Memphis, Tennessee - MJG

Him and me, me and him, that's how we rolled
Over ten million records sold, Platinum and Gold
We broke the mold, ain't no duplicatin' the two
Who makin' hit shit in clutch situations
And demonstratin' the real quality of a team which consists of
Eightball & MJG, we do this shit 'cause it feel good
First of all, we sacrificed for it
But afford it, then motherfuckers sheist for it
In the jungle of concrete just within one beat
Of the heart you can be taken apart
Ain't no regret but scars from my battlin' hard tactics
I think I'll roll with the paper, you can keep the plastic

I know you niggaz got doe
I saw you in them videos
I know you niggaz stay high
I saw you at the club right?
I know you niggaz keep hoes
I saw you with them freak hoes
I know you niggaz got it made
I saw you on the front page

I've seen a lot of niggaz come and go
Saw some shit fall and seen a lot of shit grow
Money here, money gone like a magic trick
Real hustlers hustle with or without that shit
I get my grind on daily 'cause I wanna see
Me and my niggaz gettin' paid 'til we elderly
And it ain't hard if we all put that work in
Keep it twerkin 'til they close the fuckin' curtains
We all dream and we all have fantasies
Every nigga wanna buy that house for mama G
But life is like a roll of the dice, right
Sometimes you win and sometimes you just might
Lose it all, fucked up sick and don't know what to do
That's when you find out who really down to bust for you
I rock and roll from my heart and let my soul glow
And don't worry about what a nigga think he know, ya know?

[Chorus]

Nothin' but 24/7 - 365
Eleven to eleven I be off in the fire
Of this revolution, the solution is what I'm spittin'
Fat stacks of green backs is what I'm gettin'
Jaw bones and microphones, that's what I'm hittin'
I'm hangin' on the edge of the cliff with no mittens
Thick flickin', chrome smokin', preferred potion
Man will never touch my flow, deep as the ocean
When you go down too far and you - can't seem to light
Best to look out for that pressure baby, it bust pipes
I got too much fight - in my heart, body, my insight
Is magnifyed a thousand times, more than the average guys
My status lies right before you with no disguise
The black mack is here to step up and so I rise
My shit has gone way past cold, it's freeze dry
One brain can't do what I do, you need five

You gotta say it baby
The company you keep
It change daily baby
How did you get the Mercedes and the Escalade lately
How come its been trouble in the places you stayed lately
The black cat affair
A broken mirror
Two steps up under the ladder would bring me near her
To good luck that fucking with you
You make the sun rain
The same moment you left
that's when the fun came

Always bumping like a bad lady ho quit that
Straight up ask a nigga to pay when he want to hit that
Always want to drank my Hennessey
And smoke weed
Take you out to see a movie
Hoe please

I could hit you in the car and it'll be just as fun

You built with fly paper

Instead of working you be begging trying to get rich quick
Faking acting like you interested just 2 hang around

Tellin them about the famous niggas that you know

Would will ill be grippin' in my big boy truck
Back then at the club gettin' this big boy sucked

If its 'bout Hennessy and weed you can link it to us
If I feel you disrespectin' Ima cock it and bust
And MJG gon be right with me if that eight ain't enough

If Eight ain't enough 
Don't worry I got eight in the clip
Eight for them hard looks
And eight for that lip
It was unnecessary
That sort of punishment was less than very ugly
Which was fucked up 
You wanted this you lucked up then
Oh well  some more shit I'm stuck up in 
Hey lets squash it  
Go sweep the dust up then 
Drink a shot 
I got a bitch you could drive a truck up in 
MJG pimp tight! And I got em

I fuck with them niggaz who run the hood
From the south to the east coast to the west
I be puffin on that shit that gon be burnin' in yo chest
See them hoes want a nigga who got bread
These niggaz want a bitch you got that fire head
And all I want is weed and money
And mo' money
The streets don't respect a nigga with no money

Ya poor dummy  
You should be spendin' ya ho money
When she offered you some 
You probably tell her ""no honey""
You to slow sonny
What I'm spittin' gon make you know somethin'
So the next time instead of just talking 
You could show something
And most hoes is like casinos 
Pistol blow somethin'
So anytime a bitch approach me 
I see some dope coming
My main focus is tricks who be out ho huntin'
But they don't get that pussy for free
I make em owe somethin'

[Chorus: x8]

I like them yellow thick women giving love to me
Hugs and kisses disrespecting bitches 'cause of me
Always want to sex with me no matter where we be
All her friends do my friends and they do it for free
Okay we smoke with them hoes and get em something to eat
But any real nigga will just to drill baby
Pimp hard or pimp harder for the millennium
That paper out here for ya Ima get me some

Hit a liquid some
Tell my bitch to quick get the gun
We got some shit to run so shut up and cut off the grits they done
I want you up on your feet until they blitz the song
Bitch you understand what I'm sayin'
I'm the official one
Mjg I pimp strong until the reasons gone
Until it ain't no hojack left to spring the season on

First I came with a game plan (what) next I tried it
Now what you know about that money in her snatch
When she promised you that she was givin' you the whole stack
Can't be no lover slash pimp nigga, or a player slash good boy
You either be real or Mr. Goodjoy
Cause ain't no such thing as love at first sight
But it's a such thing that you was on them drugs the first night
It's mandatory for me to appeal to the women
Keep it real with the women, but let them tricks deal with the women
And when you in the field with them women
Watch 'em, they start talkin' love shit stop 'em
Cause ain't no hoe supposed to have no emotions
Her job is to keep a trick broken and hopeless

Tradin' big faces hopin' you can stick your dick in
And she will do whatever for a dollar bill
Suck dick and lick clit on them X pills
High heels and big thighs make a dick ride
Make a nigga spend a grip and think of plenty lies
Lookin' deep in your eyes and don't mean none of it
I got the pie, you got to work if you want some of this
Where you from bitch, don't nothin' come easily
I got somethin' for you if you got somethin' for me

[Chorus - X2]
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch

[MJG]
For four and a quarter you can get a hoe and a order
A Barbie doll bitch or a hoe from across the border
A loose bitch, a tight bitch, whatever you like
With the certain group of paint brushin' bitches consider priceless
Nut drinkers, butt spankers, dominatrix
Most ain't really with that rough shit but some can take it
One hundred percent born and bred, pimp type
Hoes make my money off of goin' to bed

[Eightball]
Givin' head, hookin' niggaz like a cigarette
Niggaz plea and pay fees, just to get a hit
Skin tight, with no hair so you can see the clit
White hoes, black hoes and hoes that Hispanic
Pierced tongue feel good when she workin' wood
Platinum Visa, PIN numbers and them check books
Turn it in, help a nigga get a new Benz
Turn out your friend, let me be both of y'all man

[Chorus - X3]
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this

Roll through, one deep, heat in the waistband
Jealous-ass niggas might try and touch a made man
Crazy rap fans, followin' my rap van
Wanna get a hug, wanna shake a playa hand
Smoke somethin', I'm a fiend for the sticky green
My whole team keep it clean like a pinky ring
Hardcore like a scene in Cabrini Green
Plenty green get a young nigga anything
Excursion, Escalade with the big rims
Denim suits, soulja rag with my gold Timbs
Poppin' pills like a nigga eatin' M&M's
Shoppin' deals at the table wit the best of them
Leave the rest of them, way in the back
Weak-ass rappers get smoked like a sack
Fat Boy did that, didn't nobody help me
MJ to the G

Do you really wanna get buck?
Then tell the truth, I don't give a fuck
Each day is a blessin', I'm a live it up

I never seen a, party crunker than the one I'm in
Bitch pullin' contest we done won again
We hit the scene all the women start swarmin' in
I feel like I died, went to heaven and born again
Pimp tight, MJ fuckin' G
Death wish meant for anybody touchin' me
I'm a hit the dance floor with a attitude
Who's the killer now? Tell me who's the badder dude?
Who's the one who ain't afraid to let the bullets fly?
If you know you ain't gon' use it, why you pull it why?
Do you really wanna kill me and do time?
And leave ya kids and ya girlfriend left behind?

[Chorus]

Do you really wanna hit the sauna, with some bitches and marijuana?
Sailboats offa the beaches of California
Getcha game tighter as a fist and the ice that's on it
Y'all ain't crunker than us, ghetto performers

Corner on a nice day, nigga just thought I'd warn ya
Eightball and MJG, we the buckest
Dope shit nigga, roll us up in the Duchess

One of the hardest niggas that you will ever meet
Two of the hardest niggas to bust over beats
It's all real, never fantasy or incomplete
Incomplete emcees just can't compete
Hear defeat, I'm elite when I grab a sheet
Grab a pen and compose what my life hold
Fuck what a nigga stole I'ma still roll
Fifty deep, fifty feet from you weak hoes

[Chorus]",Do You Really,2001
MJG,"Anyway it doesn't matter much how you feel 
You know what you got to do I'm here to do it  
How about you?  

Our age five years old 
We were young bucks 
Scrubbin' each others backs in the bathtub 
Babysitter would send you to bed 
But she would make me stay up 
So she could give the young playa some viscious head uh 
Early symptoms of 
Time of nightway 
Gigantic factor from the 
Caukenis bitch tamer 
Some had it all though 
But less unfortunate 
You had an alloy spoke Mongoose 
And I had a Huffy 
You owned a green machine 
Three different lunch pails 
I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails 
We grew up in the church together nigga 
Sunday school 
Now I heard you off into jackin' nigga 
That ain't even cool 
I used to be conned, racked, fucked around, 
And ripped bad 
Barking up on the wrong tree 
Talking about runnin' up in my past 
Niggas have hateful thoughts 
But they stop me from strivin' 
Suckas be shakin' salt 
All in his gameful so find 
Some fools be gettin' crossed 
Victims of 40-ness 
Man all that drama you come with 
I swear you on some shit 
Whether it's morphine or cocaine 
Doja or dog food 
They had these marks for Tre and Max 
Fuckin' off my high breakin' rules 
You got ya P's mixed up 
You ain't no pimp 
You's a forty 
I spit for major mix 
While you make tapes for ya homie 
And then you work up tha nerve 
To speak fair words 
The pimp, a traitor, we instigators 
That's why I wrote this verse 
For every youngster with his mind on his meal 
Young playa just chill 
And take a look at what these fakers call real 
Nigga 
I trust no man, 
'Cause man will let you down every time 
That's why I take it upon myself to thank god in every rhyme 
'Cause I've seen better times 
And I've seen worser days 
When some of my so called friends 
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say 
I quench my thirst today 
With righteous thoughts of mine 
'Cause righteous thought of mine will leave mark ass niggas far behind 
I seen it every time 
They come and go 
That's why I drop to my knees 
And ask god to distinguish friend from foe 
And what do you know 
By the time morning comes I can see the light 
And then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right 
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene 
Countin' greens 
Straight from H-town to New Orleans 
New human beings puttin' it down like a mic or not 
Replace the slot open up shop 
We 'bout to make it hot 
Stop 
With ya devilish doins 
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin 
Friend or foe, you just will never know 
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold 
Playa hatin' is everywhere I go 
Friend or foe you just will never know 
Listen 
I'm tryin' to tell you my nigga to watch cha back 
And trust few 
Cause ain't no nigga goin' watch ya back for you like you 
When someone is broke and down and out without no clout it's rough 
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust 
See let me explain myself and clear up the point I'm tryin to make 
Don't want no bustas around me 
Playa hatin' or actin' fake 
Don't ever be wantin' nobody to get to close 
I don't know if it's effects of 
From the marijuana that got me more than trippin'
See nowadays tha nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot 
But if my loot was gone would I be all alone? 
See, my partners who used to ride with me 
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes 
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll? 
Maybe they will, maybe they won't 
Who is to say what a nigga will do 
Who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help 
You 
See what I'm sayin', listen to me and see if you can dig this 
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people receive ends 
Now all of a sudden I'm actin' funny because my moneys loaned 
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home 
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin' you don't already know 
Personal business, you got to watch who you friends is 
I'm thinking about hard times 
Freeing my mind 
Who in the fuck goin' be my crutch? 
Holdin' me up, helpin' me out 
Makin' sure that I stay in touch 
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to? 
When I be low on my cash 
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin' bout kickin' my ass? 
Who is my friends who is my foes? 
Who do I ask, when I want to know 
Somethin' about somethin' but I don't know nothin' 
My ignorance be keepin' me out in the cold 
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride? 
In somebody elses car 
How do I get from point A to be	 if be is just to far? 
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone? 
Who's goin' to give me the permission to make a decision 
To come up in they house and live 
When will I drive a BMer takin' my clothes to the cleaner 
How can I know 
Will I forever be payin' my dues, will I forever be singing the blues? 
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin' to lean 
Know what I mean? 
When I be needin' some justification 
Stuck in the fuckin' same location 
Who is the friend that is helpin' me? 
Who is the busta that's hurtin' me? 
Who can I trust? 
Will you be there when the goin' is tough? 
Will I be hangin' with dick in the dust? 
Who want to share my load when it's too heavy to carry? 
Or will I go crazy pullin' the load alone? 
Constantly gettin' my hustle on 
When will I finally see, kinda suspect 
Or even actually know 
Who is my real friend thick and the thin? 
And who in the fuck is the foe? 
Friend or foe, you just will never know 
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold 
Playa hatin' is everywhere I go 
Friend or foe you just will never know",Friend or Foe,2001

Got her touching on herself, 'cause the X is hot

She's a cowgirl, and she calling the shots
Like I turn around and look, when she working the twat
Got a lovely face, and a sexy waist
A earring on her navel, I'ma catch me a case

Get your move on, I see you working that thang
Get your groove on, you see some playas you want
Then get your choose on, cause you know it go down
She gon represent tonight, for real for H Town

You don't stop, body rock, and let it drop, why not
(She's a cowgirl)
Let it go to the flo', you know fa sho

Go, go, get it, get it
Go, go, get it, get it
It's like a pony, when she rocking my world
She's so thick and she's so fine fa sho, cowgirl

Looking for the hoes, at a club - full of drunk fools

Plus I, need a little more, I gotta eat a little mo'
My seed gotta grow
I got a reason to flow, a reason to show
What I mean is I go
off like a champ, when I cling to the floor
My Twinkies shine when I hit the strip, 'llac dipping
Strictly pimping, as long as tricks invest in women
From the Memphis Tenn., to the N-why-see I'm representing
I put mo' spice into yo' life than yo' entire kitchen
Big dicking, choking hoes with anaconda
If my pimping was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder
I slang lumber, a spell I keep my women under
Through all seasons, they fall winter spring and summer
I hit the highway smoked out pistol gripping
But I ain't tripping though I'm high as hell, spaceship'n

I know I've done some wrong, but I can't get right
'Cause life is like a big fight
I'm stickin'-and-movin', tryin' to get my shit right
My family's been houndin' me, friends they done turned against me
Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty
And they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same
It's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game
This industry fucked up
That's right I said it, and it's fake as ever
Keep real niggaz around me, stay ""Spaced Age for Eva""
Po-ppa never went and jumped the broom, never got that one degree
But if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me
Your son was DUI, but my momma made it by
I didn't shed no tears when you left me

This whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin'
Babies doin' dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
Everybody want to blame music for they bad kids
Sittin' up in the court talkin' 'bout Eminem made me do what I did
My own hard times rolled in like the fog
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts
My momma, in 1967, pickin' cotton
While other blacks was gettin' liberated, boycottin'
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin' that
He started tootin' then he graduated to smokin' crack
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin' gutter
I tattoed it on my arm so I can't forget it
It's in my mind and my heart so I'm forever with it

A drum machine, the old fo'-track, and a pack of new tapes
In the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe
We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me
Knowin' without a, household father, things could get crazy
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all
I graduated out of nothin', not out of school, it was like
Tweleve, thirteen, fourteen years I'm thinkin' cool
I might as well, be focusin' on me tryin' to get paid
Usin' these rhymes I've been writin' since in the seventh grade
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage
It was just like a piece of pussy
It fucked me long as I stayed

Yea yea sittin' looking out my window the streets I see ain't pretty
Sometimes I wonder if I was born rich with plenty
Money, and everyday was sunny didn't no rain fall
Life was beautiful like the colors of a rainbow
Would I be the same prim row all my niggas know
If I didn't have to learn to beat them streets and get that dough
What if I never witnessed killings with my own two eyes
Bussin' leave they own folks layin' in the street to die
Life without respective if every second I was shakin'
Cause I injected dope in my veins
Divide and strain could I describe pain could I
Describe livin' life without desire mayne
Could I survive if I couldn't rap or entertain alive
And free you can't beat it
Who can you blame my world is like a picture and the frame
The picture might change but the frame stays the same

Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

What if you was on the other end of the bullet
When a killer wanna pull it would it seem like
The light flash in front of your face
Or would you run real slow like I ran in my dream like
Just the other day I tried to be a hero but it wasn't the side of me
Or maybe it just wasn't the time to be but if the shoe had to fit then I would be
Ahead of the game playin' the part I bring it all into the light from out of the dark
I hit the bat into the ball and out of the park
And live with the question alone that's meddlin' hard
What if you had to live under the bridge and do anything just to feed your kids
Think about that and the deed you did the first thing that impress me kid
Oh yes you did and I ain't even tryna choke your chain or pull your leg
And I ain't even tryna fuck with your head and I ain't even tryna sweat this shit
Just spit these messages cause I'm blessed with it
What if you had the chance to be able to switch hands with me or anyone you see
And if you really wanna take it deep this shit not quanum to me
For one and each and each and all for the sci-fi mat more religious superstitious
Politicious and all the listeners with us this shit be cold as Christmas
So put your head to the sky say a prayer for the sick and the old the young and the weak
For the bombs and the single moms with six kids askin' for something to eat

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And when you get up they seem to hold you down
Down to the ground gotta stay focused with your eyes opened wide
See the sun rise I keep my hands on the steering wheel when I'm creepin' up 75
(woo woo woo) changing lanes on the regular talkin' on my cellular fast
Watching cause they wanna take me away
I'm just trying to feed my babies face
But I'm just hustling I'm waiting on tomorrow

Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

You got me fucked up, we shoot guns and hit targets
Meat market, chop haters up who start shit
M.J.G., rippin' holes in body guards
Outta line, polices and boys who think they body hard
And when the party started, I thought we was all chillin'
I figured that everybody be leavin' here all livin
You standin' to close partna, you askin' too much baby
You need to get way from round me, before our clique goin' crazy

They many niggaz come round, talkin' bout
They hot, but they not, fuckin' with fat boy and MJ
Nigga we the truth, holla at a playa man
Streets are the booth, we poppin' at you hatas man
Soft ass niggaz make they chin hit the floor
Off bran niggaz take they cheese and they hoe

I got a 22, not much bigger than my finger
A Winchester pistol grip pump that's a head ringer
A two shot derringer, not little millinater
A big 40 glock, just call me the gun slanger
Some AK spray to kill the front line
One hundred and thirty dead from squeezin' off one time
All you muthafuckin' niggaz, that yappin that fly lip
Let it rip, don't slip, I'm workin' with fly clips

We fifty deep and every nigga with me got they ice on
Look, niggaz gottta brake your face like Roy Jones
Crush your bones when its on, we ain't never scared
Them Memphis boys, we so serious when its bout that bread
Kidnap family members, them niggaz don't leave no witness
They all love a gangsta, that shit be so addictive
When we pull up, they know who we are by the car
We blowin' big, and you know Diddy he gonna buy the bar

[Chorus]

Take your vest off, I'm blowin' your neck off and eyes out
High speed chase, I'll follow you to your hideout
Shoot your fuckin' tires out, don't try to ride now
What happened to the bass in your voice, you just cryin' now
Thought you was a man, you starting to look fine now
The grim reaper been lookin' for ya, and boy its time now
And blow the roll, shit out the right side of your head man
ain't no way for retaliation when yous'a dead man

Not a scared man, we keep it, out the frame
We stayin' away from lames, and run the whole game
I do it like G, you ain't, fuckin' with me
Eightball, MJG, we reppin' for Tennessee
With murder and homicide, and daily, niggaz die
And daily, niggaz ride, it don't mean with we you wise

Them boys that disrespect, with bullets they get showered

Hey

See a nigga like me gonna get money till I get rich
Ride with a couple hundred G's in a biscuit
Stay down for whatever forever hustle with my mystic hoes
And soon you gonna see just how crunk this shit be once we get rich
Till then it's back to hustlin' with my misfits
Deep, on a creep, fifty songs tucked under the prone
Fifty songs tucked under the prone

I keep a big old nigga beater heater
It's in the trunk of my four-door and my two seater
I'm make them say skeeter skeeter
Keep up and grab the ball back just like I'm Derek Jeter
I know you want to fuck my hoe but you too scared to meet her
See you ain't got enough bread to even start to treat her
The way a pimp did, and in the bed I'm even sweeter
I hustle, I got more Franklins in me than Aretha
If I had Oprah Winfrey I would marry her and keep her
I spit as much knowledge as preachers and teachers
Just as long as the message reach us we all fill up the bleachers
I'm the MJG, I get in yo' shit
I ain't trying to run yo' clique, that be your friend so quick
Come on, where my money, let me hit the stage
Fuck them long interviews, just give us the front page

Straight flying when I hustle, that's how I represent

I been rocking mics since I was seventeen years old
Smoking up, drinking up, kicking dust, and fucking up
Everybody want a piece and we ain't got enough for us
Yeah, I touched a brick or two, pounds I done smoked a few
Got my bread and didn't do what the fuck I was supposed to do
Money blinds players, turns them into evil spirits
Niggaz die trying to live out these old rap lyrics
I try to give it to them just how it come to me
Real and unedited, not like it be on T.V
Be myself and don't be what those haters want me to be
Take the good the bad hit my knees set me free
Make the bad good, put that on my leather and wood
Cinderella with my fellas deep off in the hood

You need to stop sticking your hand out and trying to (?)
Turn around the broom handle and trying to hold it
It's plenty dirt to be swept, and leaves to be raked
Now you need to leave from my face, take heed to mistake

Thinking that a rapper could get wrapped and phone tapped

And it seems like it's usually the ones that's right by ya

Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill

I don't really want to have to bust you bitch
Roman gold shine so hard

I don't trip, niggas pull up
I be lookin' proud when I bust that dutch
Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Niggas try to jack you and loose my coop is by the kennel wheels
Mother fucker want to take my style
Cause niggas out here know I'm only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters want to see me fall

From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball and MJG

Like his jaw got a battery, this nigga always know
Who got robbed, got shot, who got put on lock
Nobody invited you and still you got up in the spot
Me, I'm not a witness, keep my distance, mind my business
You, somebody talk, you in they mouth like a dentist
We keep it gangsta, mommas love it cause they know it's real
Like UGK, ""we keeps it real"" mobbin' through the field
Big Ball, Fatboy, unload heat when my brain spill
You for it, images without no coke connect pills
We keep it crunk and poppin' real niggaz know the deal
We Bad Boys, anywhere we at we smoke and kill

Who holds the key? No fucking bout it, I broke the lock off
I grew the top off, took the comma, period, dot off
And ran on wit it and broke you a whole lot off

You just affected wit it, pimpin' yo, get yo' rocks off
Release some pressure, stop all that cryin' and wipe ya snot off
Excuses you be usin' for losin' it's cheap as hot sauce
Earn yo' position, stop hatin' because you not boss

And I don't reach, stoppin' yo' plans, fucking yo' plot off
I go hard and I don't sheave and I'm not off

Needless to say, my favorite rappers told me to get on this track
And so I DID it, quickly wrote my sixteen down and SPIT it
By the end of the verse you'll say, ""once again, Ludacris shit it""
Then I'll wipe this wit yo' face and put yo' pride in the trash
My whole career is like my video, I'm showin' my ass

Shit, I had hoes way before I was nationally famous
I was in the hood strapped up good
Watchin' my anus

I'm a target splitter
The world strongest man hardest hitter
Even though you hate
I still elevate regardless nigga

Step to us boy, look what you done started
And we don't even care that your arsenal be the largest

[Hook: 8 Ball & MJG, P. Diddy]
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone

When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone

[Verse 2: 8 Ball]
Look, you niggaz play too much mayne
You need to pump yo' brakes
Keep a heater nigga need for them restless snakes
Right in my face caught a case tryin' to defend my space

Dodging snitches police niggaz jumping state to state
What kind of nigga run his mouth and snitch out everybody?
The kind of nigga that's gone end up being a dead body
Yo' wife and children gone be searching for their dear ol' daddy

They found his headless body tied up in a dark alley
It's cold like ice and snow on a nigga soul
For bricks or snow, niggaz will fuck you like a dirty hoe
Kick yo' door and put and your babies on the floor

See you in public fuck who with you let the thang go
A nigga tell you don't let business turn personal
Fuck what they say cause for gram a nigga hurtin' you
Niggaz out here hurtin' fool

Nothing is for free mayne
Fuckin' with the game
That's how that shit be mayne

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 8 Ball]
I was torn this bitch came from the streets I was born
Pussy like a little kitty back yellow as corn
I don't go around poppin' shit wit' niggaz who talkin'
Them niggaz ain't talkin' no more

Closed coffin
Not often do you see a nigga loyal as I
Like that boy from Best Eye nigga ready to die
For my bread and them niggaz that considered me family
Hold it down mayne I got you til we up there wit' granny

[Verse 4: MJG]
'Cause as soon as I start writing
I start going through physical
Deeper into my spiritual
I'm so fuckin' lyrical

MJG the realest the truth the definition
Just call me the competition
I'm still stomping and pimpin'
I'm still working with Diddy, still fuck wit the hood

I got the key to the city, the streets is all good
My leather is all wood, my gun is still secluded
I'm still hoping and praying to God I don't use it

What'chu talkin' 'bout, what'chu think you doin'?
Why you walkin' out, where you think you goin'?
You actin like you didn't, you knew what I was doin'
3 o'clock in the mornin', you knew where I was goin'
Straight to my spot, a loft in the city
Stopped and picked up somethin pretty on the freeway suckin' titties
You in the bed sleepin'', I said that I was workin'
You smile when you see me but inside you was hurtin'
The cars and the clothes, whatever that you asked me
I was takin' care of you, I thought that you was happy
Out of town, fuckin' 'round, all-star, Superbowl
A-T-L, Magic City, tippin' big dick hoes
Panties on the back seat, I don't know whose shit that is
Condoms and phone numbers, I don't know whose shit that is
F'real, you know when I realized that I was wrong
When I wrote the words to this song

[Chorus]
Just tell me why baby, did I ever did I ever did I ever let you go baby
Cause I love you cause I love you cause I really love you so baby
Baby, woo, it's the very last time that I'll let you down
I won't make the same mistakes again

Yeah, since way back I was a mag-a-net for pretty women
And brought up in the city where they exercise their pimpin'
I fight temptation daily, I could be in Paris chillin'
With somethin' young, eager talent, they ready and willin'
I get a lot of phone numbers but don't really call 'em
Unless I hit 'em just to let 'em know I'm out here ballin'
I know you picture me, laid up with these other women
Most of the time I'm not, occasionally I get 'em
Who was that woman lookin' at me up in Wal Mart
Lock in the sexual fantasy, her drawers hot
But back to the subject, the chemistry I really loved it
Mental, emotional, couldn't put nothin' above it
But every unturned stone you had to touch it
Rolled 'em over, look what you found, now you disgusted
But before I leave, look me in my eye
Don't cry, never lie

[Chorus]

You and me, full of that, sticky weed and cog-nac
You like how I lick it then, put the dick up in your back
There you go, talkin' 'bout, what you know, who done said
That they saw me trickin' some-where with one of yo' friends
Did you see me do it no, do you know that shit fo' sho'
Who you gon' believe me, or them ol' meddlin' hoes
Damn, I think of all the shit I put you through
This a lonely game and, sometimes I be missin' you

I got a tank of gas to burn up, turn up the radio
Baby hit your girls, go tell 'em c'mon get ready to go
We headed fo', somewhere, tucked in and very low key
No interruptions, no cell phones, no tee-vee
Just you and me, sippin' up on some Hennessy
Makin' sure that we finish the whole, cup to the end it be
Meant to be chemistry between us and even though
You saw the bitches in my Beamer

Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chains

Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to (hell)
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I swear to God I just want to (slit) my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm (dead), a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe (suicide's) on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak

Swell in my pocket

Been around the world

Got the shit to make 'em jump
It's hyper like a pimp rally
Give 'em just a piece it make 'em
Mime me like a skip daddy

Slamming my doors, knockin' these hoes
And when I'm feeling like I'm feeling like I'm feeling today

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

MJT + 3,"To the tables down at Mory's
To the place where Louie dwells
To the dear old Temple bar we love so well
Sing the Whiffenpoofs assembled with their glasses raised on high
And the magic of their singing casts it's spell

Yes, the magic of their singing of the songs we love so well
""Shall I Wasting"" and ""Mavourneen"" and the rest
We will serenade our Louie while life and voice shall last
Then we'll pass and be forgotten with the rest

We're poor little lambs who have lost our way
Baa, baa, baa
We're little black sheep who have gone astray

""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels

No wind breathed in the sky
When a pin-striped suit
Saw that the Institute of Mental Health was burning.
He stood upon the corner
Where the sun was warmer
Looking across the street
He moved the shackles on his feet
As the Institute was burning
Flames were roaring, singing like a thunderstorm
Smoke was pouring straight up to the sky
Windows smashing, Gothic doors and lintels fall
Timbers crashing and we both know why

Nobody else came by to stare
You see, they didn't really care
Can't call the fire brigade 
None of them had been paid
And so the Institute was burning
Throughout the city, people say it isn't pretty
Everyone agrees, and everyone feels glad
Doctored brains celebrate and everyone waves their chains
It's a pity they're all mad

Spontaneously killed itself

Mkrtich Malkhasian,"Beg you listen me, don't be kissing me 'til I'm done
Unsung champion, reason, like seasoning
Pepper your thoughts with spice, and entice you to a space
Where I dwell with bass players and layers and loops

Think what I think with my prayers. It's nice. My world is everything I've become
Contained in the hum between voice and drum
I'm coming from the same place I'm still running from
But even sitting in the garden one can still get stung",Garden,2001

My heart is sinking as I’m lifting 
Up above the clouds away from you
And I can’t believe I’m leaving

But someday
I will find my way back to where

I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye, yeah

And I’d give away a thousand days, oh
Just to have another one with you (baby girl)
Well, real life can wait (It can wait)
I’m crashing like waves (yeah)

Thinking about it shine shine under trees,
Summer time on the beach,
Of fine we get closer under them trees,
Baby girl, you really got to me

It’s 3 o’clock, and were together and the time doesn’t leave
In a heartbeat girl, sex on the beach
Don’t stand your world, ask me I'm rich,
Loving you girl, is the best part of me

Say hello to palm trees and Benzes
They say you gotta fall to have it all

We don’t want two kids and a wife
I don’t want a job I just want a life
Sometimes the underdogs rise
And the mighty fall

So tell me whatever happened to the American dream

She was fresh off the plane
She whispered in my ear
“Baby, come here. I’ll do anything to make a name”

Honey, take my hand follow me ‘cause
I don’t wanna hurt you but he does
I just wanna give you some real advice

Never take candy from a stranger
And keep your eyes open for danger

So I numb the pain away, I know I'd leave but not stay
I wonder if I will ever find someone to fill me up inside
someone to kiss my fears away
If I believed in god I'd pray, to god I'd pray

Am I crazy to think that I could be in love when it all ends up
it all ends up wasted
I'd give you my heart, but I'd just fuck it up
we'd end up, we'd end up wasted
La la la la la la la

Night after night, day after day
Jack and coke smokin' on the fire escape
Is it to soon or is it to late

Am I crazy to think that I could be in love when it all ends up
it all ends up wasted
I'd give you my heart, but I'd just fuck it up
we'd end up, we'd end up wasted
I say we'd end up wasted, ooh

A lovers moon lays down its light
Like a path upon a shiny sea
An invitation for two souls
To see where the horizon goes
The future reaches out for you and me

So take my hand
Take this heart
Forever waiting just below the stars
Heaven's light will be setting soon
Tonight let's take the pathway to the moon

It seems like we could walk on water
Never slip and nerver falter
Maybe that is just the power of love
The waves are singing out our song
And before the break of dawn
We will promise to the moon above

So take my hand
Take this heart
Forever waiting just below the stars

Never would I think I had the world in my hand
17 times, circumnavigate the globe
A traveler’s tradition, my religion is the road
Broke the mold, explored all the options
The quickest way to curate the cash, so I clocked in
On the job, no training wheels
Told my mama I'mma make it cause I say I will
Till the wheels fall off
Yes yes, y’all, 'till the beat it don’t stop
Between a rock and a hard place
Came up out the ghetto with my boys, no Scarface
But is my mind playing tricks?
If the world is really mine how I ain’t got shit?
Still they stop and they frisk
But it’s never gonna change till we stop and resist

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more
(Control, control, control, control)

Welcome to the world of drug dealers
Comic books, white girls, and real niggas
Skateboards, bandanas, and malt liquor
Japanese cartoons and straight killers
They tell us get out the ghetto and get rich
But when you really a rebel you don’t fit
We all tryna find our niche
Got to grab it by the throat and make the world your bitch
It’s the American way
Plug into the drive and let the narrative play
We obsessed with nothing but the best shit
Do it on your own or be a drone with a death wish
Defy definition, repress repetition
Get money, get high, get sex, the addiction
The depression, the stress, the affliction
Get ready, get set, go, we on a mission

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more

They had a rally for police brutality up at the park
But when we killing ourselves don’t nobody want to march
We got to start to take a look in the mirror
If we don’t respect ourselves then they always gone fear us
If black lives matter then black lives matter
And the color of the killer shouldn’t even be a factor
Most of these rappers ain’t equipped to lead
Cause most of these rappers illiterate, can’t read
This is educated street music for the educated street movement
It’s fucked up what the police is doing
But motherfucker look what we doing

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more

I wrote a song about you last night

La la la, you broke my heart in two
I don't know what to do, you've got me so confused now
Baby, I wrote a song about you last night

I was lost in the melody (lost in the melody)
Found in the memories
Just say you love me, I'll believe it,
You don't even have to mean it
It's all I want

Every time I look around, I sit and wonder
Where did you disappear?
My thoughts are no longer a Capella
But it doesn't seem to matter
'Cause I feel you here, I feel you here

Of the stranger things that are growing in my mind
Now will I ever wake up
Wake up to see the box I'm in

Will I ever stand up
I'm standing on the edge of inability
Now is this a failure
My project kill is rigth awake

I'm all burned out from pressure
My thoughts have brought me to my knees
Awake in pain
They're no good - still surrounding me

Forcing my actions upon me
The blood just paints my world
They're no good - still surrounding me
Forcing my actions upon me
They're forcing my actions upon my deathbox",Deathbox [DVD],2005
Mnemic,"Fearless rejection
Breathing with imperfection
Living with imperfection
Listen to me when I say
That I will never get back to you
You bite the hand that was feeding you

Dark thoughts nailed into your fate now
Dark thoughts awaiting to shine now

I choose a way with no surrender
I choose a way with no surrender

Won't you stay away, away
I guess it's not the last time
Won't you stay away, away
I just hope it's the last time

Looking after me
I need you and you need me
But it seems you didn't read the information

Dark thoughts nailed into my fate now
Dark thoughts awaiting to shine now

Keeping me calm before I explode
Keeping me calm you're keeping me close

You don't know my determination
I'll make you feel a new sensation

Won't you stay away, away
I guess it's not the last time
Won't you stay away, away
I just hope it's the last time

I need to be in control
In control of myself
In control of myself
Fearless rejection
Imperfection

Won't you stay away, away
I guess it's not the last time
Won't you stay away, away
I just hope it's the last time

I need to be in control
In control of myself

I choose a way with no surrender

Wasn't never no Mama I want to sing

Roll through the hood on them gold thangs
Now it's world war 3 in them streets
Ain't gone never have enough police
Picture I relax, relate, release
Like this all my homies rest in peace
Disrespect this, put you in the mix
Whopping out that tec grip
Running through your click like busting on you like death wish
Spinning your head like the exorcist
(*Smack*) that's a death kiss
Viscious, foaming at the mouth like rabies
Ain't no good cause in my hood we was doing bad like crack babies

(And dangersous) Dead that's how we living
Shiesty, like ganking the offering up out the church. 
Putting in work spitting game on your Boo
Like when that rem and hennessy got me hurt
I'm tru
Taking everything you got with that infared dot on your knot
Down South Hustlers got on lock, with that J-L-O-see on cock

It ain't about slanging keys flippin half ounces to quarters
When the Task hit that mean time to throw ya rocks
My little patner got 25 years for 2 rocks. 
My block be crazy my homey pushing dasies
Never had a chance to see his unborn baby
Ain't that sad black rolling in the cadillac
4, 15 woofers bumping behind I'm hitting him in the back
Dead, who gives a damn cause when you gone
Ain't no coming back to my homies that dead and gone 2 stones
Label me a thug like Pac, 
Cause I done got the world hooked on ice cream I mean these gangsta rocks
I'm slanging these tapes we banging 
Steady hanging on the block 
Keep product in my socks ready to rock
Open up shop cause it all good (all good)

By the hands of that 4-4 (Clack Clack)
Pull the hammer back (That the last)
Live fast and watch them die slow
You know I really want to say is that they don't car about soldiers
Falling asleep behind the whell in the Range Rover
Can't remember the last time I was sober
(Whoop Whoop) that's the Po Pos 
Gotta watch those, 
The got some nerve talking bout the supposed to protect and serve
Took my money and my herb
Every player that on my team got a laser beam
Knock your head off, steal your dream
Not first you sure, ain't nutting nice serving fiends ain't what it seems
What the south about, big money, big guns and those big booties

-The only person I can trust in this world
-This for you mom

Momma, this is one thing I still can't realize
How you been so strong when my brother died
You done kept the family together tight
Thinkin' about how we gone get through this sorrow night
This is crazy, I can't sleep nope
Even though i got revenge written across my throat
Five kids and you done lost one
Never had a daddy, but put it on your oldest son
Ain't that a be	, leave me to watch the family
To make the bills get paid, you got to live scandalous G
Cause the ghetto got me pressured
Will I die sellin' dope, or would I sell a million records
Oh momma won't you feel me
Even though Ms. ?? said somebody tried to kill P
And you know your boy's sellin' dope
But all you say is watch yo back
Cause you don't want to see me go

		Momma I don't want to see you cry
		No more tears
		Cause I'm deep in the game

Momma how you be so strong
Even tough the ATF, done kicked down your home
And ran right through and got me
But you still came to see me
And said that you love me
And I know that you real though
Cause when I got out, you's the first one at the door
Knowing that your boy turned into a man
But you done tripped cause I still understand
That I'm trying to make some money
And if I die in this game, I guess that won't be funny
But you still on my side cause you a soldier
You the only friend I got and ma I told ya
One day I'ma change G
Even though the ghetto's crazy, think about your baby
If I make it out this dope game
I know that life won't be the same, momma I gone make a change

And tonight I'ma page her
