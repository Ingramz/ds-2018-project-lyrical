John Siegler,"Cupid, Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now I don't mean to bother you but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this, you can fix

So Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Ooh, now, Cupid, if your arrow make a love storm for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know, between the two of us, her heart, we can steal
Help me if you will

So Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Don't you hear me calling?
My tears keep falling
I got to have your love now
Whoa, oh, oh, yeah

Look, I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby

I look at you, you turn away
I say to you, ""Please look my way""
But you say to me, ""Leave me alone""
Then I say, ""I can't live without you""

I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby

Girl, deep in, you know that, my love for you
And it hurt me so bad, I'm telling you
Come on, look at me once, [Incomprehensible]
Can't you see, I can't live without you

I loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
Make you my baby

Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Hear me calling
Hear the love is getting stronger
",Clich√©,1978
John Siegler,"Don't you ever listen?
Don't you ever learn?
The hand may find you
It's time to take a turn
You think this life is something strange
You're ready for another change
But don't you ever learn?
Don't you ever listen?
Don't you ever learn?
The world is on fire
Your body doesn't burn
Kill yourself before receiving
Something out of all this breathing
Don't you ever learn?",Don't You Ever Learn?,1978
John Siegler,"Hello, it's me
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
There's something here that doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine
 
Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me

Think of me
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me

Think of me
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should",Hello It's Me,1978
John Siegler,"It's the last ride
Our little game is over
It's the last ride
It's time to take you home
And we can't cry 'cause we seen it coming
No use running, take it slower
It's a dangerous drive
I'm afraid to arrive
But I strive to survive
More a fool than alive
I thought I knew just everything
I had it made and I could coast
But I turned away love when I needed it most
It's the last ride
My little game is over
It's the last ride
It's time to take me home
And I can't cry 'cause I seen it coming
No use running, take it slower
And the road rolls around
And turns through the town
The depression drips down
And glazes the ground
Horizons east and skylines west
The moon, the sun, and all the rest
The loving son, the faithful wife
The burnt out wreck of a poor man's life
The father, son, and holy ghost
They all turned away love when they needed it most
It's the last ride
Their little game is over
It's the last ride
It's time to take them home
And they can't cry 'cause they seen it coming
No use running, take it slower",The Last Ride,1978
John Siegler,"I have a place where dreams are born
And time is never planned
It's not on any chart
You must find it in your heart

Never never land
It may be miles beyond the moon
Or right there where you stand
Just keep an open mind

And then suddenly you'll find
Never never land
You'll have a treasure if you stay there
More precious far than gold

For once you have found your way there
You will never, never grow old
And that's my home where dreams are born
And time is never planned

Just think of pleasant things
And your heart will fly on wings, forever in
Never never land",Never Never Land,1978
John Siegler,"Your Daddy runs sheep and my uncle runs cattle
Nothin' can keep us out of this battle they wage
As it burns up the range, 'til no man is left
In the saddle
Your ranch is upstream and they dammed up the water

Thirsty cows scream for my uncle to slaughter
The sheep while yore Daddy's asleep
And I do the same for his daughter
If I had my own way, we would be together

Back in Pittsburgh
It's the only town east of the river I know
And I feel kinda bad, bringin' our grief
Upon this pore old farmer's house

But we ain't got nowhere else to go
Three years on this range since they started the range war
Nothing has changed except maybe change for the worst
If I'd married you first,

There might not have been any range war
You wouldn't be lost to the range war",The Range War,1978
John Siegler,"Sometimes I don't know
I just don't know what to feel

Sometimes I don't know what to feel
Everything I thought that I knew starts to look so unreal
There's a ringing in my head that keeps me awake at night
Sometimes I don't know what is right

Today I saw a car crush my little dog under its wheel
It did not even stop, it just sped off and out of sight
Sometimes I just feel so afraid
But I know that no one else has it made

So if I just believe in myself
I won't need no help from nobody else and I can make it alone
And everything will be cool, I got to keep on keepin' on
There's nothing else I can do

Sometimes I don't know what to do
Someone said the world's going to end and I think its true
I thought there was some love in the world
But I guess I'm wrong

Sometimes I just feel so alone
I don't want to admit to my friends that I feel confused
I wonder what I'd do with myself if the world was gone
Something makes me stay on my feet

Don't you dare admit to defeat
And if I tell myself it's all right
I can comfort myself through the night
And watch another day dawn
And everything will be cool",Sometimes I Don't Know What To Feel,1978
John Siegler,"Pretty bird with feathers falling
Pretty as a lady calling
For her pink and midnight lover
As she stares into the water

And a yellow moon is rising
And there can't be no disguising
That the pretty bird is dying
With a silver arrow lying at its side

Rivers of blood,
Oceans of tears,
Life without death,
And death without reason

To the whole United Nations,
To your greatest expectations
To the moment that you realize
As a dark figure slips from out of the shadow

Pretty bird closes its eyes, pretty bird dies
Another pretty thing dead on the end of the shaft
Of the Zen Archer

A man in parts forgotten
With an outlook that is rotten
And an attitude to match it
Finds relief inside a hatchet
And he halved someone in Boulder
Justifiability is in the hands of the beholder
And you just don't know what people will do next

Mountains of pain,
Valleys of love,
Death without life,
And life without meaning

To the promise kept and broken
To the love that's never spoken
Just as surely as I'm in your ears
A dark figure slips from out of the shadow",Zen Archer,1978

John Signorello,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride,2006
John Simmons,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl,
And me, oh Lord is one

If I had listened to what my mother said
I'd have been at home today,
But I was young and foolish, Oh God
Let a gambler lead me astray

My mother is a tailor
She sews those new blue jeans
My sweetheart is a drunkard, Lord
Down in New Orleans

The only thing a drunkard needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
The only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

He'll fill his glasses to the brim
He passes them around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is bumming from town to town

Go tell my baby sister,
Never do what I have done
To shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

It's one foot on the platform
And the other one on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

I'm goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm goin' back to spend my life
Beneath that Rising Sun",The House of the Risin' Sun,2006
John Simmons,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2000
John Simmons,"When the moon's kinda dreamy
Starry eyed and dreamy
And nights are luscious and long
If you're kinda lonely
All by you're only
Then nothin' but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

When the wind through the window
Blows across your pillow
And tells you sleepin' is wrong
If love goes a thirsting
Till you feel like bursting
Then nothing but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

Suppose you want somebody
But you ain't got nobody
You only get a gleam in your eyes
Till somebody's found you
And put their lovin' arms around you
You got the feelin' you want to die

But when the Lord up above you
Send's someone to love you
The blues are something you loose
You're so busy doing
The things that you're doing
That love ain't got no time
For brewin' the blues

John Simmons,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2002
John Simmons,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game

In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl

We were fallin', stumbli'n, crawlin'
her come da police, Captain Tom Collins,
and the rapper said freeze
he said ""hands in the air and hand over your keys""
now we did, and that was kinda simple,
now here came Margarita and her friend Shirley Temple.
I asked my friend 'bout Margarita,
he said Shirley was a virgin and I wouldn't wanna meet her.
So I talked to Margarita, cause you, she was flyer
I took her to the coast cause I wanted to Screw Driver.
Now I'm not one for a speech,
but there was plenty of Tequila and Sex On The Beach, Y'all.

see I'm a French-Mexican but I can get with White Russians,
at the bar with a drink in my hand.
In walked Jose Cuervo what was margaritas man.
I talked to the wise man cause, yoh he's distinguished.
His name was St. Ives and he spoke in old English.
He said ""you'd better think fast,
cause Jose is kinda crazy and I heard he Shot Glas
He gave me some advice and it went like this:
""catch the night train and head up to 'cisco""
I didn't wanna stick around,
I caught the 1:51 to New York, the Grey Hound.
Now I'm at the Red Zone, everybody's stylin'.

the Tequila Gold Label had bombed me.
You see I woke up late and wasn't feelin' so great,
And Mike said there's a Bicardi party startin' at eight.
Yo we walked in the party and started playin our games,
we played tops, fuzzy quarters, with Bartles & James.
Here came Shirley Temple and they told me to chill,
because the Mickey Brothers took her up to strawberry hill.
They took her $1000 mink and she could barely think,
cause the Tequila that she drank had her tickled pink.
Now the music came on and I rocked the instrumental.
There's a groupie named Mai Tai, a fly oriental.
A groupie is a girl that jocks,
She wore the def Black Velvet and drank Scotch on the Rocks.
We had a fake marriage, now here's to honeymoon,
Ya zone vagabond and the Blue Lagoon.

Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day

I think you know what I've been trying to say

And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are

Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me

And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep
Inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me

Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me

Will be","Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)",2006

Only adds to my heartache
It runs quietly down my window
Like the tears upon my face
And each time the lightning flashes
And I hear the thunder roar
I'm reminded of the closing of the door

I'm not over you
The storm still rages
The waves of pain remind me
That we're through
I'm slowly drowning
In a sea of endless heartbreak
I'm going under
'Cause I'm not over you

I keep holding to your memory
But my hopes are sinking fast
The chance that you'll come back to me
Now fades into the past
Can I find a way to let you go
Somewhere down deep inside
By reaching for the healing hands of time

I'm not over you

You've been forever forsaken by the one that you love
I know how you feel lonesome dove

I've tried to run from the pain of his memory
But I can't find a place I can hide
And that old lonesome dove is gonna mourn for his love
No matter how far he flies

I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me
But all you can show me
Is the prairie and the sky

And I don't want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain 
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, I watched it burn

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Well you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive
And I come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down
Out on 95
And pretend that it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean
Baby, do you know what I mean?

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace

In our struggle just to get by 
Many times the burden's been heavy 
Still we carried on side by side

Is the love that we shared

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Watch them, catch them unawares,
And see them frolic on their holiday.

See them gaily gad about
They love to play and shout,
They never have any care;
At six o'clock their Mommies and Daddies
Will take them home to bed,
Because they're tired little Teddy Bears.",Teddy Bears' Picnic,2003

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line

Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard

Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist

Starry night, campfire light, and the coyote calls where the howlin' winds will.
So I ride out to the ol' sundown. I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail.
Lord I'm just thinking about a certain female.
And the nights we spent together, riding on the range.
Looking back, it doesn't seem so strange.

Roll me over and turn me around. Let me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo.

I was took in Texas, I did not know her name.
But Lord all these southern girls, they seem the same.
But down below the border, in a town in Mexico,
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo.

Roll me over ans turn me around, let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, running free with the buffalo.

Roll me over, and I'll turn around.
And I'll move my fingers up and down.
Up and down.

It's ok amigo, just let me go.
Riding in the rodeo.

Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinning till I hit the ground.

My girlfriend who lives in Canada
She couldn't be sweeter, I wish you could meet her
My girlfriend who lives in Canada

Her name is Alberta, she lives in Vancouver
She cooks like my mother and sucks like a Hoover
I e-mail her every single day, just to make sure that everything's okay
It's a pity she lives so far away in Canada

Last week she was here but she had the flu
Too bad 'cause I wanted to introduce her to you
It's so sad, there wasn't a thing that she could do
But stay in bed with her legs up over her head

I wish you could meet my girlfriend
But you can't because she is in Canada
I love her, I miss her, I can't wait to kiss her
So, soon I'll be off to Alberta, I mean Vancouver
Shit, her name is Alberta, she lives in Vancouver

Yes, I have a girlfriend who lives in Canada
And I can't wait to eat her pussy again

Around it, a white dove flies--
Forever circling

Gently touches the surface of the earth

To wear this planet down to nothing
Is eternity

Within time, there is change
Soon, the wing of the white dove
Will touch our world again

Time for a new beginning

Now is eternity
At the break of
Dawn of a century

Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do

In his arms she fell as her hair came down among the fields of gold
 
Will you stay with me, will you be my love among the fields of barley?
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we lie in fields of gold
See the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold
 
I never made promises lightly and there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold
 
Many years have passed since those summer days among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down among the fields of gold

John Tesh,"Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our rice crispies
We can't hear anything at all

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today,
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street,
But all he ever thinks to do is watch,
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away there's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake

Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away

Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone

Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you

When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little

He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart

And no words are spoken but oh

I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back

And sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

When you say the things, you say you gotta mean it 
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart 

 Something's gone, I can't explain 
The heat is missing from the plain 
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain 
There's something wrong with you and me 
When more than one adds up to three 
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see 
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away 

 When you do what you do that you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
when you do what you do without love, without love

The only colour I need is blue 
You're out of love, baby you know it's true 
Tell me why and I'll try to understand 

 Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
When you do what you do without love 

 It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away

Don't you drown when your dream boat runs onto the ground

By filling his glass with your fast flowing bitter-sweet wine.
He'll taste the aftertaste when you come home late some night.
With your eyes all a mist from the smoke of a distant fire.

Want some bacon?
JULES
Naw, man, I don't eat pork.
VINCENT
Are you Jewish?
JULES
I ain't Jewish, I just don't dig on swine, that's all.
VINCENT
Why not?
JULES
Pigs are filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.
VINCENT
Yeah, but bacon tastes good. Pork chops taste good.
JULES
Hey, a sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. But I'll never know 'cause I
Wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's
A filthy animal. I ain't need nothin' that ain't got sense enough to
Disregard its own feces.
VINCENT
How about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.
JULES
I don't eat dog either.
VINCENT
Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty.
But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.
VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to
Be a filthy animal? Is that true?
JULES
Well, we'd have to be talkin' 'bout one charmin' motherfuckin' pig. I mean
He'd have to be ten times more charming that that [...] you know what
I'm sayin'?

JULES
-- okay so, tell me again about the hash bars?
VINCENT
Okay what d'you want to know?
JULES
Hash is legal there, right?
VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't
Walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. I mean they
Want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
JULES
Those are hash bars?
VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this, okay: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own
It and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's
Legal to carry it, but that doesn't matter 'cause -- get a load of this,
Alright, -- if you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them
To search you. I mean that's a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
JULES
Oh, man -- I'm goin', that's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.
VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
JULES
What?
VINCENT
It's the little differences. I mean they got the same shit over there, we got
Here, but it's just there's a little difference.
JULES
Examples?
VINCENT
Alright, well you can walk into a movie theatre in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
And I don't mean in a paper cup. I'm talkin' 'bout a glass of beer. And in
Paris, you can buy a beer at MacDonald's. You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
VINCENT
No, man, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck
A Quarter Pounder is.
JULES
What'd they call it?
VINCENT
They call it Royale with Cheese.
JULES (repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?
VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.
JULES (repeating)
Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?
VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. You know what they put on french
Fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
JULES
What?
VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

And you can try to stop my dancin' feet
But I just cannot stand still
'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums
Then I found my way
'Cause you can't stop the beat

A woman found out if she shook it
She could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it
The best that I can today

'Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean
Or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat!

So I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today
'Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try to stop the paradise we're dreamin' of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
'Cause you cant stop the beat!

You can't stop my happiness, 'cause I like the way I am
And you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas Ham!
So, if you don't like the way I look, well, I just don't give a damn!

Listen to the fireplace roar

I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

John Tropea,"For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right 
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me one
And not let me stay around?
Oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
 
For a while to love each other
With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had 
Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair 
Would lead our love into
Somethin' happened along the way
Yesterday  was all we had

The light in darkness
Enshrines the flower with a veil
Closes every hint beauty
Defends protect and steals

Every branch I try to reach
Simply cannot overtake it
Mobilize in my own distrust

The way she moves
What makes her tick
The fog has momentarily blinded
Labyrinth walls have grown thick

Character screams with a breathless sigh

Quickly stumble into her conscious
Listen intently to all the words
Gently lowering my bridges
In hopes of touching her
And unclear the window
To her emotions
Feature of this crooked smile
Perfect in all its incompletion
Think can we crash into her now
Into her room

And limitations
Feverish intents all flamed
Impassioned by the glory in this
Angered in the knowledge that
In time this worldly love will fail me
Everything I grip will fall

Eye contact we make and she smiles
She smiles

Built it of this painted picture
Judgement retires for the night
All I have left is this
Brilliant creature here beside me
Lovely in every single way

Guess I'll blame this all on him

John Van Tongeren,"I went all the way to Paris to forget your face
Captured in stained glass, young lives long since passed
Statues of lovers every place
I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love
I walked through the ruins, icons of glory
Smashed by the bombs from above

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us.

Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil
There's just no medium for life
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth
In a dusty cathedral the living God called
And I prayed for my life here in earth

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us.

There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon
Bleeding its light like a lamb
And the town is illuminated, its tiny figures are fast asleep
And it dawns on me the time is upon me
To return to the flock I must keep.

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust

A swarming jellyfish pulled us over the surface
The sun, the sun was crying diamonds
For every broken masthead
And scotch taped sail that passed us by

We hung on, hung on
Two orphan monkeys
And all we said and all that we did
Left me feeling like a little kid

Against, against slowly bleeding wanting eels
And if you dream of dolphins
Of tattooed fish in milky seas
And if you dream of levitating
There is a word you should be saying to me

But settled instead on holiday inn, riverside

I walked down to the lobby 
And found her on the phone

She grabbed me by the throat

I went to the room and threw all her things

Hovering low, warning me to go back home

Are you blaming me?
Oh no, it's the lionesses
You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored

That's more like it
But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on the spit...

Oh, how I miss Mufasa
Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name! 
Note taken. I shall never mention ""M-m-m"" again
Even in death, his shadow looms over me
There he is!
No! There he is!
And there!

Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
headaches! 

I am perfectly fine!
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised
I'm keeping calm
I'm going wild!

I tell myself I'm fine
Yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am, no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine

No you're not, yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am
No you're not
Yes, no, yes, no, who am I talking to...?

Oh, pull yourself together, Sire!
Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...?
Yes, Sire?
Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub
What did my brother have that I don't have?

Do you want the short list or the long?
Whatever!
Well, he had adoring subjects... a loving family... a devoted queen... 
That's it! I need a queen!
A what?
A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no
descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
be mine! Immortality will be mine!

Scar
Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've
grown

Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt
She's got those assets feminine
You're the king. Control the hyenas
I have to make her mine
You're destroying the Pridelands
Nobility in every gene
If we don't stop now.. Don't you see...
She has to be my queen
...there's still a chance for things to be all right again... 
Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars

What are you doing? Are you listening to me?
We'll create a host of little Scars
What are you talking about?
Tell me I'm adored
Get away from me
Tell me I'm adored
Oh, Nala... you know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will
be mine

Never, Scar. Never!
You belong to me
You all belong to me",The Madness of King Scar,1997

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2003

As you stood in my shadow
In some loud disguise

You were lookin' straight through me
Like a piece of glass
Out of step with the fashion
Fashions always pass 

I've been living 
On the dark side of the sun
Waiting for something 
That would never come 

Feeling restless and jaded
My heartbeat paralyzed
Like some refugee hero
To beat denounced and denied 

In some rock and roll wasteland
In a thousand hours
While Madonnas keep smiling
Present them with the flowers 

I've been living 
On the dark side of the sun
Waiting for something 
That would never come

And I've been running down the shadows
Like a street gang to survive
Hoping for something to keep me alive

Fire in my eyes
We were looking for justice
What we got was a great big surprise 
We've been living 

On the dark side of the sun

In the course of your life
There's a side of each man
That sleeps in the darkest hour
I know what it takes

It takes time, it takes faith
To make the second state of the heart
And a simple taste of love
To lift us up

It's easy enough to believe
'Cause we're working on this deal for life
When your heart's held for ransom
Walk away and your spirit will fly
Bet the light that burns in your eyes
On a deal for life, oh yeah

I never danced in a storm
I was hooked by a hunger
That left a bitter taste in my soul

There's a distance between hard truth and dreams
Some days it pays to run with the chances
I've got a simple tats of love to lift us up

It's easy enough to believe
'Cause we're working on this deal for life
When your heart's held for ransom
Walk away and your spirit will fly
Bet the light that burns in your eyes
On a deal for life

And tennis slaves backhand never moved you
It took a soul all the way to pull you through
And now I won't let go, won't let go
Oh yeah

Got a simple taste of love
To lift us up

It's easy enough to believe
'Cause we're working on this deal for life
When your heart's held for ransom
Walk away and your spirit will fly

'Cause it's easy enough to believe
On a deal for life
When your heart's held for ransom
Walk away and your spirit will fly

John Waite,"There's a silent movie 
Running off its reel inside my mind
As I try to fall asleep tonight
On prescription lullabies
In the darkness there's a doorway
That leads me back to you forever 
But these days there's only
You and I in photographs
Ambitions and dreams we've shared
Now I wonder who has got the last laugh 
Cause I know you're crying
And you know I'm cold inside
Got no expectations for my pride
And I reach for that glittering prize 
I remember on our wedding day
Looking back at you
Our eyes met and we said goodbye
As we both said ""I do""
Didn't I make a promise baby
I would stand by you forever 
But sometimes the best-laid plans
Flare up and blow away
And fairytale logic comes
Sweeps you heart 
Your soul' your world away 
Cause I know you're crying
And you know I'm cold inside
And I'm tired of living with that lie
And now time is flying
And you know I miss that fire
But I feel for you
I've got desire
So I reach for that glittering prize 
No doll's house dreams
Or valentines
Just the future at the door
Just leaving trains and empty rooms
A broken band of gold
Cause love don't live here anymore 
And some nights I'll come and see you
And I know you'll let me in
Two strangers in silence now
Cause you know in love
We could never win 
I know you're crying
And you know I'm cold inside
And I'm tired of living with this lie
These days
Cause now time is flying
And you know I miss that fire
Cause I feel for you
I've got desire
Baby baby 
In my world (in your world tonight)
Reach for that glittering prize (in my world)
That's all I ever seemed to do (in your world tonight)
Was reach for the glittering prize (in my world)
I lost myself when I lost you (in your world tonight)
As I reached for that glittering prize (in my world)
And I hope that all your dreams come true (in your world tonight)
When you reach for that glittering prize (in my world) 
In your world
In my world tonight",The Glittering Prize,1995

Of the dreams that we chase and pursue
These rights we hold precious
Say it loud enough

And you find a lot of wisdom there

They all just slip away
And you lie down in God's shadow

But the future's already been sold

Spinning their fine webs into gold

We're sailing out on troubled seas

At the house of truth

Yeah
I need more

Out there near the shore

In the uncertain moments in the loam
You can almost hear it shine
Is that voice I'm hearing divine 
Cause I hear more
I hear more

Drunk on elderberry wine
Laughing in the cornfields
And taking our sweet time

The world was ours together
And all the things we had
Were cast up in the future baby

Now I ain't waiting for
Those days to return
You showed me what love was
I had such a lot to learn

We tripped the wild fantastic edge
The truth was always clear

They could never tame our wild hearts
Or stop us making love
We were so inseparable
We could never get enough

And it seems like only yesterday
You made my world turn
And these days I think about ya
The fire still burns

Hey baby
I never knew a better time (When you were mine)

I know there's no sense in looking back
But everytime I think of it baby

I just have to laugh

I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinkin' about you, and it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you, no matter what I might say

There's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you, no matter what my friends say

See I'm reaching for the deepest blue
It's a one man show, I'm free again

Thinking about the things we said
All the worthless games and lies

And the mirror's unkind
You're inside my mind
And you're outside my eyes

And I'm looking for something
That's real in my life, something true, yeah!
And I'm looking for something to hold on to
But I guess it won't be you

Thinking about
Thinking about
Thinking about you all the time
You're on my mind
But this song is not for you

Of all the things I could've done
I walked right out the door
Left like a loaded gun
Into the street
And these new days drag on
Through the long afternoon
I'm smashed and Flintstones are on TV

Repeat

Yeah well sometimes I wake up round midnight
With you wreathed around my skull
Like a halo of lies most of the time
And I'm in denial coming down from the ceiling
I was just your stepping stone
You burned out all my feelings

",Thinking About You,2001
John Waite,"We've seen a lifetime since we met
Through good and bad
And things we won't forget
Forgotten promises and broken vows
But we always made it through somehow
But the key to you is broken in the lock
And a simple band of gold is all we've got

It's in the things that I can't say
That tear us both apart
But if you keep listening
You'll hear inside my heart of hearts

Darling, the simple things are hard to say
And darling the words get in the way
The poet sees the world through rhymes
But only says so much
See darling, the words are in my touch
The meaning's in my touch

And maybe there's something I should say
To make everything that's wrong Ok
A simple phrase, a sonnet from a play
But a man can only say so much these days
And we're drifting to the deep end of the lake
Trying to make good on our past mistakes

And I know you're tired
But heaven's here and now
I've got no explanation
Words are worthless to me now

Darling... etc

When the rivers freeze and summer ends
See for me she has a coat so warm

Abe says, ""Man you must be puttin' me on""

And said, ""That way down Highway 61""

Well Mack the finger said to Louie the King

And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute son""

And he said, ""Yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she says is much too white
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""
He says, ""Hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done""

But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now the Rovin' gambler he was very bored
He was tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor

Could things be like they were before
If I promise to be a good boy and be the way you want me to
Could I still have a chance with you

Cause I don't know what made me fool enough to think
That I could live without your love
I must have cried a million tears since our goodbye
Yes and misery fits me like a glove

He says 'I've never believed in you anyway'
He says 'Now what the hell do you want to lecture me for
To keep the approaching years at bay?'
And as the curtains opposite open slight
They see a front door slam
And God the Father to His chosen Son
Shouts 'Be saved or You'll be damned'
And the years go past
Nothing changes 'cept the date
This time, it's just the same as the last
It's always just too late

And he can't bang out the dent

But the memories have peeled away

So proud to have nothing to say
Well there were moving pictures on the news at ten
Why they rioted, it's a mystery

Dusk of a late-night bar, late-night bar
Well they both believe in love at first sight
Provided you can't see the scars
And mummy did it and his daddy too
Otherwise how could they be here
Will you have me in sickness and in health
Til death do us part and we'll get divorced next year

His hard-earned money came and went
He just tried to pull down the biggest monument

Yesterday in tomorrow's world
They invented the wheel again
Someone died in Hollywood
And then he was proclaimed King of the Insane
And tomorrow it's in the papers
The next day it's on the news
And it all happened just like this before
You know I'm starting to get confused
Yeah and the years go past

Who couldn't stand the heat
I got cool bed linen, baby
So the story should be complete
But somewhere in the back of behind
There's a light that makes me feel unkind
Those stupid things I made you sign
It ain't deus ex machine
It's not some soul subpoena

You got a dark dark dark heart
It's the heart of darkness",Dark Dark Heart,1989

John Wesley Harding,"He's done it all a million times
The gags, the repartee, the little crimes
Every audience is special and that goes for you
He looks into your eyes again
He never does it but he tries again
That old boy lost look could bruise you black and blue
Everybody's looking for a single row so they can be alone
'cause every time the lights go up, they'd rather be at home
I looked through all the wanted ads with a fine toothed comb
And all I came up with was another evening
Doing the same thing twice
That's what I was doing

All the drinks that he's been sinking
Never ask him what he's thinking
Every audience is unique and that goes for you
Dead or alive you're coming with me
Because everything's my cup of tea
That's why I've got a gold suit and some green italian shoes
Everybody says they had, but we all know they didn't
It's impossible to be a little bit pregnant
Give me the whole fruit 'cause I'm getting just a segment
And all I end up with is another evening
Doing the same thing twice

By ugly looking bureaucrats with ears like headphones
Reading The Sun, Sunday Sport, S.Ideal Home, Woman's Own
Looks like you're on your own

Bring me on the magic sponge
My dying gasp, my final lunge
It's all over now bar the dance
Do it now but don't get caught
I've been having third thoughts
They can be so clever, only when the script demands
You cluttered up the sky now so you can't follow any star

No-one wants to end up face down in a reservoir
And I don't want to end up with another evening

Sing in tune for a world that is going for a song

And you can wake up in the morning with sweaty hands
Turn the radio on to the right waveband
Think about today and the one that you planned

Under the desperate gaze of the whole wide world
You turned into a spaced cowgirl
Spaced cowgirl
Lock up the medicine chest
This wild wild woman is way out west
Spaced cowgirl
Lock up the reins and the spurs
None of you cowboys are true to her

Well, you can be a good lover, hammer nails into hearts
And you can be a big loser when the real horror starts
You can blow hot and cold on the sacred graph

You had a good evening but you don't know where
All you recall is a fall guy with an up for sale stare
Fell down by the bed and not to say your prayers

Under the watchful eye....

Sometimes I listen to you, it's the whiskey talking
Sometimes I watch you move and it's the whiskey walking
Sometimes I sit and think of the things that might have been

Well, your eyes never open, when you sleep they don't close
And it rained so hard and your a delicate rose
Then it got so cold that your feelings froze

No, I still don't believe in all your second sight

Smile at the bird, we'll get you home alright

John Wesley Harding,"You might remember this conversation when you get older
You may recall the warning signs on the road
But if you lose all recollection
Or misplace your sense of direction
Here's a quarter taped to the number of my phone

When childish habits are slow to die
You might look up and wonder why
Things snowball in the twinkling of an eye

You could be paying for the present on expenses
You might realize your biggest lies on a movie screen
You might be living in a mansion
Your corporation in expansion
With a broken heart that far exceeds your wildest dreams

Somewhere way under the rainbow
Dragging round an empty pot of glue
Bruised and confused it could happen to you
Seeing for the first time that dreams can come true

I was living up the stairs from a mortuary
He could hear me bring the bodies home at night
He tried to say ""I was just like you""
I shouted back ""you're an old fool""
He said ""listen"" and I told him ""i'd rather die""
But I changed my mind",Things Snowball,1989

I have to leave the room
Another accident statistic
While the big bass drum goes boom
There's an apocalypse now on station road
If there's a nuclear winter, at least it'll snow
Your talk turns all of me upside down
You turned up my ticket at the lost and found
And all I got was the current crown worn by
Cathy's new clown

Our enemies are at the border
We couldn't go back too soon
Be a nice girl and don't take orders
That's what they're saying in the back room
You got a big black box that I can't get a look in
And I wanna look at you but I don't get a look in

But now I'm alone and I'm homeward bound

But I'm waiting for an audience with you

And all the wrestlers you've employed
And all the boys with whom you toyed
You tell me please don't get annoyed
You're behaving like some helen of troy
I don't care for original sin
It's a stupid world we're living in
Your paid assassin makes me wait
He eats with fingers off his plate
He says you've got a pressing date
With r.i.ps and heads of state
I know that he won't let me in

Got a pistol strapped into her thighs
Says you're as sweet as apple pie
You only get so bitchy cos you're shy
But that's a load of papal bull
I put you on that pedestal
People say I got no sense
But I'm waiting for an audience with you

Give me the strength of hercules
His fallen arches, water knees
And please please let me be like I oughtta be
Lost and lonely, hurt and happy
With a singer's vanity

Now everything seems like a myth
The strength that I have performed with
Two thousand stairs and there's no lift
Gonna get to the top and there's no if
What's for me when I get there
Is it just wheelchairs and grey hair
And never was one letter sent
I told the truth but told it bent
That's the custom that's the law

John Wesley Harding,"Bob Dylan is my father, Joan Baez is my mother
And I'm their bastard son
Though my roots show through I'm just twenty two
I don't belong to anyone
When the band was disbanded, I was disowned
I got a number you can ring me on but I ain't got no phone
Got a forwarding address, baby I ain't got no home
I got no direction home
That's the style of a bastard child
This is the song of a bastard son

Uncle Lenny used to make me laugh
Took away my nightmares, tore my daydreams in half
Showed them to me reflected upside down
In the mirror that Suzanne Vega found
Lenny's still doing his tricks today
Only goes to show that growing up might pay

Bruce and James were family friends
Took my mind to Carolina through the New Jersey bends
Gave me a harmonica when I was three
Nailed a banjo to my knees
Now Bruce is a foreman and James is a slave
Bruce gave in and James just gave up

My family didn't grow up too well with technology
And I think this is why they disowned me
But now I wanna get back into the fold
I don't wanna be a black sheep, I don't wanna grow old
Here's to Warren, Neil, T-Bone, Andy, Lou, Townes, Elliott
Tom, Steve, Elizabeth, Elvia, Dave
You're singing something good and it's gotta be saved
I think so!

I've only just started playing guitar and already they say
I'm a has-been
Say my songs are too long, words are too strong, shoes
Aren't clean
See the synthesizer's broken, the 12 inch does not exist
It's gonna take a blessed life to get on to the hit list
I'm gonna need a blessed life to get on to the hitlist
But I'm singing for the men, for the women and the kids

As their sight is restored to the blind
And I'm sifting trash on the offchance
That there might be something to find
And mary lets her fingers do the walking
Her baby's nearly due
She's listening but no-one's talking
At the citizen's advice bureau
And joe is down on the dole-queue
He should have signed on yesterday
Even if he was a carpenter and she was his lady
He still wouldn't be able to make it pay

And he don't believe in angels
She's been seeing another man
Infidelity runs in the family
But that wasn't a part of the plan
And shepherds watch the flicks by night
At the king's cross all night show
Something's trying to catch their eyes
But they're too grossed out to know
And the three kings travel like three ships a-sailing
They've got some gifts he'll need
Cocaine for sniffing, money for corruption, and a whole load of videos of I love lucy

But the king of the country he's getting frightened
He doesn't want to be another man's pawn
And he crushes the beer can between his hands
He sees his fate, the clown yells checkmate
And another star is born

But the baby is killed in an instant
As though his whole life were a dream
Though his book sells well and he pulls out the stops
Everyone knows he's a hyped-up hasbeen

And the t-shirts just embarrass
And thought become memories after a while
He's looking so much older now
It's hard to belive that that was style
And he throws his cloak out to his fan
It's his last chance sacrifice
The girls are crawling a cut-glass sea
No-one even wants to look twice
Cos the circle's all but full now
But the stalls are empty for the latest son
Who just smiles and says
Give my regards to fleet street, I've gotta run

As their sight is restored to the blind
And I'm sifting trash on the offchance
That there might be something to find... 
 

",Bridegroom Blues,1991
John Wesley Harding,"There are so many sides to every story
And this is mine
A dirty pair of hands sometimes has to come clean
And now is the time
I just couldn't see love's great defection
Now it's flourishing in one dimension
Love went over the wall
Was it pushed or did it fall? 

The official story was a 60/40 split
Cut with a knife
But now that I'm ghostwriting your autobiography
This ought to be your life
You wouldn't have to be a great detective
To see the things you do to me are self-reflexive
They bounce right back from me
Cos I'm a human trampoline

Seem now, it's so hard to take
Heart to hearts that were heart for heart's sake
Now cupid only watches darts
Love is just the sum of it's parts

Together we were a perfect circle
I think that we should get back again
I'll hold you close and we'll roll all the way
Down to lover's lane
We're just two sides of a vulgar fraction
Waiting for a little love interaction
When the borderline will fall
Without you I mean half of nothing at all

Looking back it seems like fake
Heart to hearts that were heart for hearts sake
I should have known right from the start
I want you know, I want the fake
I learnt the laws and found it's just give and take
(you give and I take)
I've got the guts, I will restart
And love is only the sum of it's parts
Love is the sum of it's parts
Yes it is.

And half an ounce of hope
Sold his soul in the vestry
Money for old rope
Been this way a million times
But now his time is nigh
He steps into the spotlight
He wants to say 'hi
Hello, we're so glad you came
You've never seen me before'
He's so ambitious, he's so game
But yesterday he was dressed the same
Then he was so much easier to ignore
Here comes the groom
But the world's not an inn and there isn't any room for you
But here he comes

He married into money
Just to kiss and tell
He ripped the contract open
He's out of his shell
He looks into a mirror
Practising his poise
But it reflects so badly
The groom just gets annoyed
He gasps, he forgets his lines
He's never done that before
The scientists say he's doing fine
This fumbling frantic frankenstein
Soon he's gonna do the dinosaur
Here comes the groom

His fingers are on the cliff edge
His head is going under
Is that applause? 
No that's just thunder....
Why do you keep saying I do? 
What does the bride mean to you? 

Play me some puccini
Make it heavy on the strings
Walk me to the altar
The choir can't even sing
Right side for the photographs
Left side for the kids
God made me do it
So that's what I did
He coughs, loosens his bow-tie
You've never seen him before
He kisses the bride, oh you know why

I can see it in your smiling eyes
I can't help when you're telling lies
I can see it in your lack of surprise
I can see just where the truth doesn't lie
Watching you cut through the bind that ties

Once upon a time a story with a happy end
But that's all in the past now, it's all around the bend
You can't appease me now, those hopeless things you send
And you can't please me now and we can't start again
There's too much history, and no clean sheets
When I get to hear his story, it puts my feet to sleep
It's all romantic nothing about a heart in a rage
Murdered by some cartoon villain who ripped out the last page

Happy ever after, a prince apparent and his bride
All his disarming charm and her unfaithful side
He's scouting for success and she's his girl guide

Sometimes you must recross them, that's something you never learnt

So hard for to realise that I'm not dead yet
When everything that we wanted is beyond beyond
And all that I hoped for is long dead gone

So how can I sleep in this memory bed
Where I feel like a grave with a tomb for a bedhead
With your name and my name carved deep in the stone
Now faded away cos we're long dead gone

We're long dead gone, long dead gone
Now faded away because we're long dead gone

And love lies bewildered, checking its pulse
To see if it compares to anything else
And two things still beating, but never as one
And one thing lies choking cos it's long dead gone

So here rests in pieces
Whatever it was that we could admit to
Whatever it was that was me and you

So why won't I just let it die and get rid
Of the truth that we both would've rather kept hid
Better to live a lie than pretend that you're not
And to live out a love that is long dead gone

It's long dead gone, long dead gone
Don't live out a love which is long dead gone
Never live out a love that is long dead gone

That your joke's become your reality

I was almost dying of thirst
We parked the car in some old schoolyard
The windscreen caked in dirt
There was no water in the engine left
No tread upon the tyres
The electrics were broke 'cause you went mad
You ripped out all the wires
Across the road, a small cafe
In this state of disrepair
You went for papers and a shave
So I saved you a chair
I knew it wasn't the journey's end
And that your dream was incomplete
But I just could not stand anymore
I was dead upon my feet
I was dead upon my feet

There's nothing there in the market square
But the ghost of the scarlet town crier
I was dead upon my feet
I sing the red rose and the briar
I sing the red rose and the briar

The waitress told me her life story
She'd always meant to up and go
She wiped a cup on her red pinafore
As we waited for you to show
And I told her just a little of you
But left the picture incomplete
You still weren't there to paint it in person
So I skipped out on the street
I skipped out on the street
The newsagent grinned, he said yes you'd been in
You bought a local paper and some shades
The washroom attendant said that you'd freshened up
That you'd left but you hadn't paid
And I couldn't figure out where you were
So I went back just to look near the car
There was nothing there where it should have been

In a garage off on the right
And a man said 'get your hands off son'

There was nothing left of mine inside
Not even the broken radio
And I couldn't figure out where that left me
So I went back to look for rose
The cafe rouge was a lunchtime rush
Of regulars yelling for food
The service in there left a lot to be desired
And all the regulars were getting rude
I saw an apron thrown over a chair
A note said 'hey john we're gone, we're gone'
And I just smiled 'cause I loved you both
So I put the apron on

His pa will be so disappointed
To find out his son was double-jointed
Some will flounder
Some will be anointed
The son couldn't wait to do a turn-about

It's been raining but it's gonna stop
Cats and dogs will shake themselves
Time to work, time to pick those hops
I gotta go and mend the greenhouse shelves
This was meant, well, it's all heaven-sent
Go out naked and have no fear

But now he's grinning from ear to ear
Now he's grinning from here to here",When the Sun Comes Out,1991
John Wesley Harding,"How can you be so dark and disgusting
When she's all sweetness and light
She doesn't lie through her teeth all day
She doesn't grind them in her dreams

When you hold her tight at night
How can you be so sick and suspicious
When she's health and goodness personified? 
That love you gave her, it's just a virus

That wants blood for dr.hyde
She's an angel and you're a clown
She'll be flying when you're six feet under the ground
You'll be lying because someone told you you should
She's an angel and you're no good

How can you be so cool and distant
When she always does her best to be here
Right between your dreams and your nightmare desires
The hole in your wall has got so small

Her stockings are so sheer
How can you be so greedy and hopeless
She gives you everything but you still want more
If you could see the looks you give her

That's something you'd abhor
She's an angel and you're a joke
A shaggy dog shuffling in to give the punchline a poke
You're just dying to turn her into red riding hood
She's an angel and you're no good

She's a not a barbie doll
You can drag around on some dog collar
You can't wrap love up in clingflim
Keep it from getting older

She'll always be so artless
You're heartless, getting colder
Don't try to come from behind
'Cause I'll be right over your shoulder

How can you treat her dumb and stupid
When she knows that you're not the bee's knees
You'll have to let her turn the bedside light right off
Instead of you turning it down to mood by the three degrees

How can you be so limp and spineless
When she'd even help you to make your final stand
It's not enough for anyone
Just to lie back and think of iceland
She's not an angel, she's flesh and blood

You do the dirty and she's crawled around right in your mud
Now you're crying, I think that we knew that you would

Even my lungs have started to groan
Everybody is singing their own song
Sometimes I wanna sing alone
Never been a primadonna
Never seem to wanna be the one to complain
Enough's too much and now I'm gonna
Stop the madness soon before it drives me insane

So, take me where the sun won't shine on me
Take me where my conscience won't go
Take me where the sun won't shine on me
Don't tell me I'm backing out cos I don't wanna know

Everyone around this town is so angry
Blaring horns, swearing, shaking fists
If everybody in the world was a hit man
We'd wipe each other off each other's hit lists

Who cares about the starving millions
We're just happy that our cheques don't bounce

John Wesley Harding,"With all your vice and volume the whole of last week
The plastic pretenders to paradise speak
Of your fictions of triumph and legends of pain
The sense that you'd left you'd be back once again
There's a glint in your eyes and the sky starts to laugh
It's two to one you never did things by half
And I'm out on the rooftops yelling your name
Cos without you this town will be too much the same

You went driving in the rain
I'll never see you again
There's nothing in the air left to compare
To all of your passion and genius pain
You went driving in the rain
I'll never see you again

There was talk of an illness that came by surprise
The papers did penance, the whole town took sides
Oh, but it was your dancing and mischeivous mind
And then we were shot of you, but no-one's that blind
And there's flowers have bloomed down the side of your street
Where you and your demons did openly meet
And I hope it's wide open where you've got to
There's closed minds in this town that couldn't accept you

(chorus)

They're making excuses, the reasons the facts
They're reasoning how long you'll take to come back
But there's guilt in their prayers, maybe shame in their pride
They know it was no fault of yours down inside
They steps can't be retraced cos tracks disappear
And there'd be no welcome for you back here
Because you were the worst side of everyone's soul
They had to get rid or face up to the cold

When your shares hit low and the world starts to rearrange
And when it does I know that
You won't be where it's at

And it's much more sinister than the birds and the bees

And you're learning much more than you ever expected

And awaits congratulations

And he wails amidst the ruins

On this worthless enterprise

Everything was not just as it seems
Take a look around at the faces in the crowd
And you'll see where I've been

We met up on the Saturday, I thought it was us two
But I had not asked questions not knowing what to do
Twelve of them were in the van, thirteen including me
Twelve pairs of eyes were staring back at me, suspiciously
And so I just sat down and drove, took them to some track
And drove past the security guard while they hid in the back
They made me stop, and got out there, and I heard a couple of shots
I hoped they were in self-defense but I knew that they were not
They were not

Not in this weekend of ordinary dreams

I drummed my fingers on the wheel and waited for the boys
Had a smoke, I had a few, I got very paranoid
And still they hadn't come back there, so I just drove away
Deciding to play safe and get my share another day

On Sunday, he came round my place, I asked him where they'd been
He said they'd left another way and only I was seen
He said that we should cash the van and did I want my share
I didn't like the way they'd left but by now I didn't care
Didn't care

Didn't care for this weekend of ordinary dreams

He drove me to a back room with a single swinging light
Someone said ""the fish are starving, ain't it time they had a bite""
And I felt sick and stupid and damned my own brown hair
Forgetting that the price you pay must far exceed the share
Someone pulled a knife out and they stabbed me in the back
They tied my hands and bound my feet and threw me in a sack
They took me to a lakeside and they threw my body in

It all made the news but the story was wrong
And the photo wasn't even of me
And the great god I love, he intoned from above
You shouldn't sniff at free publicity
But it wasn't the voice I'd expected to hear
it was thin and unclear like Richard Gere
And somebody said ""God's had a bad fall
That's his manager taking his calls""


And I said
""Where's the truth around here today?
Where do fact and fiction go their separate ways?
I thought we were much too clever to pray
But where's the truth to find the truth?""


I was put in a cell for the whole afterlife
But my mind was just as free as can be
Somebody said, ""just your body's enchained""
And you can guess how that encouraged me
So I wandered and roamed for the rest of my days
I was clearing my name, I was apportioning days
And then I woke up, it was all a dream, all was well
But when I woke up, I woke up in my cell

And I said
""Where's the truth around here today?
Where do fact and fiction separate
No-one wants to be the one to say
Where's the truth around here today?""


I was arrested for disturbing the peace.",The Truth,1992
John Wesley Harding,"somebody went and killed some people
And they know who
The evidence fits around the facts
Like a favourite shoe
But nobody knows where the corpses are
Their whereabouts unknown
The killer's in a frenzy
And he's getting on the phone
So they got their thinking hats on
And spread out in their cars
But only I know where the bodies are

You know they can i.d. someone
From one cell of skin
But they couldn't spot a crime scene
If the killer went and let 'em in
To genetic fingerprinting
We all take off our hats
To hide the little stains that spread
Across the welcome mat
You can put your best foot forward
And wish upon a star
But only I know where the bodies are


Lawyers defending guilty men
Depending on the bid
The question isn't if they're guilty
But if they'll get acquitted
Justice goes unjustfied
Beneath a police chief and an eagle
Pain's too difficult to prove
They're not going to make pain illegal
To think that we were once naive
To think we've come this far
To think that only I know where the bodies are


Some people don't wanna know
The facts behind the scam
Or see ""Who could I be?""
Peeking out behind ""The great I am""
But most of us got enough to think about
Husbands and wives
To notice pointless death's become
A brand new way of life
And this is just a sandwich board
That I wear out in the park
Saying only I know where the bodies are
(And I'm not telling you.)

John Wesley Harding,"It's been raining for a million years
And the weather just won't turn
Try to build a fire round your place
And the damned logs refuse to burn
The braindead have been sitting on their sunbeds
Where's heaven for it's own sake
Lying dead or half-forgotten
At the bottom of a bottomless lake

But when the sun comes out
The world's gonna go crazy
Everybody's gonna move their arms about
Cos what they believed is turned inside-out
When the sun comes out

It's been raining since I don't know when
We're all in for a big surprise
Go to the woods in your dreams tonight
And when you awake you won't believe your eyes
It's all the rage, it'll make the front page
Gotta get the gutter press going down the drain
Butter melts if you leave it near the window
And it's time to try and use a deckchair again

But when the sun comes out....

When the sun comes out
His pa will be so disappointed
To find out his son was double-jointed
Some will flounder
Some will be anointed
The son couldn't wait to do a turn-about

It's been raining but it's gonna stop
Cats and dogs will shake themselves
Time to work, time to pick those hops
I gotta go and mend the greenhouse shelves

You've got to ration love because you know that there's a shortage
She'll take you with a pinch of salt
And she'll give you no quarter
She's the queen of the short order
And you're a one-armed bandit
Gambling on a crash
Wearing a pair of silly glasses and a baby's wax moustache

If you're finding life a bastard, someone somewhere's having fun

Throw you right back in again

You know that Hell just isn't some kinda bottomless pit
It's a chair in a long white corridor and you're sitting in it
With clenched fists
The lifestyles of the rich and hopeless
I'm gonna build me a coffin and get right in
Sometimes it's too much to see what's happening around me
I'm gonna build me a coffin and get right in
Sometimes it's too much to see what's happening around me

So just perhaps you're not the only one
They say that a change is gonna come
Why the hell are you acting deaf, blind, dumb

Troops are camping at the border and of course they're champing at the bit
The concert's all security, you've bought your seat so sit in it
New features in the market square, it's just behind the porn exchange
Free executions here so all change
You know this town is a free for all, so please flash your cash
There's a big sale at the supermarket, garbage, pills and trash
Mind that ash
Big sister's missed the boat again

",Build Me a Coffin,1996
John Wesley Harding,"Not long ago I went through the gate of dreams
I came to the famous City of Destruction
Where now a shuttle runs to the Emerald City
With air miles and big group reductions
So I went to the ticket office where Evangelist sat
And reserved seats through credit card calls
I said ' How does it feel now they changed your job?'
He said 'Now I don't feel anything at all'

As we moved off I looked down on the Myre of Despair
From a bridge that passed a thousand miles above
Its legs were made of books that they'd thrown into the mud
And the books were of philosophy and love
As we reached the Hill of Difficulty, we waited for a climb
They'd dug a tunnel through the center of the stone
And with the excess rock, well the valley became landfill
Where once you'd had to walk down there alone

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For all those who seek the truth but don't have the time to get there
Don't have the time to get there

The train ride felt so smooth that I put my feet up
Barely noticing the motion of the carriage
The stewardess was Prudence with her sister Charity
For fifteen grand they'd sell their hands in marriage
And just as we were entering the Valley of Death
I expected to be plunged into the darkness
But the company had floodlit the underground gloom
Taken care not to make this place seem joyless

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For all those with the money, just tender up the fare
Just tender up the fare

It looked like we stopped at the mouth of Hell itself
But they said it was a now-extinct volcano
And if you'd seen the demons seemed to emanate from there
You'd have taken the guidebook at its say so
But some of my companions they would not get back in
They'd heard that heaven it was vastly over-rated
The weather here was warmer, and drinking was allowed
And they thought they'd see us come back here much later

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
You could be home by now, if you lived there
If you lived there

After boarding no new passengers we went upon our way
Past the place where Pope and Pagan ruled with terror
But now the giant Scientology had eaten them for breakfast
And bought all the property around her
At a city called Vanity we stayed for the night
Where one's every whim was catered for and sated
The shuttle brought prosperity and business in its wake
And an attitude that never gets outdated

So all aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For all those seeing double, just tender up the fare
Just tender up the fare

So Charming was the city with its profitable fair
The inhabitants claimed it was the only heaven
And said that only dreamers ever venture beyond its gates
And go to that land of Never-Never
And in this city an education came without a school
The shops sold one alongside praise and honor
Reputations and honour went on sale at the fair
And conscience could buy almost any of them

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
The most efficient way to go, it's the best way to get there
It's the best way to get there

And I stayed in the city, til I became like those
Who lived there and abandoned their old questions
Til I saw some pilgrims who'd walked the journey's length
Standing at the edge of its dimensions
'Friend let me tell you' said the Speaker to my ear
'The whole concept of the shuttle is a Bubble
You can pay the fare and travel for the rest of your life
You'll never get anywhere but trouble
'cause the train is only progress and it isn't a roundtrip
And just in case the whole thing should explode
The Lord of the Good City he will never let you in
And he grants no kind of permit to the railroad'

I got back on the train and my companions they were few
My hopes with the suburbs disappearing
We saw the Silver Mine and the Castle of Despair
And we saw our destination it was nearing
Saw the gates of that fair city, beyond a river lay
A blinding light shone from the other side
A ferry boat was waiting to carry us over
It was built of paper and everybody died

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For all those who want the truth but have no time to get there
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
Just say what you've got, we'll sell you a fare
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
We'll look after you so good that you won't wanna get there
You won't wanna get there



",The Celestial Shuttle,1996
John Wesley Harding,"They gave me doses of dioxide
Started coughing constantly
Nursed inside my wounded pride
Poisoned arrow in my knee
Then they stood around my bed
Said I was getting on famously
A faceless man in a TV van
Reprogrammed my naivety
I met you sparring in a corner
And you spat right in my face
People say it looks like tears
Because they'll have seen the trace
And they take it as their job of work
To put me right back in my place
And I pretend that I wanna be
A contender in the human race

Now when you hit me
I don't cry
The only thing that remains for me
Is to learn how I can say goodbye
'cause I'm ready, steady, dead on arrival
I'm ready, steady, dead on arrival
I'm ready, steady, dead on arrival

You know I thought that this was mist
But now I guess it is pollution
Caused by an economy of half-truths
And the resulting confusion
You sign a form the day you're born
That commits you to collusion
With society's special standards
And its optical illusions
Someone says you're still alive
Gives you great expectations
But now you know you're dead inside
'cause you feel no shock vibrations
Now you must control yourself
You can always cheat at patience
Soon I'll be right in the dog house
Food for FBI alsations

Now when you hit me
I don't cry
The only thing that remains for me
Is to learn how I can say goodbye
'cause I'm ready, steady, dead on arrival

A chemical reaction late into the night
Once they're out of love, now they're outta sight
That's alright
When silence reigns, it's strange weather
Why do you have to leave me for a man
Who couldn't tie his shoe-laces together?
He's had the last laugh but the joke's on him
He could've had a final bang but drags on with a whimper
When dogs bark
And when cats meow
Two humans are the animals they knew they could be now
Sniffing round each other's dirt
Fighting til it starts to hurt
And eating each other's babies

Paperback's get thrown, the story unfolds
Two lost sheep who couldn't find the fold
They got no common sense, couldn't catch the common cold
I've been told
She fights tooth and claw, he starts to abuse her
You show me someone who takes losing well
And I'll show you a loser
He's a very small man wearing very big clothes
There's no room for expansion but there's plenty of room for growth
When dogs bark
And when cats meow
Two humans fighting middleweight, instead of middlebrow
Picking on those little things
Tearing off each other's wings
And eating each other's babies

We're stuck here in this cage
Playing out this prison game
Committing all these war crimes
Time after time after time after time after time

Something clicks, time to get soft
She's getting on, he's getting off
On the way she splutters with her little cough
That's enough
They're so adept, he used to spoil her
Sometimes we get so see through
Think I'm living out some potboiler
Remember me forever in your gallery
When all your past is catalogued and filed alphabetically
When dogs bark
And when cats meow

Put off the break up

Let's eat each other's babies

We drove home in a hearse

So I'll see you

The king is on the balcony, the queen is in the sack
He's lying through his golden teeth, she's lying on her back
Beneath the handsome soldier and the family coat of arms
The lady she's affected by the soldier's obvious charms
And the king sweats quite profusely and says we should stay calm
I can see his brand new suit but I can't see the man
He's here to cover up his so-called economic plan
But his voice dwindles to nothing, he strikes up the royal band

They built a brand new human but forgot about the spine

It's not the way you play the game but how you can succeed
Put the bastards in a new town and watch the rabbits breed

Because it's all performed for the idiot's delight

The soldier's executed, he's mistaken for the king
Who said he was from somewhere else and hadn't done a thing
And made off with the crown jewels but misplaced his wedding ring
Power's aphrodisiac, addicts die of thirst
The new El Presidente saw his bubble finally burst
And the king returned from exile, by request to break the curse
He fulfils election promises with temporary cures
And everything's worse than it once was without the same allure
And his stepson is on squad inspection making overtures

On the way back from work it was getting dark
He saw autumn trees with their peeling bark
She was sitting on a bench
He didn't think she'd look twice you see
But she looked three times or so it would seem
The rain started up it began to teem
And she was getting drenched

She started to run but he caught up quickly
And he was wearing sunglasses it was hard to see
Then she hit him with a moving plea
Could I please share your umbrella
Well he just smiled and he let her in
And they walked through the rain like Siamese twins
He doesn't normally pick up girls he thinks it's a sin
He just not that sort of fella

She told him where she lived and she told him her name
And he tried her patience, she tried to play games
He wanted to be with her though his excuse was lame
I was going that way anyway
Her flat in a house it was three miles out
Right next to a train track and he had to shout
She said I'm a dancer, she twirled about
And asked him if he wanted to stay

His clothes were really wet he should have taken them off
But he was embarrassed 'cause he thought she'd laugh
But then she insisted when she heard him cough
She went to make some tea
And he was wearing just a towel to keep him warm
And he saw that she liked Somerset Maugham
She took the Guardian so she could be better informed
But she wasn't interested politically
She seemed rather nonchalant

Time went fast, time came to leave
But in that room he thought he was Adam, she was Eve
He wasn't lying and she wasn't deceived
And neither knew what to say
But everything seemed to be going down fine
Til she gave him a leaving sign
And he asked her 'Why?', he said 'Is the fault all mine?'
She just said 'No, I've had a bad day'

So he wandered back to town in the drizzling rain
And he wondered if he'd ever see her again
He wanted to walk with her down lover's lane
And it started to make him cry
'cause his life was turning cartwheels, all his cards were down
In the circus of existence, he always played a clown
He wanted a slice of forever as he turned into town
And he felt her memory die

But today he was walking through the park
On the way back from work it was still getting dark
He saw autumn trees with their peeling bark
And she was still sitting on that bench

He holds the gun hard to her forehead
He's given her his best shot
She cleaned the barrel while they made love
It was the bullets that he forgot
One day when he stopped lying next to her
That was when the lying stopped
That was when the lying stopped

And it's the long goodbye
It's the long goodbye
It's the long goodbye
But it's the wrong goodbye

Wakes her out of her latest nightmare

One more left til she falls down the stairs

As he's free falling fast to the floor
But nobody claps because nobody's watching
It's his lawyers who get all the applause

Time's on the move and I'm on the red-eye
Where I'm hoping to find one more song
But it's like looking for rain in the river
We'd better not leave it too long

Terry and Julie, they filled out the coupon
They won tickets tonight for the show
But it's the aisles in the new stores that beckon
As they shine a divine guiding glow

The bridge through the city, well it has just crumbled
And that link is what kept us all sane
The two of them tumble into the river
Forget to come up for air again
Forget to come up for air again

",In Paradise,1996
John Wesley Harding,"There was you and me and then there was him
Which leaves me out on a limb
Out in the cold where the wild things grow
Where no one sleeps because no one knows
That there are 26 letters, just five vowels
And you can use them all, it's allowed
If you've got the patience
Because there are infinite combinations


There are cars on fire and burst balloons
Which one of us must mend soon
But it's a dark old path through the dead of night
And only one way to get there right
Because there are 20 million roads
And 20 million coming home
You can find the longest way, it's not unknown
If you've got the patience
Cos there are infinite combinations


Your heart is safe, I don't have a key
Your heart is a safe that's locked to me
But when the lights go out, I'll place my bets
Because we're not finished yet
There are endless numbers and finite moves
But you can try them all, it's been proved
If you have the patience
Because there are infinite combinations ",Infinite Combinations,1996
John Wesley Harding,"The king puts on his raiment
And surveys the royal scene
And tries to put his finger on
The source of all his ennui
But when something goes, it's gone, you know
Starts at the top, spreads down
Just check out the faded bodywork
Beneath his rusted crown

They're waiting for impeachment
But they can't see the day
The queen can't give him any heirs
The word is he's to blame
So he beheads her for amusements
And now he's quoting Nietzsche
You'd think that he would have known
She was his one redeeming feature

But the king isn't dead, the king's dead boring
That's the song that the millions sing
You name it, he's lost it, he lacks everything
The king is dead boring

He used to be a Don Juan
Now he's just the royal slut
Knocking up the servant girls
Waking up a half-cut
He gets a chance to win them back
But gives them some old spiel
And all they see's the ghost
Of his former ex-appeal

But the king isn't dead, the king's dead boring
That's the song that his minions sing
You name it, he's lost it, he lacks everything
The king is dead boring

They used to sing long live the king
He was the man with everything
But now they shout
""Get that dull bastard out""

He used to be so Carnaby
So out of all our leagues
Now it's all that he can do
To zip up his fatigues
If only he could make excuses
Engage with us somehow
But effort is so out of place
And failure's not allowed

Because the king isn't dead, the king's dead boring
That's the song that the millions sing
You name it, he's lost it, he lacks everything
The king is dead boring",The King Is Dead Boring,1996
John Wesley Harding,"In Westminster, the bell fell down
Took three hundred years to touch the ground
Fall leaves drifted by and turned brown
A foreign plane was downed

Dogs came running from their cold dog pound
They leapt through the fence and ran downtown
And the convicts turned their ship around
And they were homeward bound

Kiss me, Miss Liberty
Take me to bed
So I can be free as well
Not just in my head
Kiss me, Miss Liberty
Lift me alone
Unchain my heavy heart
Fill me with love
Miss Liberty, Kiss me

And the slave were saved from their chain-gang
Knives cut men down just about to hang
Lost love returned just like a boomerang
And it was I who sang

Kiss me, Miss Liberty
Take me to bed
So I can be free as well
Not just in my head
Miss Liberty, kiss me

Freedom, show me to your foreign shore
Lay me in your arms at your front door
I can't face confinement anymore
I won't be ignored

Kiss me, Miss Liberty
Take me to bed
So I can be free as well
Not just in my head
Kiss me, Miss Liberty
Lift me above
Unchain my heavy heart
Fill me with love
Miss Liberty, Kiss me","Kiss Me, Miss Liberty",1996
