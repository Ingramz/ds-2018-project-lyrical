Harry James & His Orchestra,"'Cause it's been so long
Since I held you tight
When we said good night
It's been so long
Honey, can't you see
What you've done to me?
I've been in a kind of daze
For days and days and days
Feelin' blue, missin' you
In, oh, so many ways
'Cause it was so nice
When we had that date
Every night at eight
It was so nice
Then we said good-bye
What a fool was I
Let me get back in your arms where I belong
'Cause it's been, oh, so long",It's Been So Long,1994
Harry James & His Orchestra,"Will this be moon love, nothing but moon love,
Will you be gone when the dawn comes stealing through?
Are these just moon dreams, grand while the moon beams?
But when the moon fades away, will my dreams come true?

Harry James & His Orchestra,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

I hate to see that evening sun go down

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Harry James & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

How much you mean to me.
My world would end if ever we were through.

Harry James & His Orchestra,"Through the trees comes autumn with her serenade.
Melodies the sweetest music ever played.
Autumn kisses we knew are beautiful souvenirs.
As I pause to recall the leaves seem to fall like tears.

Love was ours until October wandered by.

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you

More lost without you and so it goes

As I recall it, you were in it, too.

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did.
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me.
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all.

For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Harry James Band,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2011
Harry James Orchestra,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all

Oh please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say no, no

I tell them you're okay 
When they ask about you.

They wonder where we've been

No camines sin poner tu mirada en mi
Ya no camines mas sin mi

Oh no
Hoy siento que las oras
Se me hacen segundos
Siento que me muero y que se acaba el mundo

Un éxito rotundo
Pero por dentro siento que soy un
Vagabundo

Riquezas y placeres
Buscando ser feliz
He herido a mil mujeres

He tenido todo
Lo que un joven quiere

De que vale el dinero
Si no puedo comprar un amigo sincero
Si no puedo encontrar
A alguien que me diga
Héctor cuenta conmigo con o sin dinero
Mi mente dice no
Con ella batallo
Quiero servirte pero
Por mi orgullo callo

Camino sin norte

Levántame no veo la salida
Con mis fuerzas no puedo
Aquí sigue la herida
Muchos que me saltan
Y me llenan el ego

Pero quiero palabras que me llene mi vida
De que valen los lujos?
De que vale la fama

Si tan solo el borde de mi manto
Tocaras
Te sanaría del dolor y del quebranto

Deseo que vuelvas

No camines sin poner tu mirada en mi
Ya no camines mas sin mi

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000
Harry McClintock,"One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fire  was burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
And he said, ""Boys, I'm not turning
I'm headed for a land that's far away
Besides the crystal fountains
So come with me, we'll go and see
The Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
There's a land that's fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
On the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
The lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Oh I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall
The wind don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railroad bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And of whiskey, too
You can paddle all around 'em
In a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
The jails are made of tin
And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws or picks,
I'ma goin' to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the Turk
That invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

I'll see you all this coming Fall

We're leaving this whole fairground behind
It's a dream that's going cold

The circus never dies
The act forever haunts these skies
I know we cannot stay

Farewell to the fairground
These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town
Until the ice begins to thaw

This place used to gleam
I see it in my hopeful dreams
Now I have to get away

We move towards the stars
And all that we touch becomes ours
Let's keep warm till it's day

Farewell to the fairground
These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town
Until the ice begins to thaw

We'll head south, just hold my hand now
I feel like I'm casting off my clothes
And I'm running through the snow towards the sunset
And I'm always with you

Keep on running
Keep, keep on running
There's no place like home
There's no place like home

Keep, keep on running
There's no place like home

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night

It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone

One little Indian forgot to say his prayers
Then there were three

Three little Indians
Deciding what they're gonna have to do
One took the name of God in vain
Then there were two

Two little Indians
Thinking that they oughta have some fun
One took a liking to a picture of himself
Then there was one

One little Indian
Out looking for the sun
At six o'clock, the moon came out
Then there was none

This is our last dance together
Tonight soon will be long ago
And in our moment of parting
This is all I want you to know

There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you

There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never, ever be another you?

Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never ever be
Another you?

In the morning when I first arrive

Such a comfort to know its got no place to go,
It's always there
Its the one thing I've got, a huge success,

My old desk never needs a rest,
And I've never once heard it cry
I've never seen it tease, its always there to please me

Tie your horse up tight, so he'll know no harm

Harry Nilsson,"When he was young, he sang in the band and his fans all looked the same
And the fans he had were younger than he and they loved to scream his name
They'd leave at the end of the third show, go home to talk of the fun 
Well, isn't nice the parents would say, well isn't nice you've got someone
Someone to idolize, he must look twice his size
I think it's great you're going through a phase
And I'm awfully glad it will all be over in a couple of days

Well, the calendar changed and the pages fell off, but the singer remained the same
And he never grew tired of singing his song, and his fans still called his name
They'd leave at the end of the second show, go home to talk of the fun
For most of the fans were married by then, so they had to be in by one

I'm awfully glad, the husbands would say, I'm awfully glad you got someone
Someone, I realize, who used to look twice his size
I think it's great you still remember his name
And I'll bet if he knew you were there for the show
He'd be awfully glad you came

Listen to me crying on my pillow
Crying cause I know my love is gone from me

Living in a world of different places, 
Looking at a million different faces
Yet I see a face in every face I see      
Love must lack a sense of humor, 

It laughs when other people cry
Love, would love to hear the rumor, 
That you and I have finally said goodbye

I know that every heart was made for breaking
And my love was ready for the takin',
Still I won't complain for someday love will call again

Must I take a memory as a token,
To replace a heart that love has broken
Will the wailing willow always weep for me
Must I see a face in every place I see

Bojangles,
And he'd dance for you
In worn out shoes,
With silver hair,
A ragged shirt,
And baggy pants.
The old soft shoe.
Jump so high,
Jump so high,
Then he'd lightly touch down.

I met him in a cell
In New Orleans,
I was down and out.
He looked to me to be the very eyes of age
As he spoke right out,
Talked of life, talked of life,
Laughed, slapped his leg and stepped.

He said the name ""Bojangles""
And he danced a lick
Across the cell.
Grabbed his pants,
A better stance,
And wow he jumped up high.
Clicked his heels.
He let go a laugh,
Let go a laugh,
Shook back his clothes all around.

He danced with those at minstrel
Shows & county fairs,
Throughout The South.
He spoke with tears
Of fifteen years
Of how his dog and him,
Had traveled about.
His dog up and died,
He up and died,
After twenty years he still greives.

He said ""I dance
Now and every chance at
Honkey-tonks,
For drinks and tips.
But most of time
I spend behind these country bars,
Cause I drinks a bit.""

And as he shook his head,

Our voices lifted higher
We sang until we reached the bridge
We crossed, then saw the wire

The enemy had opened fire

Now, we ain't gonna sing that song no more
Ain't gonna sing that song no more

How to write a song
How to write a song
How to write a song

If you write it on guitar
Place your guitar upon your knee
If you write it on piano
Don't do that

Place your fingers on the
Strings of your guitar
Not your piano
If you write it on piano, don't do that

Now strum or press together
Feeling, this might take a little time
Now think of something sad or something funny
Which inevitably brings us to the rhyme

Let's assume you're just an asshole
And there's nothing in your pain
It might help if you remember
These helpful little hints

Don't try to rhyme (sumba?) with anything
That goes for homage as well
But notice how cleverly
I just used them both
And all I have to do
Is rhyme well

You've got to be tricky
Because to avoid these words takes talent
So never ever trap yourself
Like that, or you'll end up saying words like

Oh, balent or falent
Or dalent or
Oh, I'm sure you'll catch on fast

Now some tips on tempo
And some subjects to avoid
Like the use of the word bandit
Unless you really have to say it
And that's for 'tempo'

And if you say 'time'
That's strictly up to you
Because that depends on how you play it

Now let's do (it) once
Now think of a rhyme
Now that's it, you're doing fine
Think of the good time
We just had together

If you practice these instructions
On the board of some new sale
If you listen very carefully
I'm sure you'll shout it there

I said shout
Shout it
Why, heheh, That rhymes with talent
That takes talent
That is talent
Oh my God, oh
Shout it rhymes with talent
That takes talent
That is talent

Oh, I'll glide across the floor.

You know, down in my soul I hate rock and roll
And I don't like the way that them drummers beat on them drums
They always hum along, out of tune
But I can see Valentino and me when I hear a tango

Yeah, I can see Marlon Brando and me when I hear a tango",I'll Take a Tango,1976
Harry Nilsson,"Jesus I said Jesus I said Jesus Christ you're tall
I bet nobody I bet nobody I bet nobody wanted to dance with you at all
I said Jesus, I said Jesus there hardly ain't no room here for you at all
I said Jesus. I said Jesus I said Jesus Christ you're tall

Well we could dribble our way down a courtship
Get married for a little while
I would shoot a little love inside your basket mama and in a little while we'd have a child
He'd be a little boy, he'd be a little boy

But he'll get taller as the time goes by
He'd be a little boy, he'd be a little boy
But pretty soon he'll hear the other boys cry
Because they're saying to him

Jesus they'd say Jesus they'd say Jesus Christ you're tall
I bet some day at least some day I hope he finds a basketball
So maybe a big scout from a big town team will come and sign him to the meadow larks
And then someday. Someday he'll play as good as van dyke parks

He'll be famous he'll get married, he'll be happy,
He'll be happy with the girl next door
They'll have a little boy, they'll have a little boy but at birth he'll measure six foot four
Each generation as the time goes by

Will grow and grow until they reach the sky
And finally someday I said someday they'll bump into God
And he'll say ""hi""

And then he'll say Jesus, Jesus look at 'em, Jesus Christ they're tall Jesus. Just look at 'em. Jesus

Hey' you guys want to play a little basketball
There will be a big court up in heaven
Softer than the softest cloud

They can play all day, they can play all night they can play as long as they can play

It'll be a half court game until the other boys show it'll be a full court game and then, when it's over we'll hear a high score. It'll be over, then the end amen hey' Jesus, oh Jesus. Sweet Jesus Christ you're tall no nobody. No no nobody

You guys wanna play a little basketball

C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon Jesus
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon Lord
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon do a hook shot baby

Damn damn the daylight

It's gone and caught me for another day
Damn damn the daylight
It does it every day
It does it anyway

It wants to

Why, I could put out the candles
At night time

But god's gonna light 'em
In the morning
Daylight's found me once again
Daylight is chasin' me all over the world

I'd like to jump on some airplane
Just to get away from it all
Daylight is after me,
I don't like to see it smile

That's why I pray for night time
And darkness
Just for a while
If I could sleep in the mornin'

And I could play at night
If I could have the evening
I wouldn't need the daylight
Damn, damn the daylight

The owner and his wife
The butler and his wife
Cook with her knife
A couple named Smythe
The Andersons were there
With another strange pair
And the scary caretaker and me

We were shocked with alarm

Harry Nilsson,"I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her 

Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Of an empty room 
And you go inside and set a table for one, it's no fun 
When you spend a day 
Without her

It's such a beautiful thing 
But it's ended now 
And it sounds like a lie

And it grooves like a clock 
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part

And Cuban rum
And towels from

Harry Nilsson,"Life isn't easy when two are divided and one has decided
To bring down the curtain and one thing's for certain,
There's nothing to keep them together

How does it happen that two can be tender
And one be the lender of love and emotion
That covered the ocean of sadness that kept them together?

Love when it started was easy to measure,
Each day was a pleasure, each night an adventure,
Each morning was something that had to be shared together

Love when it's growing is full of surprises
As temperature rises from higher to higher,
Then turns into fire that has to be shared together

Then came the sadness which follows the laughter
And shortly thereafter the dream had exploded,
A promise was broken, now few words are spoken together

To bring down the curtain and one thing's for certain,
There's nothing to keep them together",Together,1995

I think it's cheaper
Than making whoopee.""",Makin' Whoopee!,1997

Harry Nilsson,"Well in 1941 a happy father had a son
And by 1944 the father walked right out the door
And in '45 the mom and son were still alive
But who could tell in '46 if the two were to survive
Well the years were passing quickly
But not fast enough for him
So he close his eyes through '55
And he opened them up again
When he looked around he saw a clown
And the clown seemed very gay
And he set that night to join that circus clown and run away

Well he followed every railroad track
An every highway sign
And he had a girl in each new town
And the towns he left behind
And the open road
Was the only road he knew
But the color of his dreams
Slowly turning into blue
The he met a girl the kind of girl
He wanted all his life
She was soft and kind and good to him
So he took her for a wife
And they got a house not far from town
And in a little while
The girl had seen the doctor
And she came home with a smile
Now in 1961 a happy father had a son
And by 1964 the father walked right out the door
And in '65 the mom and son were still around

He was my mother's biggest fan
We used to walk beside the sea
And he told me how life would be
When I grew up to be a man

And years ago, we used to play
He used to laugh when I ran away
And if I fell and hurt my knee
He would run to comfort me
And the pain would go away

Years ago, I knew a boy
He was his daddy's pride and joy, pride and joy
But when the daddy went away
It was such a rainy day
That he brought out all his toys

And how the mother did explain
Trying to take away the pain
But, he just couldn't understand
That his father was not a man
And it all was just a game

Harry Nilsson,"When he was young, he sang in the band and his fans all looked the same
And the fans he had were younger than he and they loved to scream his name
They'd leave at the end of the third show, go home to talk of the fun 
Well, isn't nice the parents would say, well isn't nice you've got someone
Someone to idolize, he must look twice his size
I think it's great you're going through a phase
And I'm awfully glad it will all be over in a couple of days

Well, the calendar changed and the pages fell off, but the singer remained the same
And he never grew tired of singing his song, and his fans still called his name
They'd leave at the end of the second show, go home to talk of the fun
For most of the fans were married by then, so they had to be in by one

I'm awfully glad, the husbands would say, I'm awfully glad you got someone
Someone, I realize, who used to look twice his size
I think it's great you still remember his name
And I'll bet if he knew you were there for the show
He'd be awfully glad you came

""The time has come,"" the Walrus said, ""to speak of other things""

Harry Nilsson,"Life isn't easy when two are divided and one has decided
To bring down the curtain and one thing's for certain,
There's nothing to keep them together.

How does it happen that two can be tender
And one be the lender of love and emotion
That covered the ocean of sadness that kept them together?

Love when it started was easy to measure:
Each day was a pleasure, each night an adventure,
Each morning was something that had to be shared together.

Love when it's growing is full of surprises
As temperature rises from higher to higher,
Then turns into fire that has to be shared together.

Then came the sadness which follows the laughter
And shortly thereafter the dream had exploded,
A promise was broken, now few words are spoken together.

Life isn't easy when two are divided and one has decided
To bring down the curtain and one thing's for certain,
There's nothing to keep them together.",Together [Remix],2000

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1999

Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You [From the Internatinoal Revue],2003
Harry Robinson,"The Summertime's escaping, and the carnival's away,
And the sunshine is awaiting for another sunny day.
Breakers whisper to the shells upon the shore,
And hear the seagulls they cry for more.
And hear the gulls they cry for more.
Good day to you sweet Autumn, so gently you appear.
Why I never even realized those rustic times were near.
The moment's changing from a dusty green to gold,
The Summer fair she has grown old.
The Summer fair she has grown old.
And away in the blue of the skies and over the trees
How the carnival flies on the wings of a breeze.
You've had your time and now it's mine for me to go,
These colder days they move too slow.
These older days they move too slow.
So the Summertime is leaving, and the carnival's away,
So the sunshine is relieving us of all our sunny days.
But I'll be waiting for to greet your fleeting calls,
So come back soon the carnival.
So come back soon the carnival.
Come back soon.",Carnival,2011

From Soho down to Brighton

Sure plays a mean pinball!

Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.

Sure plays a mean pinball!

There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,

Sure plays a mean pinball.

Harry Shearer,"All work and no play,
Makes Dick a dull dull boy, career gets in the way.
Square jaw, ooo, such a handsome face,
Why do you have to save the human race?

Life of crime, no it never pays,
Clean up the streets and make your secret get-away.
All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, had to let her go.

Chorus:

You're a man with a gun in your hand,
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun

All boss and no brains,
Bullies and thugs, they take up all your time in vain.
Can't let go, someone cries and you hear the call,
Who's gonna catch you, don't good guys ever fall?

(chorus)

All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, I would never let you go.

(chorus, with last line:)
'Cause I can show you some fun

(spoken) And I don't mean with a gun. No.

You are a man with a gun in your hand;
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun, take it out of your hand;

Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't make time, it's not nice,

Take your love on the run,

Harry Shearer,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

Don't fall in love",Island of Sirens,2007

It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference

Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind

I see the kids in the street, without enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul

They follow each other on the wind ya' know

'Cause they got nowhere to go

That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change

It's time that I realize

There are some with no home,

Not a nickel to loan
Could I be, really mean,

Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred (scarred), somebody's broken heart (heart)
And a washed out dream
(Washed out dream)

I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
 
You made me glad, I made you sad
I made you lonesome and blue
And who ever knew 
Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you

Harry Skoler,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!

Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

To go your own sweet way

Nobody's heart belongs to me today

Harry Sosnik,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I knew he was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
Though I dream of him all the while

No matter how I may persist
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me
Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three

How can I ignore the boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me glance his way

And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door

a guy got fresh and she said, ""You cad!

Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

The sunset's gold
And stars are bright above again
I smile, sweetheart
For then I know I can start
To live again, to love again

When day is done
And night comes on
Until the dawn
What do I do
I clasp your hand
And wander through slumberland

We dance between
A sky serene
And fields of green
Sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime
Whenever I spend my time
Dream-dancing with you

Touchung you, clutching you

I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me love you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it

You made me happy sometimes
You made me glad
But there were times
Dear, you made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I want some love that's true
Yes I do, deed I do
You know I do

Give me, give me
Give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you

Harry Sosnik Orchestra,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entre nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,2000

One little thought to me

Harry Stoneham,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Because I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lassy
My father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was sassy
But then one day I learned a word
That saved me aching nose
The biggest word I ever heard
And this is how it goes:

Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious

There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word
And then you've got a lot to say

Or it can change your life

And now I am his wife!
