Just four best friends that you'd like to call
With Kathy, Kim, Ari, rockin' Jen
When you hear their songs, you'll want to hear them again

I want to borrow your boyfriend

All Girl Summer Fun Band,"They're asking for deadline dates in 4's.
They want my time that I cannot afford.
My friends all ask me when we'll be wed.
I'm telling them things that we have never said.
I think I'll sit down tonight and sew.
With my new best friend at my toes.
He'll nibble on the ends.
And help me to never finish what I begin.

And I'm hoping that you will find.",Daydreaming,2003
All Girl Summer Fun Band,"We all know that you can't always get what you want,
But if you know exactly what you want,
You can always go and tell Chris say,
â??Hey Chris, will you buy me a grizzly bear, I really want a grizzly bear, we could roll on the ground and I'd let him mess up my hair. Or if not then a puppy dog, yeah I'd like a puppy dog, we could run in the yard and I'd let him run like a dogâ??.
We all know that you can't always do what you feel, but if you know exactly how you feel, you can always come and tell me say,
â??Hey Kim, I'm kind of feeling like a grizzly bear. Yeah, I feel like a grizzly bear, I want to roll on the ground and I want to mess up your hair. Cause I'm feeling like a puppy dog, yeah I feel like a puppy dog, I want to run in the yard and I want to run like a dogâ??.",Grizzly Bear,2003

Show me how you do those little things that make the people say,

But every time I open up my mouth, I hear the people say,
â??Ahâ??
They look like they are falling asleep.

All Girl Summer Fun Band,"The longer I wait, the older I get, the longer my hair, I run out of patience.
The time that I've spent, the people I miss, I remember the time, when I could have cared less.
If you could see me now. 
The girl that I've become.

The one you've never met,
I could do you no harm.
She's traveled round and round.
There's one thing that she's found.

She's fallin' in love.
She says he's her best friend.
The longer I wait, the more that I think, the more I'm aware how beautiful life is.
I'll take in the day, I'll never regret, forgetting the time that I'll never forget.

A side of you that no one else has seen.

Your fears, your worries and your dreams.

Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

I taste the wine of real romancing now.

All Kinds of Problems,"[Chorus]
Who would ever thought a guy
Would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that I
Would  fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we
Would finally come to be
I guess they just don't know
How much you mean to me
Who would ever thought that they
Would have some words to say
We'll go on anyway
It's alright, it's okay
Take what ever comes our way
Together we will stay
I got three words to say
Never say never

I can't believe they'd stop our happiness
By trying to pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out of all of this crazy madness
Now when they talk I think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

Now baby they can't believe that
You and me are together
That's why they should have never
Never say never
There were times when we thought that
You an me could never be together
That's why we should have never
Never say never

Now there's a lot of talkin' goin' round
About the way me and you gettin' down
What are they jealous are they hatin' me
I guess they all have their own Ph.D's
I wish that they would just stop sweatin' me
Stop trying to get the best of me
No matter what they say baby
We gotta move on because we're gonna be happy

We didn't let the thoughts that we had
We didn't let the words that they said
Keep us from the love we now have
Never say never
Simply for me to see when
Never would've been never allowed
Now that we are together

All Out War,"Born to this world, but for what? Deceit takes control, as the heavens cry. Waste of life, waste of time, nothing can be done. We were born to die, in this world, of hate and fear, doomed to a fate of a hopeless death. Say goodbye, to your hopes and dreams, because in this life, they are all destroyed. See the blood- in my eyes. Another day, another endless lie, I look ahead, but we're trapped in the past- the human race, never meant to last. The end, the end, the end...End of time, end of life, point of no return has past. Years gone by, all is lost, into the fires we're cast. No turning back, cannot be saved, the final days are here. In this world, lost with life, only ourselves to fear. Fires of hate, burning our life, destroying all it's way. All is lost, witness the end, victims of our own decay, seeking out, who's to blame? When it effects us all, spend our time, lost in life, awaiting the final, fall",After Autumn,1995
All Out War,"In the beginning we tried but nothin' turned out right, 
Fall victim each time to man's nature of brutal fight, 
Through the years we've learned, expect the worse, 
You'll be safe, ma's destined to burn in this land of hate, 
Live life in a rage, 
That's what life's all about, 

This world is a cage and no one hears your shouts, 
Destined to Burn, 
As I stare down into this mass grave of humanity, 
I never knew I'd end up this way, 
I'll try to shed a tear from my eyes 
But I can't because my mind is filled with hate.",Destined to Burn,1995
All Out War,"With the concept of life there was no hate, 
There was no sin, created by man, 
It's bred inside of him, humanity the chosen ones, 
Never ever meant to fall, but tempted by greed, 
Quest for power corrupts us all, 
Destruction of a gift passed down from god himself, 
Creation of sin, human race destroys itself, 
Ruins of a world, it was the only one, 
Through temptation and greed, 
Look what we've become, 
Reign of terror hope is dim, 
Certain falls and nobody wins, 
Fall from grace, final sin, 
End of man will begin, 
Fall from grace, final sin, 
Nature of man bred within, 
Fall from grace, final sin, 
Confrontation, the final sin, 
Turned a world free of sin into corruption and lies, 
Nations of hate,

God's creation in disarrary, by the father we have betrayed. Need proof, just look to our past, strangled life amidst our grasp. Self destruction we're lost to see, take and take for all our needs. In a time of innocence, we have poisoned the Earth. Destroyed the innocent, disgraced our birth. Revenge upon us by the father's hand. Witness to apocalypse, and the downfall of man. All out war, war. All out war, redemption for the innocent, and the seekers of peace. Ignorance, tomb of the masses reaping the piles inside. Wreaking to divine intervention, by the father's hand.

Greed- a disease of man, bring us down to our knees. Armageddon- thrust upon us, but we're too blind to see. Senseless- quest for power, only a quest in lies. Feeding- off eachother's misery, how many have to die? Searching, for salvation, it's right before our eyes. Drowning, in a sea of neglect, stocked with countless lies. Realized, if we faced demise, it's all by our own hand. Power, lies inside, rise up and take a stand. Take and take, never give until there's nothing left. Innocent, their suffering, declining but no one seems to care. Greed- the path leads nowhere. Falling as, we tear this world apart, innocence lost, corrupted from the start. Losing time, until there's nothing left, take and take, with no regret, who's to blame? Who takes the fall? Greed of man- it effects us all. Searching, for salvation, it's right before our eyes.

Can you feel the torment as we tear this world apart? Seasons burn in the flames of neglect, as we feed our desires. Embracing a false sense of hope, placing faith in the liars. Annihilation is freedom, from the lies and deceit, salvation lies far behind, the answers we seek. Eradicate the cancer that infects the Earth. A poisoned creation to relive a worthless birth.

Now, down what it is. Lost in it's lost. Drown in his lies, you aren't safe. Watch it burn. Unleash the dogs of war, to devour this Earth. Feed upon the pain and suffering, our creation a worthless birth. Extinction a gift to existence, final solutions for peace. Wash away the filth and corruption, then this torment shall cease.

want to be ready when you call my name

Give me your love

I need a man to be a real man
Take note of what I got in store
Always finish what you start baby

You never let me down
I'm always happy when you make me laugh

This heart of mine
Emotions don't come into my head
So don't be misled
My heart doesn't need to be bled

Only trying to be smart baby
Don't need the roller coaster ride

Ever since I was the age of nine
I really only felt that I could sing or rhyme
Under the impression that this is a mic
Making sure every dance step is right

Way up in the mirror singing five star songs
I wanna be shy cah
So I'm keep it real only doing what I know
Writing phat beats and keeping the flow

If you don't know what I know, you won't know
If you feel how I feel, I feel you
If you see what I see come and see me
If you hear what I hear, you know me

I know you like my style but do you like my flow?
(Huh?)
I know you wanna get with me but have you got soul?
(What?)

No money in my pockets would you take me as I am?
(Who?)
And if I wasn't beautiful would you be my man?

From Monday to Sunday
I'm just working on my beats
So if you don't know what I know
That's no good to me

Hear the music, don't you lose it
Let it take control
When I see you've got it right
Then I'll let you know, let you know

If you don't know what I know, you won't know
If you feel how I feel, I feel you
If you see what I see, come and see me
If you hear what I hear, you know me

We don't care y'all 'cause our pockets are fat
Well actually girls no they're not
But at least you get to be on Top Of The Pops

We done plastic, platinum, silver, gold
Do you really wanna know how many records we've sold?
Let me tell you what other girl bands say

When I was young nobody kissed my, huh
I was the skinny kid at the back of the class
But now I've got curves shapely and strong

Every man, some women, wanna give me some more
I don't do that 'cause it ain't my thing
If you wanna piece of this, gimme gimme the thing

If you don't know what I know, you won't know
If you feel how I feel, I feel you
If you see what I see, come and see me

I would listen to them say
I just kept smiling oh help me sing it now
One-two whats a girl to do I said
Three-four I'm gonna laugh some more c'mon
Five- six I'm getting a stich
You never know you'll never ever break me baby

One-two whats a girl to do I said
Three-four I'm gonna laugh some more c'mon
Five- six I'm getting a stich
You never know you'll never ever break me baby

Now times have changed, I find myself involved with another
Stroker trynna beat the game without going under
Slowly
Yet I'm still go-ing
I can't believe the way some people want to stop lovers
Trying to take away your sense of pride must be fulfilling
If you got no feelings
You can't sing
I thought I already told yo ass
Stop dreaming
Now get yourself back into class
Can't you see what ever you are tryin' to acheive
It won't change no-othing

One-two whats a girl to do
Three-four I'm gonna laugh some more
Five- six I'm getting a stich
You never know you'll never ever break me baby
One-two whats a girl to do
Three-four I'm gonna laugh some more
Five- six I'm getting a stich
You never know you'll never ever break me baby

As I laugh haha you can kiss my ass
You guys thought I live a none existant life Thats right
You thought I might not make it on my own
Got my own car go-car own my own home
(haha in background)
Gotta get it back to livin my dreams
Roles and ambitions I have to acheive
Try to do me you can't pull me down
So prove you wrong (wrong)
Sing my song (song)
When you pass I'll do a laugh
Try bring me down (just got to laugh a little louder baby)
I just laugh out loud (just got to laugh a little harder honey)
You're still on the ground (your still underground)
As I laugh out loud (can you hear me)

One-two whats a girl to do I said
Three-four I'm gonna laugh some more c'mon
Five- six I'm getting a stich
You never know you never ever break me baby

If You have let me down
Why does it seem I walk alone
Where trouble finds me out

But sorrow as my company
I fix my eyes on You
Soon again I’ll praise Your name
And feel my soul renewed

That sacred place alone
A light to always guide you

Through every briar and thorn
Although my flesh will falter
My hope is in the Lord

Because I know, I know

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

If you'd have me I'd take you back again
And add to the mistakes I've made

I remember morning light
And a shower to clear my head
Everyday a reminder of what a fool I've
Been
Seemed when I left you I'd left everything I'd
Known

And with the birth of fear I am set free

From these wounds I claim redemption
From these wounds I am redeemed

In passing I recall with such vivid clarity
The soft whispering reminders of foolish notions
Too late I realized my wrongs and my carelessness
Now from the stone I hear you call
I can not answer

Selfishness hollow smile, cracks my foundation

Bleeding me dry, a foolish display
You walk through my halls and you tear me down
Masochist some would say
But you feel like home to me
Winter mood illuminates
These lasting impressions I elevate
This last thing I do regret
For you feel like home to me

Silver tongue, crystal eyes, follow my piper
For my fear shield of lies, completing my failure

Wrapped up in lies like sheets of another one night stand,

We can't hide, we let go
We've got more than we know
My friends are a different breed
My friends are

There's a ghost in this room
I think I'll name it after all of you
And watch it hang over my bed like decorations
Celebrated memories that came and went
In light of all that time we spent
Listening to everything our parents told us not to take in

Now make a change, I'm counting down
The mile marks to every town
And falling more in love
With the distance put between us

We can't hide, we let go
We've got more than we know

Make this last, take it slow
We've got it all figured out for now
So, let us live our lives without a doubt

Tonight we lie awake
Remember how the coffee made us shake
On those long drives?
One more long night

Another seven days
Heartbeat racing the interstate, my home tonight
For one more long night

From coast to coast I'll make the most
Of every second I've been giving with this crowd
Without a doubt, you're all I dream about

At night we lie awake
With stories taking us back
To the nights we felt alive

Sit back, gotta catch my breath
'Cause every time I see her
I know she's gonna take it back somehow

Tattoos and a switchblade attitude
Snakebite heart with a bubblegum smile
Sex in stereo, don't turn the radio dial

She's dancing alone
I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo

And I've been waiting for so long
But she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

And I'm just like cellophane
'Cause she sees right through me
I know she's glitter and gold
And that's just the price I pay
When I don't even know her name
She's slipping away

She works for the weekend
Mixtape of her favorite bands
Tearin' up the radio
Lost in the stereo's sound

She's dancing alone

To find my whoever, wherever she may be

I'm terrified to speak (I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me

From so many thousands of feet off the ground, I'm over you now

Now he's scared to face the thorns of his actions
And it goes on and on
First glance then a second look
Not too long
The third eye chose to stare
And it said
To go ahead, take a bite, promises
And it goes on and on

I don't remember innocence
It's been so long
So far down this winding road
I can't remember my way home
It's all a cross to you
What have I done?
Such tainted decisions
But now I'm past the point of no return
Never to go back
Now the seed is sown, the tree is grown,
It's all a cross to you",On & On,1999
All Together Separate,"Dry thoughts of a better day
My hope like stones in the dust lay
Fast pace to escape
My search for living water

Cool breeze on the water top
Smooth shine on a silver rock
Lord please let Your current see
Through to the inside

[Chorus:]
Lose myself
Cover me over
Find my life
Down at the river

Cut deep into shallow ground
Through me You can flow now
Winding to the blue sea off in the distance

And Sundays always come around
Down at the river",The River,1999

As I close my eyes, the demon flies
With purple waves and teeth that sing
And as it (????) my skin, I start to grin
At plastic walls of utter sins
Soon, plexiglass seals my faith from
Tidal waves, they shock (????)

Unshift the skin to freeze the spell

How was your weekend?
I just can't stop
It's Tuesday and you're stressed again

While shepherds watch their flock by night
They see a bright new shining star
Then hear a choir sing
The music seemed to come from afar
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
Then find no place to born the child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the holy bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas Day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day
Hark now hear the angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live forevermore

All-4-One,"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer 
had a very shiny nose. 
And if you ever saw him, 
you would even say it glows. 

All of the other reindeer 
used to laugh and call him names. 
They never let poor Rudolph 
join in any reindeer games. 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve 
Santa came to say: 
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"" 

Then all the reindeer loved him 
as they shouted out with glee, 
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, 
you'll go down in history!

With a corncob pipe and a button nose

And two eyes made out of coal



Frosty the Snowman

Is a fairytale they say

He was made of snow

But the children know

How he came to life one day



There must have been some magic

In that old silk hat they found

For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around



Frosty the Snowman

Was alive as he could be 

And the children say 

He could laugh and play

Just the same as you and me



Frosty the Snowman

Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run

And we'll have some fun

Now before I melt away



Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand

Running here and there all around the square

Saying catch me if you can



He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop

And he only paused a moment when

He heard him holler stop



Frosty the Snowman

Had to hurry on his way

But he waved goodbye

Saying don't you cry 

I'll be back again some day

All-4-One,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

All-4-One,"Someday, when we are wiser
When the world's older
When we have learned
I pray someday we may yet
Live to live and let live

Someday life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
And greed will not pay
God speed this bright millennium on its way
Let it come someday

Someday our fight will be won then
We'll stand in the sun then
That bright afternoon

Till then, on days when the sun is gone
We'll hang on
And we'll wish upon the moon

There are somedays, darken rivers
Say we haven't got a plan
But I'm praying for something better
Is the one thing we all share

Someday, when we are wiser
When the world's older
When we have learned
I pray someday we may yet

All-4-One,"When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find the light
To light my way
And when I'm scared
And losing ground
When my world is going crazy
You can turn it all around
And when I'm down you're there
Pushing me to the top
You're always there giving me all you've got

For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
I turn to you

When I lose the will to win
I just reach for you
And I can reach the sky again
I can do anything
'cause your love is so amazing
'cause your love inspires me
And when I need a friend
You're always on my side
Giving me faith
That gets me through the night

For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
I turn to you

For the arms to be my shelter
Through all the rain
For truth that will never change
For someone to lean on
For a heart I can rely on through anything
For that one who I can run to...

For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm
I turn to you

For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
I turn to you

They asked me how I knew
My true love was true?
I of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied 

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind

When your heart's on fire
You must realize

So I chaffed them and I gayly laughed
To think they could doubt my love

Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without, without my love

Just takes time

And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I could live without love

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew

And threats to my comfort zone

You can name a blessing yourself
Stake a claim on power and wealth
And strong healthy teeth, a spot at the beach
And romance that's really swell

All the saints and martyrs alive
Well, they would have called a national strike
Demanded less pain, more personal gain
If only they'd known their rights

Well, I take it very personally
Yeah, I got to know, what's in it for me?
Ain't it grand when you're livin' in La La Land?

My Jesus decal does quite a trick
Right above my dashboard I stick it
A good luck charm, it keeps me from harm
And saves me from speeding tickets

And Edgar Allan Poe

All the others fade away 
I can't recover 
I know I'll love her

And the ladies as they came 
Like Liz from Tucson

And me I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades bangin' them pleasure machines
Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they all promise to unsnap their jeans
And you know that tilt-a-whirl down on the south beach drag
I got on it last night and my shirt got caught
And they kept me spinnin' I didn't think I'd ever get off

Oh Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us
This pier lights our carnival life on the water
laughin' 'neath the boardwalk, ah, with the boss's daughter
I remember Sandy girl, na, na, na, na, na baby

Sandy that waitress I was seeing lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore
She worked that joint under the boardwalk, she was always the girl you saw boppin' down the beach with the radio
The kids say last night she was dressed like a star in one of them cheap little seaside bars
And I saw her parked with lover boy out on the Kokomo
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do
For me this boardwalk life is through, babe
You ought to quit this scene too

Allan Clarke,"Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band

And she was blinded by the light
Oh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East
He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

Yeah, he was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight

Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said, I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right

He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night

Allan Clarke,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss

One, two, three, four

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really wanna go

The little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.

And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.",Away In a Manger,1994
Allan Ganley,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Allan Langstaff,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn,1999

Allan Langstaff,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999

My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

One look and I had found my future at last

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004

Allan Sherman,"This is the start of the large dark aardvark song
(Bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum, bum, yeah yeah yeah!) 
There is a large dark aardvark in the park,
They say he's missing from the zoo
(That's me, folks!)
And the police are looking high and low
But they have not seen him, have you?
(Peek-a-boo!)
Why did he go?
Oh, I'll tell you the reason
'Cause it's aardvark mating season
When an aardvark makes a date
He sneaks right through that old zoo gate
So, if you see two aardvarks necking in the park,
Don't upset their apple cart
Do not be a spy, you're not the FBI
And you should never break an aardvark's heart

This is the second chorus of the aardvark song

To be an aardvark is not easy, folks,
'Cause all you get to eat is ants
(Delicious!)
And all the other animals make jokes
At your attempts to find romance
(Very funny)
Nobody laughs at hippopotamuses,
Or at fat rhinoceroses,
But an aardvark makes them howl
Because he's neither fish nor fowl
He's like a kangaroo in love with a gnu,
And that's what makes the zoo folks laugh
All of this is so, and here is how I know
I'm your friendly neighborhood giraffe!

Allan Sherman,"Beautiful molars...
Lovely bicuspids...

I'm Dr. Prentice, the painless dentist;
By that what's meant is,
It really doesn't hurt.
This is Miss Klinger, you've met her finger.
So open wide, and Miss Klinger will squirt.

Well, well, I say there.
We've got decay there.
Can't let it stay there and cause you all that pain.
So please Miss Klinger, remove your finger,
And won't you hand me down my Novocaine.

It's far worse than I thought it was;
My charge is gonna be large.

Don't be unwilling,
It's just a filling,
I'm simply drilling to dig a little pit.
Don't fight Miss Klinger, or bite her finger
And now while I change the drill you can spit.

I hum while you're bleeding;
It takes your mind off 
The things I grind off.
Your gum's are receding;
You'll have to come back,
We'll build that gum back.

And now if you will open wide,
Miss Klinger's gonna put her whole darn fist inside.

That's it, now it's over.
They'll be a puffiness around your cheeks,
You'll have to eat soft food for three more weeks,
And if you'll kindly stop those ghastly shrieks,
I'm through.

Everyone's moral fiber's in complete decay there;
They've got a problem cleaning up the PTA there.

Everyone walks around the square so overjoyed,

That's where they put the statue up of Sigmund Freud,
In Peyton Place.
They've got a new library there, but here's the snapper:
Every book in it's covered in a plain brown wrapper.
Peyton Place, where the good life is,
Depending where your wife is.

Nobody's got an overdose of scruples
Down in Peyton Place;
All of the teachers learn things from their pupils,
Down in Peyton Place.
There is a faithful husband there, you oughtta see him;
He is the main exhibit in the town museum.

That old back scratcher like the Chinese sell
Your plastic fingers up and down my spine,

You tame that tingle when I'm all alone;
For I am single, so, to itch his own

So down and down you go,
Around and around and around you go
Scratching my unreachable zone

I should throw you away,
But I never do
I must give in to itchy skin
A skin with such a burning desire
When I'm scratching low,
The itching gets higher

Oh, you're the scrubber that placated me,
That chased each place that irritated me
And then, last night, you broke my heart

Two hundred pounds on you,
Then, snap, crack,
Everything just went black

I know that the product has got to be good
Those words may be crazy, but I think they're great,
Like sodium acetylsalicylate

I cover my Pic-O-Pay with Fluoristan
I add Hexachlorophene, 'cause it's so pure,
And then GL-70, just to make sure

And Marfac and Melmac and what else is new?
There's Orlon and Korlan, and there's Accutron,

Ladies and gentlemen, I got fat as a public service when I was a child, 
My mother said to me, 
""Clean the plate, because children are starving in Europe"" 
And I might point out that that was years before the Marshall Plan was ever heard of 
So I would clean the plate, four, five, six times a day, 
Because somehow I felt that that would keep the children from starving in Europe 
But I was wrong They kept starving and I got fat

So I would like to say to every one of you who is either skinny or in some other way normal
When you walk out on the street, and you see a fat person, 
Do not scoff at that fat person 
Oh no!

When the Beatles come on stage,
They scream and shriek and cheer them.
Now I know why they're such a rage,
It's impossibe to hear them.

Ringo is the one with the drum,

It shows you what a boy can become
Without a sense of rhythm. 

There's Beatle book and T-shirts and rings,

And wore a beatnik beard
He had big thick glasses
That looked real weird
He weighed ninety-eight pounds

Over her eyes
Kinda half Barbra Streisand
And half Joan Baez

At the discotheque
The Rebel was a-tryin'
To pay his check
But his pockets they were empty
So he yelled, ""Oh, heck!""
""Heck,"" said the rebel
Well, the Dean walked by
Just as that occurred
He said, ""You can get expelled
For what I just heard
Don't you realize 'heck'
Is a four-letter word

But the rebel said
To his old adversary
""Just as long as that word's
In the slang dictionary
I swear by Peter
Paul & Mary
I'll use it!""

""Furthermore,"" said the rebel
""I won't let the issue pass

Began to rebel

During show and tell
Then the older generation
Started sitting down as well

Teachers wouldn't teach
People sat at home
And on the street and on the beach

Nobody was talkin' to anybody!

There wasn't any doubt

Soon everyone was saying ""heck""

""This is terribly unfair

Let's you and I be square""
And the did, they squared it up

Rhonda got a haircut
The rebel shaved his beard
They were married and had children
Which they subsequently reared
They moved out to the suburbs
And they really disappeared

Has anyone seen my gal?
Lucite nose, rust-proof toes,
And when her antenna glows,
She's the cutest Martian girl.

You know she promised me, recently,
She wouldn't stray,
But came the dawn, she was gone
Eighteen billion miles away.

Her steering wheel has sex appeal,
Her evening gown is stainless steel,
Has anybody seen my gal?
How I miss all the bliss
Of her sweet hydraulic kiss,
Has anybody seen my gal?
Lovely shape, custom built,
Squeeze her wrong and she says ""tilt"",
Has anybody seen my gal?

She does the cutest tricks,
With her six stereo ears.
When she walks by, spacemen cry,
'Specially when she shifts her gears.

If she's found, rush like mad,
Put her on a launching pad,
Down at Cape Canaveral,
And shoot my cutie,
My supersonic beauty,
Send me back my Martian gal.","Eight Foot Two, Solid Blue",1988
Allan Sherman,"I know a man named Otis who invented a room,
And his heart was filled with pride
I said to Mr Otis, ""What does your room do?""
He said, ""It goes from side to side""

You'll be the richest man in town
You gotta take that room that goes from side to side,
And make it go up and down""

Go right back there and sleep beneath that tree
And if you let that rotten apple fall down on your head,
Why you'll discover gravity""

A very poorly educated soul

And in the middle of it was a hole

Christopher Columbus was a seaman second class
When I told him that the Indies could be found
By sailing to the west instead of sailing to the east
I advised him that I thought the world was round
(I really thought so)
And then I sent him down to ask good Queen Isabella
To pawn her jewels for all their worth
Next day he set sail, and as everyone knows,
He fell off the edge of the earth

And that was bad advice, bad advice
Bad advice is just the same as good advice
Everybody makes
Occasional mistakes,
And that was bad advice",Good Advice,1988
Allan Sherman,"Listen all you children to my sad refrain
About a subway conductor on a runaway train
Squeezing people into cars, he won his fame
And John Charles Cohen was the great man's name

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
IRT that's a subway line
And if you gotta travel uptown
He's a greater conductor than Leonard Bernstein

'Twas on a Sunday in the summer and from everywhere
People planned to take a subway to the World's Fair
A half a million people tried to push and jar
All of them determined to get in one car

But the IRT depended on their finest men
J. C. Cohen could pack a subway like a sardine can
He pushed the people up and back and 'round about
He squeezed so many in he squeezed the engineer out

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
How he'd moan, step to the rear
J. C. Cohen, he really had a problem
On a subway train without an engineer

J. C. tried to get into the engineer's place
But when he look inside the cab, he saw a strange man's face
A half pint drunk with a full pint bottle
He emptied out the bottle and he yelled, full throttle

They passed Columbus Circle doing 82
A couple minutes later they were under Bronx Zoo
J. C. shuddered and he said, ""I guess
This used to be a local but it's now an Express""

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
Kept his head when everyone was tense
He said, ""When we pass the city limits
Everybody pays another fifteen cents""

J. C. said, ""We're heading north, my friends
But not a man alive knows where the subway ends""
The train went under Albany at 90 flat
And Governor Rockefeller hollered, ""What was that?""

A lady said to J. C. Cohen with indignation
""If this is Albany then you have passed my station
So either you should take me back to fifty ninth Street
Or ask one of these gentlemen to give me his seat""

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
J. C. Cohen noticed something odd
When he saw lobsters on the roadbed
He said, ""I got a feeling we're beneath Cape Cod""

Oh well, the train kept speeding to the north my friends
Finally came to where the tunnel ends
When they came up to the surface from the long, long hole
They were twenty seven inches from the great North Pole

J. C. hollered, ""Everybody out
This is the end of the line beyond the shadow of a doubt""
They went out to get some fresh air and before they took a whiff
Cohen and all the passengers were frozen stiff

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
Bless his soul, he ran out of luck
J. C. Cohen, he was really frozen
And he had to be brought home in a Good Humor truck

When they told Mrs. Cohen that she'd lost her man
She said, ""Must you interrupt me when I'm playing Pan?""
Then she said to her partner, Mrs. R. J. Rosen
""Cohen was a lovely husband but he's no good frozen""

Then she went to her little boy and took his hand
And she said, ""I'm going to take you out to Disneyland
So Melvin, little darling, don't you weep or wail
'Cause you got another papa on the monorail""
Got another papa on the monorail

Allan Sherman,"One hippopotami cannot get on a bus,
Because one hippopotami is two hippopotamus
And if you have two goose, that makes one geese
A pair of mouse is mice A pair of moose is meese

A paranoia is a bunch of mental blocks
And when Ben Casey meets Kildaire, that's called a paradox
When two minks fall in love, with all their heart and soul,
You'll find the plural of two minks is one mink stole

Singulars and plurals are so different, bless my soul
Has it ever occurred to you that the plural of half is whole?

A bunch of tooth is teeth a group of foot is feet
And two canaries make a pair, they call it a parakeet
A paramecium is not a pair
A parallelogram is just a crazy square

Nobody knows just what a paraphernalia is
And what is half a pair of scissors, but a single sciz?

You'll pant, and pant once more, and that's a pair of pants!",One Hippopotami,1988

Glory, glory Harry Lewis

In the service of his Lord
He was trampling through the warehouse
Where the drapes of Roth are stored

Allan Sherman,"Now this next song was a big hit comedy song before I was born, and I took this song and modernized it, I hope. The hero of the song was originally Jewish, and I made him Chinese - which is no small achievement, actually. Uh, and the reason I did that was that a couple months ago, in January, I was appearing in San Francisco, and it happened to be during the Chinese New Year. And I learned that to the Chinese people, this is the year 4664. And of course to the Jewish people, this is the year 5726. Which means that for 1062 years, Jewish people have had to do their own laundry.

Now this is a very tender, poignant song, actually. It's beautiful if you want to know. I figure I better tell you it's beautiful before I start singing it, because once I start you'll have no way of knowing that it's beautiful.

This is a song about a man who walks into a tailor, and tells him a very sad story. And it goes like this:",A Few Words About the Chinese New Year,2005

Oh, I should tell you. It's a great historical sidelight.

In the early days of the pioneers, hundreds of years ago, 
When they first came in the covered wagons from the east to the west, 
They went all the way across and they got to the top of the Santa Monica mountains. 
And they looked down and they saw the beautiful blue Pacific Ocean, 

And they saw this vast expanse of green valley in front of them. 
And then, the assistant chief pioneer turned to the chief pioneer, and he said, 
""Oh, chief pioneer, what do you think of this beautiful vast expanse of gorgeous green valley?"" 
And the chief pioneer said, ""Very nice!""",How Van Nuys Got Its Name,2005

Allan Sherman,"This one I wrote this afternoon.
That's the truth.
I had written the first little part of this, and I sang it two weeks ago Sunday on the Ed Sullivan show, and...the song is called ""Mononucleosis""...and my daughter, I talked to her, and she said all the kids in her school, there were a hundred kids in her junior high school who had it, and they think it's a real good subject for a song. And, that's why I originally wrote it was that she had come home with this mononucleosis about six months ago (she's thirteen), and then Life magazine came out a month or so later with an article on it that explained that it was the kissing disease. So I put those two facts together. I'm a very, you know, thrilling detective. And I was wondering, well, you know, I'm...I guess I'm old-fashioned because about six months ago she got one of those learner's brassieres...Well actually she's learning real good if you want to know! I mean, the first couple of weeks it used to slide down and dangle around her ankles and trip her, but she's really getting the hang of it now.
Anyway, so, I dedicated this song sort of to her because of the curiosity that was aroused in my mind by these two things happening at once. And it goes like this...
We don't have any arrangement of it, they're just kinda faking it, and we'll just try it. If it works, we'll stick it on the album, if not, I'll just...kill myself.

Allan Sherman,"Plan ahead!
Plan ahead! 
That's what the wise man said.
Success is hard to win, but you can win it

If you do a lot of thinking in advance and make the necessary preparations 
And don't leave everything to be crowded into the very last minute. 
Plan ahead!
In advance.

Don't leave a thing to chance.
And if you want to wind up rich and famous,
Just be careful and meticulous in everything you do and just make sure your work is not slip-shod or sloppy or negligent or else people will go around saying you are an ignoramus.

So... so...
Insist on absolute perfection,
And do all your things perfectly.
If you strive day and night,
In a long time you might
Be almost as perfect as me.
As I.

For the toughest things in life are never easy.

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1994
Allan Vaché,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1994
Allan Vaché,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love,1994
