Grace,"Das Rotlicht, dass im Mondlicht brennt
Keiner kennt es so, wie ich's kenn
Wenn ihr einschlaft, beginnen für uns die Tage
Mädchen warten vor der Tür auf der Straße
Sie war 17, von zu Hause abgehauen
Denn Mama schlug ihre Augen blau
Sieh, der Zuhälter, er hat Duldung seit 20 Jahren
Vater Staat sagt, dass er nicht arbeiten darf
Guck, der Häftling, er hat jemand umgebracht
Den, der sein Kind ohne Grund vergewaltigt hat
Und der Straßenmusikant im Rollstuhl, der im Milieu spielt
Was soll er tun?
Damals in der Jugend noch bei Eintracht gespielt
Heute querschnittsgelähmt, das ist teil dieses Spiels
Schicksale, zich male
So verbringt man hier seine Jahre

Unter all den Narben hört man es schlagen
Wir leben und es tut was es kann
Wir können alles haben, 
Nur die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehen, die Schatten nicht begraben
Können nur weitergehen

So ist das Leben, Nachtleben
Man will auf uns verabreden
Schwesta, wir befinden uns im ältesten Gewerbe
Ich weiß, ich bin Zeugin dieser Welten bis ich sterbe
Guck mal, dieser Kiffer, für den Geld einfach nichts ist
Horizontal, Schwesta, welch ein Business auf dem Schore
Junkie, er war mal ein Arzt
Auf den Tod seiner Frau kommt er aber nicht klar
Oder den Mafiosi der die menschen hier schützt, zur Polizei können sie nicht, Rotlicht
Schau mal, dieser Dealer
Ihm kamen ein paar Packs abhanden
Ruft sein Bruder aus Syrien durch Schlepperbanden
Denn sie fliehen vor dem Krieg, wie jeder vor uns
Einer stirbt, es ist Thema nur kurz, 
Denn es muss weitergehen
Brauchen essen auf dem Tisch, bis morgen Nacht
Wir treffen uns am Strich

Unter all den Narben hört man es schlagen
Wir leben und es tut was es kann
Wir können alles haben, 
Nur die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehen, die Schatten nicht begraben
Können nur weitergehen

An das Milieu, wo du eine Mille löst
Nichts ist echt, doch die Bilder sind schön
Alles Illusion, guck, der Freier bringt'n Blumenstrauß
Er denkt, ihn liebt diese Hure auch
Er kommt nicht drauf klar, dass seine Ex einen Neuen hat
Mitten in der Nacht und er läuft durch die Stadt
Guck, die Go-Go-Tänzerin, die ihr Studium finanziert
Mit ihrem Kopf war sie nie ganz hier
Und die Nutte, die ihr Para macht
Und schaut weil ihr kleiner Sohn eine Krankenkasse braucht
An alle, dies dazu zu sehen einfach leben wollen
Wir hatten lang genug nur die Nebenrollen
Was bedeutet ein Bildungsstand
Dass man nicht ne Mille haben will, auf der Bank
Der Rand der Gesellschaft, wo man anders sein Geld macht
Der Staatsanwaltschaft gefällt das

Unter all den Narben hört man es schlagen
Wir leben und es tut was es kann
Wir können alles haben, 
Nur die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehen, die Schatten nicht begraben
Können nur weitergehen",Spiegelreflex,2015
Grace,"Pitcuring in your face, another moment lost
I saw your silhouette under all of the noise

Now I'm left here with no sympathy
I fucked her, yeah, yeah
Miss my fingers running through your hair
Your bedtime stares, yeah
Oh, your lips would glisten (they did)

Grace & Danger,"There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
Finally, I can see you crystal clear,
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare,
See how I'll leave with every piece of you,
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
The scars of your love remind me of us,
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
I can't help feeling,

We could have had it all,
(Your gonna wish you, never had met me)
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told,
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair,
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,

The scars of your love remind me of us,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
I can't help feeling,

We could have had it all,

Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all,
Rolling in the deep,
You had my heart inside of your hands,
But you played it with a beating.

Throw your soul through every open door,
Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all,

Grace ?,"Did you forget about me?
How you gon' forget about me?
Should've bet it all on me
Now you wanna fuck with me

They wanna put a chink into Twista's armor
But I didn't even blink in that fiscal karma
I just be stuntin' on these niggas and ballin' on 'em
Tellin' 'em I'mma be forever young
'Cause ain't no motherfuckin' artist alive fuckin' with me
You know it, they compare to none
I am a Dark Horse
Creatively comin' from a dark force
Closin' the unexpected turn of events as I commence to
Givin' you another definition of hardcore
Lord have mercy on the souls that competed with me
And didn't know what I was capable of
Let a nigga on the track and I attack and snatch and
Beat and murder it, especially off of an eigth of the bud
Now recognizing me is an abomination
Speaking on the coldest and I'm not in the conversation
Overachiever, forever the underdog
I spit it but still omitted from every writer’s congregation
When I ain't on the list with the mic splitters
Every once in a while I do be quite bitter

Did you forget about me?
How you gon' forget about me?
Should've bet it all on me
Now you wanna fuck with me

I did it myself, my nigga
Didn't need your help, my nigga
Played the the cards I was dealt, my nigga
Now I got the belt, my nigga
And they screamin' out ""That's my nigga""
Did you forget about me?

Can't forget about 'em, cause he stuntin'
OG ? now forever runnin with a pocket full of hundreds
Spit it how I get it and they want it cause I flaunt it
Because I get to the money
If I get to that honey, I'mma have 'em all hatin' on me
Screamin' out ""that nigga just don't stop""
Intricate part of my style is the way I swag on 'em
When I'm goin' so fast and still it be so hard
And when I do I know these niggas can't fuck with me
Style, it be ugly, they don't want none of me
And if we do get into it, it's gonna be
Just some shit that's in front of me
I'mma come gunnin', we conquer all obstacles
And if it's possible, I'mma get money, we
Welcome haters and challengers, fakers not down with us
Takin' our sound from us, we can get it on if
They want a rhyme from us and I...
Be takin' 'em out of the faith of a doubter
The face of a coward, who's bravery's forsaken for power and then I...
See if he learned his lesson, not to bully the lil' one
Cause he don't want it
Probably get the pistol off a molly that'll hit you
A one that’ll come with a side of another phenomenal that'll be turnin' up the
Party when he diss you, it'll probably be an issue
If you think I'mma let you forget about the way
I can throw flames on 'em
Trinidad, I'll gold everythang on 'em

Grace Alexander,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1992

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose

Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last

With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

You've made a deaperate appeal, now save your breath,
Attachment to obligation, through guilt and regret, shit that's so wet

And your sex life complications are not my facinations,
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out,(x2) Oh!

And now you want to use me for emotional blackmail,

See the breaking glass,
Beneath the underpass.

Warm leatherette,
Feel the crushing steel,
Feel the steering wheel.

Warm leatherette melts,
On your burning flesh,
You can see your reflection,
On the luminescent dash.

Warm leatherette,
A tear of petrol,
Is in your eye,
The hand brake,
Penetrates your thigh.

A tear of petrol,
Is in your eye,
Quick let's make love,
Before we die.

On warm leatherette,
Join the carcrash set.

Qui nous resemble,
Toi qui m'aimais,

Ceux qui s'aiment,
Tout doucement,
Sans faire de bruit,
Et la mer efface sur le sable,
Les pas des amants désunis.

Cut open murmurs and sounds be calm hands on skin
Carry further oh...entangled strands all sing
Saving some time to slip away we could dance oh..

Stretching my back down the way
To your invitation stretching my body
Use your intuitive play

Half-African but she looked like Madonna
And yo check, she had a tiger for a pet
I'll never forget, the restaurant where we met

May seem a waste of time

Your meat is sweet to me
Your destiny
Your fate

you?re my life support, your life is my sport

I?m a man-eating machine X2

you won?t hear me laughing, as I terminate your day
You can?t trace my footsteps, as I walk the other way

I can?t get enough prey, pray for me X2
(i?m a man-eating machine)
Corporate cannibal, digital criminal
Corporate cannibal, eat you like an animal

employer of the year, grandmaster of fear
My blood flows satanical,
Mechanical, masonical and chemical
Habitual ritual

i?m a man-eating machine.. X2

I deal in the market, every man, woman and child is a target
A closet full of faceless nameless pay more for less empitness

i?ll make you scrounge, in my executive lounge
You pay less tax, but i?ll gain more back

my rules, you fools

we can play the money game
Greedgame, power game, stay insane
Lost in the cell, in this hell
Slave to the rhythm of the corporate prison

i?m a man-eating machine?
I can?t get enough prey
Pray for me
Corporate cannibal?
Digital criminal?

i?ll consume my consumers, with no sense of humour
I?ll give you a uniform, chloroform
Sanatize, homogenize, vaporize? you

i?m the spark, make the world explode
I?m a man-eating machine, i?ll make the world explode

She married a Preacher Man

Followed him all around

Singing in a little Church
In a little ghost town

She's so happy

She's so happy, keeping up

Playing on the road
With Nat King Cole
And he womanised
Staying up all night
Cruisin'up around the town
From town to town to town

Spreading my wings

Serving up another man's head

Let go your fear
Far becomes near
Look out

This is life

Are you going into the light
Are you freeing your fear today
When you lie down to sleep
Do you kind of float away

This is depression
It comes when you're blocking
This is expression
It comes when your rocking

Grace Moore 
(V. Schertzinger)

One Night Of Love
When two hearts are one,
A night to have and hold
When love is gone and starlight grows cold.

One Night Of Love
When love is all that I'll recall.
When at the break of dawn
I find my lover gone
I'll whisper with a smile
I've lived a little while
I've known One Night Of Love.

And headed down to where nobody knows me

I was jaded by another passing lover
I couldn't bring myself to wonder why
And the man on the radio said
?Hey, don't you wanna got down to Deliverance Road??

I saw three little birds sitting on a doorstep
And two little boys in their Sunday best
And the preacher?s voice was strong
The big lady sang along, as I listened
Rolling down Deliverance Road, Deliverance Road

I may never walk through the gates of heaven
I may never hear the angel?s serenade
But when the wind picks up and drags the dust
I'm gonna stop my car, look straight up
And the rain might wash my sins away

And tumble weeds have faded
And the radio sings a country song

Drove to the end of the road
And a red-faced man
Taught us to do what we're told

And on the twenty-third night
Things ain't bad but things ain't right

Are we falling or flying?
Are we falling or flying?
Are we living or dying?
I guess we'll never know

The air's so heavy
It could drown a butterfly if it flew too high
And I get the feeling
That the truck driver ain't shy
?'cause he's looking at me
But nowhere near my eyes

And on the thirty-fifth morning
Things ain't good but things ain't boring, no

Are we falling or flying?
Are we falling or flying?
Are we living or dying?
I guess we'll never know
Striking rock but hitting gold

Sometimes it's hard to tell
If there's a life behind this song
But I know tomorrow
Today won't feel so long, no

The room was dark but the stage was bright

I had three daughters, a new man for every one
And the only man that I ever loved left me with my only son

?Cause I heard about forgiveness and I hope it ain't too late
No, I ain't no holy roller but you go tell your King
That all the folks up in heaven might like to hear me sing

I sang for my lover or a nickel in a tip jar

Closed his green eyes and played the boy a song

I was trailed by twenty hounds

I set out running but I take my time

If I get home before daylight 
I just might get some sleep tonight

I spent that night in Utah 
In a cave up in the hills 

I ran down to the levee 
But the Devil caught me there 
He took my twenty-dollar bill 
And he vanished in the air 

Got two reasons why I cry 
away each lonely night 
First one's named sweet Ann Marie 
and she's my heart's delight 
Second one is prison, baby 
the sheriff's on my trail 
And if he catches up with me 
I'll spend my life in jail

And one in Cherokee 
First one says she's got my child

Open this door, come on, I'm not messing around

Well, believe me, I?ll be gone by the time you get back from work
I just left a few things I don't want no one to get hurt

Just give me back my hammer, give me back my nail
Give me back my jeans and my J.J.Cale
Give me back my box with the quarter inch cable
And don't forget my toothbrush and my table

You got a good thing going on I wouldn't wanna take you away
Se la vie, so it goes dirty business or so they say
I know I done you wrong but here we are face to face
Boy, I sure am glad I don't have to hang around this place

Well, believe me, baby, this ain't fun or me neither
So get out of my way or I?ll start blasting cat scratch fever

Give me back my hammer, give me back my nail
Give me back my jeans and my J.J.Cale
Give me back my box with the quarter inch cable
And don't forget my toothbrush and my table

I don't care which way you think the story might have went
I've already recollected all the love I wish I had not spent
But baby, you know I paid more than my share of the rent
There ain't nothing in my heart for you except a big ol?denkt

So try to pin it down, try to tear it up or try to get me gone
I?ll just need a few things for the road that I?ll be on

Its like your across the hall
With your ear glued to the wall
And as I move to let him in I can
Feel you crawl under my skin
And I can feel you from the inside
Prowling like a devil that I try to hide
I can feel your heart beating
Closer than the poison of my pride
Caught up in a moment
I thought I feel no shame because I
Didn't have tell you lies
When the daylight came but now
Down goes that silver tear
Down goes my golden year
Down we go in a water slide
That's made up of the tears Ive cried
And I can feel you from the inside
Prowling like a devil that I try to hide
I can feel your heart beating
Closer than the poison of my pride
I can feel you, you're touching me
I look at him but its you I see, baby
I can feel your heart beating
Closer than the poison of my pride

Hand on my heartily just to the night

Why do I drown when I look through your eyes
Love is the morning that succeeds the night
I was gone by the first sign of the light

When it's dark out
I search for love but don't find it
Just sex and drugs but don't mind it
Because nothing's real I'm reminded
And I do suppose
Ignorance is bliss, truth be told
They say go smash these groupie hoes
And spend money on some newer clothes
And put poison up through your nose
Well,
Eventually everything fades
Even the brightest of colors turn greys
Highs comes down but the pain still stays
Even the longest of nights turn days

Wake up when it's over

But the night is impossible to harness

Live and die young leave a beautiful carcass

Realizing now that it just wasn't meant
But how would we know if the time wasn't spent?
If only we could live where the sun doesn't set
Somewhere it's always light out and happy

Stare at anything that's shiny bright
Her voice cuts through the sea even when its stormy

I hope she sees some things that will make her time happy
It all comes in so fast it all comes in

She sleeps through almost any sound
Even when its screaming loud and clear
But she wakes up and smiles at a friendly voice
If it whispers softly in her ear

I see in her new face, a clear beginning
It all comes in so fast it all comes in
She knows who she is without looking
She says it out happy when the feeling is there
She's an all new person who says just what she feels
She's a fat faced goddess of nowhere

I hope she sees some things that will make her time happy

If I was to go?
Like Jacob of old
To the well of the world

To wax halls where candles
Burn on through the day
To light you a path
So you'd never lose your way

I was down in the valley
Where the shadows are long
The birds in the harp tree
Were singing this song

There is time to deliver
Time to receive
All that you're lacking
Of whatever you need

Turn around, by the by
You'll still see the sea
As it was in the dawning
As it always will be

Raise up your bottles
And drink down the blood
You planted the vine here
In spite of the flood

Turn an ear to the harp tree
An eye to the wall
The songs in the singing
Or nowhere at all

No where to come from
No place to retire
No shelter nowhere
Except in the fire

The birds in the harp tree
Can finish their song
Then rest in its branches
Which is where they belong

But where can a man go
That's sweet to his soul
When his time is not ready
But he's still turning old

Here's a dream for the piper
And a tune for his lady
Outside the thin wall
The waves are still raging

Here's one for the harp tree
And one for his song
One for the morning
When the night was too long

Here's one for the candle
That lights you to bed
And one for the sword
That hangs over your head

Ain't gonna hang it in your old picture frame.

Well, I might look like Samuel Golders
But I feel like Baby Jane

Well, I wish I was in some
Australian mountain range.
Yeah, I wish I was in some
Australian mountain range.
I got no reason to be there, but I
Think it would be some kind of change.

I got my dark sunglasses,
And for good luck my black tooth.
I got my dark sunglasses,
And for good luck my black tooth.
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin',
I just might tell you the truth.

I got a man in Jackson,
And I ain't gonna say his name.
I got a man in Jackson,
And I ain't gonna say his name.
You know he's a brown-skin man,
But I Love him just the same.

Grace Slick,"When the winter comes the sun is low upon the fields
The sky is cold and it throws down icy snow
The lakes are glass the rivers all a frozen mass
The trees are bare and the northwind blows the air

But the children dance and sing as if the time were spring
When the seasons change everything they find a joy in what it brings

Then the sun comes high and the spring rains come and go
The summer air so hot it melts the Russian snow
The fields are brown there's no rain to make them grow
And the old ones sigh, the heat has made them tired and slow

But the children dance and sing as if the time were spring
When the seasons change everything they find a joy in what it brings
The children dance and sing as if the time were spring
When the seasons change everything they find a joy in what it brings

September leaves are falling through the autumn haze
And the school bells tell everyone there'll be no more summer days
Warm nights are gone, all the leaves are turning brown
Then the windows close again when the winter comes around

But the children dance and sing as if the time were spring
When the seasons change everything they find a joy in what it brings
So I will laugh and dance and watch the children sing
Then I will have the chance of finding joy in everything

And the ones that mother gives you, don't do anything at all

Go ask Alice, when she's ten feet tall

And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call

And call Alice, when she was just small

When the men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom, and your mind is moving low

Go ask Alice, I think she'll know

When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead
And the white knight is talking backwards
And the red queen's off with her head
Remember what the dormouse said

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1998

Graciela Beltran,"Voy a jugarme un amor
Con una baraja de oro
Que si lo gano ya estuvo
Y si lo pierdo ni modo
Porque yo soy de los hombres
Que cuando pierdo no lloro

Las mujeres son barajas
Que hay que saber barajar
Pa saber cual es la tuya
Di la que vas a apostar
No ya despues de perdido
Quieras volver a jugar

Y si juegas sin malicia
Porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando a sota de oros
Se aparece un caballero
Dispense mi buen amigo
Esque yo llegué primero

El que no lo quiera creer
Que le entre a lo pantera
Pierde dinero y mujer
Y hasta la portamonedas
Y a veces llega a su casa
Con la camisa de fuera

Y ni modo de reclamos
Porque yo llegé a caballo
Estoy regando el rosal
Pa cortar la flor de mayo
Perdoneme rey de copas
Pero yo soy de a caballo

De Canales se aparecen tres mujeres que en vida
Fueron rivales se dieron de puñaladas
Allá entre los mezquitales

El causante de esas muertes Santos Valdez se
Llamaba a las tres por separado les decía
Que las amaba pero a ninguna quería
Nada más las engañaba

Lupita era de la costa de Charco Azul María
Inés Estela era de Reynosa la más brava
De las tres decía yo pierdo la vida antes
Que Santos Valdez

Dicen que en Laguna Seca cuando la gente pasaba
Se oían gritos de mujeres cuando el sol ya
Se ocultaba eran aquellas valientes que ya de
Muertas penaban

Santos Valdez fue a sus tumbas para pedirles
Perdón rezaba sus oraciones con todo su
Corazón y quien habría de pensarlo
Ahí murió en el panteón

Y a mí no me cuadra nada

Pues yo no quería, mis padres me han dado
Estaré pedida, más no me he casado
No voy ah pasar la vida, con un celoso amargado

No seas tan coqueta, se más decentita
Ella le contesta con una sonrisa
Pues yo no tengo la culpa
¡De haber nacido bonita!

Sacó la pistola para amenazarla
Pero la Teodora le arrebató el arma
Con ella los 8 tiros, se los sepultó en el alma

Luego la aprendieron, pero a Teodorita
Los jueces la vieron tan entalladita
Que la libertad le dieron

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh Uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

You know how people have these little habits
That get you down like Ernie
Ernie like to chew gum, no, not chew, Pop

Like, I come home this one day and there's Ernie
Layin' on the couch chewin', no, not chewin', poppin'
So, I said to him, I said
""Ernie, you pop that gum one more time"" and he did

So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots into his head

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake city about two years ago
And he told me he was single and we hit it off right away
So, we started living together

He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
Then I found out, single, my ass
Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up the chicken for dinner
And in storms my husband Wilbrin in a jealous rage
""You been screwin' the milkman""

He says and he kept sayin'
""You been screwin the milkman""
Then he ran into my knife
He ran into my knife ten times

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie traveled around with us
With the last number in our act
We did 20 acrobatic tricks in our world

One two three four five, splits, spread eagles
Flip flops, back flips, one right after the other
Well, this one night we were in Cicero

The three of us, we were in this hotel room
Boozin' and havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice
So I went out to get some

I come back, open the door
There's Veronica and Charlie
Doing number seventeen, the spread eagle

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out
I can't remember a thing, it wasn't until later
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming, they had it coming
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it, in spite if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

I loved Alvin Lipschitz, he was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter
But he was always trying to find himself
He go out every night looking for himself
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it comin', they had it comin'
They had it comin' all along
'Cause if they used us and they abused us
How could they tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
Only first I am asking you why""

Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down

He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
And now will you tell me why?""

She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""

But she closed herself up like a fan

And she said, ""I've swallowed a secret burning thread
It cuts me inside, and often I've bled""
He laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground

""Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
But I won't march again on your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see.

And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
And would not look at his face again

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand
Your highness, your ways are very strange""

But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside

And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word

Je sais qu’en vrai, tu rêves d’être à moi

J'te baise et tu payes, ramène ta chatte
On met des verres de champagne pas dans mes achats
Sale fils de putain, des Louboutins, des Philippe Pleins
Bien sûr qu’on est plein
Du bif au rabord la vie sur le ciel
La pluie, le beau temps, j'suis Catherine Laborde
Ta sœur, la putain, disque d’or en 10 jours
T'as pas mon butin, j'suis seul maître à bord

On à des mes-ar sous les vestes, même quand je dors je les baise
Des mes-ar sous les vestes, du biff, 6 litrons sous la presse
Des mes-ar sous les vestes, même quand je dors je les baise
Des mes-ar sous les vestes, du biff, 6 litrons sous la presse

J'ai fais croire à cette petite salope que j'avais du buzz
J'lui ai dis que j'connaissais 2-3 footeux juste pour voir ses fesses
J'ai fais croire à ce petit fils de pute que j'vendais de la cess'
Je lui ai donné rendez-vous cagoulé, calibré pour prendre son pèse

Trop de bâtards n'ont pas cru en moi,
Mais la mixtape va leur donner tort
Génération 90, 23 piges, que tu le veuilles ou non,
Gros, c'est moi le plus fort

J'ai RDV avec Nyda, putain, y'a 3 salopes qui m'attendent
J'ai prévenu mes potes, enlevé mes bottes
Enfilé la 'pote, la tête sous mon bob
Cette salope m'a dit ""Ouais, Gradur, j'te la gobe""
Ma bite s'est levé aussi vite que ma côte
Tous ces bâtards de footeux qui nous regardaient de travers
Dans la boîte avec leur gros salaire
Maintenant ils ont plus de club aujourd'hui, aucun diplôme,
La roue a tourné, bâtard, tu galères
J'crois que j'suis le seul à faire des millions de vues,
Et à être encore au taff
Bah ouais, qu'est-ce que t'as cru petit fils de pute,
Moi j'ai jamais rien attendu du rap
À l'heure où je t'écris ce son, le Brésil perd
Pendant que je galère dans la caserne
Toc, toc, toc, ça frappe à la porte
Encore un soldat qui veut de la verte
Plus je rappe ma peine, plus je sors de la merde
Et forcément, ces bâtards me jalousent
Ils m'ont vu en treillis, FAMAS,
Humble et calme dans les interviews, ils m'ont pris pour une tarlouze
Vas-y viens, tête à tête, moi j't'attends, non j'parle pas
Sheguey, j'suis Black, frais, talentueux un peu comme Paul Pogba
J'veux le biff et la gova à Balotteli-li

Leur regard n'est plus le même ils me voient tous comme un danger

Les plus gros trésors, sont cachés dans l'océan
Et le paradis se trouve sous les jambes de ma mère
J'regarde en l'air, en fumant de l'herbe
Un jour j'me casse la jambe, un jour j'deviens célèbre
J'ai vu des gens me donner la force puis cracher sur moi
Je t'envoyais des lettres des mandats, j't'aimais comme un frère
Et toi tu m'as sali, juste pour un peu de buzz
Parce que j'suis monté plus vite, parfois le game fait peur
Oui j'avoue j'ai percé, et ça sans faire exprès
Oui j'suis loin d'être parfait, parfois j'commet des excès

Grady Martin,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Grady Martin,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,1999

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1981

Graeme Coleman,"Well I was there in Memphis
The day after Elvis died
But I never went to Graceland
'Cause I didn't wanna miss my ride
I've been down in Louisiana
Spent a night in New Orleans
But I never did sleep well enough
To dream the American Dream

I flew into New York City
Another face in the crowd
They took me in a limousine
To an office up above the clouds
They say one and one is three
Nothin's as it seems
Well I didn't sleep at all that night
So I missed the American Dream

I drove through a freezin' winter
Through the middle of the great heartland
Spend my nights at truck stops
My days with the country fans
Rollin' on 'til daybreak
Sleeping in my jeans
But I don't think dreamin' of home
Is the American Dream

Well I've been down to Hollywood
Well I've been to LA
Where people shook my hand
While they were looking the other way
Where everyone was dreamin'
Everyone but me
Well I'm sorry
But I don't believe

As I'm on these backstreets gettin' mine
Dodgin' the law, dodgin' it sublime
And if you feel me, I'm a keep it real for this episode

What must I do to live in the City of Angels?
Like a fucker, who unclockin' the chamber
'Cause it remains to be the same to me
I gotta be an OG like my daddy and my grand peppy

Don't ever touch mine, don't ever disrespect mine
Better get out to protect in case you ever cross the line
Yo, I'm like the crow, no dumb birdy
As I handle my business and as I take you on the journey

I'm like an angel in the city with the devil's path
And everybody's out to get me
So I quickly stick and move
And if he moves I trip, my fingers itch

I got a vision, I'm on a mission, listen
I can hear 'em, but I can't trust my intuition
I'm wishin' upon that midnight mystical
And through the darkness I'm hopin' for a miracle

I can't holler 'till you hear me
I gotta get me through the madness
Even though I'm guilty
And as I reload I'm all alone, set to explode
Like an unlogical murderer that's in the zone

I know they workin', the spirit's lurkin', I'm hurtin'
The triple six with the kiss got my soul searchin'
Then I woke and I choked on a cloud of smoke
It was a dream and in my dream I'd seen a black crow

The dark of the night starts to set in
Lots of deals goin' down under the city lights

Welcome to the city of drag where my pants sag
And the homies still relyin' on the flag
Yeah, life starts to twist and turn
Then they hit you at another angle
Just some more drama in the City of Angels

Violence is brought forth too many years
Fuckin' memories, we cried so many tears
Oh, the devil plays the repo man
And he's suckin' up souls as fast as he can

It's no question, it's in our nature
A .45 brings out the criminal behavior
When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom
As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room

Your heart starts to beat, it's like a ritual
And the feelin' that you get is somewhat spiritual
I'm a have to let you know how reality go
Learn to fly like The Crow as you slide into limbo

Yeah... KRS-One bout to wreck the joint
I was seen openin up at the edge of Detroit
Where the cops go beyond the laws
Where enemies work together by putting they shit on pause
So what does it mean, Assault on Precinct 13?
You are bout to see just what the dirt bring
It's working, that force, I have been searching
Like Lawrence Fishburne when it's time to hurt things
Ethan Hawke, man he face all that
I hold the mic like Ja held the baseball bat
I stay ahead, like a baseball cap
The ways of the world, Kris don't chase all that

[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 2]
Well as I walk through the street, my spirit will speak
To those I meet and great from week to week
I am not my handsome beat. I command the speak
As the observer inside the physique
Many rappers try to compete, of course
But they got smashed and trashed in the streets and tossed
Sometimes I think we all just lost
We just flashin and flossin the disastrous cause
We don't even know the one-ness of the only force
Instead of a golden calf, we got a platinum horse
But what did Moses do with the golden calf?
Threw the log at it and it ended in a blast
Master, get on them quick, get on them faster
In the background you frontin, 'cause there's nothing but laughter
I tag church like the shirt king
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13

We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

Wow, what an ending. What a conclusion
They thought they was winning, but they really was losin
He though he was sinnin, but he really was provin
That leadership keeps it moving, steady cruising
Guns up, funds up, from sun up to sun up to sun up
Buck buck buck! Yo, duck duck
We run up, two down, one up
Dope MCs see me and get butterflies in they stomach
Others can't speak, they just shut up
KRS on the come up, liftin Big Pun up. Let me sum up
Dope MCs, wack MCs, thin MCs, fat MCs, commercial MCs, they can't all
Get done up
Raise the drum up, breath for breath, I'll rip your lung up
On my trophy wall, I'm nailing your tongue up
KRS-One, you know what it means
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13

We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 4]
We gotta start trusting each other right now if we gonna make it
Through this night
From Criminal Minded to Spiritual Minded, and even beyond and behind
It, never be afraid to fight
Or be the lazy type. Me, I'm the crazy type
I get them clubs so crazy hype
I throw them glasses on that them ladies like
And years later, rock what they babies like
I blaze the light, there me be 8,000,000 ways to die
But there's 16,000,000 ways to fight
So wherever you are... in the crib or your car, in your tank too
KRS-One would like to thank you, right
That's why KRS on the mic
Wishin you peace for the rest of the night
'cause at the end of the film, you'll see what it mean

So, if your tryna' feel what I feel then yo get at me
And me? I get me fix from all sorts of shit
Every night with a glass of milk with some Oreo's I can dip
Fresh pot of mom's sauce, macaroni, meatballs
That smell of Sour Diesel when I open up the jar
Break it up and rollin' somethin', breakin' off a ho I'm fuckin'
Pop a little ecstasy and get that serotonin pumpin'
Goin' commando in a pair of sweats
Reruns of Sopranos up on my TV set
And that dopamine be flowin' on stage
Feel it every time that shit is goin' my way
It's chillin' with your best homies
The spittin' game and it's gettin' laid and that after sex bogie
Any time you feelin' good, it's what your brain produces
So my fans will get their fix every time they bumpin' my music

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me

I'm like a Power Ranger the way I'm mighty morphing
Into a rocket ship, that's taking off into space as I get lost
Thanks to stimulating endorphins, brings me closer to the coffin
Walk on the edge, cuz' I'm on the ledge
Wake up, when they go to bed
Got these cowards runnin' a bounty hunter like a Boba Fett
Life is like a drug, born addicted like crack babies
Tryin' ta' get that fix, you gonna hurt your back, like the Bag Lady
Goodbye dude, I expose these niggas', I got to
These niggas' heads bigger than yakoo, it's not cool
Lyrical mournings, gettin' us gory as biblical stories, you ignoren' the allegories
Tryin' to feel good; it's Aleister Crowley
Rush of that adrenaline is my medicine
My fuel is my kerosene
You ever live the life of a heretic?
That, dopamine, from the smoke the coke the lean
Is temporary when your third eye ain't opening

Loud so loud, my lungs vibratin'
High as a bitch I'm up skyscappin'
Annihilatin' some kind of [?]
That's the feelin' I feel when I am creatin'
And the fire's escapin', though your fire escape em'
Until I lie in your basement
Arise in the pavement just to arrive from inside of a spaceship
That fix, I'm suppose to dream
I chase Hennessey with dopamine
This is dope, I mean, I ain't sober
Promethazine in my soda, I'm suppose ta lean
My momma cookin'? Encore
The family members I die for
The two beautiful kids I stay alive for
Plus Hip-Hop makes me feel alive more

I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

Let me put you down, with some realness
You feelin' loud with me and Webby, rockin on that trill shit
Feelin' bliss, like its that fattest joint you ever hit
Higher than you've ever been, of course you know you're feelin' this
With that fellin' that you get when you open up your
Bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
With the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelt it
We the vibe at the party, when that shits about to turn up

Get [tightest?] in them [?], [?] me a drink, you bout to turn up

Girl you wore these jeans and you 
Made a thug wanna cry something terrible 
I had to have, have you for myself baby 
You don't know what those jeans do to me 
Make me wanna get down on one knee 
You got that thunder 
And it only makes me wonder how it 
Feels 
To get up in those jeans.
Oh those jeans!

[Chorus] 

You are the bomb 
Girl you're tight to death 
Baby, I don't know the words to say to you 
All that I know, baby all I know is 
That 
I'm loving what I see and I'm feeling you
I wanna know, all I wanna know is if 
I could have what's up in those 
Jeans
Baby can I have what's up in those jeans?
Don't get alarmed cause I don't mean no harm 
But I love the way you 
Wear those jeans 

Levis, Prada, BabyPhat (I love them) 
Love the way you, wearing them (I love them) 
Calvin, Iceberg, Sergio (I love them)
Trying to get inside of those 
Yeah Yeah Yeah 

[Chorus] 

I wanna say that them jeans 
Looking good fitting right 
Baby damn those jeans
Any kind doesn't matter you could win 'em 
You look fine 
Baby damn those jeans 
Anytime that I see you I want in, 
You wear them well 
Baby damn those jeans 
You the shit you the bomb 
All I wanna know is can I have what's in those jeans?
Can I get in those?

Then spell it out for ya ass if you tryna read
You fall like the spot behind ya knees

You get sufforcated when you tryin to breathe
I dare you to try to sneeze lil'nigga-please lil'nigga
My snipers squeeze I gotta connect this dianese
Tryna keep dope and his rice and beans

I'm tryna show you what it's like in Queens ya heard me

And where I'm from niggaz'll hustle and pack all day

I'll pistol whip a nigga in front of his click
Don't play with my money-you son of a bitch!
I'm a greedy motherfucker when it comes to mine
So I put in extra work in the summertime

'Cause ain't nobody in the world gon' give you shit
And don't nobody in yo' hood want to see you rich
So fuck that I'm all about goin and get it
And if anybody in the way they gonna get it

I'm a G I was raised by killers and thug niggaz
That'll sufforcate you(hard breathing)and leave you in a tub nigga
Hub niggaz for kilo's-and take they work
Play with me and they gon' have yo face on a shirt

Tryna get off they G-pack, I'm from the ??
Haters ain't never stop me yet
I made a couple of mistakes but ain't nothing I don't regret
It's $5.00 a pop in the hood for some cigarettes
Where I'm from niggaz'll pop up where you rest
Where I'm from it's too much for a man to digest
Where I'm from niggaz lose sleep and get no rest

Where I'm from niggaz lose sleep and get no rest
Where I'm from we aim shoot at ya neck (where I'm from)

Where I'm from I run with a pack
Of killers and ex con's that'll run in ya drought
Them three bricks right there they come with them rats
And if the cops hit the spot, I'll have 'em runnin in laps
I'm the same young nigga pumpin that crack
I'm the same young nigga dumpin the gat
I'm the same young nigga that'll jump out the 'Lac
Hit you with the mac and watch that shit jump out ya back
Throw the gun in the back, plus the bump, and the mac

I could brave bad weather.

Here on Sunset Boulevard",Sunset Boulevard,1997
Graham Bickley,"No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Say you love me!
RAOUL
You know I do.

Anywhere you go, let me go to
Love me, that's all I ask of you.
(they kiss)

I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Wait for me Raoul!

Christine I love you!

Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!

And soon you'll be beside me!

You'll guard me and you'll guide me
(they hurry off and the phantom emerges from behind the statue)

I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing
Christine
Christine

Say you'll share with me one love,
One lifetime say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning

You will curse the day you did not do

Graham Bickley,"Where do I go
Follow the river
Where do I go
Follow the gulls

Where is the something
Where is the someone
That tells me why I live and die

Where do I go
Follow the children
Where do I go
Follow their smiles

Is there an answer
In their sweet faces
That tells me why I live and die

Follow the wind song
Follow the thunder
Follow the neon in young lovers' eyes

Down to the gutter
Up to the glitter
Into the city 
Where the truth lies

Where do I go
Follow my heartbeat
Where do I go
Follow my hand

Where will they lead me
And will I ever
Discover why I live and die

Why do I live (beads, flowers)
Why do I die (freedom, happiness)
Tell my why (beads, flowers)
Tell me where (freedom, happiness)
Tell my why (beads, flowers)
Tell me why (freedom!)

I got my tongue, I got my chin
I got my neck, I got my boobies
I got my heart, I got my soul

I got my liver, got my blood

Graham Bickley,"She asks me why, I'm just a hairy guy
I'm hairy noon and night, hair that's a fright
I'm hairy high and low, don't ask me why, Don't know
It's not for lack of bread, like the Grateful Dead
 
Darlin', give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair
Shining, gleaming, steaming, flaxen, waxen
Give me down to there hair, shoulder length or longer
Here, baby, there, momma, everywhere, daddy, daddy
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it, my hair
 
Let it fly in the breeze and get caught in the trees
Give a home to the fleas in my hair
A home for fleas, (yeah) a hive to bees, (yeah) a nest for birds
There ain't no words for the beauty, the splendor, the wonder of my 
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it, my hair
 
I want it long, straight, curly, fuzzy, snaggy, shaggy
Ratty, matty, oily, greasy, fleecy, shining, gleaming
Streaming, flaxen, waxen, knotted, polka dotted
Twisted, beaded, braided, powdered, flowered and confettied
Bangled, tangled, spangled and spaghettied
They'll be ga ga at the go go when they see me in my toga
My toga made of blond, brilliantined, biblical hair
My hair like Jesus wore it, Hallelujah, I adore it
Hallelujah; Mary loved her son, why don't my mother love me?
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it, my hair
