Te amo
Aishiteru
Ani ohevet othka, I love you

The sounds are all as different
As the lands from which they came
And though our words are all unique
Our hearts are still the same

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

We teach the young our differences
Yet look how we're the same
We love to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain

From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies all get misty-eyed
To give their daughter's hand

Oh, maybe when we realize
How much there is to share
We'll find too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Though the rhetoric of government
May keep us worlds apart
There's no misinterpreting
The language of the heart

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, fluently spoken here
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Ladyhawke,"It all began innocent as love can be
In every word you gave it all to me
'Cause this is what a love song sounds like
Another life, two beating hearts are mine
The party's over but you're still over the line
'Cause this is what a love song sounds like

This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song sounds like
This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song, love song sounds like

I'm falling down, too much to drink again
You pull me up and tell me how it could end
This is what a love song sounds like
I gave it up, I don't wanna hurt anymore
It wasn't me, why can't you just open the door?
This is what a love song sounds like

This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song sounds like
This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song, love song sounds like

Life is always meant to replay
No heart break no more today

This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song sounds like
This could be my life, but it's only words

Ladyhawke,"In the dark, in the back of the van cautiously holding your hand
Making eyes, making everything alright
Being home, being all alone, feeling sad watching the phone
Singing out, singing everything's alright

You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire

In the dark, in the back of the van cautiously holding your hand
Making eyes, making everything alright
When I'm out, when I'm far away wanting you, wanting to stay
Singing out, singing everything's alright

You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire

When I wake and I'm far away, I know that you're leaving
In the dark when I'm all alone, I'm scared that you're leaving
When I wake and I'm far away, I know that you're leaving
In the dark when I'm all alone, I'm scared that you're leaving

With your eyes up close to me
I hear footsteps in the dark

Ladysmith Black Mambazo,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fear relieved 
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
And grace will lead us home
When we've been there ten thousand years 
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,1995

I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night

Makes the monkeys sing and the baboons swoon

And the rhino rumba in a conga line
And the pink flamingos are intertwined
As the stars come out to play

Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine
That you lose your mind
As it sweeps you off your feet

It just takes two
To make it true
Your heart will lead you there

Better hold your breath cause the water's deep

That you lose your mind
As it sweeps you off your feet

Ladysmith Black Mambazo,"I knew a man who lived in fear
It was huge, it was angry
It was drawing near
Behind his house a secret place
Was the shadow of the demon
He could never face 

He built a wall of steel and flame
And men with guns to keep it tame
Then standing back he made it plain
That the nightmare would never ever rise again
But the fear and the fire and the guns remain 

It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow
He tells the world that it's sleeping
But as the night came round I heard
It slowly sound
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping 

And then one day the neighbors came
They were curious to know about the smoke and flame
They stood around outside the wall
But of course there was nothing to be heard at all
""My friends,"" he said, ""We've reached our goal
The threat is under firm control
As long as peace and order reign
I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain
Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain""

Makes the monkeys sing and the baboons swoon
And the sultry scent of the lotus bloom
Will carry you away

Where the hippos swing from the jungle vines
And the rhino rumba in a conga line
And the pink flamingos are intertwined
As the stars come out to play

In Upendi
Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine
That you lose your mind
As it sweeps you off your feet
In Upendi
Without a worry or a care
It just takes two
To make it true
Your heart will lead you there

In Upendi
In Upendi

You better watch your step 'cause the path is steep
Better hold your breath cause the water's deep
It's a long way down over Lovers' Leap
But falling's half the fun!

In Upendi
Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine
That you lose your mind
As it sweeps you off your feet
In Upendi
Without a worry or a care
It just takes two
To make it true
Your heart will take you there

You can beat the bush like there's no tomorrow
From Tanganyika to Kilimanjaro
But you'll find Upendi wherever you are
Oh, underneath the sun

In Upendi
Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine
That you lose your mind
As it sweeps you off your feet

To make it true

Made a trail of, of a thousand tears
Made you a prisoner inside your own secrecy

[Chorus]
There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say ""I'm sorry""
Doesn't mean I'm sorry

At the first hour of the springtime
Made you up and split from one thousand enemies
Now I see you from the corner
Clock strikes
And I know you will be drinking alone

The summer went straight through your tires
Every faded sign that passed you
Used to point the way towards you

We have got to know, know that I'm not scared, to go home

We have got to know, know that I'm not scared, to go home

[Verse 1: Common]
It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock
Loud like shot that come from a glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
They could get robbed and stop the luck (?)
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a,
Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered, you forgot the mission
Listen!

All traces of life
In our gats we carry
That's used to dress humanity

[Verse 2: Common]
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
For the people to make or wait it's better
In a room called real I stay forever
Everyday I lose something I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some it's like umbrella
Where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind scream like Al Green ""Let's Stay Together""
How could a nigga be so scared of change
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Y'all rich, we could beef curry in the game
Out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go bang
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream
It all seems mundane in the scope of things

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Common]
From a land of shit talk, boy stars and pitch forks
Didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent on backyards, wishing in the air for a black god
Where people fix cars and clap hard
And look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
That master anger and ain't afraid to shoot
Through poured liquor fallen angels they salute (Whew! Whew!)
Feel the wind blow
A new wave people with their hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels who rock heavy metals
And tell them that they're pharaoh so let go
Come on!

Mother fuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my flog gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

We're making smores by the campfire
Camp flog gnaw, golf wang summer

Sat by the fire, do witness gentle
Transformation cease to be mindless
Create your sweetness

Pop some tame impala, your man got a lame impala
And I'm sharing slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You’re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
Maybe, I don’t know, I think you’re chill
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seat belt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Habt ihr meinem traum
Grausam kalt gemacht. 
Hier steh ich ganz allein, 
Ich hab euch nichts getan 
Und fühl mich doch so schwach 
Und klein - allein

Drehn sich einfach um 
Warum 
Und die die für mich wichtig war'n 
Glotzen nur noch stumm 
Warum 

warum schweigt ihr 
Sie gehen auf mich los 
Warum zeigt ihr auf mich 
Was soll das bloß 
Warum 
Wollt ihr mich nicht seh'n 
Wie ich wirklich bin 
Ich kann euch nicht verstehn 

ich - ich stehe hier vor euch 
Und seh' euch ins gesicht 
Das bin ich 
Ich - ich bleibe wer ich bin 
Und klein kriegt ihr mich nicht 
Niemals (niemals)

warum schweigt ihr 
Sie gehen auf mich los 
Warum zeigt ihr
Auf mich was soll das bloß 
Warum 
Wollt ihr mich nicht sehn 
Wie ich wirklich bin 
Ich kann euch nicht versteh'n

warum seid ihr so

Sie wollen dass wir uns nie wiedersehen
Sie trennen uns
Sie zwingen uns

Wir stehen zusammen
Wir gehen zusammen
Zusammen bis in den Tod
Wir leben zusammen
Wir schweben zusammen
Zusammen bis in den Tod
Do bist bei mir 
Ich bin bei dir
Wir lassen uns nie wieder los

Wir kennen keine Angst
Wir suchen und wir finden unser Glück
Denn hinter den grauen Wolken
Wartet das Licht es gibt kein Zurück

Was wir haben ist so groß
Wir werden miteinander siegen
Was wir sind 
Was wir tun
Wird nur in unsren Händen liegen

Wir stehen zusammen
Wir gehen zusammen
Zusammen bis in den Tod
Wir leben zusammen
Wir schweben zusammen
Zusammen bis in den Tod
Do bist bei mir - ich bin bei dir

Something's just crazy
Somehow it's taking all the life left in you
You're losing ground
Carrying that torch
Your not asking for much
As she has
Had time to heal
And she doesn't need you any longer an you
Had time to drink
And you call her to tell her you've gotten much stronger
At three in the morning she says stop calling 'cause
Everyone's asleep
Some of us work
You're driving me crazy
When will you get on with my life
Now every nights Friday night
Picking fights with your friends
Somehow trying to make amends
So you search for comfort in a friend
It's not the same she won't understand
You both learned to think alike
So what was so wrong
Where's she tonight
Out there drinking while you're left in thinking
It's taken all the life left in

You're losing ground

Was I less to live with no answers, as a life cried wolf

If I say it again can I kill it, will you lend me your ears
Breathe in breathe out exhale, acting sweating
A broken smile provides them a view, projection is nothing new
Just once I would like them to feel it, suffer in my skin
For a moment stand in my shoes, filled with swelling blues

[Chorus]
I keep this room, and this room keeps me, chained to my organs
I am quarantined, to a place that's dark, staring at three walls
The door is locked to them

Maybe now that they all know it, you'll find solace
As you're drowning in narcissism, or is it self-loathing
Cause you fought it all in your head boy, psychosomatic
They used to humor you now they pity you, and nothing's changed

[Chorus]

The door is locked behind me, if I say it again can I kill it
Because they're sick of my complaining and i am sick of being sick
Maybe these will cure you completely, chemicals deeply

I was abducted for a short time the door was open
But she fit inside she left me out here to justify
And pain is here now in some form of goodbye
But you died, yes you died I knew your secret
I'm stuck in time I met you in transit with five other ghosts
You ran me over reckless
But true emptied by oceans
My eye's a desert of dry expecting
You to drive by I want to see you
I want to see you to tell you I'm sorry
And pain is here now in some form of goodbye
I've been expecting you
I've been expecting I met her in transit
On her way home she left us out here
I wanna know she made it back to them

Forty-four robbers around my door
Forty-four - and maybe more
What the hell they want me for?
Stubbly faces & gap-tooth grins
Ain`t no way I`m lettin` them in

No way - you can`t come in
Forty-four robbers stinkin` of gin
Uh huh - I ain`t lettin` you in
I`ll hit you with a rolling pin
So small can`t hurt a fly
Get in my way and I`ll sure as hell try
To kick your butt down the block
Can`t wait yellin` for the cops

Fifty dealers and fifty thieves
Starring at the drive-in on my street
Shit, over my shoulder there`s Popeye and Bluto
Looking nasty - can I remember my judo?
It`s always like this - going out alone
So damn scared might never leave home

I`ve got my freedom I`ve got my pride
All means nothin` with these men outside
Puffing and preening and strutting their stuff
Blocking my way out - I`ve had enough!
Give me justice - hand it over now
Gotta get a gun or maybe just leave town...

See ya!
Sly Stallone and Al Capone
Are giving me grief on the telephone
All I want is a Swiss cheese sarnie
When at the deli stands big Arnie
Hey Jean-Claude - move aside
That taxi`s mine - I`m taking that ride
When I go out to get the Sunday paper
What`s my man to think `someone might rape her`?!
I`m just having a beer on my own
Don`t mean Hulk Hogan can take me home
I`ve got my mace but my loud-as-fuck whistle
Is so ineffective I just pray the Epistles
For help to come someday soon
But until then I`ll stay in my room",44 Robbers,1995

Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Saw the earth from the rim of a ship
Heard the whistle of the damnation train
But I didn't see her coming

Baby clear sky light

And now it's broke
With big guns booming like thunder
I should have struck him cemetery dead

41 dollars and 63 cents won't buy my way out of this mess
41 dollars and 63 cents won't get me a dress to compete with her best
God made woman when he took out a bone
Gave it to adam so he wasn't alone
Fell at his feet - a heap on the floor
Now he ain't coming back no more

I saw him on the lake at Galilee
The ship was gliding away from me
Sails unfurled in the evening breeze
The white caps marbleized into peaks
The wind is a woman and the water is too
The moon he holds the reins of the tides

Laing,"Wünsche gehen in Erfüllung doch die Erfüllung wünscht du nicht,
Es fehlt dir vielleicht nicht an Willen, 
Doch zu viel Glück bricht dir das Genick.

Du bräuchtest ein Organ, dass zu viel Neid abbaut, 
Damit sie sich nicht in deinen Adern staut. 
Aus lauter Angst vor Glück zu platzen, musst du es immer zu nichte machen.

Wünsche gehen in Erfüllung, Wünsche wünsche gehen in Erfüllung 
Wünsche gehen in Erfüllung doch die Erfüllung wünscht du nicht.

Du liebst es wenn deine Beute vor dir flieht, 
Je weiter desto besser,du schärfst schon mal die Messer, 
Denn die Jagd ist dein Spezialgebiet. 
Warum willst du immer das, was der andere hat? 
Warum lässt du was übrig und bist trotzdem nicht satt?
Ich sehe zu meinem Trophäen und bekomme Applaus bravo
Warum geht hier irgendwann alles drauf?

Wünsche gehen in Erfüllung doch die Erfüllung wünscht du nicht.

You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

On the rock and roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you out of school
You're a little touched you know, Angie baby

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
Angie girl, are you all right
Tell the radio good-night
All alone once more, Angie baby

Angie baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At night through the window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby

When he walks in the room, he feels confused
Like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
Except a crazy girl with a secret lover who
Keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane

Either through basketball or the mall or various odd
Jobs he does around town for free or at most a dollar
And I'm guessing 99% of you have either laughed in Whitey's

Or shortness when he wasn't looking
But the next time you'd see him he'd still go out of his way to 
Smile and wave at you and ask you about your mother's
Operation or something like that because he, unlike us,
Actually cares about someone other than himself

The reason I bring this up to you is because I was the worst
Offender of all

To relate evil deeds,
Frightful with hiding beasts,

Throne of the hostile king,
A shadowed offering,
Knife slits the servant child,
Served as a dish of flesh,

Avenging thunderbolts,
His wrath destroyed all men,
Punish deformity,
The wolf possessed Lycaon,

A lust for butchery,
Pleasure in the pools of blood,
He howls at the night he bleeds,

Slaughter eternity,
Defect obliterate,
Design a sect of hate,

Bring forth the blood of nine,
Chanting unholy priests,
At Mount Lycaeus' peak,
Prepare cannibal feast,

Sacrifice mortal dirt,
Revel Arcadia now,

Bilder von dir überdauern – bis in alle Zeit
Bis in alle Zeit, bis in alle Zeit
Bilder von dir überdauern – bis in die Ewigkeit
In die Ewigkeit, in die Ewigkeit.

Meine Worte hüllt in Schweigen,
so können sie nicht flieh'n.
Das was dunkel macht das bleibt
Und lässt das andre zieh'n.
Ich kann nicht sagen und will nicht vergessen
Oh nein, nein, nein
Wie ich es seh', wie ich es seh'.
Worte sind wie Pulver,
wenn do den Himmel kennst
Ich fühl's in meinem Kopf,
fühl's überall hab's lang vermisst
Ich kann nicht sagen, will nicht vergessen
Oh nein, nein, nein
Wie ich es fühl, wie ich es fühl.

Repeat Chorus 2x

Tausend Spuren und Gedanken,
nicht das kleinste Stück von mir
do lässt mich taumeln, lässt mich wanken,
die Luft ist voll von dir.
Ich kann nicht sagen, will nicht vergessen
Oh nein, nein, nein
Wie ich es fühl, wie ich es fühl.
Wie ich es fühl, wie ich es fühl.
Wie ich es fühl, wie ich es fühl.
Ich kann nicht sagen, will nicht vergessen
Oh nein, nein, nein
Wie ich es fühl, wie ich es fühl.

Wen das Herz am Boden liegt
Wo gehen wir hin
Wenn die Zeit gegen uns kämpft
Wo gehen wir hin

Die Augen fraglos
Blicke treffen sich nicht
Wann sind wir so stumpf geworden
Alles so abgeklärt
Im Ungleichgewicht
Unsere Worte mauern Wände zur Verteidigung
Unser Schweigen zermürbt uns
Presst das Herz
Und es bleibt stumm

Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause

Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness, in all them
Gotta shoot only if necessary 
Homey vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
Where Arian nations ain't having integration, we so blind
The beauty of life, was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right, ""Jesus""!
What is he like? I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school 
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool
But chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out

My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build
With dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills
For fish scale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese 
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's 
Black fatigues and ? On the sofa
50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters
My motions don't appeal to repel at divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga
Only killas know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution 
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton 

Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to his fathers
Protect the children, grab revolvers
The women plays important part of our life force
So what we fight for, my heart goes to you beautiful wife in war
Uh, And listen more talk less
Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient 
Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
You ain't a man you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in
Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
It's more to a war than just getting it on
Conceal your form, cover your tracks
Stay prepared I don't care if no one's spared

? rappers are full of this, since I'm a Don I'm pulling out a hit
'cause I'm fired up, I'm tired of all the bullshit
Flavor Unit, it's time to attack the prey
So make way for hip-hop's green beret
Bring on the refills, you see we feel
The name of the brain game is kill or be killed
I'm an expert, who will be the next jerk to try?
Let me explain you got 8 million ways to die
We torch and scorch ya, make ya feel real sore
Have that ass looking just like this boo-boo slipped the door
Known to kill, dunk skills, e-rupt
You ask why? My reply is 'I don't give a fuck!'
I'm a Panther, I love fresh meat
After I kill ya, I'ma leave ya body across 110th Street
My tactics are drastic and real fast
I tie one to a truck and go drag ya ass
I'm more than a threat, I'm a problem
To hell with cotton, watch out when I come to Harlem
So don't whisper or make a sound or croak
Shit ya prop, go straight back down ya throat

Putting rappers outta commission even on an off-day

Fuck around, lay around and get stuck up
You beatnit, wait a minute, hold the fuck up
If I was deaf, dumb, blind, stupid, blame
Handicapped, crippled and ""pussy"" was my middle name
You couldn't beat me slick, snap that neck like a Chico stick
I know who beat'cha quick (who?), my grip
Failing this to some type of tournament
I cut ya fucking head off and use it as a Christmas tree ornament
Come and give me a test whoever claims to be the best
He's with the 40-below footprint on his chest
Fucked up, got stuck, go press your luck
Both of his legs were found in back of a garbage truck
Head found in the bar of a limousine
The rest of his body at a dove site in Queens
Damn man, Mr. Handman, you like bragging
Ya fucked up, made a wrong turn and entered the dragon
I told you I'm out to stalk,

Give me a hearing aid or two then I'm through 'cause I'm that def

So I'm straight, if I hear ""drop the bomb"" I have to go
Break this nig' for anytime or any day, as many rhymes are played
Erase, forgive me not 'cause shit I'm hot, if I can get then you'll get got

I wouldn't cut it for the biggest butt-ocks out there
Put on a tip or hitting hips, I'm more than quick

Lakman,"Nehmen wir an diese Welt, diese Welt wäre fair, diese Welt wär' gerecht
Nehmen wir an, Rap wär' mehr als Gelaber, wär' mehr als Geschäft
Nehmen wir an, dass es dich nicht mehr gäb', nehmen wir an, du wärst weg
Das wär' 'ne schöne neue Welt, es wär' 'ne schöne neue Welt (imagine that)
Eine schöne neue Welt

Und du willst ein Rapper sein, ich fühl' dir auf den Zahn, du Esel
Was für Legende? Menschen reden über mich, als wär' ich ein unerklärliches Fabelwesen
Laber nicht, deine Braut hat ein asymmetrisches Blaseface
Das aussieht, als äße sie zum Frühstück morgens 'n Wagenheber
Eh-eh, sie mag nicht jeden, nur jeden mit 'nem Schwanz
Der sie wild durch die Lüfte wirbelt wie beim brasilianischen Capoeira
Frag nicht, wieso das Piano hier so mollig ist
Der Witz versteckt sich im düsteren Gewand, als wär' er von Hagen Rether
Lambos in Videos, doch im Alltag eher Marke Seat
RapUpdate titelt, denn DIESER Rapper tunt seinen Rasenmäher
Seine Bitch lässt sich betouchen wie'n zahmes Meerschweinchen
Macht die Nacht im Club durch und müffelt aus dem Rachen morgens nach starker Blähung
Sie nennen meine Kunst entartet, wären glücklich sie zu verbrennen
Denn meine Stimme schneidet durch den Beat wie'n scharfes Schwert
Rapper quatschen aber immer das Gleiche wie ja und yeah
Ich wart' nur, bis sie sich gegenseitig auslöschen wie Phasendreher, S-A-V

Nehmen wir an diese Welt, diese Welt wäre fair, diese Welt wär' gerecht

Na, wat ist'n los, Kleiner?
Deutsche Rapper haben Ghostwriter
Machen auf der Bühne auf Tae-Bo-Fighter
Alle nur noch Statements und so weiter, eh
In der Schwulenszene kennt man sie
Weil sie gern ein viel zu kleines Hemd anziehen
Doch ich hab' kein Mitleid, keine Empathie
Bis eines Tages meine Seele aus dem Fenster fliegt, eh
Und du willst dann noch ein Huhn mit mir rupfen
Doch ich kann dir nur anbieten, meine Schuhe zu putzen
Um mich aufzuhalten, musst du besser Kugeln benutzen
Keine Gegner, alles Huren und Nutten
Und dann hör' ich diesen Song
Und da disst er mich, denn mein Erfolg macht ihm schlechte Laune
Ist okay, doch lass die Mutter aus'm Spiel
Oder meine Mutter haut deiner Mutter auf die Schnauze

Nehmen wir an diese Welt, diese Welt wäre fair, diese Welt wär' gerecht
Nehmen wir an, Rap wär' mehr als Gelaber, wär' mehr als Geschäft
Nehmen wir an, dass es dich nicht mehr gäb', nehmen wir an, du wärst weg
Das wär' 'ne schöne neue Welt, es wär' 'ne schöne neue Welt (imagine that)
Eine schöne neue Welt

Ich nehme, nebenan, Überholspur, geht's nicht weiter
Ich will nur auf die Karriereleiter
In einer Szene ohne Wegweiser
Voller Quälgeister, redet weiter, eh
Als ich klein war, war Leben leichter
Und ideenreicher, alle eh reicher
Yeah, ich geb' der Platte eine B-Seite
Täglich streiten, allein aber Che Guevara, eh
Meine Kinder sind wie Seefahrer
Auf hoher See, aber ohne 'ne Magnetnadel
Frage, soll ich ihnen sagen es kommen Tornados
In einer Welt voller Pablos und Sopranos?
Check die Kollabos, es sind MVPs und Allstars
Rapmusik ohne MTV-Reporter
Ich geh' ans Mic, für die Jugend nicht mehr hörbar
Alte Schule, aber New World Order, eh

Nehmen wir an diese Welt, diese Welt wäre fair, diese Welt wär' gerecht
Nehmen wir an, Rap wär' mehr als Gelaber, wär' mehr als Geschäft
Nehmen wir an, dass es dich nicht mehr gäb', nehmen wir an, du wärst weg

It's summer time and I'm feelin' so good, 
Wake up in the mornin' with the player's groove, 
The weather's hot and I'm in my drop top 
Me and my friends rollin' through the parking lot, 
Today's a good day so call out the DJ, 
Bring the Gatorade, it's a sunny day 
Love the way I'm so fresh and so clean 
Out in the sunshine, you know what I mean? 

(i don't know this line it's on 50-51 sec.) 
So it's time to chill 
I'm home and I'm relaxin' with the meat on the grill 
And for real, (whistle) the girl's lookin so fine 
Dressed to impress and the weather's ain't denied 
All the time, the homies bring the cars out, 
Black, white, brown, asians no doubt 
It's a holiday, it's a sunny day

Water balloon fight, as the kids play 
Another day in the summer sunshine, 
Kites in the air as the food get's pre-pared! 
All the fella's looking for the pretty girls, 
(the pretty pretty girls out in the summer world), 
Like DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Fresh Prince, 
It's summer time again, let's reminice 
And how summer comes and goes and comes again, 
School's out, let's all have some fun again 
Everyone with the ringtones blowing up, 
It's the Summer Anthem song so you know what's up 
Play it loud, in the park, cruisin' in your ride, 
Everybody doing like these other kid times (?) 
Nevermind your problems, they go away 
It's summer time everyday is a good day

kickin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertime Anthem,

Now it's 6 o' clock and it's feelin so good, 
Summer breeze straining throughout the neighborhood, 
Time to pack up the bags, 
And the roll on now, 
Tempting the giggles with the music playin' loud 
Toastin, like it was 94' 
Remembering the boulevard after the car show, 
Damit, those were the good old days, 
But the summertime's back and it's time to play

Cruisin in the summertime, baby, 
Homies in the park goin', crazy, 
Crusin' in the block with your, lady, 
In the, in the, in the sunshine

I'm a give it to you because
I don't want somebody to give my little girl the game
So she could find her S.E.X.

Heard you just turned seventeen and finally got some hips

But they just want relations, they don't want relationships

Can't quite put your finger on it, but you feel it's strange

S.E.X., take a deep breath

Mama's giving advice, but she ain't tryin' to hear that
Not because it's wrong, just her delivery is whack

Life is rough
You say that you're not ready for sex, but you're in love
He says if you really loved him, you would give it up

Which one will you trust?

See, he'll tell you all kind of things to get in your pants, yeah
Baby, it's a fact that once it's gone, you'll never get it back (never get it back)
Hold on to your innocence
Use your common sense (you're worth waiting for)
Be strong

Till we meet again, I'm praying for you

Laladin,"You think that I don't feel love,
What I feel for you is real love.
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, born  in poverty,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, take a look at me.
 
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, by society,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, diff'rent from the rest.
Hold on, Whoa.
 
I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out.
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me.
Don't think I don't need you,
Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.
 
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.
(I'll always love you.)

Lalah Hathaway,"She's in danger, too
Human danger
Lone canary nesting near a runway whispers
Earthly strangers
Mighty jet planes fly you casually glancing
O'er seas and mountains
Too high to see this dying bird singing her swan song
No one hears it through the din as engines burn
Stars across the sky
Watch the caveman fly
Taking in the sights
Breathing out things die
Mother nature
Dying to reach you hasn't heard from you in
Ages since when her young children
Listened to her songs with awe and reverence
Now adolescents growing fast and eating her heart
No more thank you's no good mornings
Earthly dangers
What was once your modest home now
Swarms with cars and poison
Brown skies noise and playing with toys that kill you family
Blowing up the mountains foul oil fountains
Watch the caveman burn through the sky
The last canary screams her final song and dies while
Towards her nest crawl more sprawling towns
What burns up must come down
Human nature
Scrambling late to curb hard consequences
Young mankind so much potential
Time to heed Earth's guidance
Though our science brought us to novel heights
We must come back to mother
First she'll ground us the she'll whisper
You were my most endangered species
She's in danger, too",Endagered Species,2012

Out of the mist your voice is calling it's twilight time
When purple-covered curtains mark the end of day
I'll hear you my dear at twilight time
Deepening shadows gather splendor as day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender the setting sun
I count the moments darling till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time

Here in the afterglow of day we keep our rendez-vous beneath the blue
Here in the same and sweet old way I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold
Each day I pray for everything just to be with you
Together at last at twilight time

Lalo Mora,"La lealtad de un pistolero
Se le aplaude y se le admira
Por que son hombres completos
No se andan con la mentira
Y traen en su itinerario
A los que traen en la mira

Cuando cumple años el jefe
Siempre salen los regalos
Unos le traen cementales
Otros traen carros del año
Unos arriesgan su vida
Y el regalo sale caro

Se dio cuenta Barbarino
De un acérrimo enemigo
Era el que mas estorbaba
Y el emprendió su camino
Iba a rifarse su suerte
Al buscar aquel bandido

Tu le estorbas a mi jefe
Y matarte lo he planeado
Toda la gente del Shaka
Donde quiera te ha buscado
Esta vez vengo por ti
Tu eres mi regalo caro

Se agarraron a balazos
Barbarino tuvo suerte
En la frente del bandido
Se le dibujo la muerte
Y lo subió a su marques
Para llevar serlo al jefe

No tengo mucho dinero
Para regalarle un carro
Disculpeme usted señor
Estos presentes son caros
Abra la cajuela jefe

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

And there are dreams all that your heart can hold

Someday we'll meet again my love
Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Lara my own, think of me now and then
God speed my love till you are mine again

Lalo Y Los Descalzos,"There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years
Baby, baby, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)",Angel de la Mañana,2004

Lamajic,"Yeah, it's time, baby
It's time to speak the truth, maturity
Niggas gotta evolve to let niggas know the real
Call yourself real, ya gotta start speakin' about the real
This is Joe Crack, The Don an' this is what I'm bringin' to you

Yo, nowadays, I'm flirtin' with uncertain death
Lord, I gotta be dyin' 'cause after all this cryin'
How much more hurtin's left?
When will the pain stop? This depression an' anxiety
Is gonna make me show another side of me

My niggas ride with me 'cause I'm the truth
There's benefits to rollin' with this clique
Don't nobody fuck with you
Still they label me a tyrant an' a backstabber
But study the facts of crack, the shit don't add up

I'm bringin' opportunity to my community
Probably the only rapper that cares
But still you out to ruin me
Who you foolin', be? I'm for unity, Latins an' blacks
Could you fathom the strength, we have of the two it attach?

Born together, voted alike
These 'Uncle Charm' politicians ain't holdin' us right
How could the same nigga be 20 years in office
When it's clear the only thing that's risin' is unemployment?

Abortion, little kids havin' kids
The school system is failin' us, now ain't that some shit?
While the rich keep gettin' richer, the poor keep dyin' young
I can't hide no more, the time has come

I was born in the ghetto
Tremblin', tryin' to stay alive
'Cause when you're born in the ghetto
No one seems to hear your cry

Brown skin, you know I love my brown skin
Every day, I'm confronted with racism
These motherfuckin' coppers wanna bag us
An' have us shackled up in state prisons

After all the taxes I pay
You would think when they stop us
They would have something nicer to say
Than, ""Get the fuck out the car, where the drugs at?
All the jewelry, you wearin', where the fuckin' guns at?""

Once they search the car clean an' find nothin'
The same crooked cops try to act like they know us or somethin'
Laughin', tellin' jokes by the thousands
Two seconds ago they tried to send us to the mountains

Leave my son without a father, my wife without a husband
The more I think about it, man, it's just disgustin'
Still we live amongst 'em, everybody wants out
That's why we rap like we got silver spoons in our mouths

Like we ain't grow up on welfare
Nigga, don't even go there, you probably wore Pro Players
We need to educate the youth, tell our seeds the truth
Too much to share, the bare minimum will exceed the proof

I was born in the ghetto
Tremblin', tryin' to stay alive
'Cause when you're born in the ghetto
No one seems to hear your cry

Yeah, so much pain
Trying hard to stay alive, stay alive
Out in these streets

Man, sometimes it can get so tough
Yeah, yes, it can, yes, it can, yeah
It can get so hard, so hard, so hard

Fly, come and fly with me

Fly away with me
Rap 1:
Hard times in the ghetoo yo it's time to slow up,little man on the block with the plans to blow up
You cane make it out of the ghetto if you reach for the stars
When the times're getiing ruff , just think with your heart
Love is all around and sometimes it's covered with hate
The more love, the less violence and the feeling is great
Sometimes, I fly with my eyes closed and vision my path
When my eyes start to open I can see what I passed
One day I took the wrong road and letting the pain
Now I learn from my mistaked and it won't happen again
Heard the gun shots pass the scene, bodys desceased
And I reach deep inside my soul so I can still preach peace
We all need to fly and keep our hads to the sky
And now I promise to help the needing 'til the day that I'll de
Womder why the queen died, cause forever you're more
And I spread my wings and fly because life goes on
Chorus x 1
Fly away?

Rap 2:
Flying high to a place that's far beond our site
At night I see a light and forever it's bright
When the street are going on violence and they even know work
When I spread my wings sometime, starting feel like a bird
Little man with the gun, little girl with the knife
Tell them down look the sky and you can follow my flight
Cause there ain't nothing in the streets but distruction and death
And my plan to save the world is on the knowledge and trust
Keep your eyes on the good things that life can offer
Everuday I'm giving thanks for my mother and father
Tought me how to keep flying, when I'm rapidly change
If I feel I can't make it, then call on his name
We all gonna fly, it's just a matter of time
On the dropping of my love, I hope it falls on your mind
And the fence for your support is nothing but love
And together we'll fly to the heavens above

Oooh, fly?.

Bathed in your sighs

Step inside let me warm you up
By the fire in my heart
Step inside close the door
On the wind the fear
Brewing up behind you

You could stay here
Make your home here
Hide away here
I could wrap you up in cotton wool

Here's somewhere you could let your love run free
Come and give your soul a resting place
Finding someone is like finding yourself or home
If the key fits just open the door
Cause you're never gonna spend a lonely day here
Come and watch your fear fly away
And you'll never humble for a greener side then here
Gonna wrap you up in cotton wool and save you
And save you

Where's your love?
Let me in 
To find the warm fire 
That I know is there inside you
Let me in 
It's cold outside and I'll grow there 
By that place deep down inside you

You could hold me
And protect me from all harm
You could love me
You could wrap me up 
And I could stay there
Make my home there
Hide away there
You could wrap me up in cotton wool",Cotton Wool,1996

But you didn't want to look
You heard me hurting
But you didn't want to listen

Tell me something more worth living for

You felt me wanting
But you didn't want to give
You sensed me sinking
But you really couldn't save me
