Art Tatum,"Perdido,
I look for my heart
It`s perdido
I lost it way down in Torito
The day the fiesta started

Bolero,
I sway that they play the Bolero
I kissed me the listing sombrero
And that`s when my heart departed

High, was the sun when I held him close
Low, was the moon when we said, ""Adios""

Perdido
My heart ever since is Perdido
I know I must go to Torito
To find what I lost Perdido

High, was the sun when I held him close
Low, was the moon when we said, ""Adios""

Perdido
Goodnight perdido
I lost perdido",Perdido,2013
Art Tatum,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love,2013
Art Tatum,"This love of mine, goes on and on
Though life is empty, since you have gone
You're always on my mind, though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day and all the night

I cry my heart my out, it's bound to break
Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

I cry my heart my out, it's bound to break
Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?",This Love of Mine,2013
Art Tatum,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream 
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will

Art Tatum,"Mop mop! A thousand years ago
Mop mop! A guy named Jungle Joe
Was a drummer man in a Zulu band
That made swing history

Mop mop! One day the king said ""Gate!
Why Gate, you old reprobate
I commission you, find a riff that's new
Or your wig belongs to me.""

Joe's knees started knockin'
So scared he was stiff
'Til he noticed the tribe was rockin'
As his knees beat out this mellow riff

Mop mop! From the tropic's heat
Mop mop! Came this jungle beat
Though old Joe is gone, his jive lives on
And it still is making history.

Art Tatum,"Savoy--the home of sweet romance
Savoy--it wins you with a glance
Savoy gives happy feet a chance to dance
Your old form just like a clinging vine
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine

How my heart is singing
While the band is swinging
I'm never tired of romping
And stomping with you at the Savoy
What joy, a perfect holiday
Savoy, where we can glide and sway
Savoy, let me stomp away with you

Art Tatum,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we

The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,2018
Art Tatum Trio,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Art Tatum Trio,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say: 

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'

It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night

Art Tatum Trio,"I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in
Don't let it abide in my dreams

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear 
It won't be too late, dear, for me

Art Tatum Trio,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone

What have you done to me
I can't eat, I cannot sleep
And I'm not the same anymore, no, no
I don't know what to do
'Cause all of me wants all of you
Do I stand alone at the shore

Now once I could turn away
From everything I feel today
But now I wanna walk through your door

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last

With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart

Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears?

Art Van Damme,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,

Art Van Damme,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Art Van Damme,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Art Van Damme,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!
Till everything he's got belongs to me!

And everything I've got belongs to him!
And everything I've got belongs to us!",Ev'rything I've Got,1995
Art Van Damme,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1995
Art Van Damme,"Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo,
In a garden fair where roses grow,
In the tender light
Of a Summer night,
I can see her wander to and fro.

For she said, ""I'll wait
By the garden gate"",
On the night I said, ""I love you so!"",
And in all my dreams it seems I'll go
Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo.

Oh, she said she's gonna wait

Art Van Damme,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone,1995

It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1998

Let there be wind

A lark and a dove
But first of all, please

Although I can't dismiss, the memory of her kiss.
I guess she's not for me.

She's knocking on the door, but not for me.
She'll plan a two by four, but not for me.

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Oh! Will you never set me free?

Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree

When I know that the good times go
They never stay

Early and greet the new day

Something to keep me occupied
I guess I've known all along that it was you

Someone that's always on my side
I believe that what you said is true
And God has shown me
That he won't turn away
No matter what I do
No matter what I say
It's just so hard to let go
And simply let him in
I've got to make the choice
Or be back where I've been

Moving beyong-wiping the slate 
Moving beyond-eith goals set high

Taught from childhood-words of broken nature 
Results of no good

Naked as we stand in the golden light

It makes one man weep and another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove

Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

Arthur Fiedler,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1995

Oh, honey, hail! hail! the gang's all here
For an Alabama jubilee

Mandolins, violins,
Hear the darkies tunin' up, the fun begins,
Come this way, don't delay,
Better hurry, honey dear, or you'll be missin'
Music sweet, rag-time treat,
Goes right to your head and trickles to your feet,
It's a reminder, a memory finder
Of nights down in old Alabam'.

Hear that flute, it's a beaut,
And the tunes it's tootin', tootsie, ain't they cute?
Let's begin, it's a sin,
To be missin' all this syncopated music!
Oh, you Jane, once again
Give your legs some exercise to that refrain,
Boy, that's what makes me so dreamy and takes me
Back home to my old Alabam'.",Alabama Jubilee,2013
Arthur Fiedler,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well

That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

Arthur Foxall,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2005

Love was the gleam in papa's eye

People suddenly meet
People suddenly fit
People suddenly hit
And brother, that's it

Personally
Love is a kick right in the pants
Love is the aspirin you buy

If you're flappin' your fins
If you're climbin' a wall
There must be a reason for it all
What is the reason for it all?
Love is the reason for it all

Love is the night you can't recall
Love is the extra drink you drank

Love's a shot in the arm
Love's a poke in the ribs
Buyin' bottles and bibs
And fillin' up cribs

Obviously
Love is an old established trap
Ten million suckers walk the plank

If you land on your tail
Every time that you fall
I can't see the reason for it
Who needs a reason for it?
Love is the reason for it all

Hallways are lovely for a call
Call it the season

Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth

Where the townies slept
their wives were kept
In the Whiskey Point part of town

In 69 our close friend Joe
drowned on a dare
Swimmin' across the reservoir

went to war in Vietnam

down at the V.F.W Hall
And everyone dances till midnight

Down to St.Vincent's to confess
That Whiskey Point hangover
Good for ten Hail Mary's I guess
Stick to the game plan

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her; 
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;

Every man who looks your way

Seniorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes

Like a little soldier catching butterflies

Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done, oh, I'm so much in love
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind

Arthur H,"Mes illusions donnent sur la cour
Des horizons j'en ai pas lourd
Quand j'ai bossé toute la journée
Il m'reste plus pour rêver
Qu'les fleurs horribles de ma chambre

Mes illusions donnent sur la cour
J'ai mis une croix sur mes amours
Les p'tites pépés pour les toucher
Faut d'abord les allonger
Sinon c'est froid comme en décembre

Quand le soir venu j'm'en reviens du chantier
Après mille peines et le corps harrassé
J'ai le regard morne et les mains dégueulasses
D'quoi inciter les belles à faire la grimace
Bien sûr y'a les filles de joie sur le retour
Celles qui mâchent le chewing-gum pendant l'amour
Mais que trouverais-je dans leur coeur meurtri
Sinon qu'indifférence et mélancolie
Dans mes frusques couleur de muraille
Je joue les épouvantails

Mais nom de Dieu dans mon âme
Brûlait pourtant cette flamme
Où s'éclairaient mes amours
Et mes brèves fiançailles
Comme autant de feux de paille
Aujour'hui je fais mon chemin solitaire
Toutes mes ambitions se sont faites la paire
J'me suis laissé envahir par les orties
Par les ronces de cette chienne de vie

Mes illusions donnent sur la cour
Mais dans les troquets du faubourg
J'ai des ardoises de rêveries
Et le sens d'ironie
J'me laisse aller à la tendresse

J'oublie ma chambre au fond d'la cour
Le train de banlieue au petit jour
Et dans les vapeurs de l'alcool
J'vois mes châteaux espagnols
Mes haras et toutes mes duchesses

À moi les p'tites pépés les poupées jolies
Laissez venir à moi les petites souris
Je claque tout ce que je veux au baccara
Je tape sur le ventre des Maharajas
A moi les boîtes de nuit sud-américaines
Où l'on danse la tête vide et les mains pleines
À moi ces mignonnes au regard qui chavire
Qu'il faut agiter avant de s'en servir
Dans mes pieds-de-poule mes prince-de-galles
En douce j'me rince la dalle

Et nom de Dieu dans mon âme
V'là qu'j' ressens cette flamme
Où s'éclairaient mes amours
Et mes brèves fiançailles
Où se consumaient mes amours
Comme autant de feux de paille
Et quand les troquets ont éteint leurs néons
Qu'il n'reste plus un abreuvoir à l'horizon
Ainsi j'me laisse bercer par le calva
Et le dieu des ivrognes guide mes pas",L' Alcool,2002

The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,1961
Arthur Lyman,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1961
Arthur Lyman,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
 
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes

Arthur Lyman,"Oh, you can kiss me on a Monday
A Monday, a Monday is very, very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would
Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best
But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest
 
Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day

A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest
But never, never on a Sunday",Never on Sunday,1962

My dear heart, seems like a year since you've been out of my sight

And dear heart I want you to know
I'll leave your arms never more

Arthur Lyman,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe,1967
Arthur Lyman,"Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Over you, over you
I want you to want me
I need you so badly, I can't think of anything but you

And I think I'm goin' out of my head
'Cause I can't explain the tears that I shed
Over you, over you, I see you each morning
But you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head, over you
Out of my head, day and night
Night and day and night, wrong or right

Arthur Lyman,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence","The Sound of Silence From ""The Graduate""",1969

They're all the same, those pretty girls

Night o'er the valley is creeping! 
Birds cuddle down in their nest, 
Soon all the world will be sleeping

And now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here

Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow!

Arthur Lyman,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Him Was Easier,1997
Arthur Lyman,"My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

Playin' make believe you're married to me
You were fifth-grade, I was sixth when we came to be
Walkin' home ev'ry day over Bonnicut Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far
Headed for city lights, climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone made myself a name
Funny I seemed to find that no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss and the love I left behind

My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I saw Uncle Sammy weeping
For his children from over the sea

They had come to him, friendless and starving
When from tyrants' oppression they fled
But now they abuse and revile him
Till at last in just anger he said

To the land from where you came, whatever be its name

If you don't like the Red, White and Blue
Then don't act like the cur in the story
Don't bite the hand that's feeding you!

You recall the day you landed
How I welcomed you to my shore
When you came here empty handed
And allegiance forever you swore

I gathered you close to my bosom
Of food and of clothes you got both
So, when in trouble, I need you
You will have to remember your oath

Quella sera
Mi si era avvicinata e mi fissava mentre io bevevo una birra chiara
E si era seduta lì vicino a me
Ma non me n'ero accorto perché ero un po' storto
Allora stufa d'aspettare lei mi dice
""J-ax, approvo come interpreti la globalità
Multimediale della massa attuale

Era bella con un cu-curioso taglio di capelli
E delle te-te-te-te-tenere espressioni
Non si possono sprecare certe occasioni
Per non passare da coglione
La inseguo, la fermo, mi scuso e dico
""Senti
Vorrei approfondire i tuoi accorgimenti

E se vuoi aprire le ga- le ga-

Io continuavo a bere, facevo finta di ascoltare
Dopo circa una mezz'ora di stronzate e paroloni
Mi mette una mano sopra i pantaloni e dice
""Ho voglia di pene-pene-pene-penetrare
All'interno del tuo ego per poterne ricavare l'essenza
La dissidenza, e quel tuo sentimento di reazione violenta""
Le dico, ""senti bella, adesso ti spiego
Ho voglia anch'io di penetrare, ma non certo il tuo ego
Ma la tua fig-fig-figura di donna
Inserita, nella società moderna
Quali sono i tuoi interessi? Cosa ti piace fare?
Quali sono i tuoi progetti per stasera?""
""Per essere sincera avrei un appuntamento
Un corso di pittura, non posso mancare
Stasera ho proprio voglia di usare un pennello
Con un pennello in mano mi posso realizzare""
""Senti bella, potevi anche dirlo

Io mi metto in libertà
Apre la borsetta, si accende una sigaretta
Mi guarda intensamente con la faccia sospetta e dice
""Guarda, non so cosa tu voglia fare

Ho voglia di scoprire qualche nuova posizione
Ortogonale, mica male però il tuo pennello posso toccare?""
""Tocca, tocca pure ma fai piano è delicato

Ma se domani un altro sole il tuo corpo riscalderà (domani)
Però domani un altro bacio dimmi che sapore avrà? (Domani)
E se domani un pensiero di ciò che era ieri ti chiamerà (domani)
Tienilo con te perché dopo un giorno ancora forse se ne andrà

Oggi c’ho in testa te, non so perché
Domani chissà… perciò se ti va senti qua
I ricordi sono in fila e non mi mollano
Ad uno ad uno salgono e mi tormentano

Sono in para-noia dura, dolce tortura
Paura, come quella sera
Indeciso sul baciarti o meno, a parlare sul divano ore
La prima volta che assaggiavo il tuo sapore

E già ne ero strettamente dipendente
Shhh, cotto immediatamente
Ed era tipo “che c’importa di domani? Stringimi le mani”
Ma I baci non risolvono i problemi

E ora non ci sei, domani è già arrivato
E brucia dentro sai, anche se ero preparato
E cadono parole come pioggia sulla strada
Forse verrà domani il sole che le asciuga

Non so dove mi porterà questa marea
A largo o a riva non ne ho idea
Se con qualcuno o se con te
Non so domani neanche se sarò con me

Ma se domani un altro sole il tuo corpo riscalderà (domani)
Però domani un altro bacio dimmi che sapore avrà? (Domani)
Se domani un pensiero di ciò che era ieri ti chiamerà (domani)
Tienilo con te perché dopo un giorno ancora forse se ne andrà

L’autostrada scivola veloce
Sto mangiando quel gelato che ti piace
Che ti fa ingrassare tutte le menate
Quante volte le ho sentite
Mi gira in testa ancora la tua voce
Dolce musica, pure quando isterica
Quasi psichedelica, senza dubbio erotica

Ah, e pensa a quanto spesso son finito nel tuo letto
A smaltire quel gelato, a restare impigliato
Nei tuoi capelli con il mio orecchino,
A fare casino, per farmi stare zitto mi schiacciavi
Sulla bocca il tuo cuscino.
Fumare sigarette, raccontarti barzellette fino al mattino

E mi divertivo quando mi correggevi se sbagliavo un congiuntivo
E come t’incazzavi quando t’abbracciavo
E non m’ero tolto l’orologio e ti graffiavo
Cento volte buonanotte e non dormivo, ti fissavo
Poi mi muovevo e ti svegliavo
“E lasciami dormire Ale, ti prego”
Ed eri così bella che non ci credevo

Ma se domani un altro sole il tuo corpo riscalderà (domani)
Però domani un altro bacio dimmi che sapore avrà? (Domani)
Se domani un pensiero di ciò che era ieri ti chiamerà (domani)
Tienilo con te perché dopo un giorno ancora forse se ne andrà

Forse domani un nuovo vento
La mia passione soffierà via (domani)
Chissà domani quale fuoco ecciterà i peccati miei (domani)
Perché domani non ci sei, perché domani non c’è “noi”
Perché domani, c’è solo domani (domani), domani

E ancora cambio umore se ti penso
È un bel po’ che non ti sento
Ma non mi frega cosa stai facendo
Dentro ho un’immagine di te che non parla
L’ho fatta per guardarla e non voglio rovinarla
E tengo solo il buono, come il tuo profumo
Che mi ha sballato più di ogni cosa abbia bevuto o fumato
E mai nessuna foto renderà giustizia al tuo sorriso
Quando esplode all’improvviso sul tuo viso, lascia stare
Domani avrò un altro posto dove andare
E un’altra rima da inventare
E neanche so dove saranno i miei pensieri
Forse sarai solo una luce che illumina il mio ieri

Ma ancora rido se penso ai soprannomi che mi hai dato
Li sapesse anche il mio amico, sarei rovinato! Non credi?
Sono ancora in piedi, e lontano che non mi vedi
Ma oggi tu sei la mia musa, baby
Fata benedetta e strega maledetta insieme
Faccio di te le rime mentre domani viene
La notte muore schiaccio l’acceleratore
Oggi sarà un giorno senza te, domani pure

Ma se domani un altro sole il tuo corpo riscalderà (domani)
Però domani un altro bacio dimmi che sapore avrà? (Domani)

Io sono un funkytarro D.O.C
Tipa stop
Con me non devi far la snob
Dài, salta su Hop
Sulla Jeep
Sentirai il profumo dei miei sei Arbre Magic
Come Bersani sono un freak
Tarro e t'atterro con lo sguardo
Io sono trash come la Marini e Adriano Pappalardo
Io sono quello che impennava con il Ciao
Con la maglietta degli Squallor Arrapao
Quello che rimpiange la sella con le frange
La targa Arizona e la marmitta Proma
E l'adesivo dei Kiss e di Bob Marley
Il motorino che fa casino come un'Harley

Faccio rime giù in città
Senza pudori né riguardo
Sono un funkytarro
Io sono un porco a volte storto

Dammi il tuo cuore baby, perché sono qua

Mi metto a petto nudo nella music hall
Non sono beautiful, ma c'ho il physique du rôle
E faccio gara alle giostre col punging ball
Come faceva Terence Hill
Ho l'orologio di Topolino comprato all'Autogrill
Lo porto sul polsino; non è Beverly Hills
Il posto dove vivo, bella mia
Sono il tipico tamarro di periferia
Che tiene al massimo l'autoradio
Per me il Garelli è un classico
Come gli interni in radica su una Ritmo cabrio
Mi piace la catenina con la croce d'oro
Sulla maglietta stile Tony Manero
La sigaretta sopra l'orecchio
Lo Zippo come accendino
Se siamo a letto rimango nudo, ma col calzino
Che fa tanto Hard Core
Ma non temere perché uso il DivorOdor

Io colpisco e scappo via
Ma con ognuna ho fatto un pianto
Ho pianto pure con la tua

Sono funkytarro, l'anti-yuppies
Faccio schifo tipo scarafaggio alle preppies
Ma bambina, t'incanto quando parlo
Anche se la mia rima è tarra come i film di Vanzina, Carlo
Funky come Pino D'Angiò però
Tarro come Massimo Ciavarro
Io sono un evergreen
Come le tendine sul lunotto posteriore con disegnata Marilyn
Oppure Geen
E ho visto l'era punk, quella metallara
Quella dark, quella paninara
Quella dei finti ricchi
Quella dei finti poveri
E ancora io sono qui invariato
Niente m'ha cambiato
E sembra finalmente che il momento mio sia arrivato
Tipa, con gli altri non c'ho sfida sai
Il tamarro è sempre in voga, perché non è di moda mai

E allora?

Muoviti tranqi funky 
Slega i legamenti col tranqi funky
Segui i movimenti tranqi funky 
E le vibrazioni del tranqi funky

Questo suono è funky
Questo suono è tranqi
Perchè io la musica la tratto con i guanti
Slega i legamenti
Se mi senti ti accendi
Delle vibrazioni segui i movimenti
Facce sorridenti e beviamoci una birra
Ma poi scendi giu' in pista
Se non ti piace il ritmo hasta la vista, vai pure via
Sono io l'animatore che sta sulla regia
L'intrattenitore
Che viene dal quartiere
Tu muovi il tuo sedere
E fammi fare il mio dovere
Sai che tranqi significa tranquillo
E su questo funky mi scialo e non strillo
Come il parmacotto
Accattativillo
Dimmi sai il mio nome? Si
E allora dillo JAx
E tranqi funky è il nome del mio ballo

Muoviti tranqi funky
Slega i legamenti col tranqi funky
Segui i movimenti tranqi funky
E le vibrazioni del tranqi funky
Gira intorno poi respira
Ogni nota è un'atmosfera
Questa sera un po' speciale, se lo vuoi
Muoviti tranqi funky con noi

E mi ricordo i tempi
In cui eravamo in venti
A muoverci col funky
Oggi siamo in tanti 
E domani saremo sempre di piu'
E adesso muoviti con me
Ai piatti DJ Jad
Butta giu' la base
E quando entro in fase
Ci sputo su una frase
Come sempre
Rigorosamente
In rima
Funky sinfonici, oggi come prima
E ba-ba-baciami piccina 
Sulla bo-bo-bidibobocca piccolina
Muoviti arrapante tipo play
Metti play poi ok
Tutto fila liscio come con i Casadei
Hey ci sei? ci siamo, andiamo
Sono appagato in pieno, vi amo Vi amiamo
E tranqi funky come siamo

Muoviti tranqi funky

Segui i movimenti tranqi funky

Ogni nota è un'atmosfera
Questa sera un po' speciale, se lo vuoi
Muoviti tranqi funky con noi

Di voglia di parlare ne ho poca
Ma è inutile parlare se nessuno
Ascolta
Dunque io ringrazio tutti quanti
Specie la mia mamma che mi ha fatto cosi' funky
A me piace la musica quando trasmette i sentimenti
Dire le mie cose senza complimenti
Bere birra, fare tardi, accidenti
Ballare con le tipe con i vari strusciamenti
Yahoo Sono in posizione
Portare il funky nella mia nazione
è la mia missione
Se vuoi darmi una mano fatti avanti
Scendi in pista tranqi
E ballati sto funky

Muoviti tranqi funky
Slega i legamenti col tranqi funky
Segui i movimenti tranqi funky
E le vibrazioni del tranqi funky
Gira intorno poi respira

Che con i topi ha conquistato la città ma del lavoro non sa neanche la metà 
E ho imparato che niente è impossibile, e anche che quasi niente è facile 
Che devi avere fede, parlare a chi non crede, anche a chi ha il cervello messo dove ci si siede 
Adesso salta su, suona chi te lo meriti, la suola brucia come un rogo (rogo!) 
E quanta merda m'han tirato addosso, ma mi son mosso più d'un passo 
E ho risposto a chi tirava gliel'ho spiaccicata in faccia 
E come vedi su di me non ne rimane traccia, e se mi annusi senti profumo di rivalsa

Ohi Maria, ti voglio

È una canzone d'amore mi sale dal cuore (come?)
Con ardore, candore di stile cantautore
Caro ascoltatore la canto con calore struggente
Un mix tra Masini e Cocciante e coscente
Che serenate ne ha già scritte tante, in tanti
Con sentimenti e intenti differenti
Con pianti, lamenti, accordi struggenti, ricordi
Ne hanno scritta una per Francesca che non si trovava
Per Giulia che era brava
Per Silvia che ignorava, che Luca si bucava
Per Anna che sapeva fare l'amore
Per Gianna, Gianna, Gianna che aveva un coccodrillo e d'un dottore
A Marinella volata su una stella, lassù
E che due palle ci aveva fatto Lisa dagli occhi blu
Così, dopo signora Lia
E passerotto non andare via
Con la mia dedicata alla Maria
Ricordo quando l'ho incontrata al parco sette anni or sono
Vestita in verde con quel suo profumo buono
Stava con un mio amico che mi ha chiesto me la tieni
Devo andare all'aeroporto e lei non va d'accordo tanto con i cani
Non ci son problemi fidati di me
Che intanto che tu vai facciam due chiacchiere
E anche se a quei tempi ero poco più di un bebè
Sono corso a casa mia con la Maria a farmi un tè

Ohi Maria, ti amo
Ohi Maria, ti voglio
Ohi Maria, ti amo
Ohi Maria, ti voglio
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria

Con la Maria ho fatto il tè e l'ho baciata, prima
L'ho conquistata con un tubo perugina
Dalla mattina fino a sera siamo stati insieme
E stavo troppo bene, sebbene
M'era venuta una fame immane, da pescecane
Mi sono fatto otto panini col salame
Ed un tegame di pasta al pesto, del resto
Dopo mangiato Maria si bacia con più gusto
Mi sono addormentato poi, verso sera
Mi sono svegliato e lei era finita
Finita chissà dove
Volevo tornare al parco ma piove-
Va e già il mio cuore si struggeva
Dopo da allora l'ho sempre cercata continuamente
Ma purtroppo è nei guai con la legge, è latitante
E certe sere che mi sento solo e stanco
Come Caruso schiarisco la voce e intono un canto

Ohi Maria, ti amo
Ohi Maria, ti voglio
Ohi Maria, ti amo
Ohi Maria, ti voglio
La Maria, la Maria, la Maria

Maria che fa Giovanna di secondo nome
L'ho rivista l'altra estate presso la stazione
E con lei mi sono fatto la stagione
E più che un cuore di panna, era un cuore di can
Ma già sapevo che sarebbe finita presto
Non la fanno passare in dogana, e per Maria restare è un rischio
È ricercata dai pulotti e dai caramba
Ha pure dei casini con la guardia di finanza
Ma comunque sia, ho visto che qualche agente di polizia
Si fa le sue serate in compagnia di Maria
Una condanna, della mia vita il dramma
Perché non potrà essere io, Maria Giovanna e una capanna
Mi è rimasta solo una canzon, nel mio corazon
Le vacanze le farò in Giamaica, dalla mia Maria bella
Aspetto intanto voto Pannella e canto

E ascolt-a guardami se non ti fa ribrezzo, ti piaccio? Ti adoro 
Spaccio rime come primo lavoro e tengo incollato un microfono alla mano 
Sul palco molleggiato mi muovo come Adriano, come chi? Adriano Celentano 
E come dice lui stai lontano da me, ah ah attento 

Gli istinti non tengo e se velocità prendo, provando a seguirmi rischi un crampo 
Sei pronto ti tiro scemo, veloce come slaccio un reggiseno Cris-Cros 
Come da piccolino sulla saltafoss, a fare gare ad impennare sono un boss 
Beccati un po' di questo stile latino che fuma come un piatto di spaghetti pieno 
Ti devi lasciare tirare scemo come il Kinder, sono Bueno e ancora 
Scuoto la base ti faccio capire che posso volendo colpirti in pieno 
Se sei convinto hai vinto come al Totip il premio è questa hip 
Quello che voglio è vederti ballare con la leadership e beccati questo hip hop 
Ho finito il su la zip stop, disattivo il microchip BIP aspettando il riff
Articolo 31 e il microfono mi fumo e fino all'ultimo decibell, ti tiro scemo

Prima ringrazio e poi mi faccio spazio 
Dentro queste poche note nuove che mi danno il giusto andazzo 
Quindi grazie, merci beaucoup, abita via sono pronto per il club
Prendo la chiave universale per entrare nel tempo 
È il passepartout per andare su la su giù quaggiù
Mani lunghe sull pless 

In pieno business la giusta trama filo stesso fallo stesso non importa 
Cambio il nesso se m'è concesso questa volta ma è solo un caso ah ah

Sarà quella che non ha futuro e allora vola mia melodia 
Sali e scendi giro attorno saremo noi Solo Zippo e Articolo 31
A caccia di mosche sono armato di spray, velenoso il DDT finché lo sai 
Sai la parola d'ordine per passare di qui, scemo 

Ti tiro scemo e se rispondi scemo temo che sarai invitato a cena 
Se vuoi con noi poi trema brr un brivido per la schiena ti frena 
Per primo c'è spaghetti, da bere solo birra, meglio se Moretti 
Tutto a posto quindi grazie mio solo per conoscer 
Nell'intimità del mio confortevole pieno terra avrò
Per sorpresa a te come mio prelibato dessert

Come Dean Martin jing-a jing-a-ling that's Amore 
Per questa fila di note sciolte che mi sconvolge a palla 
Questa qui è la tribù che sballa 
Sballa un po' sulla destra, sballa un po' pure sulla sinistra 
Basta che nelle vene non ti finisca niente 
Se vuoi lo sballo basto io, eppure io 
Quando il mio messaggio invio, unito al mio ti tiro scemo 
All' improvviso come il mostro di Loch Ness, come Kevin Costner 
Se ti guardi quattro volte balla coi lupi ascoltando un LP di Dalla e poi di Drupi
Caga questo mix e sta sicuro che non ti sciupi

Ed adesso barman riempimi il bicchiere metti qualcosa di tranquillo poi vieni qui a parlare, tanto già lo so che hai già capito che mi è capitato, il tuo bancone ne ha sorrette di persone messe in questo stato, parlami degli amori che hai passato io ti parlerò del mio che è appena nato.

Ok, ora metti che ha queste frecce veramente questo Cupido che le tira, ecco ha sbagliato mira, ha colpito me e lei no, lei questa notte dorme con qualcuno che non so e io non dormirò, succede o almeno dicono, in un film lo troverebbero poetico romantico una cotta a senso unico, io mi vedo comico e rido di emozioni senza traettoria guardando lei dispedersi nell'aria. 
Ora veniamo a noi signora che mi giri in testa, che ieri sera sei uscita col mio cuore in tasca labbra rosse di rubino il mio ricordo mentre bevo vino il mio compagno di San Valentino. Sei la regina di un ignaro re fra gli uomini, mia privata fantasia lascia che ti esamini, occuperei la lingua mia in approfondite indagini, impartirei il tuo corpo che nemmeno immagini, ma l'aria è di tutti e di nessuno, possa respirarla e sporcarla con del fumo e ti respiro anche quando tiro dalla mia Marlboro soffiando gioco a fare anelli con i tuoi capelli d'oro, dura messo male da paura barman dammi tu la cura stasera sono fuori gara, brindiamo alla memoria di una storia senza gloria una febbre d'amore necessaria come aria",Aria,1998
Articolo 31,"Eri la più carina un'eterna miss liceo
Il trofeo per il torneo dei romeo
Che dietro di te facevano corteo
E tu sfruttavi tutti senza scrupoli
Indossavi uomini come abiti
Con la tua bellezza li rendevi deboli
Servili ed arrendevoli
Poi quando ti stancavi li buttavi
Tipo straccio vecchio
Dei loro sentimenti non ti curavi e amavi
Solo la persona riflessa nel tuo specchio
Così sei cresciuta giudicando tutto dall'aspetto
Pensando che la confezione centri con la qualità del prodotto
In base a questo hai scelto i tuoi amici
Persino il tuo compagno, era bello
Quindi era degno di far parte del regno
D'apparenza di cui in testa tu avevi il disegno
Era come un sogno vi sposaste a giugno
A settembre ti mostrò il suo pugno
Dimmi ora come ci si sente ad essere insultata ignorata
A essere picchiata da una mano ubriaca
Ora che anche il tuo specchio non ti vuole più vedere
Ora che la tua bellezza sta nel fondo di un bicchiere
Dimmi come ci si sente

How does it feel? Dimmi come ci sente
How does it feel? A stare sempre da sola

Tu volevi chiudere tutti i diversi fuori
Su questo hai investito tutte le energie e i tuoi averi
Ricordo il tuo concetto di straniero
Dicevi questo non è il posto loro son maleducati sporchi
Ci portan via lavoro
Difendevi la tua ottusità come un tesoro
Quello il tuo sentiero che non ti ha portato a sentire
Che il terreno su cui ogni giorno camminiamo noi non lo possediamo lo occupiamo
E non è italiano africano
è un dono che è stato fatto ad ogni essere umano
I confini le barriere le bandiere sono giunti dopo
Aiutando l'odio la guerra e il razzismo a fare il loro gioco
Dimmi come ti senti ora che non ci sono più confini
E le frontiere sono aperte
E che hai dovuto appendere al chiodo la tua camicia verde
La bandiera più non serve
Ora che hai speso tutto e sei ridotta all'elemosina
Finalmente sai che non c'è colore razza ma solo anima
Ora tu sei l'emarginata evitata scalciata ignorata
Quando chiedi qualche moneta
Ora che non hai più una proprietà che ti dia un identità
Sventoli soltanto la bandiera della povertà

Tu vivevi in un mondo a parte fatto di tasche piene
E di porte aperte ma eri insoddisfatta della vita
E delle tue spalle coperte
Non avevi mai lavorato per mangiare
Lo stesso avevi tutto quello che si può desiderare
Giravi declamandoti infelice a gran voce
Io ti dicevo che eri fortunata ma non ti davi pace
Il tuo dramma era scoprire chi eri
Ma quello è il dramma di ogni uomo
Ed è più facile soffermarcisi sopra a stomaco pieno
Non immaginavi quanto scotta
E come è dura portarsi a casa la pagnotta
Ora lo sai dopo che il papi ha fatto bancarotta
Avevi il meglio ma non lo hai apprezzato
Perché non possiedi niente se niente ti sei guadagnato
E dimmi come ci si sente ora che devi sudarti i beni materiali
Vedi che hai poco spazio per i problemi esistenziali 
ora che sei una parte del mondo che ignoravi 
sei diventata una di quelle pietre che scalciavi

Articolo 31,"O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché io devo mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto
E non così
Sono in preda ad una psicosi
Rischio una nevrosi
Mami
Non posso continuare questo andazzo da funky-gigolò
Ogni giorno sul mio palco recita lo stesso show
Di pupe a gogò
Cristallo e Pinot
Dolce vita però
Spesso in stile Peppino e Totò
Le mie ex dicono che sono
Un bastardo bugiardo ma io gioco d'azzardo
La mia vita è un casinò
Ogni sera nel night di King Mauri
Con i ragazzi della banda
Cospirando manco si trattasse di una rapa in banca
Per cacciar la bimba da portare in branda
Seppur la compagnia di pupe non ci manca
Trattasi di avventuriere straniere
Amori che si rivelano chimere
Le puoi vedere sparire
Alla luce del mattino come un sogno
Adesso basta! ora so di che ho bisogno
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché io devo mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Prima o poi io devo metterla 'sta testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Magari una che mi contraddica
Qualsiasi cosa dica
Che non mi faccia uscire con gli amici
E poi mi porti al cinema
Io, lei ed una sua amica
Che mi ripeta
Che sono disordinato
Che mi chieda
Se ho bevuto
Che quando sono affamato
Sia a dieta
Che non mi creda
Se sono sincero
E se mente lei
Pretende
Che me la beva
Che mi telefona mentre sto lavorando
E se le dico che al momento
Sono occupato ti richiamo
Quando la chiamo dice che non l'amo
E fa l'offesa
Che abbia la pretesa
Che ogni giorno le faccia una sorpresa
Sììì
Mi ci vuole un pò di disciplina
Che mi obblighi a svegliarmi presto la mattina
Che mi faccia stare un'ora a esaminare una vetrina
Che quando danno un filmone in tv inviti gente a cena
Che mi svegli per chiedermi se sto dormendo
Che tenti di cambiarmi
E poi mi accusi di stare cambiando
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché io devo mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché io devo mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto
In fondo la mia vita non è poi malaccio
Con i casini che faccio e i guai in cui mi caccio
So che non è serio cambiare ogni sera
Ma preferisco un'overdose di libertà che una dose di galera
Cattivo coi nemici con le bimbe un agnellino
Ho più pupe io del gangster di Chicago
Perfino al bar del Giambellino
Dicevan che ero un mago mi chiamavan Drago
Mò aspetta che ti spiego
Forse la fidanzata non mi serve come prima ti dicevo
Continuerò a fare zig-zag
Tra soubrette e vedette e tete-a-tete
Con ballerine di
Tip-tap
Ad essere infantile
Ma con stile
Fidanzare me è un'ingiustizia
Per la popolazione femminile
Quindi una alla volta
Avanti c'è posto
Questo è il modo che mi dà più gusto
Quindi è quello giusto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Così le faccio mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché sto già vivendo in un modo giusto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Nessuno mi fa mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché per uno come me è questo il modo giusto

essendo incredulo escogito corteggiamenti intimi senza poter sembrare frivolo, quindi m'incarico del 
mio sabotage!

mia con me non sarò tranquillo, fammi uno squillo chiamami, se sto sognando svegliami, se sono 
sveglio sognami, adesso spogliati, della tua lingerie ne faccio un puzzle tarro colpi di grease sfiorando

tessere con le rime ragnatele come i ragni, sbollettare i taccagni, preoccuparmi a tempo pieno dei 
miei guadagni, conquistare più cuori che terre Carlo Magno, nel pericolo soccorrere celere un mio 
compagno, sogno di avere il mercato discografico in pugno, trovare il tesoro più ambito dentro uno 
scrigno, temuto da M.C. gracili come un per mingherlino Louis Ferrigno, saggio come per Chiasciani il

Articolo 31,"I rumori di questa città oggi si fanno musica, la normalità a volte in una sfumatura magica e certamente era sempre davanti alla mia faccia, solamente prima era trasparente ora è consistente, ma non so che consiste, la mia esperienza non lo definisce, la mia mente non ci riesce e inconfudabilmente esiste, altro non m'interessa, ora che un cavaliere senza re ha in bocca il sapore di una principessa e non è roba di passioni e amore, è una pallina da ping-pong, e cuore e testa sono i giocatori. Pensiero senza guida e senza forma, lo lascio libero di andare ed è per questo ritorna. 
E non so 'cause'è, so che è volato dappertutto come i tuoi vestiti ieri sera prima di buttarsi a letto, eppure era quello il loro giusto ordine, piacevolmente perdersi in un turbine, che sia l'inizio oppure il termine. La mia sorpresa nel tuo sguardo in quell'invito, da una manciata d'ore è nato un pezzo d'infinito. L'estensione del tempo è relativa, señorita, è stata roba di una sera, per una falena un amore di un'intera vita, alta come le frequenze del mio twiter. Tu starai in quel cubo con il tubo ed io in questo cono con il wufer. Vivrò amore nomade perchè ho un cuore zingaro, in un libro con un nuovo capitolo, in bilico fra pericolo e miracolo. 
Non è un bluff se sto puntando forte 'sto poker con la sorte, oggi see'ho buone carte. Ogni sbattimento è sinonimo di vitalità, felicità, chissà sarà un caso, come la tua bellezza che è sinonimo di arte, la testa a parte, un viaggio bello stavolta, a briglia sciolta.

Io sono il frutto di una strana mutazione che sconvolge a ritmo la composizione di ogni mio gene. 
Sopra la cassa passa ogni pulsazione, sul campione si edifica il mio DNA mattone per mattone, affina 
la mia tecnica sparando la mia anima attraverso merda e poesia, è questione di bioritmica a rendermi 
diverso immerso nella disciplina che ho studiato, imparato e adesso fatto mia, sono tornato, rinato, 
uguale e cambiato, angelo beato e demonio reincarnato, artista arrivato e buffone alcolizzato, bagnato 
di un successo meritato, rubato in quanto fortunato, riuscito fallito, la folla mi resuscita come in un antico 
rito, TIPA, mò molla il colpo perché il funk t'abbozzo è tornato in città ci sta il mio barba DJ Jed-funky 
nano sul fay, J.Ax sul might spaghetti funky nel fight e la spaghetti funk con il pas pec stage e see'è che 
see'è la voglia e see'è che see'è la storia e see'è che, che che se nevica sono giorni di fuoco e non solo di 
gloria, io rappresento per l'infame quello che per un computer rappresenta un virus, il microfono 
rappresenta per me quello che la coperta rappresenta per Linus, il risultato rappresenta ciò che per un 
mago rappresenta un ocus focus, e tutto è ben studiato e ben documentato come un articolo su focus, 
quindi passa a me, diffida dalle imitazioni, le ali sulle scene e mani strette sui coglioni, dove trovi i 
campioni sukeroni infamoni, io so solo che un purosangue non fa gare coi pony, senza rivali in quanto 
non è una sfida, ma è la vita che decide quanto vali e come peli see'ho più stili che Jack vinili, che 
Ferrara chili, che una ragnatela fili, che un treno sedili, che un burrito chily e adesso passo da uno stile 
spesso ad uno ancor più grasso quindi non m'abbasso a fare gare con M.C. sottili, Articolo 31 ancora 
domina il party a caccia del mio tempo prima che sia troppo tardi, con le mani per aria aiuta questa 
mia storia e il mio concetto di festa è una distanza che s'accorcia. Sballa, strippa, salta su spaghetti 
funk la kru nel funky rendez-vous, stimolante per lei tipo HATU e l'M.C. pollo cuoce sopra il funky 
barbecue, e questo funky è tranqi quando è tranqi il sottoscritto, zitto o lo faccio così peso che ti ci 
schiaccio sotto, se scatta il bit del funk t'abbozzo non see'è cazzo che tenga questo andazzo tira in 
mezzo, se il mio DJ sopra il piatto, sta faccenda lascia che ti prenda e che ci prenda a vicenda, lascia 
che qualcuno s'offenda e che qualcuno lo ritenga una leggenda, ma spaghetti funk a palla vai bella 
shakera il culetto tipa, ora di nuovo in vita; 

Rit. 

Qui non è questione di incontrare il gusto delle masse, ormai non è tanto questione di stile, ma è 
questione di classe, è essere diverso da ogni produzione che si fa nella penisola italica, diverso nella 
musica, originalità prima qualità regola per essere evidente contemporaneamente in due realtà, senti 
qua un italiano per quanto in tecnica capace di tradurre la capacità dello statunitense rapper sarà 
sempre un blues contro un poker, chi se ne frega si essere Zucchero se see'è Jajjo Cocker, DJ Jad 
attacca il cavo, manda il ritmo di gusto lo schiavo, scatta il funk pure se il senso è Lady Patty Bravo, 
rispettando le radici mischi i frutti di una nuova botanica la chiamo spaghetti funk t'assicuro è roba 
inedita, per il 98 risorto mi davano per morto, ma il film che ti porto è un altro colossal del Festival 
formato in corto, nessuna scorciatoia anzi creare quello che non see'è mai stato è come rendere 
credibile l'incredibile, dimostrare realizzabile l'utopia, via dalla mia corsia, sono in sorpasso perenne, 
alza le antenne, arrivo al 4° disco con più notizie della C.N.N., con la strofa che spacca la base che 
spacca qualsiasi bla-bla prende il volo, se stai con noi se ti va, se non ti va schippa e vaffanculo;

Tutti a casa mia prima di cena overdose di doccia schiuma

Siamo il riflesso del colore che ti abbaglierà

Faccio giochi di prestigio come Tony Binarelli 
Mi sento fortunato manco si stato baciato dalla Dea bendata Nancy Brilli 
Tentano di inquadrarmi tutti i giorni

Ciao a tutti da Lella Smolleri 
Benvenuti alla terza puntata di musica per crescere
Musica per crescere è un contenitore di costume e nuove tendenze giovanili 
Lo sapete bene ormai gentilmente offerto a voi da Radio Babbo 
Con il patronato dell' associazione BRIPPI
Babbi Recidivi Pignoli Paurosi Italiani
Questa sera tratteremo il problema troppo spesso sottovalutato dei messaggi 
Che tutti I giorni I ragazzi ricevono dalla""Robbaccia Rap"" che infetta 
Uhu in misura sempre maggiore il panorama musicale del nostro bel paese 
Ma attenzione le forza per bloccare questa orda di barbari sono già all'opera 
Pensate che alcuni di loro addirittura pretendono di esprimersi al di fuori di ogni canone 
Senza censure persino al di fuori del ""politicamente corretto"" 
Ma cominciamo subito parlando con uno degli interessati più in vista 
Forse il peggiore di loro dovremmo avere in linea

J-ax
E stasera come preservativo uso il Domopak
Lella vieni qui che ti spezzo in due come un Kit-Kat
Chi cazzo dice che bisogna fare tutta la sequenza
Corteggiamento classico con 50 per la benza
Due gambe per la cena più la mancia
40 per la disco se la bimba danza
60 per la ganja
Metti un po' d'alcool in pancia
Spendi mezzo palo senza sicurezza di mangiare la pietanza
Accorciamo la distanza
La vita è breve quindi resta giù a 90
Spalanca finché c'è sperma c'è speranza
M'arrappi come a Michael Jackson
Una foto che ritrae nudi gli Hanson
O una capra squartata Marilyn Manson
Io in realtà sono educato ho anche usato
Un barboncino bianco per pulirmi dopo che t'ho cagato nel prato
Jad dammi 4 note per queste signore
E che le mia palle siano vuote entro un paio d'ore
Ragiono con il cazzo e ora ce l'ho duro e in futuro
Con un po' di merda scriverò sopra il tuo muro

Cattivo gusto perché ti do
Storie emanate perché
Malato è il tempo che vivo
Quindi descrivo
Perché 'sto tempo è anche mio e io
Prima del grande addio ne rido
Cattivo gusto perché vivo
Storie emanate perché
Malato è il tempo che vivo
Quindi descrivo

Credi non è che c'ho un bastone dentro ai baggy
È l'effetto che mi fai quando mi preghi
Di darti pizzicotti mentre tu ti sfreghi
O che ti leghi al lampadario per I piedi
Frustandoti dove ti siedi
Tesoro t'adoro da quando godi solo di culo
Per questo ho ricamato sui miei genitali le tue iniziali usando ago e filo
Mi son tatuato sul braccio il nome di tua sorella
E il tuo me lo sono marchiato a fuoco sulla cappella
Io sono così non sono mai alla moda ma riesco a essere in
Alla Soda mischio col gin e cin-cin
Brindiamo alla topa alle gare di rutto al sesso di gruppo
Quelle che fanno di tutto di brutto fino a che sei distrutto

Ma ti sembra un buon esempio scusami da dare a chi ascolta 
Trovo offensivo questo tipo di turpiloquio 
Sia per il nostro pubblico che per la gente a casa 
Esigo immediatamente un chiarimento 
Ma per piacere un po' di decenza
Ma vai a fare in culo zoccola io ho

Cattivo gusto perché ti do
Storie emanate perché
Malato è il tempo che vivo
Quindi descrivo
Perché 'sto tempo è anche mio e io
Prima del grande addio ne rido

Un momento abbiamo una domanda dalla regia 
Niente po-po di meno che Ipocrito corretti 
Colonna storica di Radio Babbo ora nostro programmatore capo 
Nonché presidente del comitato di censura brani che non hanno la rima Cuore-Amore 
Ipocrito ci sei?
Sì forte e chiaro buonasera Lella e un caldo abbraccio 
Al nostro mansueto e dolcemente addomesticato pubblico veniamo ora a quel 
Quel cretino che abbiamo in collegamento senti DJ Ax
J-ax michione
Ah sì va bene J-Ax la stessa cosa 
Ti sembra giusto l'atteggiamento che hai verso Radio Babbo 
In fondo anche noi abbiamo il merito di avere diffuso la vostra musica 
Ai tempi non so se ti ricordi Ax ti ricordi?

Perché tu pensi di avermi comprato
Il giorno che mi hai passato
Quando era il momento di andare oltre tu m'hai censurato
Non è che sei un'infame è che a te conviene
Mentre il mondo va a puttane far cantare che tutto va bene
Io ho rischiato
Tu sei così un cane che per te un albero di Natale è un cesso illuminato
Quindi ti offendo
Perché tu sei una merda senza creatività
E nel frattempo ti preparo uno scherzo che di fisso avrà

Cattivo gusto perché ti do
Storie emanate perché
Malato è il tempo che vivo
Quindi descrivo
Perché 'sto tempo è anche mio e io
Prima del grande addio ne rido

Dall’effetto di cento libra di viagra le piace il woofer perché vibra suo padre è un musicista 
Hard rock, o così crede da quando prese quell’acido a woodstock conobbe la mamma 
Sull’adriatico, anni di voghiera, ma cantava in una balera a cesenatico strane combinazioni di 
Ormoni la spingono a ginocchioni di fronte ogni paio di pantaloni lei è Jusy quando è seduta 
Vibrano i maschietti, sbavano, assieme a lei le signorine cantano

Sono una donna facile, stasera mi sento accessibile 
E se tu sei come me, di maschi ti fai buffet, canta sono una donna facile

Ora spostiamo l’attenzione sul soggetto, Jusy sul maschietto fa un effetto carboni fusi accetto 
Che si scusi quanto lei ne abusi ma sai quando lascia poveri illusi con cuori contusi a sedicianni 
Era amata da ogni suo coetaneo, usciva solo con chi la superava ad un egenio: uno con del 
Contante, la patente: dalle un sedile ribaltabile lei nel suo ambiente, ehm
Ora vuole tutto, lusso divertimento, come le altre showgirls, la differrenza è che lei ha talento 
Cavalca il tempo con tacco al piede, grazie alla filosofia che ogni giorno ripete: sono una donna 
Del mio tempo e non lo nascondo, sotto la gonna so che tengo la chiave del mondo così la terra 
Gira, tutto si ispira alla lira, quindi si arrampicherà su una pila di centomila uomini in fila donna 
Facile si, perché così la vuoi te, è la tua funkydrive e a tutti dice che
 
Sono una donna facile, stasera mi sento accessibile 
E se tu sei come me, di maschi ti fai buffet, canta sono una donna facile 
Sono una donna facile, stasera mi sento accessibile

Oh, non avanziamo lamenti, qui non ci sono occhi attenti per talenti che non si levano 
Indumenti se crei la donna oggetto come poi pretendi abbia sentimenti quindi se la vedi 
Dimagrire non è un’impressione, è che a fine mese porta il silicone a far la revisione non è che 
Cambia spesso ragazzo, è che ha molti amici, il suo ragazzo fa il paparazzo crede nella famiglia 
Ama stare in cucina, ma se sorrisi e canzoni tv le da la copertina cerca l’amore romantico 
Il resto non le importa ma con un diamante ti da una notte che non si scorda non si spoglia nuda 
In pubblico perché è volgare, poi sul giornale puoi vederle usare come tanga un filo interdentale 
Ballare guancia a guancia con un industriale, parlare tipo santa del nucleo familiare divorziare 
Alla partenza del viaggio nuziale, poi baciare su una apnda il massaggiatore della nazionale a noi 
Non resta che guardare la sua foto da sogno, poi sognarla cantare, andandosi a chiudere in bagno

Sono una donna facile, stasera mi sento accessibile 
E se tu sei come me, di maschi ti fai buffet, canta sono una donna facile 
Sono una donna facile, stasera mi sento accessibile 
E se tu sei come me, di maschi ti fai buffet, canta sono una donna facile",Donna Faci Le,1999
Articolo 31,"Manu vive in una gabbia di palazzi, quelli senza fiori sui terrazzi, dove tazze e sguazzi in infranto al lazzi e smazzi, dove la speranza è al capolinea come i mezzi e infatti Manu, sta chiuso in casa come per nascondersi mentre la tele vuole vendergli una vita che non può permettersi. Pensa a un pacco da consegnare, a cosa ci avrebbe da perdere se tutto va male, pensa a una ragazza amata in primavera che ora muore prigioniera di una pera, pensa a una preghiera, sua madre che la recita ogni sera mentre invecchia, e guarda la pistola sulle sue ginocchia. 
Suo padre odiava il suo padrone, ma lui è di una generazione che al padrone non riesce a dare un nome, ora in mano see' ha un cannone che non aspetta, sta uscendo, cerca vendetta in fretta e sta pensando: 
NON MI PARLATE ANCORA NON VI ASCOLTO, ALTRE PROMESSE FALSE NON LE SENTO, DA OGGI IO VIVRO' OGNI SECONDO FINO IN FONDO. 
IO LO SCONFIGGERO' QUESTO MIO TEMPO, SE MI SARAI DAVANTI IO TI SFONDO, DI VITA QUESTA HO QUINDI CI CREDERO' FINO IN FONDO. 
Contro ogni sogni impossibili di predicatori non credibili, fonti poco attendibili, segnali poco udibili, deboli, muri infrangibili, segni tangibili di circuiti invisibili di cui noi siamo i fusibili. Ogni tanto uno fonde come fonde ora Chiara mentre suo padre urla e la sta picchiando ancora, a 16 anni una valigia fatta in fretta una città grigia che l' aspetta e la rabbia che le pigia in testa. 
Vive una favola tragica dove papà è un' orco, tranne la domenica che see' è il calcio e le sembra morto, è stanca, è sola, la musica non basta, a scuola dice bugie per proteggere una bestia, lividi che lasciano furie e umiliazioni, i vicini sentono ma alzano il volume della televisione. Papà ora è tranquillo, dorme ubriaco, sta russando, Chiara ha un coltello e sta pensando: 
NON MI PARLATE ANCORA NON VI ASCOLTO, ALTRE PROMESSE FALSE NON LE SENTO, DA OGGI IO VIVRO' OGNI SECONDO FINO IN FONDO. 
IO LO SCONFIGGERO' QUESTO MIO TEMPO, SE MI SARAI DAVANTI IO TI 
SFONDO, DI VITA QUESTA HO QUINDI CI CREDERO' FINO IN FONDO. 
Me li ricordo come elefanti parlanti dirmi di valori edificanti e di lavori qualificanti e poi darmi delusioni puntuali, unti, arroganti, dentro i ristoranti con sorrisi smaglianti ma una coscienza da maiali, pronti a giurare sull' ennesima bugia presi da fobia perché sempre più spesso i Davide ammazzano i Golia, che sia pazzia che ci travolga io resto fuori e sto gridando alla sua porta: 
NON MI PARLATE ANCORA NON VI ASCOLTO, ALTRE PROMESSE FALSE NON LE SENTO, DA OGGI IO VIVRO' OGNI SECONDO FINO IN FONDO.

La sera quando vai al bar, non ordinare un liquore qualsiasi, ordinane dieci. Quando il tuo senso dell'equilibrio comincia a cedere recati pure all'adiacente parchetto dove troverai simpatici cittadini che per poche migliaia di lire ti forniranno di simpatici additivi per farcire le tue cartine.

Hai mai provato ad andare al luna park fuori con stimolatori, amplificatori di luci e colori. 
Ecco io vivo così, forse mami m'ha tagliato l'omogeneizzato con l'LSD, ma ci si abitua a tutto, spesso chi ti dice di star sobri e chi si caga addosso composi nudo artistico in copertina su Five con Chonky, Bonny e Clide, ma che attizzata non sai, organizziamo un convention ad altezza d'uomo di cantanti buonisti, proibizionisti, predicatori. Giochiamo a Carmageddon. Io sono l'uomo che al volante li schiaccia come pomodori. Per quelli come me il mondo è una sala giochi. Sei neuroni fossero gettoni ne ho ancora pochi.

Dall'inizio ogni mio sfizio è soddisfatto in pieno in quanto per il mio piacere viver bene mi ci butto a capo fitto. Non è che me ne fotto, ma mi diverto una sacco se riesco a giocare su ogni cosa che faccio, babbo, noi viviamo in un parco giochi dove non esiste il pagliaccio. Per il resto assaggio e sorseggio ogni qualsiasi bevanda che passa il convento e peggio che io sono fusa senza un reale motivo di fondo, ma soprattutto senza volerlo. Bello, rollaci sto zucchero filato al caramello che è meglio e ringrazio dio se domani mi ripiglio e mi sveglio. Sveglia, scempio dentro il luna park dove la sera si sclera.

Articolo 31,"Ti darò tutti i sogni che ho, la luce del mio show 
Qui c'è un tre con un uno a destra, un articolo a sinistra
Un passo steso con strano e una dedica a chi che 
Pensa il motivo per cui io continuo 
Ti darò tutti I sogni che ho
La luce del mio show dentro i tuoi occhi mi mostra il cammino 
Pensa il motivo per cui io continuo 
Otto ore a freddo aperto ad un cancello chiuso a sperare che il concerto sia macello peso 
Lo è se gridi la mia foto nella smemo con i sogni che ci scrivi 
Funziona come un chilo di antidepressivi 
Mi dona un silo di motivi e allora fino a che tu arrivi il mio profilo 
Resta per i giorni successivi, non vivo dove vivi, ci sono nato
Provo a mantenere quello che promisi quando ho cominciato 
Anche quando tutto sembra sì, risi, sotto imprevisti 
Rischi l' ho visti, moralisti, attacchi misti, da meschinità quotidiane
Inobiettà mondane, falsità, bugie e catrame tra i vampiri che hanno fame non mi ha dato il marcio 
Mi va stretto e per questo non cambio a costo di sembrare il pazzo sempre fuori sede
Bugiardo non succede, con la mia fede da marciapiede, finché c'è gente che ci crede 

Ti darò tutti i sogni che ho 
La luce del mio show dentro i tuoi occhi mi mostra il cammino 
Pensa il motivo per cui io continuo, se il mio coraggio cade tu mi sai dare fede
Se riuscirò sempre vivrò ringraziando il cielo 
Ti darò tutti i sogni che ho
La luce del mio show dentro i tuoi occhi mi mostra il cammino 
Come una scossa chimica aumenta la potenza della performance 
Girala come vuoi dammi energia selvatica non faccio predica ma metto in pratica
Connetto musica, effetto lamina taglia questa realtà a metà tra chi va e chi sta
Dimezza la mia età, affetta l'obiettà, qua non è l'America: nessuno dà niente per niente
In guerra dolente o volente, un 31 come scudo da sempre 
Per tutti quelli che ci seguono in questo assurdo rally, per la mia gente 
Come dicono I Gemelli una corda fraterna tra me 
E chi per strada mi ferma per una firma mi dona una nuova forma: 
È l' arma di potere parlare a tutti, ma io non do consigli 
Falsi predicatori ne ho sgamati troppi, la forma di una rivincita
La forza di esserne capaci, rappresentarci al vero, per i miei seguaci 
Ti darò tutti i sogni che ho
La luce del mio show dentro i tuoi occhi mi mostra il cammino
Pensa il motivo per cui io continuo 
Tu che lanci regali sul palco e salti se dico di farlo 
Tanto che a volte spero di meritarlo, è tutta tua la musica che mando in giro 
La vita mia, l'ossigeno del mio respiro, per te io sparo a zero
Con la biro miro e tiro a ogni falsario, mi fai ricco non in senso monetario:
Ricco dentro, tanto per andare contro a uno a cento
Tu sei il motivo per cui tutto questo ha senso 
Lui mi ha portato qui, volevo vivere così
Di sogni chiusi in un cassetto oggi non ne ho più 
Mille e più lettere ma non per dirmi addio
Rimani affianco a me e il mio percorso sarà tuo 
Ti darò tutti i sogni che ho 
La luce del mio show dentro i tuoi occhi mi mostra il cammino
Pensa il motivo per cui io continuo, se il mio coraggio cade tu mi sai dare fede
Se riuscirò sempre vivrò ringraziando il cielo 
Ti darò tutti i sogni che ho 
La luce del mio show dentro i tuoi occhi mi mostra il cammino

Ma tutto questo è solo un mezzo per raggiungerti
E della fama esiste il prezzo non confonderti
Non preoccuparti è solo il party che continua

Coraggio di investire su una vita senza garanzie

Ma un mutante volante brigante arrogante
Che lascia il microfono sanguinante
Sempre a cavallo di una hit

Un bacio come colazione che mi rende balbuziente
E la mia reputazione ne risente
Sarà per questo sorriso da beota
Che si dice che sono partito a ruota
Perché non cammino più volo a bassa quota
Prima ero sempre in nota
Chiamato lingua loca
Ora dove vado con 'sta faccia da idiota
Sono in delirio primordiale
E vederla ballare mi può incasinare l'equilibrio ormonale
Ma la musica è questa e non si ferma
Batti interna esterna si alterna eterna
Tu sei la mia conferma
Sa signorina se lei ne vuole ho le parole
Con un metro d'aria sotto le suole

Baila guapa loca, no me hace falta otra
Si te miro salgo del mundo
Dona vida y colora mi sueño
Baila guapa loca, el siglo esta a tus pies
Odio y rabia son solo pasado
Dame música y creé en mi sueño

Dopo il bla bla bla del non leghiamoci troppo
Tu mi stai addosso come un giubbotto
Io appiccicato come un cerotto senti il botto
Io sono un petardo
Un miliardo di anni in ritardo
Su cose che prima vedevo soltanto
Adesso guardo a passo da un infarto
Non posso evitarlo ho fisso il traguardo
Con la tua faccia sulla bandiera
Da milano si viaggia fino alla spiaggia con sabbia di frontiera
Portami via subito non dubito di darti la vita
Se vuoi puoi farmi da medico mentre gioco questa partita
Frequenza dk sintonizzata
Per essere degno di chiamarti sueño di guenda
Dammi rimedio o pozioni contro l'ordinarietà
Un episodio ai confini di questa realtà
Sarà il colore di ogni mio disegno e il mio sostegno
Ed il mio regno impegno

Baila guapa loca, no me hace falta otra
Si te miro salgo del mundo
Dona vida y colora mi sueño
Donde llega la playa, tus manos
Gaviotas de países lejanos, me cuentan tu historia
Por ti la guerra se para por toda la vida
Baila guapa loca, el siglo esta a tus pies
Odio y rabia son solo pasado
Dame música y creé en mi sueño

Baila guapa loca, no me hace falta otra
Si te miro salgo del mundo
Dona vida y colora mi sueño

Seguenti urbani invernali assumono
Sapori tropicali quando le tue mani i sensi miei consumano
Per quel tuo panorama che non si nomina
In queste fonti di nirvana dove ci guardiamo l'anima
Qui non si capisce
Sono bendato e sto attraversando fuori dalle striscie
Musica che cresce solo per lei
Che balla per strada con tutto il mondo che le fa da DJ

La filosofia del tuo maestro di yoga,

Faccio assordanti risate con gli amici al bar,

Guardarti accende un desiderio incontenibile
Come le gocce sul bicchiere quando ho sete ma
Io non so quanto giusto sia
Avvicinarmi e farti mia e poi andare in birreria
Io non ti porto mai a fare passeggiate
No, non ricordo anniversari e date
Dormo a metà le mie giornate
La vita quotidiana la improvviso sulla scena
Mi annoio a morte se mi porti con i tuoi fuori per cena
Non mi emoziono sugli yatch
Io colleziono Dylan Dog e

Mi piace farlo nei posti più disparati
E stare fumati a guardare cartoni animati
Fermarsi in un motel
Sulla via per la festa
E lì spalmarmi di sangria
A mo' di gel sulla cresta
Raccontarti ogni mio vizio segreto
Poi voglio portarti
Dove non esiste divieto
E le emozioni che senti creano vortici immensi è la spirare ovale dei sensi
Se pensi di prendermi così

Ti porterò a ballare 
Dove potrai gridare, saremo io e te
Nella spirale ovale
Lì, lì ti potrò mostrare 
Cosa vuol dire osare 
Saremo vivi e nudi
Nella spirale ovale

Guardarti accende un desiderio incontenibile
Ma non sopporto chi non ride
Specialmente le tue amiche
Dalla chiappa stretta e la griffe sulla borsetta
E chi comunque vive in linea retta e sa sempre quello che lo aspetta
Io invece adoro stare al centro del ciclone
Mi nutro di immaginazione musica alta a colazione
Come una spirale di colore che girando mi protegge
Vivendo un po' fuori dal gregge
A volte quasi della legge

Forse a tua mamma piacerà, seh
Ma tuo papà non capirà che 
Non prometto che ti sposo e un sicuro futuro 
Ma un letto senza riposo
Mattine a muso duro 
Né villetta né camino
Ma rimani stretta qui vicino e metto a fuco il mondo con un accendino

Prendimi così
Ti porterò a ballare 
Dove potrai gridare, saremo io e te
Nella spirale ovale
Lì, lì ti potrò mostrare 
Cosa vuol dire osare 
Saremo vivi e nudi
Nella spirale ovale

Non noto la pettinatura ed il vestito
Ma muoio per il tuo sorriso
E per il tuo frutto proibito che 
Guardare accende un desiderio incontenibile
Vorrei dirlo ma la bocca si asciuga
Adesso che sei tutta nuda ma
I tuoi capelli sono più belli se li sciogli 
Ed il vestito se lo togli, eh

La parte dei bacini e dei ti amo
La saltiamo
E facciamo saltare i bulloni a questo divano
Bruciamo come un vulcano
Le lingue fiumi in piena 
Sentirmi vivo
Con le tue unghie sulla schiena
Entrami nella pelle
E non si cade
Ti porto tra le stelle
La mia lingua è un astronave
E la spirale ovale gira più forte quando griderai
E lo farai, vedrai 

Prendimi così
Ti porterò a ballare 
Dove potrai gridare, saremo io e te

È che se ne infischia di destra o sinistra 
E mischia a mo di minestra una miscela mai vista 
Al giornalista che intervista rispondo alle domande 
Tanto questa musica leggera è pesante come un elefante 
Non ho mezza misura o stai vicino o stai distante 
Se la fischi scende dal palco e ti spezza le gambe 
Lasciatemi cantare sono italiano 
Sul terreno tra il Mediterraneo ed il Tirreno 
Con il suono alieno che fa 
A cazzotti con l’orchestra di Demo non va 
Da Pavarotti e nemmeno a San Remo 
Sotto influenze negative di cannabis attive 
Hey mamma, qui ci sono canzoni nocive 
Generazioni recidive, registrazioni proibite 
Mentre l’alcool e le sigarette legalmente uccide 
Veleno quotidiano ma facciamo finta che non fosse 
E ci chiediamo perché se accendiamo una jolla e fumiamo 
Un ministro ha la tosse….

Non te lo potevi aspettare potesse tornate 
Quella canzone popolare stava per affogare 
E invece torna tipo zombie costruisce ponti 
Se ti interessa definirla meglio che ascolti 
Qui non ci sono fessi solo brutti ceffi tutti messi 
A fare casse a pezzi come le tasse e i prezzi 
È musica dalla metodica caotica qui non si medita 
Io c’ho la palla fuori come edika 
Mutazione genetica della tradizione melodica 
Non è colonica ne americofonica chiamala comica 
Ironica ma se suona cronica nella scatola cranica 
È un asso nella manica e carica la forza delle braccia 
Se quest’Italia vale una medaglia siamo l’altra faccia 
Fegato stomaco cuore e istinto gomito a gomito 
Col rumore che vomito ora dimmi che ha vinto

Articolo 31,"Venerdì sera le nove dopo due giorni che piove 
L’acqua per strada l’inchiostro sul foglio lo stesso colore 
Guardando un quaderno di rime del ‘93 
C’era una foto di un pezzo s’un treno con davanti io e te 
E allora tanti perché dimenticati sono tornati amplificati 
E più complicati insistono su come e quando ci siamo lasciati 
Su perché oggi sento il blues dopo gli anni passati 
Giro la televisione corrida di idee banali

Tempo e non ha senso divagare penso a come mi facevi

Saranno solo rimorsi fumo e caffè 
E sarà ancora buoi la luna non cè 
Cara mia ex la luna non ce 

E guarda come un uomo matura senza premura 
Perde la misura poi giura scusa che valgono spazzatura 
Prende a pugni porte sveglia il vicinato 
Fa a botte con che era appena sgarbato 
La notte ti chiama ubriaco 
Ci vuoi fare il progetto di una vita 
Lui si fa trovare a letto con una tua amica 
Pensa solo a se stesso divide l’amore dal sesso 
Ha belle parole ma mantenere ciò che ha promesso 
Non gli è mai successo troppo egoista per un compromesso 
Così ero messo e adesso confesso ascoltando il tuo pezzo 
Preferito tra i miei dei miei vecchi dischi 
Bevo una birra che vorrei fosse whiskey 
Ho una cicatrice nel cuore con sopra il tuo nome 
Ma voglio che tu sia felice anni luce da questa canzone 
E dal male che ho fatto lui saprà curarti 
Mentre conto i miei errori realizzati tardi…

La luna si dice muove marea e cuore umano 
Invece non ne ho idea vivo a Milano il mare è lontano 
Quando uscivamo era diverso sempre luci intense 
Ora vedo opache insegne e pioggia di novembre 
…Mi manche guapa manca ogni litigata 
Manca il sapore di tornare e ritrovarti a casa 
L’odore di una maglietta prestata 
La tua voce che mi consola fare la pace in una 
Piazzola dell’autostrada 
E quante cose non dette micro vendette 
Appendi la mia foto al muro e gioca a freccette 
Sarà che infine maturo col delay 
Che le regine non scelgono i plebei 
Sarà che ti vorrei…
