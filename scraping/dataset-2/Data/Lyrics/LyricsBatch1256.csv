Vivian Green,"Oh free dom, oh free dom,
Oh free dom over me,
And bef ore I'll be a slave,
I'll be buried in my grave,
And go home to my Lord
And be free.

No more weeping

No more shooting

There'll be singing",Oh Freedom,2012
Vivian Green,"Yeah baby
You know you got it
Oh baby baby
You know I like it
Just how you do it

You got some kind of nerve
Ooh you're putting in all that work
How you gon' do me like that?
Who told you to use me like that?
Where did you come from, out the blue?
I wasn't even expecting you
But you got me coming right back
'Cause baby I need it like that
I can't see nobody else
Just you and me all by ourselves
And now that it's all said and done
I know that I got number one

And baby it's your love
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer
It's greater than anything out
And baby it's your touch
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer
It's greater than anything out
Anything out there, (Anything out there)
Anything out there, (Anything out there)
Anything out there, (Anything out there)
And baby it's your love
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer
It's greater than anything out

Ooh baby you go hard
You sure know how raise the bar
You're showing me all I deserve
You're bringing me heaven on earth
I'm giving you five stars for just being who you are
So there ain't no need to rehearse
Let's get straight to work
I don't want nobody else
Just you and me all by ourselves
And now that it's all said and done
I found number one

And baby it's your love
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer
It's greater than anything out
And baby it's your touch
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer
It's greater than anything out
Anything out there, (Anything out there)
Anything out there, (Anything out there)
Anything out there, (Anything out there)
And baby it's your love
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer
It's greater than anything out

Every time baby we make love
You pull me in deeper
I'll never get enough
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer, it's greater
Can't nobody compare to you
You make me a believer
Keep doing what you do
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer, it's greater

And baby it's your love
It's sweeter, it's better, it's finer

Vivian Green,"I guess I blamed myself
For our beautiful disaster
But when you’re young you do some stupid things
Not that you’re innocent in all this
Because you truly broke my heart
I was so out of control but you turned your back and kept your eyes closed

And so here we are
It would be the ultimate forgiveness
If we could put it all behind
Oh I don’t wanna get my hopes up high

I gotta have a little faith
Just a little, just a little, just a little
I gotta have a little faith
Just a little, just a little, just a little
I gotta have a little..

Said baby if we did this
It’d be the ultimate forgiveness
A little faith
Just a little , just a little, just a little

I can still see the look on your face
As I turned and walked away
It’s a image that I wish I could erase
The moment in time that means everything
And I wish that I could take it back
Wish that I could change it
Ain’t nobody ever had my heart that can replace you
So I’m hoping my wish will be granted
I’ll be the mother of second chances

And so here we are
It would be the ultimate forgiveness
If we could put it all behind
Oh I don’t wanna get my hopes up high

I gotta have a little faith
Just a little, just a little, just a little
I gotta have a little faith
Just a little, just a little, just a little
I gotta have a little..

And baby if we did this
It’d be the ultimate forgiveness
A little faith
Just a little, just a little, just a little

Turn back the hand of time
Make every wrong right
Forgive what we don’t understand
Just look ahead and try again
We were just too young, we messed it up
And there will never be another
And if I held you in my arms I swear I wouldn’t let go

Gotta have a little, have a little faith
Just a little, just a little, just a little
I gotta have a little faith
Just a little, just a little, just a little

Baby if we did this
It’d be the ultimate forgiveness
A little faith
Just a little, just a little, just a little (faith)

I guess I blamed myself
For our beautiful disaster
Just a little, just a little
If I had just a little faith",Faith,2012
Vivian Green,"Hold me tight 
This is a lonely night 
And I've hurt you baby 
Because you are my light 
Make me strong 
Just like you make me weak 
When your hands reach out for me 
Even in your sleep 

I'll soon be gone now 
Forever not yours 
It won't be long now 
Forever not yours 
Memories they keep coming through 
The good ones hurt more 
Than the bad ones do 
The days were high 

And the nights were deep 
And I miss you baby 
I miss you baby 
I'll soon be gone now 
Forever not yours

Vivian Green,"It’s just a little huddle, a little trouble
Nothing we can’t fix
It will build us up, even make us stronger
If we can get over it
Don’t even wanna think about it baby
The thought of you not being here
Is like the world coming to an end
And I know I just can’t handle it

Cause its light (cold light)
Tearin away a piece of me
And it’s like (like)
Telling me I can’t eat or sleep
And it’s like
Just like taking away the air I breathe
Didn’t come this far to lose it all
Didn’t make it up to heaven just to fall

Remember when we touched the stars
Remember
Remember when you stole my heart
Remember
Remember when I walked away
Remember
And you did everything to make me stay

Remember, I remember
Can’t let it fall apart
Didn’t come this far to lose it all
Didn’t make it up to heaven just to fall

So to be in heaven, there’s nothing better
It’s so nice up here
We worked pretty hard to get where we are
And I’m not about to cry no tears
Ain’t losing you over this
The thought, I just can’t take it
It’s like the world coming to an end
Losing my life, my love and my best friend

Cause its light
Tearin away a piece of me

Ain’t nobody love you like me baby
Yea nobody love me like you
So once that I get there
Up here in heaven
Can’t lose each other now

Vivian Green,"What you did to me this morning
Had me late for work I'm stressing
Missed my meeting all I'm thinking bout is you, you, you, you
And now I'm looking at the clock
Counting the hours 'til I'm back in your arms
Wish I never had to let you go

Time can't move fast enough
Until I, get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to, ooh

Stuck in transit off daydreaming
I miss you, there's so many reasons
Most of all I really wanna lay with you, and just feel your touch, babe
And now I'm looking at the clock
Counting the hours 'til I'm back in your arms

Get right back to, oh

Get right back to, ooh

Baby I'm addicted to every single part of you
But I swear this addiction is healthy
Serve me up another dose
Be ready babe I gotta go
Ooh, ooh, I
Wish I never had to let you go

I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for rainbow coloured weather

Vivian Lee,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

",Where Do You Start?,2004
Vivian Lord,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day

Vivian Reed,"Tonight I hold to nothing 
but the feelings in my soul
My heart overflows with emotion 
I just can't control
There's someone you are going to 
But tonight 
I just can't tell right from wrong

Let me be yours until tomorrow 
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Give me one night of your life
Just be mine 'til the dawn

Tomorrow the real world 
Will come crashing down on me
I know I must lose you and that's the way it has to be
But tonight I see no boundries
So I beg you before my chance is gone

Let me be yours until tomorrow 
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Give me one night of your life
So I can go on.

Till the dawn's intrusion 
Ends this sweet illusion
Make believe you're mine, love
This is not goodbye, love,
All I ask is one night, till the morning sunlight
Won't you stay here in my arms
And baby, let me be yours until tomorrow
Let me be yours until tomorrow.",Yours Until Tomorrow,1976

Vivian Stanshall,"They come to see the dungeons here
The tourists flock from far and near
They do the tower and try the beer

The picking pockets cost your life
And every jury has a price
They bring the kids and show the wife

It makes them proud to be around
And take their summer piccies
To drink at night in Soho bars
And end up feeling sickie
And we're all making money
Lovely money

Rubber necks with cash to burn
Export criminals return
They keep on coming, never learn

They fill their diaries page by page
And make it sound so thrilling
They're searching for the real thing
They're flushed and they are willing
And we're all making money
Lovely money

The victors of the opium wars
Now take their trips and open doors
They stand upon the actual floors
Actual floors, actual floors

It makes them proud to be around
And take their summer piccies
To drink at night in Soho bars
And end up feeling sickie

More money, more money
More money, more money

Now off you go, away you fly
We've had your money now goodbye
We fleeced you good we bled you dry

Viviane Greene,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way,2006

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

You taunt me
With memories

And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

Send back my love

Dédier à Kigali aux victimes de la haine...
Nomé j'y vais en jean sans cuir sans gène
T'avance les yeux vides la France elle te fatigue
direction Libreville ou Brazaville
Les horaires c'est l'horreur à Paris pas pareil

Finis donc ton assiette parlons de c'qui va bien
Regardes le temps qu'il fait s'emmerder y a pas moyens
Vraiment pas besoin d'te faire de soucis
Profiter d'la vie voilà un tour de magie

Viviane Villeneuve,"LA P'TITE LILIE


C'était un' gamin' de seize ans
Ayant perdu tous ses parents,
Une simple couturière
Sans toilette et sans manière,
Mais plus beaux que tous les trésors,
Elle avait de blonds cheveux d'or
Et des yeux bleus de mystère
Plus précieux encor...

REFRAIN

Trottinant gentiment le matin, le soir,
Il fallait la r'garder passer sur l'trottoir,
Toute jolie,
La p'tit' Lilie
Et chacun se disait devant ses grands yeux,
Où semblait se r'fléter tout l'azur des cieux :
C'est un ang' qui pass' dans la vie,
La p'tit' Lilie

Un beau jour sans penser à mal
Ell' fit connaissanc' dans un bal
D'un rôdeur de la barrière,
Ell' se donna toute entière.
Mais lui qu'aimait pas travailler
Il lui fit quitter l'atelier
En lui disant tu vas m'faire
Un meilleur métier.

Trottinant tristement quand venait le soir,
Il fallait la r'garder passer sur l'trottoir

Mais bientôt elle en eut assez
Alors ell' voulut se sauver
C'était l'heure où l'gaz s'allume
Il la suivit dans la brume.
Lâch'ment, comme un' brut' dans le dos,
Il lui planta son grand couteau,
Ell' tomba sur le bitume
Sans dire un seul mot

All through the day I wish away the time,

Qu’est-ce qu’elle me veut la miss avec ses yeux d’renard
Derrière la voilette du chapeau avec une plume d’autruche
Pour faire plus beau
Hey gratte-moi la puce que j’ai dans l’dos

Mais qu’est-ce que j’vois, qu’est-ce que j’peux faire qu’est-ce qu’elle est belle,
La p’tite lady déguisée comme un arc-en-ciel
Avec ses bottes en peau d’serpent, ses collants rose fluorescents
Sa mini-jupe en skaï et comme ça swingue sous son chandail

Il faut qu’j’lui dise que j’veux faire des bêtises
J’peux pas rester minable plus longtemps sans la brancher
Car elle a comme un p’tit chat sauvage dans les yeux
Qui ressemble à un tatouage que j’ai dans l’cœur
Y a pas d’erreur

Qu’est-ce que c’est fou, qu’est-ce que c’est chaud c’que tu dégages
Si j’te l’dis pas tout de suite j’aurais pas tes images 
Mais j’vais pas laisser passer l’train
Pour ce genre de voyage j’ai peur de rien
Hé Hé Hé qu’est-ce que tu bouges bien.

On dirait qu’le monde est à toi quand tu t’promènes
Sur ce quai d’gare, Cendrillon, tu marches comme une reine
Dans les yeux ces types qui trainent avec leurs blouses de fin d’semaine,
Et comme j’t’imagine aussi givrée qu’une mandarine.

J’vais pas t’laisser partir avec un légionnaire en perm
J’vais pas t’laisser séduire par le premier marin qui traîne 
J’vais pas t’laisser dormir tout seule si t’est libre ce week-end

Vivienne Segal,"I've been married, and married, and often I've sighed
""I'm never a bridesmaid, I'm always a bride""

I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart
Yet remember these sweet words, ""`till death do us part""

I married many men, a ton of them
Because I was untrue to none of them
Because I bumped off every one of them
To keep my love alive

Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
At night he was a horse's neck to me
So I performed an appendectomy
To keep my love alive

Sir Thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night
I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right

Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing
I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
And now he plays where harps are just the thing
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive

I thought Sir George had possibilities
But his flirtations made me ill at ease
And when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease
To keep my love alive

Sir Charles came from a sanitorium
And yelled for drinks in my emporium
I mixed one drink, he's in memorium
To keep my love alive

Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly

Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide,
He killed his dad and that was patricide
One night I stabbed him by my mattress-side

Vivienne Segal,"I know you,
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you,
That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know its true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if i know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once,like what you did once upon a dream.
Once upon a night,
I dreamed we'd be together
In love forever.
Once upon a night,
I was wishing for a never,
A never ending.

Once upon a time
Once upon a wish
Once upon a dream.",Finale,1951
Vivienne Segal,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

But I know, I know you'll be back, back for more
And the game, the game will go on as it was
Nothing's changed, we'll know when we're closer to love

[Chorus]
Aren't we desperate, aren't we afraid
We're just two lost and lonely people, scared to be alone again
Aren't we desperate, aren't we afraid

Can't you see that there are no victims, just volunteers
We won't change, we won't change until we face our fears
We're alone, even though we are together right now
Love remains, just out of reach somehow

I know we can make it, take up that look into my eyes
We'll take the future for you and I, yeah!

I had nothing to lose
I threw the top down, then pulled into town,

I met this guy, had a look in his eye, 
I swear he was saying to me

I want you to rock me, roll me, 
You won't get lonely
Come on and rock me, roll me, 
You oughta get to know me

It said, what are we waiting for?
Well guy, I'm sorry that we fooled around, 
I was looking for something more
Oh and he was shy, saying goodbye, 
He said ""I really will give you a call""
Do I have to explain you're driving me insane

Vixen,"Daddy didn't care, mama wasn't there, Jenny slammed the door to her heart
Packed a suitcase of anger, no one tried to save her
She headed for the city that shines in the dark

But the lights fade away, when you're young on the streets, without a friend
Jenny learned to survive, put a price on the nights that never end

She's hard 16, soft to the touch, but she's seen too much
She's hard 16, will her soul run dry by 17?

The face of innocence doesn't stand a chance
Between the losers, the takers, the lost
So Jenny never cried, locked her pain inside 
She's trapped in a time bomb ready to blow

There will come a day when the mirror reveals a total stranger
Another lonely runaway in a living hell

She's turning hard 16, soft to the touch, but she's seen too much
She's hard 16, will her soul run dry 

Jenny, please come home - please come home
You've got so much to give, so much life to live, so come home

She's hard 16, will her soul run dry - 16!

You think it's all rainbows and not any rain, but it doesn't work that way

Boy meets girl, better shelter our hearts
We trace the steps that a thousand lovers have danced before
Without a sound, we're face to face, and every breath is suspended in space

Holding back tonight, afraid of tomorrow
We both know something's got to give
Gotta make it soul to soul, so come a little closer

We're only a heart beat away, from laying it all on the line
We're only a heart beat away, it's just a matter of time
So tell me that you need me, an' I'll come runnin', baby can't you see
We're only a heart beat away
It's in the air, it's in our eyes, burning through every cool disguise
And pretending that we don't care pushes us closer to each other's fire

During the second song
He moved his mouth a little wrong
And his teeth fell out

And maybe sooner than you think""

Heads straight for the grocery store
Buys a razor and a bottle of pills

About being swallowed by the TV

Ah-hah, ahaha 
This is tripped out, tripped out 
I wonder what you look like? 
Haha, like dat like dat 
Well where you at? 
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? 
Buk buk!! 

You are the pain, that puts stress on my brain 
How do I refrain, from making you a bloodstain? 
Just a memory would suffice; it would be nice 
I would love to see your face, it would be tight 
Who are you? How old are you? How tall are you? 
What do you think of the daughter that wants to meet you? 
Do I have your smile and your eyes that have kept me strong? 
Will you ever be man enough to show your face; 
will you roll on the situation, a nation will rise 
no higher than this woman, a fatherless child 
Let me ask you some'in: is that you asleep on the sidewalk 
with no place to stay and with no one to talk? 
Maybe you have a wife and kids and a big house 
Or maybe you're a business man with the big clout 
Who knows how the story goes, maybe I will see 
I'm just a fatherless child, filled with curiosity 

Sometimes, I get a little lonely 
So where you at? 
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? 
Sometimes, I wonder why it had to be this way 
You know, I wonder who you are 
So where you at? 
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? 
Do you know that I'm here? 

My homies and family claim not to understand me 
Why do I talk with so much emotion 
and why do I feel so deeply? Huh 
I have this habit of bitin my nails when I'm deep in thought 
Did you do the same, did you get slapped when you got caught? 
Sometimes I feel my soul is tired from the lack of sleep 
It won't rest until I see you and you see me 
I remember when I asked my momma, ""Where is he?"" 
She said you died, in a plane crash overseas 
I remember cause momma used to get mad zooted 
So two years later I asked again and she had to prove it 
She couldn't, in fact, she forgot what she said the first time 
When I asked again, she said you died in a car crash, fine 
But momma you lied to me and my friends were right 
This is the real reason why this case was sealed tight 
Help me to understand what's going on with this man 
who I've never seen or met, tell me did you plan 
for me not to see, some pieces of this puzzle 
are missing in action, I feel that this is trouble 
She said, ""You really want to know? God please help me 
I didn't know your father, THE BASTARD RAPED ME!"" 

So where you at? 
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? 
It's like dat like dat now 

Do my ears deceive me, I'm confused, do they tease me 
because of the man I thought was dad, took my mother and.. 
forced her to - I CAN'T SAY IT MAN! 
What's this world comin to, why'd you do my moms fool?? 
She was only thirteen, you betta find yo' screws 
because like you, I am a fool too 
Let me take that back, I don't want to be like that 
But now you listen and pay witness to this raw facts 
Life is a three-sixty, what goes around comes around 
and back to your cypher, it will come to haunt you down 
Who knows, you probably turned over a new leaf 
You might be pushin up daisies, if so it wouldn't amaze me 
In fact, let's be accurate, it wouldn't fade me 
Rape, is punishable by death, alright bet 
Now here we go cause God is bringin me to my knees 
to deal with the pain of my, secret curiosity 

Sometimes, I get a little lonely 
So where you at? 
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? 
Sometimes, I wonder why it had to be this way 
You know, I wonder who you are 
So where you at? 
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? 
Do you know that I'm here? 
Do you know? Do you know? 

Sometimes, I get a little lonely 
So where you at? 
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? 
Sometimes, I wonder why it had to be this way 
Like dat, like dat 
You know, I wonder who you are 
Do you know that I'm here? 
So where you at? Where you at?

Couldn't hide what
They meant to say

A crowded room
It's too soon for a new love
When you smile

Lost inside a suit on a bar
Feeling alone with
People around

So misunderstood
I'd explain if only I could
Something tells me

In the summer skies

Feeling lost in a magic maze

Look in your eyes
Open wide you
Seem so surprised

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Through the endless night and day
I have never wanted more.
I Always thought that I would stand
Before the faceless name of justice.
Like some law unto myself,
Like a child of God again.

And if rain brings winds of change
Then let it rain on us forever.
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more.
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning.

By burning flags to cleanse yourselves of shame?
Or are you afraid as you stare back at your face?
Are you ashamed, are you afraid
By destroying what the gods had made?
Did you think you would be saved?
I believe that we'll conceive
To make in hell for us a heaven
A brave new world
A promised land
A fortitude of hearts and minds
Until I see this kingdom is mine
I'll turn the darkness into light
I'll guide the blind
My will be done until the day
I see this kingdom has been won
No more the servants of the weak
Devoid of thought or light to seek
I'll leave no walls, no stone unturned
Every tower to be razed to the dust from which it came
None will be spared, no remnant saved

Of the gods and idols you have made?
Did you think you would be saved

VNV Nation,"The art of war is of vital importance to the state.
It is a matter of life and death,
A road either to safety or to ruin.

To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence
Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without having to fight

If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt
If you know heaven and you know Earth, you may make your victory

If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear results of a hundred battles
If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer defeat.
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

Treat your soldiers as your beloved children
And they will follow you into the deepest valleys.
To defeat your enemy, you must pretend inferiority and encourage your enemy's arrogance.

Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory
For it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.

There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.

Speed is the essence of war.

The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy?s not coming, 
But on our own readiness to receive our enemy; 
Not on the chance of our enemies not attacking, 
But rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.

The general who advances without seeking fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, 
Whose only thought is to protect his country and do service for his sovereign, 
Is the jewel of his kingdom.

The victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won 
Whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.

Speed is the essence of war.
Speed is the essence of war.

It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war
Who can thoroughly understand how to profit from waging war.

VNV Nation,"Deep is the longing in the heart that ever strives
The expanses far and wide that still confine
The simple facts that yet lay waiting to be found
As lost as some forgotten promised land

Consider reasons through long goodbyes
Looking back for one last time

Just for a second look into your heart
As you stand and look across the great divide
Remember well the things that you will leave behind
As you set out to cross the vast and great divide

Guard and defend when forces hinder and collide
Solemn intentions both blessed and divine
You still pulled victory from shattered hope
Count your doubts with broken smiles
Covered your hurt in your pride

No need for reasons
None to confide
Look back and bid farewell for one last time

Just for a second look into your heart
As you stand and look across the great divide
Remember well the things that you will leave behind
As you set out to cross the vast and great divide

Just for a second look into your heart
As you stand and look across the great divide
Remember well the things that you will leave behind
As you set out to cross the vast and great divide

Just for a second look into my eyes
As you stand and look across the great divide
As you let go of tears for what you leave behind
While looking back again to say farewell for one last time

Before looking back again to say farewell for one last time
Before looking back again to say farewell for one last time

VNV Nation,"I think back upon the person
I knew you to be
Righting the wrongs in the name
Of all you believed

The one who brought the fight
Who never said die
Never letting fate decide

Be all you hope for
You were the best you could be
All that in tribute 
All that you had achieved

No time for words
From those with nothing to say
Never letting fate decide

Until the end and back again
Defiant to the last man
?Til there's nothing left
To fight against
No surrender

Unto the corners of the Earth
Defiant to the last breath
Until there's none left standing
No surrender

Conjured the ground upon which
You've only stood
Buried the conflicts that had
Preyed on your mind

Found strengths in actions
That only courage achieves
Never letting fate decide

Until the end and back again
Defiant to the last man
?Til there's nothing left
To fight against
No surrender

Unto the corners of the Earth
Defiant to the last breath

Just another night, is all that it takes

It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night another dream, but always you

Just another night, another dream, another vision of love, with me

Hey sister let me cover, your body with my love
Is with my lovin' just another

Voi,"It's a beautiful day to feel insane
And concuss yourself against a wall
And On the day that it comes to be
You have no friends to make you free

Scenes of days weeks and shames they pass
And you know that you're a fucking mess
Forced to replay everything that went on
Alone, in your bed, no comfort from the one

And the empty vessel is placed at the foot
You could fill it with memories puked out
Forced like a young child to labour
Brainwashed into thinking they'd win god's favour

Vomit out memories of pretty blonde girls
Vomit out memories of indulgence in classrooms
Vomit out memories of guilty thoughts unclean
Of those you wished would want to be treated mean
Vomit out memories of non-bloods and guys
Vomit out a one-track pornographer's brain
Vomit out conversations with the only one who listens
And memories of wounds that felt right to glisten

Vomit out the times you pulled at your hair
Vomit out distaste for the ones you claim to love
Finally, vomit your worst self-provoked path to doom
Into an overflowing vessel, now fills the whole room

Vomiting begets more vomiting
Secrets beget more vomiting

Just to be with me, feel the breeze
Sun didn't smile I didn't care

With another guy, a tear filled my eye

As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa

Down the road I look and there runs Mary

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

Yeah, down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize I was only dreamin'

There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak again
I'll touch the green, green grass of home

The beat of love is a nasty one.
It's a flame from the devils fire.
'cause nothing is stronger than boys and their eyes
And it's worse when you know he's a liar.
It's just the beat of love.

They promise you heaven they promise you fun then the
Next thing you know you are down on the floor
And you think you're in love
Oh heaven above
It's just the beat of love.

you take my mind and you cheat it.
You take my body and heat it
Then you take my heart and you beat it
And the beat of love goes on.

it's just the beat of love

the beat of love is a nasty one
People bang on the door to get in
Then one they're inside they just want to be free
And they bang at the doors with a beat they can't see
It's the beat of love.

it's just the beat of love.

the beat of love is a nasty one
There are all kinds of ways to get banged.
They'll tell you is violence they'll tell you it's sex
They'll tell you that it's all the same.

the beat of love is a nasty one
There all kinds of ways to go down
She slams her hips and then she slams the door
And then wonders why he's not around

love is a life nerve
A mission
A principle
The grand passion
Temptation

it's just the beat of love.

I will be sitting on the stairs.

I'll be as good as new.

who's laughing at the joke, and
as I leave I laugh for you.

But I say nothing, I talk to no-one.
I know what I believe. Don't need to wear it on my sleeve.
I talk to no-one, I will say nothing.
If we come and go alone, then what's the point of carrying these arcades?

it's so near to me
It's so dear to me
I see it in my sleep

and I always know if I've no where to go
It's somewhere I could be

I see you at night in the city light
But it could change so easily

chorus

it's just a city
And on night like this I feel small in this world
It's just a city and I am just a girl

it seems to me that once you stop walking
You don't want to know, you stop wanting to see
Your eyes get used to the same old story
Once you stop talking strangers

chorus

out of place out of time
Nothing to hold me nothing mine
But I'm always told ""there's no hurry don't go
There's nothing but time ""but how do they know?

He don't care that I cry every night 'cause we're through
And he don't wait to walk me home
I gambled our love and now I'm alone

my friends they tell me that time is a healer
My heart was stolen and you were the stealer
I wait for you but you don't come home
This pain is aches me right to my bones

(oh love, oh love)

I made my own bed and now I must lie in it alone
Trying to turn the time and it's nobody's fault but my own.

I only hope that on my judgement day
The good lord believes me when I say
I'm sad and I'm sorry, I can't stop my crying
If this is the life I'd just assume dying

oh love, oh love let me make it up to you
I'd do anything to prove that my love's still true

Not much to be found she said
I ought to know, time goes by slowly

I am here and I am young
Life is here and not much fun
Somehow some way, I missed my day

don't you ever get sick of feeling sick about it ?
Don't you ever get sick of feeling sick without it ?

she wakes up and cracks a beer
Wants to feel she isn't here
Sometimes she cries and she doesn't know why

she is only twenty-two
And she feels her life is through
Blames it on fate, starts drinking at eight

don't you ever get sick of feeling sick about it ?
Don't you ever get sick of feeling sick without it ?
Sorrow floats

she's too young to feel that old
She's too kind to be that cold
I try to help, I just start to yell

too much time is spent to think
Too much money spent on drink
I'm far away but still I should say

don't you ever get sick if feeling sick about it ?
Don't you ever get sick of feeling sick without it ?

What good is the truth if we never use it?

you've just got to trust me sometimes
""trust me"" he says in the dark

But to him it's worth a dime
She found out the hard way you get the kisses then
The tears
To think she'd saved is all these years
You've just got to trust me sometime

The dullest skies. The only truth 
Among all of these lies. You're beauty

Wake up senses reeling for you. And

A secret vision just for me. I think

Saw you darling I knew.

Was finding the moon is made of dust

Oh no, I have seen this mood before
Tension, flying all around the room
I have had my share of more, forgive and forget
Like before
No love's lost

Finding out the truth about you was
Finding the moon is made of dust
Stars are just confetti and heroes always fall
From the bedroom walls and
The moon is made of dust

I believe that love prevailed
I tried and I have failed
So sing to me a lullaby and disappear into the night
Love's gone home

chorus

Goodbye to all my heroes, hello to all the friends
I've disregarded all though the years
Goodbye to all my favourite songs
I wish that love and fear did not prove
You're a million miles from here

I'm tried, tired of this stupid heart
Ragged, aged and torn apart
We'd walk all around this crazy world
You were glue to a broken down and fed up,
Never gonna get out baby

In the night a sweet perfume and although we'll be parting
You'll leave me...

I'll look for you behind each star, raise my eyes to
Where you are until I'm moonblind

Left to love the sight alone - knowing you are finally home
To the silence I will speak and though you won't be there
I know you'll be listening from beyond the night somewhere
You'll leave me

Voice of the Beehive,"The night's so big I feel like a shadow waiting in the corner
Nowhere to hide away safe
Somehow light will always find me
And tell me how to brave a darkened silence
Any day now the clouds will part there will be sun

In the new day I'll find things aren't so bad at all
The day will carry me like water in a fall
The sky is endless and it's just for me to see

I close my eyes in silence, held my stillness
Dark and sweet now
And though things might seem tarnished,
Something will shine for me somehow
And then there's light, remind me there's tomorrow
It could me mine
The clouds part there will be sun

In the new day I'll find things aren't so bad at all
The day will carry me like water in a fall
The sky is endless and it's just for me to see
And it'll be all mine to just reach and grab hold of
Don't need a hand to take me,
Don't need a perfect love and the darkness
Will be just a memory

The sky, the wind kicks up my adrenaline
Yesterday blue skies turned grey
You know I felt I'd lost my way
Now the sun, and the sky beauty so real
It can't be a lie, lying back, not feeling blue
Stretch out your arms, let the sun shine through.",New Day,1995
Voice of the Beehive,"
(By Tracey Bryn & Martin Brett)

He's walking slowly - he is in no hurry
He is walking to the slaughter of the hell that's called routine
She arises tried - she is feeding on the famine of the
Fat that's called the housewife
Making sure that it's all clean

This is the game called playing house
We're all screamin', no one's getting out
This is the game called playing house

He's starving for a surprise, she is aching for a sign
That things are not quite as simple
As they seemed to be designed
Give me complication, give me freezing in the heat
Give me some new kind of rhythm
Give me some new kind of beat

Don't give me the game called playing house
We're all screaming, no one's getting out
Don't give me the game called playing house

Playing house, Playing house

Destroy all that's creative - give routine a friendly face
Just give everyone a rhythm, just give everyone a place
That is the game that we've been told that we will play
And if we play ot long enough, it's bound to surely go away.

Voice of the Beehive,"There's a much old trick to playing safely, baby people do it every day.
You can see them living sensibly with lots of care, lonely in a cautious way. 
You be alone for me, I'll be alone for you, one and one before no longer makes two. 
Let's stir things up a bit  throw the pieces up to the sky.

Baby I want scary kisses,
I want hits and I want misses,
I want hell and I want bliss,
And all that stuff between it,
And if you gave me safety in a short time I'll be driven crazy, 
I would rather run and fall, 
Then take no chance at all,
Then take no chance at all.

I would rather sit here by myself then settle down with someone safe and sound.
I kinda like a little trouble every now and then, someone with the nerve to break ground.
You take a look for me, I'll take a look for you, we'll find it's not so bad it's just new.
Let's stir things up a bit, throw the pieces up to the sky.

Baby I want scary kisses, 
I want hits and I want misses,
I want hell and I want bliss,
And all that stuff between it,
And if you gave me safety in a short time I'll be driven crazy, 
I would rather run and fall, 
Then take no chance at all, 
And if we break or if we bruise,
It won't be the worst of news,
We will just get up again, 
Start over on the count of ten. 
And if we scar or if we break, 
It'll be our own mistake 
Put it down to what we know  
Then have another go
And take it on the chin
And just begin again 
Run your fingers through the flame
And I will do the same
Together we will fall 
Together we will rise
Together we will dooo everything but compromise

Baby I want scary kisses, 
I want hits and I want misses, 
I want hell and I want bliss, 
And all that stuff between it,

Voice of the Beehive,"I have a destiny, I have a vision dear
It's as translucent and rain and glass are clear
I am a problem girl, I have a habit old
If I got silver I'd pine for shiny gold
And you're no better, wishing on all stars for things
You know you shouldn't have at all
I have a complaint now, I have to change somehow
We need a turn around because I believe that

[Chorus]
If you and I had flowers at our feet
We'd just think they will fade some day
And I know of me and you looked at skies of blue
We'd say the rain won't stay away
Tell me why it's so hard to see the silver lining
Of the clouds that tumble by
Tell me why it's so hard for us to see the bright
Side of the hidden moon hidden silent moon

I have a secret blue heard a rumor true
I have a wish and it has got to do with you
I see a picture drawn, it's lines are free and strong
I've been living on the darker side of dawn

And you the sweet one, truing sour as the sun sets
In you some so dark and shy
I have a solid trust I have a hope for us
We're both smiling as the factory's churning

[Chorus]

I want to drink champagne and dance in a
Fountain splashing us with rain
I want to fall back into grass that's cool and long
While trees above us sway we both deserve a lazy day

(Champagne giggles, kisses and riddles
Kid and play then float ways,
Splashing raindrops 'til the pain stops)
So hard the stars have a secret plan for me and you,
So hard the day is done the moon is new.",So Hard,1995

Voicemail,"Rain, such a simple thang
Every drop, a different stop
But they all come from the same
God is the cloud
And we are the rain
That's why I sometimes feel
That somehow we are the same
 
Whenever I lay my head to sleep
There's a strong thought that keeps haunting my mind
Careless whispers of a nation
That somehow was caught trapped in the dark
And nowhere to go
I know my thoughts are tellin' me

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart, in my soul
Gotta be a part of me
The world must be callin' me
And my world comes from within

Life has no guarantees
That you'll keep what you have
Even though you're blessed with then
That's why I'm feeling
Some fear for the world
With all the grief and misery
How much real time is there

The sooner I take more responsibilities
I can truly say
I am grateful for my world
The irony of tryin' to do the right thing
Is whatever you do, some will undo
And sometimes destroy
And there's someone still left in darkness
And you say

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart, in my soul
Gotta be a part of me
The world must be callin' me
And my world comes from within

The world is what we make it
What we see today
Are the results of the mistakes they made yesterday
And what we see tomorrow
Will be the results of what we do today
It's a shame that peace and respect
Has been replaced with money and power
The children, they are the futures
So teach them how to love themselves
And they will love others
Don't you see, love - that's the key

Gotta be a part of me

Close your eyes baby and lend me your finger
Together we walk out as one
No lonely nights, broken promises or fights will
Return anymore

I remember a time I believe was fine
But inside my heart broke down in two
Something inside starts to burn like a fire
And I knew it was you

We're broken and damned
But together we'll find a way
And no longer shall hell awaits
We will seek all the light in the day
'Cause forever our love will breathe

Close your eyes baby and lend me your finger
Together we walk out as one
No lonely nights, broken promises or fights will
Return anymore

I see a window open hearing Aerosmith rocking with

The motherfuckers are all awaiting him done the line

Sick and tired of fighting, all the crap inside
Starting a new day, breathing in the morning
Got a feeling leaving something behind
He sees the lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely days

Left his car out in the desert forever more
He's got another life now explore
And forever you will hear the people talk
How they can hear his boots out in the cold

And the fallen will get down on his knees
And the fallen will get down on his knees
And forever the man in the coat
Will cast his shadow among those who know the tale
Of the gangster who shot all his demons for good

Then along came the mirror and the ripper
What do you see in the night?
Passing shadows that can scar your soul
And make you feel demonized
Hear a match and see the lightning from the ripper

What do you have in your mind?
We believe that he comes for another wicked destiny night
Dazing in the dark the life line going cold in the fire

Well, is it Mr. Cadillac or you?
Walking among those who nearly found peace

In to the light, and out of the blue

Could it be that the tears no longer sad but true
(could it be that the angels of tomorrow know)
Break the moment into something more than gold
And I realize it now, it was never meant to hold

Sweet as it was not forever and never to close

For all the things that should not be
But i need a new love and for once I believe that it's her

Glared with a sunken eye of death
Moved his head from side to side and said
Come on you gutless slugs fight like a man
State your name and business and let's see what you got
Another body for the hangman's count
Show me the bar, and show me the cards
Hold on to your guys

Filled up with bug juice
The moon shine in his hand
Hot headed with a temperament
The speediest deadliest man with a gun
A bloody gambler but a gentleman dog
A frontier vagabond who charms all the dames
Hello ladies how's your day today
Let me introduce you to myself

Ooooooooooh the outlaw man's roar

A friendly man but without a friend
Fort Griffin Texas here I am
Supported Wyatt Earp to the very end
Cemented brotherhood
Don't get in his way
You cannot shake his boots
You cannot scare his fate
Down under you will hear him grin
Great the man the outlaw himself

Maint'nant on s'parle de très très près
Assis sur un p'tit banc en pierre
On est tout seuls, on boit d'la bière
Elle commence à rouler un joint
C'est cool moi je louche sur ses seins
Et quand elle relève la tête
Je pense qu'elle croit qu'j'regarde son pét'
J'ai perdu l'fil de son histoire
Je suis bourré il fait nuit noire
Mais comme elle finit pas c'est dur
J'réponds un truc du style c'est sûr...

Refrain :
C'est pas tout ça mais quand est c'qu'on baise ?
C'est pas tout ça mais quand est c'qu'on baise ?

C'est vrai je sais qu'elle a un mec
Qu'est DJ dans une discothèque
Le genre de gars qui doit s'ret'nir
Mais ça je me retiens d'lui dire
Je la laisse me faire son discours
Sur la fidélité
L'amour
Et la confiance et l'honnêteté
Bien sûr elle l'a jamais trompé
J'contredis pas
Je suis d'accord
Mais là moi
J'ai envie d'son corps
Ca fait deux, trois heures qu'on discute
Y'a pas d'autres mots je suis en rut
J'insiste un peu et elle m'avoue
qu'elle me trouve aussi à son goût
Qu'elle a besoin d'se réchauffer
Elle me propose de m'rapprocher

Refrain

Je l'attendais cette réplique
Et maint'nant c'est moi qui m'explique J'suis en amour, j'parle de ma femme
Qui m'attend chez nous à Paname
J'suis sûrement con, p't être un salaud
J'm'improvise des phrases de philo
On a qu'une vie et j'ai envie
Et à c't'heure là j'ai plus d'avis
Je suis coincé voilà c'est dit
J'ai plus la notion d'l'interdit
Et la picole et le chichon
Et son p'tit cul ses gros nichons
Demain je me trait'rai d'connard
Mais demain c'est tellement plus tard
Besoin de vivre dans l'instant
Et là maint'nant c'est l'bon moment

On a fini par se laisser Devant un beau lever d'soleil
Elle a essayé d'm'embrasser
Et pour le coup c'est moi qu'avait sommeil

You know everything must change as time goes by.
Though it feels like yesterday when we first met.
I feel I'm sinking deeper.
Do you look the same to me? Well, I don't think so.
You know everything must change as time goes by.
Like the flowers that dry, locking inside
Forever their beauty.
And they said this feeling fades,
It gets stronger everyday.
And they said that beauty fades.
You're more beautiful than ever.
They said we'd drift away,
We're still standing here.
And it feels like everyday is our anniversary.
Well, I stumble through the dark and light a candle
And the path the wax will take, no one can know.
And you said it looked like snow or maybe clouds,
And I think it looks like heaven.
So we make it into a ring and make a mold.
And we welt above the flames the whitest gold.
When hot and cold collide what's left in place
Is forever and ever.

Voltaire,"You know it's true, we're both the same.
In a storm of words we get lost in what is said.
You know me and you see through me,
So why are you confused by the things I say and do?
Do you know me?
You see the strain upon my face.
Please, don't rain on my parade.
It comes to light, it comes in waves,
It's gone too late.
It goes astray, it goes too far and you say
It's clear I know where all your buttons are.
It's not so strange, you know, it's not so queer
That I know they're there 'cause I'm the one
Who put then there, exactly as you feared.
I know you and I see through you
So why am I surprised by the things you say and do?
I don't know why.
I see the strain upon your face.
I won't rain on your parade.
It comes to light, it comes in waves,
It's gone too late.
Don't steal the smile from off my face.
Please don't rain on my parade......
I know that I can't replace you
And it would be a lie to say that I could ever try.
It's gone too late.
It's gone too late.
It cuts two ways
It cuts two ways.
It's gone too late.
",Parade,1998
Voltaire,"The day is the wife whom I elude
The one to whom I should be right
Although forewarned by peers and kin
I always get into the night
Mother always warned me such
Being a nocturnal soul
Besides just being simply strange
Spawns from some illness of the mind

the night, she calls me
She calls me, she calls me
She calls me, she calls me
She sways in her velvet dress
And pulls me towards her in the dark
While the others rest

heed the call the time has come
For all you children of the night
Gather 'round like suckling dogs
Mothers come she is the night
Come with me to the other side
Make the girl in black your bride

the night, she calls me
She calls me, she calls me
She calls me, she calls me
She sways in her velvet dress
And pulls me towards her in the dark
While the others rest

it just seems very strange to me
Not her quiet lonely streets
And draped in all her mystery
Could be so sweet and comforting

the night, she calls me
She calls me, she calls me
She calls me, she calls me
She sways in her velvet dress
And pulls me towards her in the dark
While the others rest



",The Night,2000
Voltaire,"You're a fountain of blood
In the shape of a girl
I'm the bird on the brim
Hypnotized by the whirl
I drink you, make you feel real
Wet my beak in your stream
The game we're playing is life
Love's a two way dream

Leave me now, return tonight
The tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay

You're a path of cinders 
Burning under my feet
I'm the one who walks you
You're my one way street

You're a whispering water
A secret for me to hear
I'm the one who grew distant
When you beckoned me near

Leave me now, return tonight
The tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay

You're a tree that grows hearts
One for each that I take
I'm the ground that you beat on
You're the branch that I break

And life is a necklace of tears 
You undo them with your fear
And I am a fountain of fears
You fill me with your tears

Our love
Is a big ball of string
Devil collects it with a grin
Our love",Bachelor(ette),2002
Voltaire,"Life has a way of making you humble
Day after day it's bringing you to your knees
All's okay, then everything crumbles
And all that you perceive is blowing away

But while I'm tearing at the seams
I'll apologize to anything
I'm sorry....

All's black and white when you're just a baby
You get some hair on your chin
You think you know everything
Years go by then everything's ""maybe""
And all that you believe
Drowns in a sea of gray

But while I'm tearing at the seams
I'll apologize to anything
I'm sorry, I'm selfish
I'm sorry, I behave this way
I'm sorry, couldn't help it
I'm sorry that you lost your faith in me

(I'm sorry that you lost your faith
I'm sorry that it rains
I'm sorry I ever came
I'm sorry, I'm sorry)



",I'm Sorry,2002
Voltaire,"He's so afraid when they scream
When they're mean
She was the star of a life
That ceased to be
I die in my dreams
It eats me whole, It eats me whole
All this sorrow disappears
When I learn to shake this fear
And let it go

Sue hates Irene
She hates Sue
I know you hate me
It's okay, I hate you too
Hate is a beast
It eats me whole, it eats me whole
'Til I take him by the ears,
Turn him 'round, paddle his rear
And let him go

Let it go, let it go, let it go
All this anger dissipates
When I come to shake this hate
And let it go
(Let it go, let it go, let it go,
All this sorrow disappears
When I finally shake this fear
And let it go)

I've been up high and I've been down low
But mostly I've been tired
I'll tell you, the best thing
I ever did was to let it go",Let It Go,2002
Voltaire,"Whenever I'm alone with you,
You make me feel like I am home again.
Whenever I'm alone with you,
You make me feel like I am whole again.

Whenever I'm alone with you,
You make me feel like I am young again.
Whenever I'm alone, with you,
You make me feel like I am fun again.

Voltaire,"Oh, oh, oh, little China girl
Oh, oh, oh, little China girl

I could escape this feeling, with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
I'm a mess without my, little China girl
Wake up mornings where's my, little China girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men's who want to rule the world

Oh baby, just you shut your mouth

Ochenta trucos y mil artimañas
Se fuma un fili con un trago de caña
y con el magnun, a cualquiera el día le empaña

A los bichotes araña como piraña
Chamaquito que se junte con julito se daña
Le gusta la mataera, los asalto, y la cizaña
Nadie tira al medio un tipo de esa calaña

Ni los estatales, ni arrestos especiales y federales
Le encuentran causa en los tribunales
Por que ya to el mundo conoce todos sus males
No hay evidencia ni chota que lo señale

En el barrio le temen, porque el tipo es un bravo
y tiene al diablo agarrau por el rabo
No trabaja, siempre acicalau hasta el cabo
y te arranca la catrueca si tu no le das los chavos

Los otros días le fiaron un octavo
y a la semana el tipo fue cobrar los chavos
Julio sacó la nueve y lo rajó con el cabo
y el tipo corría mas que en el maratón del pavo

Mera puñeta esto es un asalto
Llaves del carro, cartera, el dinero y las prendas
y no me mires si no quieres que te tire
y tenme el billete ready pa la proxima que venga

Los liquor store, las a.t.h.s y en las tiendas
Ese pega punto y donde quiera que se venda
Mira si el tipo es malo y le gusta la jodienda
Que le quitó al pastor hasta los chavo e la ofrenda

Arrancó pa los NewYores pa la casa de su tía
A ver si se enfría los problemas que tenía
Allá con los tiguerasos hizo un par de fechorías
y en los altos de Manhattan la gente lo conocía

En la 42, hasta Broklyn, en el tramvia
To el que cogía mi hermanito se jodía
Se fué pa la isla fichau por la policía
y cuando vino, viró mas malo todavía

Por ahí anda Julito
En el barrio se decía
y creía que iba a meter las cabras
Como antes lo hacía

Ya no es lo mismo
Ya pasaron esos días
No confunda la humildad
Con la cobardía

Boca e trapo
Papi aquí to el mundo es guapo
Ahora matan por matar
y mas si tu eres un sapo

Hombre no, aquí yo soy el bravucón
Estos chamaquitos a mi me tienen un miedo cabrón
Deja que los alumbre con esta cuestión, mamón

Pero el tipo del octavo
Era dueño del callejón
Tenía al caserío caminando por la orilla
y los secuaces tenían babilla

y ya tenía como 15 en las costillas
Que tu crees que le pasé a Julito si el hombre lo pilla

Hey, Julito Maraña, Te acuerdas de mi cabrón
Que pajó quien carajo tu eres ?
Que me partiste el melón por el octavo
Clack, Clack
Mera a quien tu le sacas eso loco, mera canto e bobo, echa
Pum
Oh
Murió Julito
Por bravucón",Julito Maraña,2004
Voltio,"Olvídate de eso, me aborrece el proceso 
Mejor q me maten, yo no vuelvo a estar preso 
Porque no dejan q yo haga un par de pesos? 
Dicen q lo mio es ilegal y por eso 
Esto va de mal en peor 
Y se pasa mejor si el guardia no fuera tan abusador 
Te violan tus derechos y abusan del control 
Ya no hay privilegios ni bajo parol, 
Ni pases extendidos, probatorias ni grilletes 
Por culpa de los guardias el motin se fue algarete 
Y me pregunta porque nadie me visita
Solo viene a verme mi vieja solita 

I’m steady trying find a motive
Why do what I do?
Freedom ain’t gettin no closer
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
Cops patrolling, and now they done stop me
And I get locked up

They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 

Ya son las 9 de la noche, calló el telón
Yo en prisión pero mi mente en el callejón 
Pensando en mi corillo y en su eterno vacilón 
Me encuentro solo y triste y sufre mi corazón
Por la condena que lucho día a día 
Mi juventud se escurre en una celda fría
Mi alma en penitencia, mi vida en agonía 
Y es muy poca la esperanza de salir todavía 
Las lágrimas que mojan el papel de mi triste carta
Comentarle a mi familia lo mucho que hacen falta
A pesar de todo sigo con mi frente alta
Soy un sI'mple preso q la sociedad descarta 

They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 

Cause visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
My cell mates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right 
But instead I’m here locked up 

They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 

Maybe a visit (they won't let me out) 
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out) 
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no) 
Maybe a visit baby (they won't let me out) 
Cuz I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Wheres my lawyer? (they won't let me out) 
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no
Get me outta here (they won't let me out) 
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, they won't let me out
Baby I'm locked up they won't let me out, no 
Where's my niggaz? 
On the lock-down
Damn, I'm locked up, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Oh they won't let me out
Can you please accept my phone calls? 
Cuz I'm locked up, locked up, locked up",Locked-Up,2004

Pal que se pega pa contarte un embuste 
A toa boca pa que la gente se asuste 
En ese viaje se pueden ir ajuste

A las gatitas en la discoteca 
Ronca de chavo y la cartera esta hueca 
""Tu eres un maliente de cartón"" 

Tiene Rolex, sortija y un pal de cubanas 
Brega kilos, y tambien libras de marihuana 
Solamente tiene ganas de botar mucha lana 
Pues lo que tiene es prestau de los panas 

Como un chihuahua que ladra detras de la reja 
Detrás del celu te despelleja 
Pero tu lo ves de frente con la labia pendeja 
""Tu eres un maliante de cartón"" 

Cara e malo, y con un guille e bravucón 
Tu lo ves que te camina con un corte cabrón 
No hace falta ni mirarlo pa saber que es guasón 
A matau 40 tipos pero en una canción 

Buscate una escoba pa barrerle los casquillos 
La mitad de to son cuentos y le llegan a los tobillos 
Ni pa despedir el año usted a jalau el gatillo 
""Tu eres un maliante de cartón"" 

Lo del tipo es rebuliar, discutir y matar 
En el barrio lo conocen como el super anormal 
Su corillo casi llena una guagua escolar 
Asi cualkiera, pero sueltalo solito a peliar 

No se en que galaxia ellos viven la guerra 
Me apuesto que no saben ni trastiar una perra 
Se meten con white lion y solitos se entierran 
Siete pies bajo tierra 

A los que frontean, a los que nebulean 
Se ponen payasos pa que la gente los vea 
Quieren meter la feca pa que uno le crea 
Tu le dices ""tu eres un maliante de cartón"" 

Los que dicen que bregan, que matan y pelean 
Los que roncan y fanfarronean 
Son los primeros en correr si la cosa se pone fea 
""Tu eres un maliante de cartón"" 

Ellos pulla y cortan pa llegar hasta la meta 
Debería yo asustarme si chambean sus libretas 
Ya los pajaritos le tiran a la escopeta 
Pero si no hay bulova, entonces pana mio no se meta 

Ese es el problema siempre paga el que aboga 
Por lo mas finito es que se parte la soga 
Despues los matan y dicen que es por droga 
""Tu eres un maliante de cartón"" 

Ando con dos largos, socio, cualqier cosa me avisas 
Si se forma una pelea, yo me quito la camisa 
Pero suenan los tiros y se pone blanco como tiza 
Y se frizan, hablan de problemas y se erizan 

No se que tu ganas con decir que estas armau 
Enseñando lo que tienes mejor quedese callau 
Con ese fronte puedes terminar apagau 
""Tu eres un maliante de cartón"" 

Socio, soy de la uno, ando sin piquete alguno 
Soy como el yambú, yo no me vacuno 
Soy feliz con mi fuma y mi desayuno 
Y gracias a Dios que no tengo que envidiarle na a ninguno 

Soy tranquilo humilde y decente 
Canto pa los corillos y brego con toa la gente 
Pa, pero si te lambe te voy a explotar los dientes

Yo hago un par de cositas que no salen en la tele 
No soy rico ni famoso como el gran Rockefeller 
Pero tengo lo que a unos le gusta y lo que a otros les duele

Si tu quiere mambo, aquí tiene mambo,tu coge mambo 
El otro bando, esta capotiando 
Dejen la envidia y dejen de estar tirando 

Lleno de alegría positiva mi energía 
Como el jigiri diria, me siento al dia en la mía 
Ya tengo la masa encendía 
La que se meta en mi via, tan tan chulería 
Ya tu sabes 

Si tu quiere mambo, nena coge mambo, aquí tiene mambo

La calle esta mala 
Pal que se la busca, me tira, me jode y me jala 
Así que embala, que lo puede mangar las balas 

La calle está buena 
Así que cojela con suavena 
Gozar beber y fumar pero curandote la vena 
Con las nenas, las latinas chikitita bonita y morena 

No sufra may condona 
Y olvidese de las penas 
Esto es pa los que tiran 
Y el alma te envenena 

Youh, Bajen la antena
Y olvidese de la vida ajena

Sacame a pasear pa la calle 
Pegate cerquita pa que los melone estallen 

Y se callen, antes de fogoniarlos se desmallen 
Llama a white lion que bajen los shipihammers 
Esta gente quiere que mi sangre se derrame 
Me voy hasta el ñame, activar los bacatranes 
Pa que to estos puercos a mi me lo mamen

Forjado de recuerdos
Y sin saber el cielo en la ventana
Que me abre la mañana

Tu amor me parte en dos el occidente
Me clava de repente
Y me convierte en masa que se amolda
A una ilusión ardiente

Dime si mastico el verde menta de tu voz
O le pego un parcho al alma
Átame al pulgar derecho de tu corazón
Y dime como esta mi amor en tu amor

Frío, frío como el agua del río
O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calma
Y se enciende
Si es que acaso le quieres

Tu amor despierta y lava su carita
De rosas me salpica
Y sin saber es una vía láctea
Que gira y me da vida

Tu amor lo guardo dentro de mis ojos
Como una lagrimita
Y no los lloro para que no salgan
Tus besos de mi vista

Dime si mastico el verde menta de tu voz
O le pego un parcho a mi alma
Átame al pulgar derecho de tu corazón
Y dime como esta mi amor en tu amor

Frío, frío como el agua del río
O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calma
Y se enciende
Si es que acaso le quieres

Pudiera ser un farolito y encender tu luz
Hasta que quieras tu
Como me gustas tu

Frío, frío como el agua del río
O caliente como el agua de la fuente

Frío, frío como el agua del río
No existe nadie como tu
Que me llene con su luz
Que se entregue en el amor
Como le pido frio eh

Yo en prision pero mi mente en el callejon
Pensando en mi corrilo why en su enterno bacilon
Me encuentro solo why triste why sufre mi corazon
(Ay dios mio)

Una colilla de cigarro mas, un cenicero que va a rebentar
La misma historia triste why sin final
El mismo cuento de nunca acabar
Why la carcajada de otra madrugada
OoOooooh

Se anulan cuatro paredes, rutina puerta cerrada
Why un carnaval de barrotes bailando sobre mi cama
Extraño aquella cometa que yo de niño volaba
Why a mis amigos del barrio, que mis canciones bailaban

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar why a mis amigos buenos visitar
Pidiendo otra oportunidad
Bajo el farol del pueblo conversar why en una fiesta linda celebrar
Mi libertad

Ya no puedo con la condena que lucho dia a dia
Mi juventud se cubre en un celda fria
Mi alma penitencia, mi vida en agonia
Why es muy poca la esperanza de salir todavia

Extraño aquella cometa que yo de niño volaba
Why a mis amigos del barrio, que mis canciones bailaban

Una lagrima que moje el papel de mi triste carta
Pa' contarle a mi familia lo mucho que me hacen falta
A pesar de todo sigo con mi frente alta
Soy un simple ser-humano que en la sociedad descarta

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar
Why a mis amigos buenos visitar
Pidiendo otra oportunidad
Bajo el farol del pueblo conversar why en una fiesta linda celebrar
Mi libertad

Oyeme Jerry
(Aha)
Yo te digo la verdad, no es lo que cuesta
(Y que?)
Sino cuanto vale La libertad
(Siii)

Quiero cantar de nuevo why caminar
Why a mis amigos buenos visitar

El mismo cuento que de nunca acabar)
Quiero cantar denuevo why caminar

Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
If won't hurt if you gon' try one time

El cándido bandido 
Nunca habla de lo vivido 
Hace lo que haya que hacer y nos fuimos 
Cantenmela simple pero con sentido 
Pa sonar calle no hay que presentido 
Ser negativo ni tan cochinchillo 
Ofrece apuñala, no tiene cuchillo 
Tráela como el, yo no me maquillo 
No corro con cabra le saque la pata al chivo 
Se acabaron los confis de colores

Sin cogerte un caso 
Me delato tu en un payaso 
Tú ronca mucho y esa es tu debilidad 
Aquí en la calle se te fue la credibilidad 
Tu no tiene amigo 
Tu no tiene gente 
Tú anda con testigo 
Yo ando con presente 
Tú me copia a mí
Más cabrón que un samper 
Y anda por ahí 
Más cagao que un pamper 
Y ustedes saben que no son de cora 
Meten cabra en to lao menos en la emisora 
Me critican 
Pero cuando zumbo se pican 
Ninguno vive lo que predican
Tú no eres real, tú eres de juguete 
Tú no eres un hombre, tu ere un mandulete 
Tu no te has graduao, tu ere un cadete 
Tu no ere al carbón, tu ere al cahuete

Los que saben, saben que todo lo de ello es montao 
Que son unos bobos crillao 
La culpa es mía por tenerlos mal acostumbraos 
Por dejársela pasar cuando piden cacao 
Tego me llamo pa tirarle en el Underdog 
Pues para echarlo no hace falta glock 
Hablan de sacarle, matar

Con violencia no hay progreso

Y dime algo en el proceso 
Pa que lo que escucha salgan ganadores 
Soy la conciencia en los jodedores

Si suenan los cloes

Hey! (Yo!)

Hemos hecho este género trabajando duro!
Sobrepasando situaciones!
Sobrepasando el sistema!
Así somos nosotros!

Definitivamente y sin duda!
Volviendo a marcar otro nivel en la música!
Este nivel solamente es alcanzado por aquellas súper-estrellas!
Lo único que, ahora, junto a Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Estas son ""Las Gárgolas: The Next Generation""!
Prra!

Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Ahí les dejo al mío!
Mario!
Comételos vivo!

Ya hace su entrada inesperada
El que menos pensaban (¡Mario, dale!)
Hoy dejo atrás todos mis modales
Pa' los que pensaron que yo no me podía ir calle
Pues confundieron mi humildad con no tener coraje
Se equivocaron de nuevo, les vo'a pasar el rolo
Pa' los que pensaron que en esto no podía solo
Alex, dame la verde y solo los desplomo
Al fin de cuenta, si vamo'a morir que sea a nuestro modo
Gárgolas, poniendo reglas desde antaño
Sé que en esta liga solo llevo un par de años
Que las estrellas de este género ya están jugando
Pero yo soy el sexto hombre que los mata saliendo del banco

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Okay, llego el turno del Vale'
Precaución que ando con mis anormales
Un combo de artillería que a cazarte salen
Y que a plena luz del día revientan cristales
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales
Sácale furia, no corre...
Y si acaso dudan de la cría de este flaco
Bajen pa'l barrio que no salen vivos de la 24
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales
Sácale furia, no corre...
Y si acaso dudan de la cría de este flaco
Bajen pa'l barrio que no salen vivos de la 24

(¡Angel Doze!)
(¡Jajajaja!)
Estos cabrones quieren que los dejemos feos
No bromeo y no les tengo miedo a los feos
Soy guerrillero y en la calle como les campeo
Mucha cazaera, mujeres y fumeteo
Como los pompeo, me voy hasta abajo si se forma un peo
Si frontean yo los sueno y aquí no hay duelo
Tú lo que hueles es a sepelio
Pague tu entierro porque mi vida en esto es primera
¿Quién dice que no te bajare de ese globo helio?
Aunque frontees tú no eres Grayskull
Cambio ese CD de Terminator
Que aquí nadie es intocable
Y to's somos iguales
Viviendo en una selva
Que los que viven no son tan anormales
Dando break, pero conmigo no te resbales
¿Okay? (¡Conmigo no te resbales!) ¿Okay?

(¡Es el turno del gorila!)
Llego la maquina de guerra, el truck Mackal
Yo no vo'a atacar si tu combo saca'l* (¿?)
De la jaula el chacal que 'ta loco por machacar
Quieren inventar y te vamo'a maltratar* (¿?)
Yo no 'toy fácil, considérame difícil
Yo controlo el zodiaco desde Aries a Piscis
Tranquilito, papo, que usted mea como missy
Y el gorila tiene letra pa' dejarte en crisis
Considérate un ""cover"" pa'l pecho
Que tengo escobas pa' barrer
A los que se fueron por techo
Se me hizo largo, estrecho
Pero de hierro estoy hecho
Y este artista de WyY tiene derecho

Y mira ahora quien llegó, la gárgola de ""Agresivo""
Rompiendo y partiéndolos, educándolos con mi flow
Son las mujeres las que hacen que yo salga de noche
(¡Tuti!) (¡Blam, blam!) WD-40 pa'l Lacoste
Suelto suelto y sigo envuelto
Y viendo como paralizo tu momento
Heyyyy, yo siendo la voz del momento
La única gárgola que el sol no convierte en cemento

No dejes que se te hunda el barco y cómprate un parco
Te aplasto, chequea en tarima cómo es que parto
Le caí de asalto, el bacalao reparto
Tú pediste tres tazas y saliste harto
(¡Ah!) Ya resolvimos marroneándola
No busques más, somos las gárgolas
La quinta parte fundiéndola
La compe', tu combo de la envidia se rompe
Porque ahora estamos encendidos, ¿y tú a donde?

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

(¡Oye!)
Ese negro es gárgola, es el negro
No hablen mucho, saben 'e donde vengo
Tengo mi propio flow, no me vendo
Si no sirve es que es sendo cerdo
No amenaces, nunca tiemblo
Mala mía si te ofendo
Yo no ofrezco si no tengo
Tú quieres que encienda
Prendo prendo (¡Ma'!)

Esto es pa' las gárgolas, sin miedo
Entra Cosculluela y to' el mundo se cae al suelo
Pa' tirarte contra mi 'tas bien loco
Hay muchos que suenan como tú
Pero como yo suenan pocos o ninguno
Salgo gigantesco y oportuno...
Consumo el humo mientras cargo el peine de la sumo
Gilipolla, prende bien atrás que 'ta la hoya
Que quien no atiende la cocina el kiosko se la arrollan
A mi me encanta saber que tengo lo mío plancha'o
Y si me muero mañana te juro que me fui gasta'o
Cuñao, brega en el norte que yo sigo las señales
Suenen los timbales, jale, bajen los metales
Disque 'toy en guerra, ¿con quien?, nunca se sabe
Cuando sientas la presión, men, esa es la clave
Sigo firme, me paro en la mía y que van a decirme
El príncipe del verso, no vayan a confundirme

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Tienes que ser el flow, brother!
A la buena o a la mala!
Cohitre de monte!
Y es que son años, mi pana, luchando!
Imagínate, ""Las Gárgolas"" otra vez!
El mismo flavor, otra vez!
Los veteranos!
Y la nueva generación!
Tiene que ser saoco!
Tu sabes!
Las gárgolas!
En la calle!
En la clave!
En el corazón del pueblo!
Eso tiene que ser!",Pa' Mi Ponce (Intro),2007

Esto es pa ti, tu lo sabe

Yo eh guerriado
Eh sufrido eh gozado
Con mil mujeres me eh enredado
Demasiado

Por lo mas oscuro
Y tenebroso eh pasado
Eh sabido lo qu'eh estar arriba
Y estar apagado

Yo eh hecho casi todo en esta vida
Me e visto sin salida
La esperanza perdida
Pero antes que se me apage la luz
Quiero decirte nunca eh encontrado un amor como tu ma

Yo me eh pasado tratando en el mundo buscado
Un amor como tu

No tengo fuerzas ya no puedo encontrar

Por darme una hermosa familia
Te agradesco

Por tratarme y darme lo que ni merezco

Yo queria limpiar mi alma y mi corazón
Se que me eh comportado como un ladrón
Por robar tu alegría te pido perdón

Yo me eh pasado tratando en el mundo buscado
Un amor como tu
No tengo fuerzas ya no puedo encontrar
(No puedo)
Un amor como tu

Por ti veo la vida de otro color
No siento el dolor
Acostumbrado a tu olor
En las noches tu calor

Quien diría pensé que nunca conocería el amor
Quiero que seas feliz conmigo o sin mi
Tu sabe ma yo 'toy pa ti
Después de haber perdido tanto el tiempo por ahí
Entendí ke lo ke busco esta frente a mi

Yo me eh pasado tratando en el mundo buscado
Un amor como tu

Cada vez que me ves, yo sé que tiemblas 
No hay misterios de tí, que yo no entienda 
Por qué tratas de ocultar
Que yo soy parte de tí? 

Vives
Esperando un amor que no recibes 
Sin que llegue la dicha que persigues 
Y es cosa muy natural!

Hubo un adiós que no derrotó al corazón
Igual que una raíz mi presencia quedó
Se que en la vida un día mandó la razón
Pero no se escapó del ayer tu corazón

Si la estás pasando bien
Quieres algo de beber
Tráete a tu amiga
Que para ella tengo un amigo también

Deja a tu amiga y a mi amigo solos
Vámonos tú y yo perfecto en una esquina
Cuando estemos guayando y la música motiva
No te hagas la fina sabes lo que se aproxima

Deja a tu amiga y a mi amigo solos
Vámonos tu y yo perfecto en una esquina
Cuando estemos guayando y la música motiva
No te hagas la fina sabes lo que se aproxima

Y tu sabes como es
Suéltate lo tuyo bebe
Con movimientos lentos tas calentándome
Nos fuimos a fichar tirar fichas
Donde nadie nos ve
Llámate dos amiguitas pal tres pa' tres
Es mas dale mami que nos fuimos palca’
Seguimos aplastando con Farruko y arca
Hoy nos quieren llevarnos la gatica
Sin líos tranquila que yo ando con los míos

Deja a tu amiga y a mi amigo solos
Como tu y yo perfecto en una esquina
Cuando estemos guayando
Y la música motiva
No te hagas la fila sabes lo que se aproxima

Deja a tu amiga y a mi amigo solos
Como tú y yo perfecto en una esquina
Cuando estemos guayando
Y la música motiva
No te hagas la fina sabes lo que se aproxima

Vamos pa' mi mansión
Que yo tengo un patio bien
Prendo un blon
Jacuzzi, coronitas y reggaeton
Me dice tu amiga que tu novio es un lambon
Que no te trataba bien por eso se le fue el avión
Y yo aqui esperando que te sueltes
Espera que este amigo se manifieste
Apágale la luz déjalo fusionarse
Tranquila bebe que en mi casa hay control
Y yo no entiendo porque no quieres ser de mi corillo
Tu novio esta pelao' mami yo casi soy millo
Y te hablo claro sencillo no quiero enamorarte
Yo me conformo con ser tu chico

Yo estoy pa' ti como tu estas pa' mi
Dale hagámoslo solido y vámonos de aquí
Tu si estas pa' mi yo me pongo pa' ti
Vamos a fuego solo te pregunto a ti

Dime beba si la tas pasando bien
Quieres algo de beber
Traite a tu amiga
Que para ella tengo un amigo también

Dime beba si la tas pasando bien
Quieres algo e beber
Traite a tu amiga
Que para ella tengo un amigo también

Von Freeman,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2001

Von Freeman With The Chico Freeman Quartet,"Comes a rain storm put rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow storm you can get a little heat

Blow a tire you can buy another shoe
Comes love nothing can be done

Don't try hiding cause there isn't any use
You'll start sliding when your heart turns on the juice

Von Hertzen Brothers,"I was banging on the door when I came to realize
I would need a miracle to get a taste of paradise

I used to get very very lonesome
And jealous of everyone else who was playing in the rain
And I never really came to understand
Why happiness belonged to the other kids, not me in any way

I couldn't go out to play

The little child within myself
Couldn't learn to read the signs
I kept hiding within myself
Like a bird afraid to fly
With no fire within myself
I couldn't burn to reach the skies
The child within myself was a mess and yes
I needed a miracle to open the gates
For the light to kick out loneliness

What I need is a miracle
All, all I need is a miracle

The keeper of the door faced me eye to eye
I couldn't let the mirror fall for the fear I would break inside

The little child within myself
Couldn't learn to read the signs
I kept hiding within myself
Like a bird afraid to fly
With no fire within myself
I couldn't burn to reach the skies

And though I tried and tried to step into the light

What I need is a miracle
All, all I need is a miracle

All what I need is a miracle
All, all I need is a miracle",Miracle,2011

With the sound of music,
With songs they have sung,
For a thousand years.

With the sound of music.

Of the birds that rise from the lake
To the trees.

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze,
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night,
Like a lark who is learning to pray.

Now I understand what you tried to say to me,
How you suffered for your sanity,
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen, they did not know how.
Perhaps they'll listen now. 
For they could not love you,
But still your love was true.
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night,
You took your life, as lovers often do.
But I could have told you, Vincent,
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you. 
Starry, starry night.
Portraits hung in empty halls,
Frameless head on nameless walls,
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
Like the strangers that you've met,
The ragged men in the ragged clothes,
The silver thorn of bloody rose,
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow. 
Now I think I know what you tried to say to me,
How you suffered for your sanity,
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen, they're not listening still.
Perhaps they never will.",Vincent (Starry Starry Night),1999
Vonda Shepard,"As I walk this land with broken dreams 
I have visions of many things 
Love's happiness is just an illusion 
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the brokenhearted 
Who had love that's now departed? 
I know I've got to find 
Some kind of peace of mind, maybe 
The fruits of love grow all around 
But for me they come a-tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger 
I can't stand this pain much longer 
I walk in shadows searching for light 
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care 
Always moving and going nowhere 
What becomes of the brokenhearted 
Who had love that's now departed? 
I know I've got to find 
Some kind of peace of mind, maybe 
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
Oh, he is lost; there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending
Now what's become of the broken-hearted 
Who had love that's now departed? 
I know I've got to find 
Some kind of peace of mind 
I'll be searching everywhere 
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking every day 
I know I'm gonna find a way 
Nothing's gonna stop me now 
I will find a way somehow

Who, if he really does exist,
Why did he desert me?

If he loves you so

That's just his arms
If you want to know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss
Kiss him and squeeze him tight
And find out what you want to know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss

Been under construction for two years

It's like the game is haunted 'cause there's so many ghostwriters

You stayed in, with so many bosses, why are they still
Layin niggas off they job? Nigga, for real?
Gon' give a nigga a gig then
Help a brother get up out this pigpen
But nobody wants to keep it pimpin' or a hundred and ten
So with this pen I begin to illustrate from within, boy (boy)

See Picasso couldn't blend, put it all together or fit in
I'm like a crocodile walkin' 'round with alligator skin

We gon' la-la-lay it down every fucking time we see 'em
Make the club get crunk, yeah, we them type of people
But wait, it's not a sequel, no wait, it's BB's prequel
The beginnin' before the beginnin', spend it how you spend it
Then, if you sell dope nigga stack it when you get it
Can't trick it, or spend it until it's gone

Come in, have a chair. Man we love your sound
Yeah we love your hair. Come on boy,
Can you fill these shoes?
Step back, take a look. You could rule the world
With your style, your hooks. Come on boy,
You just can't refuse.

Oh yeah here it comes.
Take a little more than the people give you.
Oh yeah, livin' like a game.
Oh no, there it goes.
Where is all the love that the people showed you?
Oh no where is all this fame?
I've seen the good times.
The limousines and cigars and fine wines
That only lead to the scars and hard times
That seem to come my way.
Payin' dues is a hard life.
Give a little more to the people who have made you.
What you are today.

Peace through escapism, so it won't bury me.

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

Takes a little longer
Walk before the house where we had our games
Suffering life, play, making, we discovered fire

People like you made me so much stronger
People like you made me question blame
Huddled in strength like birds on a sloping wire

Hearing your voice makes me so uneasy
Hearing your voice makes me question fame
Money is deaf to the sound of a lover's cry

The language of loss made me so much older
The language of loss made me lose my grip
The language of loss made me silent as a newborn child

'cause everything moves in a shifting cycle
The unison soars and the pressure dips
Making our way steadfast in the skyward mile

And baby I know I will see you someday
Building your house on the very street
You severed your mother's life from your father's land

Finish your home we can join them this way
We talked about peace and a little dream
Marriage and love and divorce we don't understand

And you know I have to sway my leaves and branches slowly 
Out in the sun, like the silent shout of youth

And we ask why do we take these leaps and chances
Because we have no choice but to wither into truth

And I dreamed you were there
All the vital signs were standing
When I dreamed you were with me
With the summer at my back

And I dreamed you were there
So complete and undemanding
We know the love that gives
Is what the living always lack

And do you still think about me?
Yes I am here, waging battle with this version of myself

Buried in this house, this wooden graveyard by the sea
We push away our families to understand our needs
The love and all the hate I used to hold in front of me

Restless nights, all dizzy spells, all sand between my sheets
Showing signs of thirst like dried out boardwalk-blistered feet
And now I know I never knew about you, only me
We carried this inside like some disease we couldn't beat

But we could work, try to live and get by
To make our family in a second-floor apartment
Standing on a threshold, body out and flesh cold
Go ahead and celebrate the things you lost

Try to breathe, to flex and release
To cry and work out with the underrate apartment
Moments are a lifetime
Nothing in a straight line
This will take a little while just to shake things off

Down by water's edge, under the dying tree
I let my body slip, something inside of me
But when I came around some kind of murky face
I don't ever want to be alone like this

And I will tuck into you like I always long to be
Shadows just a shade of light not darkness in degree
Oh it was you who knew me first, saw this wasn't meant for kids like me
Some brutal natural force we only feel we never see

But as you grip the tide, you blundered aside
Your heads got smaller until they vanished into silence
Sinking in a white foam, running to a new home
We can only understand the things we see

You cease, desist, and leave me like this
The eyes wide open in the beauty of the bright lights
Standing on a threshold, body out and flesh cold
I don't ever want to be alone like this, no

I have no choice but to be vicious on my feet
I never sleep, I never eat
I am learning how to be lost completely
I want to be found, be craved like things we push away
These patterns cut like every day
I need you to reach, I need you to need me

Down by water's edge, under a dying tree
I let my body slip, something inside of me
But when I came around some kind of murky face
Shaking my bones, put me back in my place

The day that someone else would play love's foolish game with me

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh",Poor Little Fool,2006

Nos enamoramos 
Why al inicio nada resulto fasil
Tubimos todo el mundo en contra

why sigue siendo asi 
Pero luchamos why aqui juntos estamos
Amandonos?

why nada pudo ocn este amor( este amor)
No pudieron separarnos
Why mientras mas difisil mas yo siento que yo te amo
Asi es el amor!!!

Coro.

Te jure que nadie nos separaria
Junto hasta el final
Inseparables como arena why el mar
Esto no va a terminar ( esto no va a terminar)
Por que nos vamos a amar

Te jure que nadie nos separaria
Junto hasta el final
Inseparables como arena why el mar
Esto no va a terminar 
Por que nos vamos a amar( por que nos vamos amar)





Rap.

Mi Corazon contigo se impacto
Testigo a sido el tiempo que nada nos separo
Se que lo que dentro siento si es amor
Por eso cuando te beso es como un choke de passion
Asi que las palabras estan de mas
Tu why yo hasta la muerte siempre vamos a estar
No tendra final lo nuestro es real
Imposible que se acabe lo que DIOS quizo crear
Yo soy el rey tu eres mi baby
Si yo fuera el presidente tu fueras my first lady
Eres para mi la mas sexy mami
Asi que en esto soy yo tambien tu papi
Por ti luchara hasta con un ejercito de mara
Con tal de amanecer contigo en cada madrugada
Ya nada nos separa somos uno no dos
Un sentimiento sin barrera asi es el amor.


Coro.

Te jure que nadie nos separaria
Junto hasta el final
Inseparables como arena why el mar
Esto no va a terminar ( esto no va a terminar)
Por que nos vamos a amar

Te jure que nadie nos separaria
Junto hasta el final
Inseparables como arena why el mar
Esto no va a terminar 
Por que nos vamos a amar( por que nos vamos amar)


Rap.

Inseparables somos tu why yo
Por mas que trataron nuestro amor cresio
Subio como la espuma libre sin pena why sin duda
Tu figura me enloquese como tu no existe una
Asi que todo eso que fue causa de tropiezo
A sido solo un ejemplo de que nuestro amore s ciego
Qeu nada ni nadie puede con los dos
Que todo lo pasado se fue al safacon
Enamorados atados juntos why fucionados
Como traje confecionado a la medida asi estamos
Por ti yo me derrito como vela ma 
Why mas cuando tan dulcet you me dices pa
Dejemos tras sin sabores ya 
Vamos mas alla luchemos como iack
Ya nada nos detiene somos uno no dos
Un sentimiento sin barrera asi es el amor.


Why nada pudo ocn este amor( este amor)
No pudieron separarnos
Why mientras mas difisil mas yo siento que yo te amo
Asi es el amor!!!

Coro.

Te jure que nadie nos separaria
Junto hasta el final
Inseparables como arena why el mar
Esto no va a terminar ( esto no va a terminar)
Por que nos vamos a amar

Te jure que nadie nos separaria
Junto hasta el final
Inseparables como arena why el mar
Esto no va a terminar 
Por que nos vamos a amar( por que nos vamos amar)
