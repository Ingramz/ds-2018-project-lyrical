Basement Jaxx,"When I met you 
You were sexy 
You were freaky 
I thought my luck was in 
Then I noticed, 
You were crazy 
I did not know what to do 
'cause I thought it was love 

Crazy Girl (Freaky) 
Crazy Girl (Freaky) 

What we had now its gone 

I want something that you cannot give 
Somewhere where the sun will shine 
Why must we be so incompatible 
Freaky 'cause I thought I was in love

Basement Jaxx,"Hehe hehe he...
What is freaky?
Freaky is a... a whole lot of magic bottled up,
In one little space.

It just needs to escape!
But you know what?

And the laughter when I can't stop yawning
But the tears on the pillow have dried my dear
Gonna let it all go 'cause I have no fear

Crazy cat inside your dream

With a glass of bubbly and my brand new shoes
Found the restaurant on the internet
This Mexican place, but they haven't finished it yet

""I love your eyes, your lips, your hands, your toes""
He seem intoxicated
As he started to chat a little X rated
I put my fingers to his lips and said

Just take it slowly boy, there's no need to rush it

Come on boy, don't play it tough

So the food was good, I had a chicken fajita
But he finished my plate and had four margaritas
As we gazed into each other's eyes
His ex walked in with her brand new guy

My man he tried to jump on me
To kiss my arms, my legs, my hips, my lips
He knocked the drinks everywhere
As he started to make an apology, I covered his mouth with my hand and said

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

I'm proof that hard work pays off
On reined that road I stayed off

He wanted every luxury that money could bring
He fancied himself as a King of the castle
Impressing all the ladies with the size of his car
But none of them would have it
They left the morning after
As a giver of love he was a walking disaster

Down a road that's paved with gold but takes away your soul

A master of disguise

Then one night he met a beautiful girl
She was a viable concern, he couldn't help thinking
But he ran out of small talk and started to panic
The comedy was turning into something tragic
Never mix business with pleasure
You can play them independently but never together

The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush

It's a girl, it's a rhyme, it's a cold, it's the mumps

A snail, a riddle, a wasp, a stain

A snake, a stick, it is John, it is Joe
A fish, a flash, a silvery glow

The bed of the well, the end of the line
The dismay on the face, it's a loss, it's a find

A spear, a spike, a point, a nail
A drip, drip, drip, drop, the end of the day

Basia,"""Tender feelings heal with flowers
When your woes and sorrows leave you
Overwhelmed
For the state of endless sadness or
Uncompleted mourning
Take star of Bethlehem,
There's willow if bitter, when helpless
Wild rose,
Some sunshine wattle revives all lost hopes""
But for a simple case of longing
What are we to do when homeless in our
Hearts and souls
 
Some of us take daring chances following our
Lovers
The passion we can trust
Others just cannot sit still
They're driven by the power of mighty
Wanderlust
Wherever we go, god, we're trying so hard
To make every place feel like home left behind
But despite of all endeavours--nothing
Changed,
As ever--we're homeless in our hearts
 
But I'm yearning no more
'Cause I found my home in you
And now it's where I belong
I gave up the world to be with you
 
Come to me, I'll soothe your yearning
 
Is this what you've always dreamed of
The aim of our desire is hard to recognize
It often stares you in the face and yet, against
All reason,
Takes the longest time to find
You circle the globe, go native, go far
But it's not a country or a town, not a house
What's the use of distant travel if only to
Discover you're homeless in your heart
 
But I'm yearning no more
'Cause I found my home in you
And now it's where I belong
I gave up the world to be with you
 
So come to me, let me soothe your yearning.",Yearning,1998

What more can I pray for

I play a waiting game
?Cause once again the spring is all around

I know so well your smiling face
That greets me every day
You stand by me I stand by you
All?s good and well, so
Day by day and night by night
I play a waiting game
?Cause my world will soon be turning upside down
In summer

Blame it on the summer
I can?t help how summer makes me feel
Blame it on the summer
I don?t care if what I feel is real
Blame it on the summer
I can?t explain what summer makes me do
I want to break away and fly away
?Cause summer makes me run away from you

Years go by a playful time
Resign come what may
You keep on loving me
And I still keep on wishing
?Cause every hour here in silence
The game remains the same
And the summer makes my world turn upside down
Oh, summer

Others take risks to survive

Basil Codolban Et Son Orchestre,"Refrain:
Parlez-moi d'amour,
Redites-moi des choses tendres,
Votre beau discours,
Mon coeur n'est pas las de l'entendre.
Pourvu que toujours
Vous répétiez ces mots suprêmes :
Je vous aime.

Vous savez bien
Que dans le fond, je n'en crois rien,
Mais cependant je veux encore,
Ecouter ce mot que j'adore,
Votre voix aux sons caressants,
Qui le murmure en frémissant,
Me berce de sa belle histoire,
Et malgré moi je veux y croire.

Refrain

Il est si doux
Mon cher trésor, d'être un peu fou,
La vie est parfois trop amère,
Si l'on ne croit pas aux chimères,
Le chagrin est vite apaisé,
Et le console d'un baiser,
Du coeur on guérit la blessure,
Par un serment qui le rassure.

Basil Fung,"Love is a hunger
That burns in my soul
But you never notice the pain 
Love is an anchor
That won't let me go
I reach out to hold you 
But you push me away
You always convince me to stay 

And I wonder why
We hold on with tears in our eyes
And I wonder why
We have to break down to just make 
Things right
And I wonder why 
I can't seem to tell you goodbye
Yeah, I wonder why

I'm no angel
With my selfish pride
But I love you more every day
Love is an anger
That builds up inside
As the tears of frustration
Roll down my face
Why does love always have to turn

Check it out, check it out
I got my whole crew in the house
and we gon' turn this house into a home
straight up and down
I got my man Melo T in the house
I got my man Preacher Earl in the house
I got my man Asu in the house
I got my man Gang Starr in the house
and to my brother Smooth B is in the house
and I'm Greg N-i-c-e, I'm in the house
So peep it

[ VERSE 1: Greg Nice ]
I got a shitload of story tales in my sack
Please come in, hang your coat on the rag
While you at it, make my coffee black
So I can get the monkey from off my back
15 cents minus 5 is a dime
Sexy young ladies, let's intertwine
Greg N-i-c-e ran it down the line-line

[ VERSE 2: Preacher Earl ]
I'm the P-r-e-a-c-h-e-r, uh
Preacher Earl and I'm considered a superstar
Pick up the microphone and I proceed to rock 'n roll
By the time I sweat I'm out of control
I'm like a locomotive goin express
My lyrics written in spraypaint on the wall (ssss...) def
I'm from Uptown, I'm a gangster from the projects
Either or, take it all, get much respect
Destined for fame when I'm goin for mine
This, this is how I run it down the line

[ VERSE 3: Melo T ]
Hey yo, beats, styles, mics I be flashin
If you step up step in a orderly fashion
See, I collect the dough for the show and then I'm dashin
House parties I'm crashin, pool parties I'm splashin
Eatin candy yams, drinkin Baby Sham, breakin down ( ? )
Got the masterplan, glance at the Melo stance
Arms are crisscrossed, posture rasta
When I wanna go to the mall, I need a helicopter
Rrrrring - I think that's my time
Yo, (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 4: Bass Blaster ]
The biggeda-Bass Blaster with a tongue-twistin rhyme
(This is how we run it down the line)
Yo, literally, literary literature
Six slippery Seals slippin silently ashore
Sally sold seashells down by the seashore
Sold two shells but couldn't see to sell no more
Beautiful babblin brooks bubba between blossom and banks
Brothers above the Brooks take a punch off the plank
A big black bug bit a big black bear, bit him on the rear
The bear was big but the bug didn't care, he had no fear
 
How much would could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Yo, I don't know, all I know is I say it good
Asu, you got the funky, funky rhymes
Yo my brother, run it down the line

[ VERSE 5: Asu ]
Yo, rhymes is rippin and the mic is passed to me
It was too young so they got me for statuatory
Don't take me for granted, punk, yeah, and think I'm worthless
Fuck movin mountains I move planets and you'll be earthless
You don't wanna battle Asu, all I leave is fossils
Lethal Weapons Die Harder cause the Mission's Impossible
And my rhymes is riper, I'm ready to come crisper
Old jacks know that so they go back and whisper
Takin surveys, gettin nervous, I'm just too worthy
They can't stand me and say, 'He can't be from Jersey'

[ VERSE 6: Guru ]
Mad, mad response I'm catchin just as soon as I step into the place
That's why a smile's on my face
I got styles that you trace with haste but I'm too deep
Lots of the ladies I meet, I must be sweet
So I say hold up and wait up and then listen here
My rhymes come crisp and clear, but beware
My format is all that, my concept's refined
The Gang to the S-t-a-double r shines
Chumps be losin it, abusin it, not gainin
So there my gain is they vanish while I'm remainin
And twice as Nice with a Smooth groove I end my rhyme
And yo (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 7: Smooth B ]
Yeah, lyrical, financial and spiritual
A dream of touchin my style would take a miracle
You didn't know how deadly was my flow as I grow
And bumrush and crush any foe
But I prefer to have a good time when I rhyme
But lately I have had to refine and be sublime
Cause sometimes some people don't understand
That I'm a man with ambitious plans and I stand to live grand
And they fight with all their money invested to hold me back
But now I'm featuring the mack pack
Smooth B, you know I'm feelin fine
(This is how we run it down the line)

[ Greg Nice ]
As I go on

to my man Slick Nick

Bass Odyssey,"You see, you're born to die
Well that's infinite sadness
I'm standing on the edge of complete madness
Shut my eyes
Yes, I love the blackness
I Journey down deep into the heart of darkness
Funny how it goes when it seems on tow
There's a whole entire world on remote control soul

With the writing on the wall
It's so strange to think I'm wrapped around your finger
Just when I'm all alone
It's so cold inside, so cold that I can't figure

They got people, to keep you in step
And nothing sounds fresh, there was no positive flow from the west
And every kid went to school wearing a bullet-proof vest
It sounds like a mess, I like my shit to be clear
It's all that subliminal that keeps me in fear
And makes me beware of even the man in the mirror
You never know, he might be the one to pull the trigger

In the darkness of my dream
I can see that ray of light, that you control me
Everything must have a price
So it's not hard to understand that you can own me

With the writing on the wall
It's so strange to think I'm wrapped around your finger
Just when I'm all alone
It's so cold inside, so cold that I can't figure

It's my mission that I'm on this ""why?"" everytime
I grab the mic, I drop the bomb
And in my rhyme you will detect
in between the slang, traces of intellect
But from that, don't expect that I""m here to teach or to preach
I'm all about gettin' about going when I speak
And I'm takin' you higher than the peaks
That be in the fall, it's nineteen nine
And I'm still walkin' tall
There was a few times that I thought I might fall
And lose it all
But I got myself together
Had to reaffirm my grip
So now you better believe that I'll always come equipped
Never slip, I always keep my balance
I rose to the occasion and I took up the challenge
Now tell me, can you imagine, a world where freedom is a threat
And sex isn't wet, and ever better yet
You take caution just before you step

In the darkness of my dream
I can see that ray of light, that you control me
Everything must have a price
So it's not hard to understand that you can own me

With the writing on the wall
It's so strange to think I'm wrapped around your finger
Just when I'm all alone
It's so cold inside, so cold that I can't figure

You see, you're born to die
Well that's infinite sadness

Hey, you, wake up, wake up

Oh,oh,oh I?ll hold out (persereve) until I go home to my bed
För att sedan börja om och bli väckt på morgonen, snälla låt mig somna igen!
Because later(it) starts again and being awake in the morning,(I?ll) bag (you) :make me sleep again
Ensam så tvingar jag mig upp, det är då fan att det ska vara så svårt,

Jag öppnar min dörr, hör morgon trafiken
Som kör förbi på tylövägen.
Dom är på väg mot hav o bad o strand,
Blottade kroppar på tylösand.

Ska ni med på en fest en sån fest som varar hela natten lång,
Ska ni med till hav o sand,
Till den enda strand som heter strand tylösand
WoooOoo
Ska ni med.....SKA NI MEEEEED!
Vi ska till stranden och glida!

Kännslor som flödar, blickar som får mitt hjärta å banka,
Nu är sommarn här. Heta nätter med erotisk atmosfär,
Do o jag vi glider aldrig isär,
Vi kan somna I en dyna av sand o när vi
Vaknar så ser vi solen skina.
Vi ligger kvar en stund å kysser varann
Å sen jag viskar vi ska till stranden och glida.

Ska ni med på en fest en sån fest som varar hela natten lång,
Ska ni med till hav o sand,
Till den enda strand som heter strand tylösand
WoooOoo
Ska ni med.

Lo chiamano il Cristo Santissimo, perché porta una croce

Diviso a metà strada tra il cielo e Milano
Mi chiedo cosa resterà di questo suono
Per ogni canzone che odio ce n'è un'altra che amo
Da sempre sono metà rapper metà uomo

Quanto tempo è passato
È da un po che non ci sentiamo
Siamo sempre gli stessi, noi che non ci smentiamo
Noi che non ci svendiamo
Boh ma per quale principio?
Stare su un precipizio dal principio
Qua la mano!
Metà schiavo metà sovrano
Confini e zone
Dividono a metà il mio nome
Ridefinizione
Deridono quei fra il mio nome
Ma non sanno come
Ne chi ha scritto il copione a piú di una generazione
Testamenti e colli si muovono in sincrono
Guardami li disintegro
Sono vestiti in intimo
Guardami come allaccio questi boots
Ridicolo
Guardami come taglio questi loop
Ridicolo
Studia le mosse, guardami negli occhi
Leggi il mio percorso
Fatti qualche viaggio in piú nel mondo
A casa sei già morto
La musica ha le immagini e i sapori classici
Cantine magiche, calici pieni e piatti carichi
La carne cruda, la pelle nuda e un sigaro da cuba
Un altra notte nel parcheggio
E un altra barra cruda
La vita spezza il corso stesso degli eventi
Piú ti eviti piú tutto ciò che sei è ciò che poi diventi
Perchè poi ti spaventi, quando hai sonno alle 20
E cerchi di mentire a te stesso, quanto siamo incoerenti
Lo sai da dove vengo
Conosci questo suono
Sai cosa voglio e cosa sono

Diviso a metà strada tra il cielo e milano
Mi chiedo cosa resterà di questo suono
Per ogni canzone che odio ce n'è un'altra che amo
Da sempre sono metà rapper metà uomo

Nel 97 non sapevo chi avevo davanti
Pensavo un rolex e una lex fossero importanti
Pensavo a prendermi i gioielli e a stare coi giganti
Poi ho capito la differenza tra saggi e ignoranti
Niente di piú semplice e spontaneo
È un mare di casini, come nel mediterraneo
Diviso da una scure tra famiglia e lavoro
Tra voi e loro
Non trovo il suono
Sono abbagliato dai tuoi dischi d'oro
Quando cazzo bro ti togli
Quando ti ripigli?
Pensavo sempre al portafogli
Adesso porto i figli
Resto sul pezzo e mi scarico i nuovi dischi
I colleghi nel backstage che mi dicono ""non capisci""
I ragazzi sopra il palco si muovono come zombie
Ti muovi meglio tu nel tuo nuovo maglione a rombi
Un altro disco nel cestino e vedi come rimo
Cercami un motivo
Dammi il braccio e mi riprendo un dito
C'è sempre un nuovo inizio a metà corsa
C'è sempre un nuovo amore quando si divorzia
Nuovi mostri stringono una nuova morsa
Nuovi box per una nuova sosta
Nuovi esploratori su una nuova costa
Metà rapper metà rockstar
Sapendo che domani ho nuovi palchi per la mostra
Metà papà metà marito, metà iniziato, mezzo già finito
Metà ubriacato, mezzo litro dopo un mezzo litro

Bassi Maestro,"Strano come il mondo va sempre al contrario
Sei nella giusta direzione, sull'altro binario
Ti sei svegliato a colazione, ma hai sbagliato orario
Volevi uccidermi col flow, hai mandato un sicario
Il prezzo è caro, è garantito dopo i quarant'anni
Puoi fare i conti coi tuoi drammi, riesci a complicarli
Ti guardi indietro e ti accorgi che non potrai più amarli
Sono i ricordi un po' sbiaditi mischiati agli sbagli
Per questo parli linguaggi che in pochi capiranno
Per questo parti per viaggi che non ricorderanno
Ma in quanti ancora sanno che non basta un ""ma"" non basta un ""forse""

Suono live per i frà, faccio il check, poi in hotel
Riposo una minima, svuoto prima il minibar
Che al tuo bar sembro il gorilla della réclame
Dini è qua, mica roba minimal
Roba che frantuma nuche tipo che finisci dritto in clinica
Fottiti con i tuoi shot, passami una vodka liscia
E vedi che serata gli organizzo a quello che organizza
Yes yes, giù dai tempi dello Zero Stress
Porto il dramma dentro i tuoi schermi come fa [?]
Figlio degli '80 come Marton Sandy
Poi a fine serata alla bertender chiedo un altro brandy
Giù col meglio, ma era meglio prima
Meglio Gaber, meglio Mina
Sparo raggi laser quando fai una rima
Ho bombe vere, niente finto smog
E sono cazzi da cagare come quando mangi gli hot dog

Ti vedo mezzo spento, tira su le mani

Esci dal corpo, pianeti contro
Tutti che cercano ogni genere di comfort
45 il numero di scarpa, pronto?
Sempre da solo, ci provi da una vita
Se vai al top tutti vogliono una spinta
In studio a lavorare con Bassi, premiata ditta
È come cucinare cristalli con Jesse Pinkman
Ho lo stress che sale e la notte scende
Ho l'amnesia che mi calma quando serve
Mostrami ciò che sei con l'iPhone 7
Però dal vivo è molto meglio, da sempre
Il mio stile è TruceKlan, perché brucia il palco
Un mix tra Donnie Darko e Noyz Narcos
Il beat esalta i fan, li manda in alto

Questa è per i miei fratelli che hanno poco cash
Vite uguali, sempre quelle, piene di stress
Che poteva andare meglio, invece va così
È sempre in testa quell'idea per uscire da qui

Per i miei ragazzi che hanno poco cash in tasca
Presi male perché vivono una vita e basta
Con la fretta della paga a fine mese
Per svoltare un altro sabato in paese
Un altro sabato di spese, un'altra notte in discoteca
E la mattina a testa bassa in biblioteca
Per chi cerca un'istruzione dopo la distruzione
Dopo che ha visto zone al confine della ragione
Chi se ne fa una ragione si arrende al male minore
Ed è ""Sissignore"" dalle sette di mattina alla pensione
Ne ho visti di padroni senza cuore
Rubare il Sole alle persone buone, renderle disgustose
Ma chi non ha svoltato con la musica lo sa
Quanto cazzo è dura campare nella città
Dove tutto rema contro e chiede ancora più energie
Piramidi e dinastie degli altri, ma non le mie
Mi servono perché aspettiamo un figlio
Mi servono per stare un po' tranquillo
Se voi non me li date me li piglio
In qualche modo gonfiano le tasche vuote
E un nuovo giorno è un nuovo dramma sulle sette note
Se sei una testa indipendente con le nuove idee
Con i milioni sempre in testa come Dr. Dre
Che hai già lasciato il lavoro per fare solo il rap
Tutto il mio rispetto va a te

Poteva andar peggio dall'altro verso, però ora almeno vedo [?]
Mi servono, sento che dopo mi sentirò solo, o almeno così dicono
Ho un amico, sa che se trovassi un tesoro mi converrebbe stare zitto
Non posso sapere a che velocità vanno i cash, lo chiederò a Bassi
Sento fastidio sotto le suolette, le Nike non vogliono sassi
Non ho un invito se mi hanno obbligato a seguire le regole
Fossi un felino col passo felpato cadi dalle tegole
So che la mia gente vuole cash
Vuole uscire dagli schemi, vogliono stare sereni
Se vogliono non posso, è una legge
'Fanculo seguire il gregge, 'fanculo queste puttane
Baciano le guance solo per marchiare il territorio, ma mi chiedo chi le ha chieste
Darebbero l'anima per due monete, dovreste farvi un giro a messa
Mi riconosci frà, italiano
Non sai maneggiarla, la carta taglia
Non ti puoi fidare di qualsiasi taglio
Non ti confidare frà, la carta canta
Se mi trovi in strada con la faccia stanca
È perché è un'altra notte e voglio farla franca
Mi prendo male come quando spezzo il pezzo da cinquanta

Giorni pesi
Sempre troppo tesi
Ognuno i suoi problemi
Non è la vita che ti meriti
Nessuno è nato ieri
Ho cominciato quando niente era sicuro
C'ho creduto, l'ho creato, l'ho cresciuto
L'ho ingrassato e l'ho vissuto
Ho visto questa merda andare in mille direzioni opposte
Tornare a casa con le gambe rotte
Quando si faceva notte
I bro senza le palle
Tutti a nanna, a casa con la mamma
I bro con i coglioni
Fuori in strada per sfamare il dramma
Una regola sai che non cambia
Non voltarti mai indietro a guardarla
Questa vita è una troia, è bastarda
Per questo ci piace scoparla
Per questo rispettano Dini
Ancora in piedi, ma arrivo dai primi
Oggi non danno il caviale
Passano i cazzo di tortellini
La vita non chiede abbastanza
Non farla più stare in silenzio
Quando mi guardo allo specchio

Giù coi ragazzi, ma è fredda Milano
Tra i cuori caldi e le strette di mano
A volte si cade, ma dopo saliamo
Corri bro, senti il richiamo!

Rimango solo
Giù con Sano Bis, da vent'anni sto fuori dal coro
Dal lato buono
Beh, sali sul ring, non vale guardarmi dal trono
Da uomo a uomo
Non voglio né dissing né foto né promo
Io ho messo nei dischi la rabbia di un uomo
Di modo che il mondo si eclissi e che sappia chi sono
Mangio il tuo odio
Sono sadico e ingordo
Dammi il vuoto e ci mastico intorno
Sono Massimo l'ispanico
Ma esamino un kalashnikov già carico
Di panico, miro e calibro il colpo
É così che ingravido il foglio
É sadico il sogno di stare al mio posto soltanto per tacito accordo
Vale tutto, nulla è condannato
Sarò nudo e crudo come Joe D'Amato
Sono io il futuro, è stato sdoganato
Tu l'hai preso in culo, tutto programmato
Uno ad uno vi ho già sputtanato
Sono in ogni dove come il glutammato
Scrivo la tua morte, firmo punto e a capo
Sono Tutankhamon con la tuta camo
Mi faccio un tiro in divano con la calma piatta di un gringo chicano
Gli amici che amo mi chiamano Ciro
Perché se sto in giro poi ci roviniamo
E te
Non venire più parlare dei '90 a me
Che sto in campagna con il Novecinquanta e col 60 Herz

Tipo di rap, tipo di uomo
Quello che sono
Non chiedo perdono
Non c'è un supremo
Cosa c'è dopo non lo sapremo
Quindi restiamo, indi prendiamo e prenderemo
Mani basse, sotto lo sterno
Al lotto punto al terno
Per chi non osa: risate di scherno
Bingo, finché non mi estinguo
Prendo tutto, tutto e quello che stringo
Se solo sapessi perché mi stressi
Il motivo per cui in fondo siamo sempre gli stessi
E tengo tutto in tasca, a portata di mano
Così sia, e se lo porti via noi lo riprendiamo
E per un euro che prendo, è un altro che spendo
Non ci sto più dentro
Fumo lo stipendio
Vengo dal Nord, senti l'accento

Dentro fino al collo in questa merda da quand'ero un embrione
Da quanto ero in hangover non avevo parole
Adesso sono sobrio amore, dammi Hardcore 999
Mi sono fatto strada in questo nonsenso
Scrivendo a terra ciò che sento coi piedi sul pavimento
Il volume che resta a cento, il pattume che porto dentro
Dall tempo in cui il divo era seduto comodo giù nel Parlamento
Fondamentalmente un fondamentalista
Ho eliminato dei nemici ma ne ho ancora metà lista
La metà della metà di voi non sa
Che ho la fotta di un gruppo di ultras
In curva, ho insegnato anche al tuo papà
Non fermi la verità, questione di dignità
Non posso tirarmi indietro, so che farei un torto [?]
Unisco generazioni come i blocchi di LEGO
Non blocchi il diavolo in me, quando ringrazi prego
Dai blocchi alle strade del centro, lavavetri sul lato
Lava sul substrato e ti chiama il commissariato

Io ancora pluristellato, tu chiedi cos'è cambiato

Non è cambiato un cazzo
Voglio un posto in prima classe e lo riservo
Lo sognavo fin da quando ero un ragazzo
Ora ho un suono nuovo in testa e mi ci perdo
Sai, la vita non è sempre quella che aspetti
Questi cambiamenti mandano in crisi
Pochi amici veri che tu rispetti
Tutto il resto è finto, prendila easy
Era più semplice scrivere strofe da poco
Quando ero solo e da poco nel gioco
Quando la responsabilità chiama il controllo
Come un capocuoco, la stanza va a fuoco
Bruciano teste di marmo, no, non è più te che guardo
Non ho mai firmato nessun contratto
Ho una testa di ghiaccio, bro come chi vive a Malmö
Non sento più caldo, la circolazione è fottuta
Come per un vigile fatto
Ti ricopri d'oro e pistole di plastica, qui è solo vero metallo
Ti metti collane e pellicce perché vuoi sentirti qualcuno
Camicie perché vuoi un lavoro anche diurno
Pensi che basti cambiarti da fuori per saldare il turno
Non è così che funziona la storia
Quello che guadagni è tuo per sempre
Tutti i soldi regalati a quella troia
Li rivedi nelle tasche di altra gente
Dini ha le parole come fosse niente
Ho rispetto della mia e della tua gente

È il momento di alzare queste fottute tende

Dammi un microfono che distruggo il posto
Bro, non ti conosco
Non ho sentito la tua merda, sorry, non ti proppo
Non ho mai letto il post, guarda, non ho visto il video
Non sono stato al tuo concerto, ho impegni al pomeriggio
Non ho un cazzo da regalare, ho solo un flow regale
Con chi credevi di parlare, con Babbo Natale?
Faccio dischi da vent'anni e classici di Cristo
Tu non hai ancora vent'anni e li compri già su Discogs
Mi manchi di rispetto? Non sai che cazzo hai detto
Altro che là al ghetto, voi vi ho visto al laghetto
Con il mangime per i cigni e il pane raffermo
Ho l'esplosivo con gli ordigni, il whisky nel thermos
Lirico picnic, Dini col mic, please
Tu lascia perdere 'sta storia dell'hip hop, this is my shit
Ho milioni di barre, tu hai fatto una strofina
L'autolavaggio è il tuo futuro bro, strofina
Non è un miraggio, è vera merda quella che tu ascolti
Siete in ritardo dalla nascita, non siete pronti
È una questione di gusti alla bancarella
Tu vuoi una strumentale, la tua tipa vuole la cappella
Liricamente un king supremo, sopra la beat lo gremo
Fai le hit? Non credo, punto il dito al cielo
Ma nell'underground sono un Dio
Ho fatto un disco d'oro con un pezzo che non era il mio
Quaranta mesi di silenzio e dopo nuove bombe

Tuktok ng bundok na Kanyang inakyat
Tignan ko pa lang ako ay nilagnat
Dapat ako ang ipako sa cross
Dapat ako ay siyang nanlilimos
Nag-awad ng tawad sa ating Ama
Ngunit masama pa ang pinadama
Dadadadadadadadadada
Puro ako salita at dada
Sa biyaya ako'y naaatat
Pero kahit kailan 'di nagpasalamat
Nagduda ako sa kakayahan Mo
'Di ako nararapat Sa'yo
Masyado akong mapagmalaki
Pero kahit kailan, hindi Ka nag-higanti

Compensate to validate the loss

Bassix,"Now if there's a smile upon my face 
it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around

I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear

Weil die Tinte dieser Feder füllt dein Leben wieder aus
Lass Gedanken wieder frei und mach daraus ein Traum
Auch die Mauer um dein Herz bricht mein Stift wieder auf
Lass es regnen, schnei'n oder brenn' wenn ich will
Ich schenk' dir diese Worte und dein Kopf malt ein Bild
Also hass' oder lieb' es, was ist egal
Nur ein Gedanke an mein' Text und jede Zeile wird real
Tiefblau oder rabenschwarz,
Denn ich lass' ihre Augen hell leuchten, wie der Vollmond bei Mitternacht
Und wenn ich rappe
Hab ich jede Facette von Blutrot aus der Hölle bis zum Blau, das der Himmel hat

Ich muss das Graue mit Farbe füllen
Selbst das Schwarz glänzt strahlend schön
Der Pinsel nimmt ein Bad in Öl

Immer wenn ich schreib', hol' ich die Farben raus
Und den ganzen Rest, den man zum Malen braucht
Ich mal es auf, ja genau, fades Grau, Schwarz und Blau
Was ich denke steckt in diesen Bildern und sie sagen's laut
Grade raus, warte mal, es artet aus
Manchmal geh' ich über Grenzen doch dann bad' ich's aus
Und wenn alles zusammenfällt wie ein Kartenhaus
Is' kein Problem, ich mal 'n Haken drauf (Ah)
Ich bin kein Picasso, aber Hauptsache ich mach' was
Denn was immer dabei rauskommt, liegt im Auge des Betrachters
So sieht's aus wenn du's geschafft hast, man ich chill' nich' mehr am Block
Denn alle meine Worte mal 'n Bilder in dein' Kopf

Ich muss das Graue mit Farbe füllen
Selbst das Schwarz glänzt strahlend schön
Der Pinsel nimmt ein Bad in Öl
Soy como Pablo Picasso

Jedes Mal, wenn ich den Stift in meine Hand nehme
Entsteht, während ich schreibe, ein Gemälde
Ich starr' in die Leere Doch seh' diese Szene vor mir, ganz real nur vernebelt
Und jeder, der es irgendwann hört, wird das sehen
Was ich sah, und wird ein Teil von mir werden
Sie schauen durch meine Augen auf diese wunderschöne Welt mit ihren unscheinbar kleinen Kontroversen

Muster ordnen, Pinsel wechseln

Bastard Sons of Johnny Cash,"[Chorus]
The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

[Chorus: 2X]
Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
 
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something

[Chorus: 2X]
Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Bastiaan Ragas,"I tried to fill this emptiness inside of me
Unbearable pain, although I try, won't hide from me
They're telling me, you've found someone to keep you warm
Pretending not to hear
But it is plain to see
How happy I would be
You're not with him but still with me
It's time that I should face, someone took my place

[Chorus:]
I should've never let you go (I let you go)
You're right and I was wrong
I should've never let you go (I let you go)
Once we were, once we were one

I try to tell myself it would be just like before
Touching, you, loving you, always wanting more
You're telling me you're so in love with someone you've just met
Hey, I don't care I'm already over you already over you
How happy he must be
'Cause you're with him and not with me
It's time that I should face, someone took my place

Don't you that don't you know
I'll never let you go (don't go)",Never Let You Go,2000
Bastiaan Ragas,"The night was young an so was I
When she took me for a ride
And softly whispered in my ear
Hush now baby, don't you fear
She put a spell on me
Playing with my soul
Slowly undressing me
She made me lose control
She wanted me to

[Chorus:]
Wango tango all night long
Wango till the break of dawn
Taste of mango, sweet and strong
She made me lose my mind
She wanted me to 
Wango tango all around
Wango till the roof came down
Hearts on fire, wild romance
Wango tango so intense
So left for weeks without a trace
Then showed up with a smile on her face
A kind of magic in her eyes
Is she the devil in disguise
That night she was crying (she said)
I won't leave you anymore
Man I was dying
When she made her move on the floor
She wanted me to

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Your move in the floor
Tell me that I still need more
To satisfy my soul
A sign of fatal attraction
A case of love and affection
She makes me want to lose control",Wango Tango,2000
Bastiaan Ragas,"Every time I hold your hand,
I know you understand.
When I wake up in the night,
Afraid of the day,
You hold me tight.
And dark storms arise,
But I can bear the fight.
You give me wings,
A guiding light,
God, I feel the light.

When I am weak,
You are strong.
When I am lost,
You just carry on.
When days are sad,
You make me smile.
You can make me or break me,
But all you ever do - you complete me in every way.

Every time I lost my heart,
You never lost your head.
Yuo just waited
Till I would find
My head and heart again.

And dark storms arise,
But I can bear the fight.
You give me wings,
A guiding light,
God, I feel the light.

When I am weak,
You are strong.
When I am lost,
You just carry on.
When days are sad,
You make me smile.
You can make me or break me,
But all you ever do - you complete me.

If I ever lose you
For a moment out of sight,
I would wait for you
As the day turns into night.
Would there even be someone
Who just came and took your heart?
I'd be so lost without you.
It's you what I'm made of.

But all you ever do,
When I am weak,
You are strong.
When I am lost,
You just carry on.
When days are sad,
You make me smile.
You can make me or break me,
But all you ever do - you complete me in every way",You Complete Me,2001

Bastian Baker,"I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who out drew you
But it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who has seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Bastien Lallemant,"Le train qui file, qui file
Aussi vite que le temps
Me mènera-t-il à temps
Près de lui qui se meurt

Qui s’en va vers son trépas
A déjà fait le pas
Qui depuis si longtemps
Hésitait en mourant

Le souvenir demeure
De ce train qui se presse
Ramenant immobile
Mon reflet dans les champs

Qui plus figé que moi 
Que ce jour se levant
Qui plus triste que moi 
Le pays indifférent

Je revois qui s’allonge
Le soleil sur le quai
Qui s’allonge et qui grêle
Les ombres empressées

Je revois qui tombent en gouttes
Les larmes familières
Empêchant coûte que coûte

et moi je porte des babouches,
sur toi ça ne fait pas trop louche,
ça te donne une sacrée touche !
Ma mie qu’est vraiment très, très douce,
alors que je sors de ma douche,
Elle rigole, elle me pousse
à défiler en babouches.

Papa, toi tu mets des babouches,
elles te vont si bien tes babouches !
Sur toi, ça ne fait pas trop louche,
ça te donne une sacrée touche !

“Vas-y, mais fais-moi donc un pas.
Ah! vraiment ça ne te va pas, 
ces choses que tu portes là !”

“Non, non, non, ça ne te va pas,
ces choses que tu portes là,”

Bastien Lallemant,"Ce matin-là
Le jour à peine était levé,
Nous avions pris
La route qui va vers je ne sais où...
J’ai oublié
Tout du chemin de la raison
Qui nous poussait, nous emmenait
Loin de chez nous

Qu’importe la destination,
Nous allions par le petit jour.
Je ne me rappelle plus l’occasion,
Vers quel lieu, quel faubourg

Pour quelle raison, quelle oraison ?
Allions-nous pêcher du poisson ? ou bien
Pour quelle cérémonie d’un jour ?
Étaient-ce des noces d’amour ? 

Le soleil me rappelle à toi
Dans sa clarté de petit jour,
Et moi encore accroché à
La lucarne de mes souvenirs...
Je crois reprendre encore une fois
Cette route qui ne menait
Nulle part ailleurs qu’avec toi
Nulle part ailleurs qu’avec toi

Ô ma mémoire qu’en as-tu fait !
J’ai oublié, j’ai oublié...
Pourquoi nous étions sur la route ?
Et partis pour quelle aventure ?

Étions-nous en deuil partant
Pour je ne sais quel enterrement ?
Ou bien partis en flânant
Chercher du suc et de l’encens ?

Et ma mère si tu avais pu
Voir dans le cœur de ces deux-là,
De ces deux hommes que tu aimais
Qui s’en allaient, qui s’en allaient
Qui s’en allaient cueillir au monde
Un presque rien d’éternité,
Qui renaissaient un jour au monde
En oubliant de t’emmener...

Ô ma mémoire qu’en as-tu fait !
Depuis tant et tant d’années de ça...
Mon cœur ne compte plus ces années,
Que ce qu’elles durent d’éternité...

Était-ce un jour sans pêche aucune,
Sans mariage, sans miel et sans lune ?
Était-ce un jour sans mort au ciel,
Sans firmament et sans missel ? (bis)

Ce matin-là,
Le jour à peine était levé,
Nous avions pris
La route qui va vers je ne sais où...
Ce qu’il m’en reste 
A de ce matin la clarté,
Un peu d’aurore et un soupçon d’éternité... 

Ô ma mémoire mon grand trou noir,
Mais cela n’a plus d’importance...
Ma nostalgie en habits noirs,
Me regarde en chien de faïence

Sans raison et en toute occasion, 
Dans les flots bleus de ma raison,
Ma mémoire en femme poisson,
Revient me chanter cette chanson.
Ma mémoire en femme poisson,
Revient me chanter cette chanson.

Qui fait que sur ton cœur un jour c’est le printemps
Et qu’à peine en un instant revient le mauvais temps?

C’est pas, c’est pas la faute à la lune non mais
C’est pas, c’est pas sa faute à la lune

Qui fait donc l’averse et sur ton coeur la tempête?
qui fait les saints de glace et ton réveil en trompette?
Qui fait qu’en un instant le plus charmant des sourires
Chez toi se transforme en grise mine en soupir?

C’est pas, c’est pas la faute, à la brise non mais
C’est pas, c’est pas sa faute à la brise

Et qui mène la danse, la girouette ou le vent?
Qui fait trois pas de danse, pirouette gaiement?
C’est ton humeur mon amour, bohème et vagabonde
Qui fait trois petits tours, un sourire et la ronde

Et bientôt se débine et devient grise mine
Et bientôt se débine et devient grise

Tendaient tes boutons de chemise

Et cette poupée qui me picore le cœur

Une fois tout consommé le feu de mes ardeurs
Trépassant plus d’une fois, sonné dans mes vapeurs
Je l’ai vue qui répandait dans les airs, à peine refroidies
Les cendres de mon âme, récoltées chaque nuit
Je l’ai vue qui répandait dans les airs, à peine refroidies
Les cendres de mon cœur, récoltées à minuit

Elle a filé la poupée en emportant le plus beau
Et moi je me suis foulé en descendant au tombeau

Que stigmates et béquilles, son cœur s’en est allé
Il ne me reste rien de cette fichue poupée
qu’un petit trou d’aiguille dans mon cœur épinglé

d’un amour naissant,
c’est bien enivrant

donner sa main, un jour, un jour à l’autre

de tout se promettre
et de tout se dire

Et qui prennent du plomb pour de l’or à leur doigt
à l’anneau l’hameçon du pêcheur est bien fiché
il ne lui tarde bientôt plus qu’à les ferrer
et à mettre leur cœur à mariner ou bien cuire en fricassée

L’amour ainsi sommeille, et la belle endormie
croit s’en remettre au temps dans sa robe de nuit
on dit de l’eau qui dort qu’elle est une ennemie
Nous savons de l’amour qu’il ne dort qu’à demi
Gare à celui qui passant là l’effleure à peine et le réveille
On ne pose sur un cœur pas longtemps de bâillon
pour en taire les ardeurs l’envoyer par le fond
On ne fait pas d’un cœur qu’il se taise à jamais
on le croit muselé on le voit bouillonner
on le croit apaisé il devient feu follet
gare à celui-là qui s‘en approche, gare à la moindre anicroche

Certaines même ne demandent pas mieux
Que de glisser lentement dans un écrin de peu
d’amour  car après tout c’est pas si mal 
on y laisse un peu moins de plumes, de son crin de cheval
on se contente du peu qu’il nous donne 
il se contente du peu qu’on lui donne

Et au parterre les empreintes du ciel
qui se sont déposées    
par le chambranle une esquisse soleil
qui nous a réveillé
avec un certain sens de la repartie

Et sous ce ciel, sous la pluie suspendue
les larmes au bord des cieux
dans ce décor de jeu d’ombres, on est nu
on se découvre, peu à peu
avec un certain sens de la retenue",L' Apres MIDI,2005

Bastien Lallemant,"Tes boucles qui s’affolent d’un tout petit peu de vent
Ondulent et simplement dansent en riant gaiement
Deux, trois boucles seulement
Trois boucles qui sont comme en vol
Trois petits tours et puis s’en vont
C’est comme une farandole
Trois fois le tour de mon giron
Trois petits tours et dégringolent

Ana, les ogres qui rêvent de t’avaler tout rond
Font trois petits tours et puis s’en vont

On les voit qui frétillent d’un souffle à peine d’air
On les voit qui scintillent te donnant un peu l’air
D’une méduse gentille 
Une gorgone comme un ange
Trois battements d’ailes et dans les airs
Les voilà remontées tout là-haut
et pour faire trois fois du mystère
Le tour, on tourne autour du pot

Et quand vient le temps des batailles
Qu’il nous faut partir en campagne
explorer la jungle d’épis en dépit des boucles en bataille
On s’arme de patience et d’un peigne en attendant
que le vent
daigne bien ne plus souffler sur
tes cheveux l’espace d’un instant
et que repose ci-gît l’épis
tombé tout droit du firmament
Ana tes boucles qui s’affolent d’un trois rien, d’une once de vent
Ana tes boucles qui volent au vent font trois petits tours sur le dos du temps
trois petits tours sur le dos du temps

Le vent qui faisait valser tes boucles, a laissé
comme plûmes tomber trois boucles en gravité
descendant tombant du ciel un peu comme des anges 
des nues
Les voilà semant la pagaille
les voilà tombant en cascade
Et sur tes yeux et sur ton front
à la manière d’un éventail
Deux trois boucles tombées 
comme des hirondelles du ciel 
trois boucles qui font le printemps
Sont au nombre de tes printemps
Trois printemps pour nous rappeler
Trois fois le temps de nos baisers

Ana, les ogres qui rêvent de t’avaler tout rond
Font trois petits tours et puis s’en vont",Les Boucles d'Ana,2005
Bastien Lallemant,"C’est du cœur d’occasion 
que vous trouvez chez moi !
Offert avec ses options
garanties etc...

Et s’il connaît des ratés 
ne vous en inquiétez pas,
ce cœur a tant tourné
qu’il ne vous lâchera pas !

Il ne fait jamais défaut,
il marche du tonnerre,
il n’a comme seul défaut
qu’un petit peu de vert !

Du vert de gris dans les entrailles,
pour se rappeler
le souvenir de ses batailles,
mais ça c’est du passé.

C’est du cœur d’occasion
que vous trouverez chez moi !
Sans date de péremption,
il dure pendant des mois.

C’est mon cœur en morceau 
que vous ramasserez là,
il n’en est de plus beau
que cet article là.

Alors ne soyez pas trop sévère,
pensez un peu aussi,
combien de coups de tonnerre
votre cœur a-t-il pris.

Ça je le vois tout à votre air,
à votre air à moitié pris,
ce cœur n’est pas tout vert,
il a beaucoup servi.

C’est du cœur d’occasion
à prendre à l’occasion.
C’est nos cœurs d’occasion,
A prendre à l’occasion...",Les Coeurs d'Occasion,2005
Bastien Lallemant,"Votre innocence est d’une splendeur
devant ses feintes vilenies
incroyable est votre candeur
quand on sait toutes ses félonies
quand on sait tout de lui

Quand il n’en a plus après vous
qu’il s’en va grignoter ailleurs
qu’il n’est plus là sur vos genoux
savez-vous ce qu’il fait ailleurs
quel est son labeur ?

Un orpailleur de premier ordre
vous faisant miroiter le ciel
qu’on voit cueillir à d’autres cœurs 
des paillettes et puis s’en aller...  

Quand il déballe ses oriflammes
qu’il vous réclame tout près de lui
soupçonneriez-vous d’autres flammes
brûlantes au milieu de ses nuits
Le soupçonneriez-vous, lui ?

Lui, ne s’en prive pas et pour
éteindre toutes vos méfiances
on le voit faire à votre cours
du mensonge toute une science
avec suffisance

lui le beau parleur, le vrai menteur
vous faisant miroiter le myrte
et qui s’effeuille au premier souffle
à la première bise venue

Mais votre innocence vous fait si belle
moins il est là, plus il vous trompe
plus moi je vous trouve belle…

pour être infâme jusqu’au bout
On l’entend même se vanter 
Et même se moquer de vous
auprès de ceux que vous aimiez
en toute amitié

votre récompense ici bas
c’est de le sentir près de vous
quand chacun sait qu’il n’y est pas
qu’il n’est pas celui devant vous
que vous pensiez, mais...

une ombre, à peine une entité
abstraite et fuyante toujours
qui vous revient comme en un songe
quand se lève le petit jour...

Il pourrait vous empoisonner
à petit feu, jours après jours
vous ne l’auriez jamais pensé
lui qui vous contait son amour
qu’il compte vos jours...

Un empailleur de vérité
qui bientôt vous fera la peau
lui qui vous fait déjà la vie
impossible et vous qui l’aimez...",L' Innocence,2005
Bastien Lallemant,"Celles dont on dit
qu’elles font des étincelles

pour goûter à l’envie

Bastien Lallemant,"Madame Liste fait des listes,
de l’exégèse de jeu de piste ;
sur le papier en patte d’oie,
rédige ses tables de la loi.
Le majuscule de notre ennui,
nous vient tout droit de ce qu’elle trie,
sur le papier parcheminé,
les faits et gestes de la sainte journée...

Madame Liste fait des listes,
au prétexte de ne point s’y perdre.
Elle note chaque heure au point du jour,
dans un carnet à rebours.
Ses listes sont comme gueule de loup,
du matin blême à l’heure du loup ;
elle offre au papier en pâture,
les élans de notre nature...

Madame Liste fait des listes,
faire ceci puis faire cela ;
c’est peine et pire que de porter la croix,
ses p’tits papiers à la croix de bois.
Et le mignon perché sur son calvaire
ne se doute sans doute pas de mon calvaire,
elle cède au Veau d’Or, qu’elle adore,
son livre d’heures vaut bien plus que de l’or...

Madame Liste fait des listes,
mon jour de peine est quadrillé,
comme celui d’un pion sur l’échiquier,
mon désir bien muselé.
Son jour de gloire est affiché,
après les courses, en fin de journée,
en fin de liste, en bout de piste,
le ciel de ma nuit étoilée...",Madame Liste,2005
Bastien Lallemant,"Indifférente à toutes apparences et c’est tant mieux
De trois têtes le dépasse et sans baisser les yeux
Elle affronte le regard des curieux
Quand elle baisse les yeux c’est sur son petit monsieur

Oh monsieur soyez heureux
A l’étage de son cœur
C’est l’endroit le plus moelleux 
Tout pour votre bonheur

Et quand on la voit passer derrière le parapet
On est bien vite tenté de donner du sifflet
En risquant pourtant de le fâcher
Lui le petit monsieur caché par le parapet

Oh monsieur, pourquoi s’énerver ?
Laissez-les à leur fête
Car après tout ces sifflets
Vous passent dessus la tête

Ah si seulement vous étiez 
De trois têtes plus allongé 
Plus élancé  qu’elle n’est
Seriez-vous pour autant
Aussi bien logé que maintenant
Avec vue sur sa voie lactée
ah la la quelle vue qu’ vous avez là !

Et quant à son balcon elle apparaît la géante
Ils sont nombreux ceux qui ouvrent une gueule béante
En rêvant à leurs fêtes galantes
Combien sont ils qui remarquent au balcon de l’amante

Un monsieur que les polis 
disent de petite taille
Un monsieur pris dans les plis
Des pieds jusqu’à la taille

Mais qui jamais ne se départi d’un grand sourire
Que fièrement il arbore quand elle pousse un soupir
Quand elle se plie en deux pour lui dire
Tout ce que des amants peuvent à l’un l’autre se dire 

« Oh monsieur, petit monsieur
Vous êtes mon grand amour
S’il vous plaît pour mes beaux yeux
De grimper à ma tour »

Ah pensez monsieur si vous étiez
Aussi grand que ces grands dadais,
Aussi benêts, jamais
Vous ne tiendriez dans
son cœur et serré comme maintenant
L’auriez-vous pu voir d’aussi près ?
ah la la quelle vue vous avez là

Et quand il pleut c’est encore nous les plus arrosés
Lui reste bien pelotonné en son cœur abrité
On croirait l‘entendre ronronner
C’est un monde mais que voulez-vous l’endroit est douillet

Un monsieur qui si petit
Dans un verre se noie
Une dame parapluie
Le couvre sous son toit

Si même nous allions défiler sur les genoux
En nous faisant plus petits, en bourrant de cailloux
Nos poches pour paraître debout
Aussi petit que cet homme qui se pend à son cou

« Non messieurs n’y pensez pas
Et veuillez s’il vous plait
Prendre garde de vos pas 
pour ne pas l’écraser »

Ah qui sait où il a bien pu passer ?
Entre l’un de nous ou bien coincé
Près d’étouffer, happé
Dans un pan, dans un pli
Ou bien réfugié, bien à l’abri
Oh je crois bien l’avoir senti...
Oh je crois bien l’avoir senti...
Dans un pli d’ mon anatomie",Petit,2005
Bastien Lallemant,"Sur la commode, entre les pots, sous les dorures 
sous les tableaux et les bouquets,
en déroulant son ombre dessus les pâles murs
et sur les photos encadrées
elle se faufile à pas feutré
subrepticement sans rien toucher 

Quelque fois s’étirant dessus les canapés
lascive comme une odalisque
elle se repose allongée dessus les imprimés 
et sous le lustre qui étincelle  
se tenant toujours aux aguets
craignant d’improbables dangers 

sous les Sun light de l’abat-jour comme en plein jour
son allure est éblouissante  !
son ombre entre les ombres ondule à contre jour
et puis s’éclipse entre les plantes 
rejoignant la cime des toits 
elle disparaît en tapinois

et sous les astres, sous les étoiles, sous les sun light
secrètement on imagine 
sous les regards hallucinés des cheminées 
et des fumerolles divines
son ombre d’encre féline
dans la nuit bleue de chine

Sur le rebord de la fenêtre, comme sur un fil
entre le ciel, et les persiennes
émouvante au dessus du vide, en équilibre
elle, la créature martienne
la revoilà tout en langueur  
subrepticement entre les fleurs ?

et mollement comme un soleil, entre tes jambes
elle prend la pause du pacha
profite de ta sieste et plein de nonchalance
s’enroule tel un grand boa
et se faufile en tapinois
délicieusement entre tes doigts

sur les volumes finement reliés des étagères
elle promène son regard de jais
faisant montre d’un intérêt très littéraire
pour le songe d’une nuit d’été
puis comme d’un songe tiré 
retourne jusqu’au canapé

et sous ton regard médusé, en un éclair
semblant glisser entre les glycines
par les zébrures hallucinantes des persiennes
et sous les bouquets d’églantines
disparaît la féline
dans le jour qui décline 
La chatte d’églantine
dans la nuit bleue, c’est Chine",Promenade,2005

combinaison intégrale

sur le plus léger bikini

J’vous verrais bien ainsi...
J’vous verrais bien ainsi...

Un kilt écossais pourquoi pas
serait du plus joli effet
nue sous un pull angora
tout le monde le devinerait

ou bien changeante sous la lumière
d’un mois d’août éblouissant
entourée de furieux éclairs
l’orage est un habit charmant

Si vous vouliez me plaire
si vous vouliez bien faire...

Vous porteriez de jolies socquettes
celles rayées avec des pois
et moi j’en perdrais la tête
en comptant tous ces petits pois

sous vos parures, et sous vos voiles
vous êtes si étourdissante
bien que toute nue en sandale
vous soyez bien plus ravissante

vous êtes si troublante
vous êtes si charmante",Les Tenues Anglaises,2005

on s’est caressé,
on s’est retrouvé,

Bastien Vincent,"Les nymphos aiment faire les courses parce qu'il y'a souvent une queue immense 
J'vis dans une monde où certains hommes prennent la mort pour délivrance 
C'est pas en faisant tourner les joints que cette putain d'roue va tourner 
Oukhty (ma soeur), respecte ton vagin car c'est par là qu'on est tous né 
Si on jette pas de fleurs au Darfour, c'est que là-bas c'est la sécheresse 
Les députés ont des langues de putes car beaucoup d'eux sont des lèches-fesses 
Celle que t'aime dévoile la haine dans un miroir fissuré 
Si l'occident pouvait se salir c'est sur l'Afrique qu'il s'essuierait 
J'comprend pas qu'des riches soient gros vu qu'y'a pas d'fric sans suer 
Et comment ils en sont arrivés à trouver une petite fille sensuelle 
Ils doivent se faire monter en l'air pour mieux redescendre sur terre 
On veut tous reposer en paix, pour ça que tout l'monde est en guerre 
Et si la coke est claire c'est qu'elle doit s'prendre dans la nuit noire 
Et si mes pensées sont claires c'est qu'elle est pas encore venue m'voir 
J'avais grave des idéaux, j'ai vu trop d'choses donc j'ai dis « oh » 
J'serais pas l'idiot qui s'baisse chaque jour pour chier et qui s'dit oh 
J'ai pas d'sous et plein d'soucis, une envie fou de s'mettre sous weed 
Bien que la rue soit en béton elle construit pas de mecs solides 
Si l'temps était de l'argent les clochards seraient pressés 
Plus j'prend conscience de la mort plus mon avenir rétréci

J'suis cultivé mais pour la France analphabète 
JR Ochrome a.k.a. la dernière lettre de l'alphabet 
Décevant comme mon statut social 
Délinquant donc pas très fréquentable 
J'guette mon affaire les yeux plissés sur une jambe 
Jongle avec les flammes Rindek (Attention) à pas glisser sur d'l'essence 
Akhi j'suis aussi noir que le tié-quar que j'fréquente 
Si j'te disais que son bitume est cagoulé qu'est-ce que t'en penses ? 
Réfléchis vite quand une bande déboule 
Infériorité numérique ça tue ou ça s'mange des coups 
La rue c'est réaliste en gros c'est crue ter les gars d'chez nous 
Si j'me définissais moi j'serais l'enclume dans un gant d'velours 
Postiché comme des C.R.S. 
On s'fait la guerre on s'fait la gueule quand c'est la hass 
J'cogite régulièrement pour mailler y'a pas d'magie 
Le ghetto t'joue des tours à la David Copperfield 
Paris Centre 75 plus d'une fois j'ai bu la tasse 
Chez moi ça marche rabbate à reculons dans une impasse 
Moi j'reviens d'loin, des keufs des shayatine (diables) sur les côtes 
Avec un p'tit arrière gout d'sucre sur le dos

T'as les poches pleines tu crois p'tet que ton cake sent le Givenchy 
Mais saches que même sur les plus beaux monuments les pigeons chient 
Ce monde est éphémère tout ce qui s'y trouve péri 
Et si t'aimes tant la vie c'est parce qu'elle te camoufle ses rides 
On m'a dit « jettes toi à l'eau » j'ai bu la tasse 
J'ai voulu remonter à bord y'avait plus la place 
Là j'ai compris qu'ici souvent c'est chacun pour soi 
Limite on t'dit « si t'es pas venu pour m'faire un chèque pousses toi » 
J'ai trop ché-mar j'ai des fourmis dans les iepds 
J'me prend une nouvelle paire si j'peux m'les fournir sans les yaip (payer) 
Oui j'ai tourner dans les iefs (fiefs) j'ai p'tet manger plus de 100 tiep 
J'ai vu que ceux qui n'ont rien partagent et que les riches sont sans tièp (pitié) 
J'veux pas finir en iench à quatre te-pa 
Quand la richesse tente de nous phone ici on capte pas
Tu veux diriger ta vie mais t'as pas la clef d'contact 
C'est pour compter leur tune qu'ils t'ont nommé comptable 
Poto, t'es seul avec ou sans amis 
L'amitié perd de sa valeur comme un pain sans sa mie 
Bref, tout ça pour dire qu'en résumé [en résumé] 
Elle fait flipper la race humaine [elle fait flipper la race humaine *3] 

J'essaye de grimper l'échelle sociale avec une jambe de bois 
Je n'attend rien d'une courte échelle vu la hauteur d'mes ambitions 
Dur de démarrer la course avec une paire de Atemi 
Quel âge à celui qui dit qu'avec le temps la douleur s'atténue 
C'est dur de réussir sa vie tout comme de rater sa mort 
Certains me disent depuis le temps que tu fais du rap ça mors ? 
J'ai beau leurs dire qu'on est pas sorti de l'auberge 
Tellement j'en chie de loin tu peux même sentir l'odeur 
Un quart de vie passé avec des sparadraps c'est pas un drame 
On s'barre à Dam attendre le prochain paragraphe 
Akhi, on m'avait dit que la France était un eldorado 
Dès l'atterrissage ils m'ont collé un poisson d'avril dans l'dos 
Les années passent les saisons changent 
Les problèmes viennent plus des cours de maths mais d'avoir la peau mâte 
Comment prouver qu'j'suis oppressé les chaines sont invisibles 
Les mecs s'efforcent de faire dans l'subtile mais restent prévisibles 
Mes gars n'ont plus la forme humaine 
A contresens sur un circuit de formule 1 
Ferme la et range tes formulaires, j'vais te l'formuler 
Autrement j'te l'dis fermement j'veux pas faire l'mulet 

J'suis là pour dénoncer pas là pour faire l'pantin 
C'est plus des carottes qu'on s'mange mais des bananes Plantin 
Belek au sourire d'une femme à cause d'elle tu peux perdre le tien 
La trahison nous fait pâlir jusqu'à en perdre le teint 
Pas d'noirs à la télé si c'n'est pour le Sida 
Et l'seul kain-fry qui a la côte chez Disney c'est Simba 
M'invite pas à table j'suis pas dans mon assiette 
Pas l'habitude des couverts nous on partage un bol à 7 
On m'a dit qu'en grandissant la voisine serait moins souriante 
Qu'avec ou sans dents de lait si c'est la hass les souris entrent 
Que rien n'est sûr chaque être humain est en sursis 
C'qui est sûr c'est que chaque paire de fesses qui passe c'est un souci 
Les p'tits peuvent pas arracher les curs ils sont passés au keus 
Et si la nuit porte conseil, bah elle a zappé les geush 
En résumé crois pas que le temps chôme 
Si le monde te sourit akhi saches qu'il a les dents jaunes 
J'aimerai effacé le numéro de tout mes frères écroués 
Mais dans c'monde rien n'est parfait akhi même la lune est trouée 
J'ai les mains sur le cur, les pieds au sol et la tête vers les cieux 
Donc dîtes aux travelos que j'les appellerai toujours Messieurs 

Paname est vivante mon quartier réside dans son zen 
Quand elle éternue, les bicraveurs tombent et prennent du ferme 
Le monde est subtile, saches que c'est pas la taille qui compte 
Car si le président est un nain bah devant lui tu parais si p'tit 
Panam est un chien sans maître donc fuck l'éducatrice 
Moi, j'suis né dans l'creux d'une cicatrice 
Akhi, tu veux des frissons ? touches moi 
Martin Luther King a fait un rêve et Maître Gims a fait un cauchemar 
Tu trouves ça gore et alors ? 
Censurez moi ça changera rien comme un aveugle dans l'noir 
J'suis foutu, caractère de base têtu 
L'être humain n'est que du sperme vêtu 
Les mécréants voudraient voir Dieu 
Essayes d'abord de regarder le soleil dans les yeux
J'me demande plus quand tout ça cessera 
Marre de m'battre pour un quartier qui porte le nom d'un ciste-ra 
Puis ça m'fait chier 
Donc si une meuf me plaît de trop bah je l'imagine en train d'chier 
J'vise la tête j'ai plus le temps pour les essais 
Et si le monde t'ouvre ses bras bah saches
Qu'il fouette des aisselles
Fouette des aisselles, fouette des aisselles

Moi inch'Allah j'vais pas repartir comme j'suis arriver
En faisant souffrir la daronne encore pire la voir crier 
On ira tous au paradis n'est qu'une chanson d'Enfoirés 
Et tes et tes hassanets ils s'trouvent pas dans tes putains d'soirées
Rien ne marche depuis mes premiers pas
J'me lève tout les jours du pied gauche comme si on m'avait amputé du droit 
Les les qui à dit qui au bled c'est la santé 
Quoi l'argent n'a pas d'odeur tu mens je l'ai senti 
Stop y'a ton gars sûr qui joue au con 
Dis lui qu'il est suivi du regard et que c'est pas celui de la Joconde 
Y'a celui qui mord la vie et celui qui vit la mort 
Dans les deux cas personne peut ves-qui son heure
La beauté de l'homme est dans sa poche 
Si t'es milliardaire t'as l'droit d'être moche 
Religieux que quand ça t'chantes 
Mais les vrais religieux ne chante pas 
Comme d'hab ils diront que les kain-fry divaguent 
Eux ils lisent des livres alors qui y'en a qu'un qui dit vrai
Si l'argent tombait du ciel, ciel ciel ciel
L'avare tiendrait son parapluie à l'envers sans hésiter

Le diable joue avec nous et avec un rien nous taquine,
On se fatigue mais tout part vite comme dans un karting
Où ta future carcasse est garée dans ton parking.
Le jour se lève et mon heure fait encore un pas,
J'me tape chaque jour pour rendre à dieu mon corps intact,
Car toutes mes affaires en fait s'appellent revient
Et quand je serai dans ma tombe personne me dira je te rejoins.
A la mairie elle t'appartient pour la vie,
Mais cinq ans plus tard avec un autre elle parcourt la ville,
Quant au succès il t'appartient pas, t'accroches ap,
Si tu loupes le co-ch, le public te fait un croche-pattes.
Tout ce qu'on t'a prêté tu le rends
Même ce que tu bouffes tu le rechies,
Dis-leur chut, l'argent est un fidèle poto dealer de shit.
Dès le choc que j'ai reçu en sachant qu'on était seul j'me suis dit
""Mehlich il m'reste la foi donc j'mets mon front au sol""

A vouloir tout posséder tu finis par rien avoir,
On sait bien que tout nous quittera mais notre âme ne veut pas le voir,
Si la vie est une prison le bonheur est au parloir.
Tu t'es vendu pour du liquide car ton honneur n'est qu'une passoire!
Accroché au matériel belek akhi c'est qu'un nuage,
Du quelque des soucis qui vont te noyer, il faut que tu nages.
T'aimais madame à en mourir, aujourd'hui c'est lui qu'elle aime
Avec la même fougue qu'y'avait dans vos nuits de rêves!
Le propriétaire ne fait que louer une terre jusqu'à sa mort
Ce monde t'appartient autant qu'Hitler avait de remords
La vie est-elle une illusion à laquelle on s'accroche
Ou la plus grande des convictions pour laquelle l'homme devient atroce?
Même mon corps n'est qu'une location j'évite les tatouages,
On s'imagine à la retraite bien qu'on puisse partir à tout âge
Attaché grave à ton pote mais c'est ton pote qui t'a poucave
Il se foutait de la belle époque, il a tout avoué!

Tout est voué à l'échec, les belles villas les grosses caisses,
Six pieds sous terre rongé par les vers!
Tout est voué à l'échec, quelque soit ton style de vie!
Enfouis sous terre même tes partenaires te laissent solos.

The cold evening aches,
As it leaves in its wake,
All the memories left by the day,
And I'm questioning why,
As you look to the sky,
That it's cloudless up above our heads,
And thoughts come to mind,
That our short little lives,
Haven't left the path that they will tread,
They will tread

I come back to haunt you,
Memories will taunt you,
And I will try to love you,
It's not like I'm above you,

The wisdom we learn as our minds,
They do burn'll,
Entice the naivety in youth,
As adults will grow and maturity shows,
The terrifying rarity of truth,
As you turn to your mind,
And your thoughts they rewind,
To old happenings and things that are done,
You can't find what's passed,
Make that happiness last,
Seeing from those eyes what you become,
What you become

Bastille ,"Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowin' the cup,
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck.
So I took one girl outside with me,
Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me,
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said,

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby,
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, ""Everyday I wake up, hoping to die""
She said, ""They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away,
So our daddy couldn't rape us,
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to""

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet!

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,

It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?

that our short little lives,
Haven't left the path that they will tread,
They will tread

I come back to haunt you,
Memories will taunt you,
And I will try to love you,
It's not like I'm above you,

They do burn'll,
Entice the naivety in youth,
As adults will grow and maturity shows,
The terrifying rarity of truth,
As you turn to your mind,
And your thoughts they rewind,
To old happenings and things that are done,
You can't find what's passed,
Make that happiness last,
Seeing from those eyes what you become,
Well you become

Memories will taunt you,
And I will try to love you,

And it's paradise in our minds

The smell of cinders and rain
Perfumed almost everything

Crying took me to the darkest place
And you have set fire to my heart

With my arms around your neck
Into our love the tears crept
Just catch in the eye of the storm

My dreams pulled me from the ground
Forever to search for the flame

The banquet for the shadows.

Had committed suicide

Death in your arms

Coming through the trees

After I saw the light
I packed my thing
The light gave me life
And helped me see more clearly

And the leaves were rustling
As the night turned to day

Getting smaller in the distance

And swans, they wrestled with lifetime's grasp
In hopefulness they nestled the past

They dined and feasted on whale and shark

And a body on a checkered floor
There was lightning in his black leather
And it struck out his name
No more tears, baby, please don't cry
I tried to tell him everything is fine
Cross my heart and hope to die
I won't say goodbye

Cause I'm falling in love
(Don't say goodbye)
I'm falling like a star from above
(Don't say goodbye)
And I finally found my pot of gold
(Don't say goodbye)
And now I can't see just what my heart can hold
But what does it mean?

And I did not know my own name

And I drive till I set myself free

Through young girls' dreams
Don't wake me up too soon
There's a halo on the moon
You hunger, I'll thirst
Pink stars do burst
God of lightning, goddess of fern
A map to memorize, a lullaby to learn
Come on darling, take me there
Where red clouds blew and fill the air
Where my purple hear beats to your jet black snout
Up on poiny point if your dare
You're my blood, you're my wine
You're my mountain to climb
Say you're mine, you're mine, you're mine

Bride in the fog, and no way out
Can't see my own hands, can't hear a sound
Where angels conspire and heroes do drown
I am lost in the mire upside down
Is that my soul on fire whirling by?
Take a walk, man of god I just want to die
I tell you my friend
The widow is on my trail
You'll hear her, you will know her
The chill on the skin, the song on the wind
To wonder, to roam, to never know how
To lie under a sky of blood reds and pale blue
To trail ten thousand miles in a dead man's shoes
There's a demon loose, a demon loose
I can't get home, I can't get home
For the road is a snake of mist
And the shadow of a rebel's fist
His jacket on my back, his bones on the shore
But the secret of dreams is to dream up a door
A portrait of him, a picture of her
A keyhole in a Douglas fir

Pace till death",Pace 'Till Death,1988
Bathory,"Born by womb untouched by man
Or a horny mortal man's error
Flower power prophet of one
Spelled dog in the mirror

You hide behind stained glass windows
In fear of real world outside
Kneeling prostitute your souls
To reach his kingdom way up high

And then you castrate your pride in search
Of answers to your prayers
Well they may be reaching the heavens
But they unanswered remain

If so let his anger strike me down
Like lightning from clear sky
For I'm questioning your lord
His almightyness I defy

Sons of bitches whores of Christ
Your fucking prayers won't do
When it comes closer to deadline
You still don't have no fucking clue

How one in heaven can sit patiently
And watch the masses starve
On empty stomachs they may go
And to this kingdom it is far

In writings you read and believe
In seven days the hog
Created light and what the fuck else
But then who created God

You think the death of one man
Self proclaimed the son of God a lost
But raise Hell and high water 'cause I rock and roll
Well, be my guest and crawl to your cross

The bigger cross the better Christian
Says the book of God's commands
But when you reach out you'll find
No one to grab thy fucking hand

And finally when truth comes clear
About death then what will you do
Y'see there's nowhere left to hide
From the grave waiting for you too

I have the knowledge guts and need
To questioning anything behind
Those pretty promises of heaven
Can't you see that you are blind

Because of one whose words you preach
And fall onto your knees before
Do not exist in fact I doubt
He'll knock your fucking doors

Sons of bitches whores of Christ
Your prayers never could
What I think faith in yourself and
Sane minds and hard work really could

Because to put all hope in one up high
Is sheer insanity
It will show fatal to us all
Yes, even fucking dangerously

You call yourselves the chosen ones
Because you've ""seen"" his light and soul
Well I've got news for you I'm stronger
Because I've got rock and roll

You think just 'cause you pray
Your souls'll be saved at any cost
While I'll burn 'cause I rock and roll
Well, go one make my day crawl to your cross",Crawl to Your Cross [#],1994
Bathory,"Creed of eternal life I swore
Held my candle of life to the void
Risen from the dead I deaths powers wed
In the name of the one with horns on head
Sleep of eternity withdrawn as dark upon
The life of mine drew the very end so near

The price another life the gospel of the
Horned one to spread shore to shore
Eternally his words let hear

Be silent listen to the wind crying out the
Answer to all mankind call from other
Side speech of horned divine
To end your search in hope to find
As sure night divides the day and as sure day divides the night
Raging flames is all that awaits us on the other side
Doomed the very moment he calls

See his star ablaze his children
On the night the flames reach for the sky
Night is comed to enter the never ending burning fire

Onto you all his word is given
Fear not reach to take his hand

Hear our master calling us his children
Eternal life is given death withdrawn
As wolves among sheep we have wandered
Victory lies beyond their spit and scorn
Even the heavens shall burn when we are gathered
Now when the flames reach for the sky

Bathory,"Leave the world of mortals to walk into the mist to stalk unto the other side
Plains of otherness
The utter emptiness
Where time have ceased and dark and light collide
Crossing the river of death and water cold
Slowly walking up the bridge
The jeweled bridge I walk for what seems a lifetime
In the night it's jewels glow
There on the other side
On shore of no return
The one for me awaits
Cannot avoid the eyes
In which the fire burns
Comed this far it is too late

And He calls my name
First a whispering then louder
And he wants me to follow
And to Enter the Eternal Fire

I walk this endless night
His eyes the only light
Repeatedly he whispers my name
Fingers move and twist
Through crimson thick dark mist and voices cry of agony and pain
Close now to his kingdom
The bleak world dark and still
I follow the voice whispering my name
Approach the gate of sin
Opened up to let me in and there, He stand in flames
The price now I must pay for eternity my soul his claim
For years of pleasures, victory and gold
The one who stand in flames
Now rise and walk my way and reach out for my soul

And He calls my name

And he wants me to follow
And to fall down. The Eternal Fire

Bathory,"Grant me the powers of thunder
And give me a sword forged in the raging Hell's fire
Lend me the eight legged black stallion of Odin and I'll have my vengeance,
oh, I'll kill with desire

Vengeance flows like boiling poison through my twisted veins
Tonight I'll blood shed with wrath and set the night on flames
Invincible in battle, war gods hear my death wish cry
I'll laugh in the face of death, I into glory ride

Snarling breath upon your backs, I'm vengeance incarnate
Now it's time, the moment's comed, stand up now, face my hate
See the fire in my eyes, the final light you'll see
I send you to the darkness with my sword of thunder and steel

on his cloak and hood familiar. The one eyed old man matches the
description of the soothsayer, as told by the elders of his village by the
fires at night when he only a child. The boy, now a young man, eager to
know, asks the one eyed old man about his dreams. Dreams he cannot
understand. Dreams about strange things he is seeing himself doing. Then
the winds that seem to talk to him. Voices that whisper to him behind his
back. The one eyed old man tells him of the cycles of the stars, of the
trail of fate and of the valley where time and space had ceased to exist...
where his world ends and the shadows begin. The one eyed old man tells the
young man that fate has chosen him to interfere with the other world. The
disturbance is already made. The daughters of the four winds have sold
themselves to the shadows, distorting the balance of the universe. And the
one eyed old man says he has seen him come for a thousand years, and that
the aging gods have told him to teach him all that he has ever known and to
prepare him to ride beyond his world and into the shadows as their champion
to restore the balance. To his aid he shall be given a sword forged when
this world was young. He shall be guarded and guided by two ravens, and he
shall ride the eight-legged stallion of his fathers' god. He will encounter
the Woodwoman, and he will make a visit to the Lake. One hundred days and
one hundred nights his training shall be hard. And this very night it will

Still I follow on to where she is going
For she has promised me magic if I follow on.

She takes me to a part of these woods few have ever seen.
Where the sun surely won't reach
Still the ground ominously gleams.
She says she's seen me coming and that she knows where I'll go.
But before I leave she says there is this one thing I should know.

She offers me the ability to take a fatal wound.
Every cut by sword or spear will be absorbed by her tree-womb.
The magic will remain until it's time for me to part with this mortal world.
And all she'll claim is my young heat.

I'm but a man. Mortal, a man.
And I'll need all the help that I can get.
So I give my heart to the woman of the dark
With or without it, my life is not over yet.

Wing of bat and lizard's eye.
Dust of a star fallen from the sky.
Tears of a virgin, *** of a god.
Thirteen drops of an infant's blood
A twist of a cat's spit and oil of the moon
Stir for a while and very soon
A salve to be applied upon the chest
close to where the heart beats strong.

No pains will occur when her hand is pushed into my flesh
She'll slowly draw my living heart out of my open chest.
She'll place my heart in the pit of the snake and behold the years go by.
Hers to keep from the moment when the time has come for me to die.

[two gods speak as they walked by. All the knowledge of all worlds, old and]
[new, was kept safe in a lake in a part of the Eternal Woods. The one eyed]

[Throwing his left eye into its black water he had gained not only all the]

[into the future. Set to find this lake, the young man mounts his stallion.]
[Riding with the speed of the winds high in the sky, he all of a sudden sees]
[the sun reflected in a lake. Standing by it, he throws both of his eyes]

Friends who are dear with us

It's time to trim the tree

We light the fire

It's Christmas Eve

Welcome to the table for some holiday fare

As we join our hands

In Christmas prayer

I'm so glad the season is finally here

Our house is nice& full like it was last year

Nothing feels better than Christmas cheer

When everyone's home for Christmas Eve

Outside snow fills the air

Colorful lights

Are seen everywhere

Sleigh bells

I heard through the night 

Little ones know 

Santa's coming tonight

Carolers sing our favorite songs

So,let's grab our coats and sing along

Come on,come on,come on

Und wegen ewigen Lebens wird nie mein Tagebuch fertig.
Falsch gedacht, jetzt wird eingepackt,
Der Sensenmann mäht mich um, ich bin leistungsschwach.
Meine Lunge platzt, die Luft wird knapp,
Mein Kreislauf gibt den Geist auf ohne Muskelkraft.
Und durch suizidale Gedanken
Kann ich Gäste nun mit blutigen Armen empfangen.

Doch ich versuch frei zu atmen,
Trotz geschwollener, trockener Schleimhäute.
Mein Arm ist eingeschlafen,
Seit dem verfolgen ihn scheußlich-teuflische Albträume.
Der Schnaps bläst in meinem Kopf Lichter aus,
Mein Magen kann den Schock nicht verdauen.
Werd' ich so auf meine alten Tage labil?
Denn meine Psyche ist nicht mal in der Seitenlage stabil!

Alle AIDS oder Krebs in Leber oder Blinddarm.
Überall krank, ja langsam nervt es,

Meine Prostata ist offenbar zu groß.
Ich esse statt Kopfsalat nur Wurst,
Also lass' uns schnell zum Doktor fahren! Los!
Gucken sie sich von meinem Bauch schnell den Umfang an,
Von Schokolade krieg' ich nie genug - bin ich jetzt Zuckerkrank?
Hab' ich Diabetis, Vidalegis, Viagetis?
Aber das ist nicht alles, ich hab EHEC und seh' schlecht!
Ich guck nicht sehr weit, also gib mir nen Hinweis,
Ist Kurzsichtigkeit die Vorstufe von Blindheit?
So hat keiner für mich im Alltag Verwendung,
Gibt's für Krankheiten doch keine Altersbeschränkung.

Aus meiner Kehle ragt ein Dunst von Aceton,

Und verharz den Lohn.
Tabak teert mir eine schnellstraße zum Lungenkarzinom.
Ich leb' in ständiger Angst,
Bis ich an's Ende gelang,

Über Nacht hat sich einiges gut angestaut
So steht mein Penis nun mit mir jeden Morgen zusammen auf
Du Spasti trinkst 'n Schluck und bist fast beschwipst vom Suff
Aber mein Pullermatz, der bleibt standhaft bis zum Schluss
Ich halt ihn gefangen denn er leider zu viel Größenwahn
Wird er freigelassen, dann macht er, was er will und hält Groupiemösen warm
Fazit, Jede kommt schnell und freut sich heftig
Verliebt sich Hals über Kopf in ihn bei Stellung „69“
Auch deine Freundin, sie stöhnt und merkt deutlich, wie schön
Meine Schlange sich wohlfühlt im feuchten Milieu
Entweder lässt sie sich besamen oder macht sich vom Acker
Es ist, als wenn sie mit einer Flasche Bonaqua in Kontakt trat
Ich krieg' ihn ganz hoch, ist er eigentlich gewöhnt
Auch nach dem Xten Anstoß ist noch Kreide auf'm Queue

So eine verdammte Kacke ich habe verschlafen
Warum hat mein beschissener Wecker nich geläutet,
Jetzt muss ich raus aus den Federn und ins Bad renn
Schwitzte im Schlaf habe Achselnässe,
Es bleibt keine Zeit für eine Katzenwäsche
Wenigstens ruckzuck die Zähne geputzt
Und Reste werden runter durch die Kehle geschluckt jupp
Jupp, die suche nach reinen Klamotten lässt mich 
leider zu der Annahme kommen ich habe nur noch dreckige Sachen
Dabei habe ich doch vor nicht all zu langer Zeit 
meiner Mutter aufgetragen sie hätte meine Wäsche zu waschen
Ja, na gut, ich gerat in Wut und zerdepper im Badezimmer die Armatur
Hey, Ist es Verzweiflung oder wahrer Mut?
Denn ich verlasse meine Wohnung im Schlafanzug
Schnell die Mappe gesattelt bin in totaler Aufruhr
Renne hin zur Treppe durch den Hausflur
Nehme dabei wohlwollend einen Sturz in Kauf,
Bewältige die Treppe per Purzelbaum
Ja man könnte behaupten ich habe Pech,
Doch muss ohne zu gucken über die Straße renn
Aber mein Scheißbus der fährt mir vor der Nase weg,
Alter ehrlich dieser Tag ist Dreck

So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
Kann man da von Schicksal reden? 
Keine Ahnung aber mich fickt das Leben!

Befinde mich immer noch auf dem Schulweg,
Den ich zu Fuß geh, mir tut der Fuß weh
Aber ganz egal wo der Schuh drückt oder Blut spritzt,
Heute komme ich nich zu spät
Hasse das Leben jetzt prasselt der Regen,
Ich hätte alles und jeden für eine Jacke gegeben
Es ist nass auf den Wegen
Und zu allem Überfluss bin ich in Kacke getreten
In einer Vielzahl, ganze vier mal, ja sogar an beiden Füßen
Sowas soll Glück bring'? alle Passanten gaffen mich an 
und denken ich würde in scheiße wühlen
Typisch, zu einem verkorksten Tag,
Gehört natürlich auch dazu passendes Regenwetter
Sollte das hier alles nie ein Ende haben
Und so weitergehn dann schick mir besser einen Seelenklempner

Keine Ahnung aber mich fickt das Leben!

Es war ein bitterer Tag (jaja) an dem ich um Erlösung bat
Ich habe das Gespür dafür, dass die Kacke, die ich heut erlebt habt nicht einmal die Krönung war
Dank meiner Vorliebe für Schokolade und fettem Essen
Is der folgende Weg ein einziger Kraftakt
Die Bewegung tut mir gut, verliere sieben Kilo unterwegs und drei Liter Wasser
Immerhin ein positiver Nebeneffekt,
Doch ich nehme wieder zu in Genen ist Fett
Ich möchte nicht mehr weiter durch die City rasen,
Ich möchte ein bisschen schlafen also bitte gebt mir ein Bett
Doch der Battleboi ist dick und muss
Weiter gegen die Zeit laufen bis zum Schluss
Eins hast du über mich nicht gewusst
Ich muss unbedingt in die Schule, bin pflichtbewusst
Irgendwie versuch ich klar zu komm,
Spring über Bänke auf denen die Penner pennen
Danach über Geländer renne so wie ein Beserker
Und überhole die Rentner die mich währenddessen anmeckern
Doch ich höre da nicht hin ich habe anderes im Blick

Aber du hast 'ne Facebook Seite, geiler scheiß, einfach nice

So hüte dich vor Hatern die vor Eifersucht geplagt sind
Und Geschlechtsverkehr mit Schlampen nach dem Reißverschlussverfahren

Dass die mit ihren dummen Sound nur scheitern könn'

Und sag dann mehrfach im Text, dass Hip Hop lebt
Auf deinem Album müssen dicke Features sein
Frag Sido und Bushido, die sagen sicher niemals nein
Über's Internet sind die ja leicht erreichbar
Und mit den Features in der Tasche ist gleich der Hype da
So wird deine erste Platte zum Selbstläufer
Auf der nächsten haste Eminem mit drauf

Your iron will makes them crawl
You have the power, the words of the wise
But it all comes behind the mask of flies

Sometimes I hope, I drown, let it go and fade away
Fall asleep with a shelter and never wake up again
Step aside and leave the signs, save them for another day
I am too weak, I cannot fight but I am still awake

Battleme,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one",House of the Rising Sun,2011

Of super-impositions of a room within the window

Made known to me the grainy stains, the crimson lotus
Of the black ash inheritance, the semen feed of Gods and masters

And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

They came from next door

And a bewildered stream of chatter
From all sorts of

Came from next door

But some men are chosen from the rest
But their disappointment runs with their guests
Never would be invited to the funeral rosegarden

But their choice don't seem to matter
They got swollen breasts and lips that putter
And their choice of matter and their scream of chatter
Is just a little parasitic scream of whores

A doll?s leg fits around you

Misfit plug and chicken pie

The cobweb?s torn, the tide is tired

Spin with fright when you're finding no way
And the drums get dark in night or day

Bauhaus,"He was in his room, half awake, half asleep 
The walls of the room seem to alter angles 
Elongating and shrinking alternately 
Then twisting around completely so that he was on the opposite
Side of the room 
A trick of the light and too much caffeine, he thought 
Then came a knock on the door 
And this sound was the same dark-brown tone as the wood of which
The door was made 
At first, he thought he'd imagined it 
Because it would not have been out of place with the other
Strange hallucinatory events of that night 
But then it came again 
Only heavier this time 
With a sense of real urgency 
So pulling himself up 
And stepping through pools of moonlight and shadow 
He made his bleary way across the room towards the door 
And slowly, apprehensively, raised the latch 

The latch became a fingertip, touching his own 
Energy sapping as a new form, transversing the edge of his
Emotions 
His power became his agony, his power knew no bounds 
Whereas before, his peace withstood the vastness 
His prerogative became an endless force of the all impossible 
His final soul is flying with contempt only 
Even the legendary glance backward to meet with eternity's stone
In peace or save his already destroyed 
You cannot share, the temperature is rising 
The ghost and monkeys make a choice 
This... 
This... 

He tried to will himself back to bed 
He wanted desperately to feel the reassuring crisp, white sheets
Once taken for granted 
To be back home, safe as houses, protected by walls covered in
Familiar patterns 
But even wallpaper had become sinister to him 
He remembered staring into the paisley print and seeing a
Repetition of skulls 
At night he would listen to the click of heels on the concrete
Outside 
And try to imagine the facial features of the unseen figure 
He would always see his own face 
And another realization of this prophecy rang terrible and true 
For at this moment, it was indeed, his own feet that filled the
Shoes 
Shoes that no man would want to wear 

Into the hills then to search for another searcher's closely
Held goals 
Into the forest under the billowing leaves 
Under the dreadful birds, the singing soil, the decrepid babies,
The unhappy new loves 
The preaching alphabetics, the long-lost lovers never to find
The safety of their mothers 
In fact, all the guilty clouds he will move into a playground 
A sense of moonlight and shadow 
All the stars touch to the cold molten sunflower, fly to his
Middle eye 
The wallpaper had sinister tones 
Alas, white cold 
Alas, rainbow's middle infinity's destination.",Departure,1989
Bauhaus,"The young man held a gun to the head of God 
Stick this holy cow 
Put the audience in action

The rancid peeling soul

Ich bin sicherlich kein Hipster, ich passe nicht in dein Register
Twizzla Minister, ich fick deine Sister
Bis die Bitch Nichts als mein Jizz im Gesicht hat
Vernichte dein Magister, alles was Du im Leben gelernt hast, vergiss` das
Es gibt nichts umsonst, nur wenn ich deine Mama bang`, kriegst du Geschwister
Du steigerst dein Ego, zu weit, du bist nur auf Steine wie Lego
Bleib in deim` Tretboot, meine Torpedos ficken dein peinliches Life wie Yayo
Was is los mit euch Schlampen habt ihr keine Jobs?
Alles was ihr wollt is` Schwanz in euren Eierstock
Sie wissen nicht wer bist du bist, sie wissen nicht wer du bist
Sie weiß nicht wer du bist, doch wer ich bin, das weiß sie noch!

Ich bin der, der durch die Stadt läuft wie ein Kaiser
Keinen Namen, nenn mich einfach deutscher Meister
Neue Zähne, neue Uhr, neue Kleider
Ich bin der, der euch begeistert
Und wer bist du?
Wer bist du?
Wer bist du?
Und wer bist du?",Wer bist du,2015

Betret' den Club kurz nach zwölf, Don Juan je m'appelle
Meine Jungs sind am Durchdrehen und wie immer sind alle am Reden
Louis-V-Umhängetasche, Inhalt vierzig Mil
Kein Bock auf Party, ich chill', chill' mit den Bras auf Rille
Hab' zwanzig Flaschen auf dem Tisch, trotzdem geh' ich an die Bar
Nehm' meinen Drink, denn Kanaken labern nur Müll
Von rechts und von links, erzählen und prahlen von Porsche Cayenne
Aber haben heut noch nicht mal 'ne Flasche geköpft
Was für platzen, mein Kragen wird sprengen
Ich wollt' gerade gehen, doch plötzlich macht der Abend einen Sinn

Und auf einmal steht sie an der Bar, lang gelocktes schwarzes Haar (jajajaja)
So hübsch wie du bist brauchst du Minimum vier Bodyguards
Deine Freundin warnt dich vor mir
Wenn sie dich so mag, sag
Wieso geht sie dann in die Disco mit dir?
Ich bin hypnotisiert von deinem Charisma
Aber du willst nur die Platincard
Aber du willst nur die Platincard (jaja)
Aber du willst nur die Platincard (jaja, jajajajajaja)
Aber du willst nur die Platincard

Karima, Karima, wenn du unbekannt bist, wieso kenn' ich deinen Namen?
Karima, Karima, du weißt genau, wer ich bin, also stell keine Fragen
Karima, Karima, einzige Grund, warum ich da bin, ist: du hast 'ne Visage wie 'ne Latina
Du darfst Ferrari fahren, denn wir chillen heute Nacht

Mach mir noch 'nen Drink
Schüttel deinen Arsch, wenn ich sag' und beweg ihn zu mir rüber, wenn ich wink'
Immer wenn ich sing', redest du von Heiraten
Aber nie schenkt dir dieser Baui einen Ring, Chin Chin
Nimm noch einen Wodka-Martini
Fahr mit mir im Aventador Lamborghini
Wie willst du zu diesem Leihwagen „Nein“ sagen
Steig ein, während der Fahrt kannst du mir Einen blasen
Mach hier nicht auf extravagant
Weil jeder von uns locker mit dir Sex haben kann
Karima, ich baller dich im Beifahrersitz
Weil eine Bitch bleibt eine Bitch, bang bang bang
Weil eine Bitch bleibt eine Bitch, bang bang bang

Will mit uns auf Party fahren
Sie will nicht alleine in den Club, ja
Whiskey unterm Fahrersitz
Sie sagt „Ich vertrage nichts“
Trotzdem nimmt sie einen großen Schluck, yeah
Sie macht die Flasche leer
Kostet und sagt „Ich kann nicht mehr“
Die Party hat noch lange nicht begonnen (oh mein Gott!)
Wolltest du nicht auch ein Teil
Von Bauis wildem Haufen sein?
Sieh dich an, das hast du jetzt davon, mhm

Die Stimmung kippt, Stimmung kippt, yeah
Die Tiere sind wild und alle wollen sie dich
Dein zartes Fleisch, Bambi
Alle wollen nur unter dein schwarzes Kleid, Bambi
Komm, ich fahre dich heim!
Okay, okay, okay, okay, bitte komm nicht zu nah!
Du bist übel besoffen, dir kleben noch eklige Brocken von Kotze im Haar
Ich hoffe ja mal, deine Mutter versohlt heute Nacht deinen knochigen Arsch
Und offen gesagt
Sollte sie dir auch verbieten, so kurze Klamotten zu tragen
Und mit Männern zu hängen, die Soldaten im Kosovo waren

Bist du echt so dumm?
Schau dich links und rechts mal um!
Jeder wartet drauf, dich zu entführen, ja
Keiner akzeptiert ein Nein
Deshalb fahre ich dich heim
Dank mir an einem andren Tag dafür
Und merk dir eins

Bevor ich schlafe, sterb' ich lieber an 'nem Herzinfarkt

Manche nehmen unsre Worte nicht ernst
Für andre ist es eine OP am offenen Herz
Doch wenn ihr denkt, dass wir nur ein Haufen Besoffener wären
Meine Jungs haben in Teufels Küche kochen gelernt, eh

Der Alkohol lähmt mich, alles dreht sich, meine Knochen sind schwer
