Patti Page,"By your side, satisfied
Through and through
Cause I was born to be with you

Wondrously, love can see
So I knew that I was born to be with you

Peace of mind
Yes I do
Cause I was born to be with you
All life through

Patti Page,"You'll be gone when the dawn comes tomorrow
You'll be far, far away out at sea
So I give you this croce di oro
It will bring you home safely to me

Ev'ry hour we're apart will be sorrow
In the chapel a candle will burn
Take my love and this croce di oro
I will pray for you till you return

My darling, my darling, my darling
Do you see that star in the blue?
Each night I will give it a message
And the star will give it to you

Till we meet on that far-off tomorrow
May the Good Lord be with you and then
With the help of this croce di oro
You'll be back in my arms once again

With the help of this croce di oro
You'll be back in my arms once again (croce di oro)",Croce de Oro (Cross of Gold),1997

Patti Page,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Patti Page,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,1997
Patti Page,"Never treat me sweet and gentle, the way he should
I've got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is oh, sentimental, not made of wood
I've got it bad and sweetheart that ain't good

But when the weekend's over
And Monday roll around
I, I end up like I start out
Cryin', cryin' my heart out, yeah

He don't love me like I love him
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody could
Said, I got it bad now
Oh Lord, said now and I, that ain't, that ain't good

Like a lonely weepin' willow
Said lost, oh yeah, I'm lost in the wood
Said, I'm, I got it bad now
Oh, yeah, that ain't good

Listen and the things I, I tell, I tell my pillow
No woman, oh, no woman should
Say, I got it bad, I got it bad, no, no
That ain't, that ain't good

Though the folks with good, good intention
They tell me, tell me to save my tears
But I'm glad, I'm mad about him, oh, yeah
And I say, I can't, I can't live without him, oh Lord

Lord above me, make him, make him love me
The way, the way he should
I got it bad now, say, now that ain't good
No, no, that ain't good

Say now, Lord above me, make him love me

Patti Page,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And then I peeped through the crack
And looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? I thought about you",I Thought About You,1997
Patti Page,"When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop I open shop

When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk, I go to work

Love for sale, appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled, love for sale

Who will buy? Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price, for a trip to paradise?
Love for sale

Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they

If you want to buy my wares follow me and climb the stairs

Patti Page,"Mad about the boy
I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
I'm so ashamed of it but must admit
The sleepless nights I've had about the boy

On the silver screen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware that here and there
Are traces of the cad, about the boy

Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school girl
In the fury of her first affair

Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy?
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy

So if I could employ
A little magic that will finally destroy
This dream that pains me and enchains me
But I can't because I'm mad, I'm mad about the boy",Mad About the Boy,1997
Patti Page,"Come sit by my side little darlin' 
Come lay your cool hand on my brow
And promise me that you will 
Never be nobody's darlin' but mine

Be nobody's darlin' but mine 
Love be honest be faithful be kind
And promise me that you will 
Never be nobody's darlin' but mine

You're as sweet as the flowers of springtime
You're as pure as the dew from the rose
I had rather be somebody's darlin'
Than a poor boy that nobody knows

Be nobody's darlin' but mine love",Nobody's Darling But Mine,1997
Patti Page,"And then she holds my hand, mm
And then I understand. mm
Her eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?
And then she dims the light, mm
And then she holds me tight. mm
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise

Patti Page,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,1997
Patti Page,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1997
Patti Page,"I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one
And while they were dancin'

My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz

Patti Page,"See then tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

I'm a rovin' cowboy ridin' all day long
Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song
Nights underneath the prairie moon
I'll ride along and sing a tune

See then tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

I know when night is gone
That a new world's born at dawn

I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed",Tumbling Tumbleweeds,1997

Gorgeous and dressed in blue
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue

And I can hardly speak my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell you, you think you know me well
But you don't know me

No you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
Who longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend that's all I've ever been
But you don't know me
 
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches, it aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
A chance you might love me too

You give your hand to me, then you say goodbye

So you met someone and now you know how it feels - goody goody
So you gave him your heart too, just as I gave mine to you

So you lie awake just singin' the blues all night goody goody

The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love

I'll do my best
To make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both
Won't say a word

Maybe
I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure
To meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday
Will be my good news day

You were the loveliest girl I'd seen in a long long time. 
You introduced me to him and while we were talking 
I just stood there thinking you never looked that good when you were mine. 

It was all I could do to hide all the things I was feeling. 
Lord just lookin' at you sent chills up and down my spine. 
I wanted so much to reach and touch you but I just stood there dyin'. 
You never looked that good when you were mine.

You know honey, I've wondered so many times 
If you still stayed out late the way we used to do. 
With all of our old friends, the jukebox and all that wine.

Oh maybe you just stay at home lovin' one another

I get a kick though it's clear to see

Beside the silv'ry sea.

And kiss you just once more.

And I was on the shore.

Will steal your love from me.

These words he did say as I boldly walked by.

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin.
""Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall.
""Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin.
""Roses to deaden the clods as they fall.""

""Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly.
""Play the dead march as you carry me along.
""Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me,
""I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

""Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother,
""An' tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone.

Always hear when you sigh

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Patti Page,"Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you
If you're young at heart.
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart.

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes.
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams.
And life gets more exciting with each passing day.
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way.

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart.
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart.

And if you should survive to 105,
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive!
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart.

You dreamed that he said goodbye

He held two roses within his hand
Two roses he gave to you
The red rose tells you of his passion
The white rose his love so true

What I think you are is all I see
And as long as you're a stranger
As long as you're a stranger
You'll stay perfect to me

Every night a lonely fight for something to be clear.
I turn the page of dreary days and that's when you appear.
So I build you up in little clay constructions in my head
And I like what I see.

[Chorus]

I used to seek within the crowd a place for me to hide.
Or look in every eye and try to find myself inside.
But in all this confusion, I have finally seen the light.
I've never known a person like the you I know tonight.

(Chorus)",Perfect Stranger,1996
Patti Rothberg,"Well I know that I got to leave you, Lover
But I don't see how I can
You say you want to make me happy
Go and find yourself another man
The first time that you told me this
You know my heart was about to crack
But I was givin' some guy just a little kiss
And that's when you wanted me back
No thanks to you I'm doing fine
Everybody has their day and this one's mine
People come around and tell me baby 'bout the way you won't be true
But I never loved you anyway so the last laugh is on you - HA
Couldn't keep me on the sidelines honey while you played the field no more - and
The thing that you never realized is it was me who was keepin score
You lost the game right down the line
Everybody has their day and this one's mine
You can beg and you can plead and get down upon your knees
I could say that you were a dirty dog but that's an insult to the fleas
I've given you about 10 second chances and ya blew it about eleven
Now I don't ever want to see your face right here 'less you ever make it to heaven
Somehow I know you're not that divine
Everybody has their day and this ones mine",This One's Mine,1996
Patti Rothberg,"You stay away from me
Because you know I'm good for you
And you are masochistic too
The reason I want you so much
Is 'cause I know you're no good for me
So together we are perfect dontcha see?
I'm the one you want
When you're so close I try to flaunt it
But you pretend not to notice
Yet I know you're being BOGUS
When you flirt with other women
And I know I could be swimmin' in yer sea
I could be so jealous of someone like me
Someone's got it all yet they just don't see
I shut out acceptance so I won't get hurt
And move on to the next one who will
Treat me like dirt
Treat me like dirt
Treat me like dirt
Standing at the threshold of another
Bad obsession, yeah-too bad it's with
A person who could never treat me
Worse then how the way you treated me
When I was staring at the backside of your neck
I was hoping soon you'd turn around
And look me over, up and down my heart was racing
'cause I knew I couldn't face you after giving you my heart and soul
Andgiving you the body of my mind
If I had a dollar every minute
Every hour that I spent obcessing
MADLY how you treated me so
BADLY and how badly that I
Wanted you the night you
Left me outside in the cold
But the thing that really gets me
Is the way you walk right past me
Yes you're talking to some other
And pretending she's your lover
Just to get me turnin' GREEN
Inside like bein' seen with me
Would be a crime
I could be so jealous of someone like me
Someone's got it all yet they just don't see
I shut out acceptance so I won't get hurt
And move on to the next one who will
Treat me like dirt
Treat me like dirt
Treat me like dirt
4:30 in the morning
Pickin' up the phone I'm yawning
Just awakened at the minute
From a dream that had you in it
I can still hear your sweet talking
But the next day you'd be walking
Out on me
Some day soon I know it
Maybe in December snow I'm
Gonna get you all alone and 
Take you to a place I've shown
To no one else in this great
World-yes, the place where
You will see me as you GIRL",Treat Me Like Dirt,1996
Patti Rothberg,"He's trying hard to keep control and lead the way.
He's finding all the perfect things to say to me.
I climb the stairs with only one thing on my mind.
To kick the habit of lost opportunity.

It's only natural to want what doesn't come.
I swiped away all of the pawns under my thumb.
But like the ending of a one-act play,
The curtain closes and the actors run away, and I'm

Wondering how small, how small am I.

As you turn the key to your door, you're turning me on.
And my mind spins high above the world.
That's the way I feel!

Patti Smith,"His father died and left him a little farm in New England.
All the long black funeral cars left the scene
And the boy was just standing there alone
Looking at the shiny red tractor
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
And circle the blue fields and grease the night.
It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.
Then he put his head in the crux of his arm
And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,
He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,
And he was very different tonight
'Cause he was not human, he was not human.

Little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him, the raven
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,
No, daddy, don't leave me here alone,
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
Where you're not human, you are not human.

But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.
Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet
Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,
All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,
I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,
Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it, where I am not human.

I am helium raven and this movie is mine,
So he cried out as he stretched the sky,
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day
And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights
Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,
And he put up his hands and he said, ""It's me, it's me,
I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,
I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,
Don't leave me here!""
The sun, the sign, the cross,
Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,
The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons
No longer presidents but prophets
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,
He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation
It's all gonna split his skull
It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining
Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
Like light, like Mohamed Boxer
Take them up up up up up up
Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,
I'm going up, I'm going up
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up
Up, up to the belly of a ship.
Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it
Where we are not human, we're not human.

Well, there was sand, there were tiles,
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated
Like a river of glass
When it hardened he looked at the surface
He saw his face
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals
And he looked up and the rays shot
And he saw, raven comin' in
And he crawled on his back and he went up
Up up up up up up
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,

Patti Smith,"Car stopped in a clearing,
Ribbon of life, it was nearing.
I saw the boy break out of his skin.
My heart turned over and I crawled in.
He cried, break it up, oh I don't understand,
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,
I'm not listening.
Snow started falling,
I could hear the angel calling.
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.
The boy flew away and he started to sing.
He sang, break it up, oh, I don't understand.
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't look at me.

The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,
I fell on my knee
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.
I cried, take me please!

Ice, it was shining.
I could feel my heart, it was melting.
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.
I cried, break it up, oh, now I understand.
Break it up, and I want to go.
Break it up, oh please take me with you.
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel.

So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.

Patti Smith,"The wall is high, the black barn
The babe in my arms, in her swaddling clothes
And I know soon that the sky will split
And the planets will shift
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop

Little sister, the sky is falling
I don't mind, I don't mind
Little sister, the fates are calling on you

Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind
The sea rushes up my knees like flame
And I feel like just some misplaced, Joan of Arc
And the cause is you lookin' up at me

Oh baby, I remember when you were born
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas
And I lit a match and the void went flash

And the sky split and the planets hit
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped
Stopped, stop, stop

Little sister, the sky is falling
I don't mind, I don't mind
Little sister, the fates are calling on you

I was goin' crazy, so crazy, I knew
I could break through with you
So, with one hand I rocked you
And with one heart I reached for you

I knew you're a youth, was for the takin', fire on a mental plane
So, I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces
Burst from the barn and flames in a violet, violent sky
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me

You're soul was like a network of spittle
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic
And I prayed as that lightning attacked
That something will make it go crack

Something will make it go crack
Something will make it go crack
Something will make it go crack

The palm trees fall into the sea
It doesn't matter much to me
As long as you're safe, Kimberly
And I can gaze deep into your starry eyes, baby

Looking deep in your eyes, baby
Looking deep in your eyes, baby
Looking deep in your eyes, baby
Into your starry eyes, oh

Looking deep in your eyes, baby
Looking deep in your eyes, oh oh

Patti Smith,"The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway

The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run,
But the movie kept moving as planned
The boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny
The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees,
Started crashing his head against the locker,
Started crashing his head against the locker,
Started laughing hysterically

When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Coming in in all directions
White shining, silver studs with their nose in flames,
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
Got to lose control and then you take control,
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi

Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, in his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, “Oh, pretty boy,
Can't you show me nothing but surrender?”
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,
Taped to his chest there's the answer,
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud,
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud,
And go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi

There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes,
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes

Baby calm down, better calm down,
On the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
Up there, there is a sea
Up there, there is a sea
Up there, there is a sea
The sea's the possibility
There is no land but the land (Up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea (Up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper of the key (Up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities. (Up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
I felt his hand on my knee (On the screen)
And I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame (In the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat(The spoon)
And let it deep in (The veins)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities (It started hardening)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities

I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud)
And go Johnny go and do the watusi,
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi
Shined open, coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined in your silky hair,
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers,
The hairs were like wires going through my body
I, I that's how I
That's how I
I died (At that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)
(They knew what they were after)
(Everything on the current) Moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land, but the land

Looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
That went streaming through the sands like fingers,
Like arteries, like fingers
He lay, pressing it against his throat (Your eyes)
He opened his throat (Your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard,
No one heard that cry,
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,
And so he seized the first (His vocal chords shot up)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate (There is nothing happening at all)
And go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep
Saw this sweet young thing (Fender one)

Patti Smith,"The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway

The boy looked at johnny, johnny wanted to run,
But the movie kept moving as planned
The boy took johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in johnny
The boy disappeared, johnny fell on his knees,
Started crashing his head against the locker,
Started crashing his head against the locker,
Started laughing hysterically

When suddenly johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Coming in in all directions
White shining silver studs with their nose in flames,
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
Got to lose control and then you take control,
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi

Life is filled with holes, johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, ?oh, pretty boy,
Can't you show me nothing but surrender ? ?
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,
Taped to his chest there's the answer,
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow and go rimbaud,
Go rimbaud, go rimbaud,
And go johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi

There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes,
Twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes

Baby calm down, better calm down,
In the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
Up there -- there is a sea
Up there -- there is a sea
Up there -- there is a sea
The sea's the possibility
There is no land but the land
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.

Patti Smith,"Wild leaves are falling
Falling to the ground
Every leaf a moment
A light upon the crown

That we'll all be wearing
In a time unbound
And wild leaves are falling
Falling to the ground

Every word that's spoken
Every word decreed
Every spell that's broken
Every golden deed

All the parts we're playing
Binding as the reed
And wild leaves are falling
Wild wild leaves

As the campfire's burning
As the fire ignites
All the moments turning
In the stormy bright

Well enough the churning
When enough believe
The coming and the going
Wild wild leaves

Patti Smith,"No equation
To explain the division of the senses
No sound to reflect
The radiance of time
In the beginningest dream
Halls of disorder
Where we are swept to encircle dawn
Strapped in a low car
Racing through silence
Trumpeting bliss
You could kiss the world
Goodbye

Standing outside the courthouse
In the rain
Seemed like a lost soul
From the chapel of dreams
With a handful of images
Faces of children
Phases of the moon
One little thing you get wrong
Changes the dimensions
Streets, swept memory
Diffused and lost
Like a prayer in the sun

Sometimes you can't tell
Whether you're waking up
Or going to sleep
Spiralling
Unnumbered streets
All the games cannot be yours
All the sights, the treasures of the eye
Does the divided soul remain the same?
No equation to explain
Destiny's hand
Moved, by love
Drawn by the whispering shadows
Into the mathematics
Of our desire
",It Takes Time,1991
Patti Smith,"Sixteen and time to pay off 
I got this job in a piss factory inspecting pipe 
Forty hours thirty-six dollars a week 
But it's a paycheck, Jack. 
It's so hot in here, hot like Sahara 
You could faint in the heat 
But these bitches are just too lame to understand 
Too goddamned grateful to get this job 
To know they're getting screwed up the ass 
All these women they got no teeth or gum or cranium 
And the way they suck hot sausage 
But me well I wasn't sayin' too much neither 
I was moral school girl hard-working asshole 
I figured I was speedo motorcycle 
I had to earn my dough, had to earn my dough 

But no you gotta, you gotta [relate, babe,] 
You gotta find the rhythm within 
Floor boss slides up to me and he says 
""Hey sister, you just movin' too fast, 
You screwin' up the quota, 
You doin' your piece work too fast, 
Now you get off your mustang sally 
You ain't goin' nowhere, you ain't goin' nowhere."" 
I lay back. I get my nerve up. I take a swig of Romilar 
And walk up to hot shit Dot Hook and I say 
""Hey, hey sister it don't matter whether I do labor fast or slow, 
There's always more labor after."" 
She's real Catholic, see. She fingers her cross and she says 
""There's one reason. There's one reason. 
You do it my way or I push your face in. 
We knee you in the john if you don't get off your get off your mustang Sally, 
If you don't shake it up baby."" Shake it up, baby. Twist & shout"" 
Oh that I could will a radio here. James Brown singing 
""I Lost Someone"" or the Jesters and the Paragons 
And Georgie Woods the guy with the goods and Guided Missiles ... 
But no, I got nothin', no diversion, no window, 
Nothing here but a porthole in the plaster, in the plaster, 
Where I look down, look at sweet Theresa's convent 
All those nurses, all those nuns scattin' 'round 
With their bloom hoods like cats in mourning. 
Oh to me they, you know, to me they look pretty damn free down there 
Down there not having crystal smooth 
Not having to smooth those hands against hot steel 
Not having to worry about the [inspeed] the dogma the [inspeed] of labor 
They look pretty damn free down there, 
And the way they smell, the way they smell 
And here I gotta be up here smellin' Dot Hook's midwife sweat 
I would rather smell the way boys smell-- 
Oh those schoolboys the way their legs flap under the desks in study hall 
That odor rising roses and ammonia 
And way their dicks droop like lilacs 
Or the way they smell that forbidden acrid smell 
But no I got, I got pink clammy lady in my nostril 
Her against the wheel me against the wheel 
Oh slow motion inspection is drivin' me insane 
In steel next to Dot Hook -- oh we may look the same-- 
Shoulder to shoulder sweatin' 110 degrees 
But I will never faint, I will never faint 
They laugh and they expect me to faint but I will never faint 
I refuse to lose, I refuse to fall down 
Because you see it's the monotony that's got to me 
Every afternoon like the last one 
Every afternoon like a rerun next to Dot Hook 
And yeah we look the same 
Both pumpin' steel, both sweatin' 
But you know she got nothin' to hide 
And I got something to hide here called desire 
I got something to hide here called desire 
And I will get out of here-- 
You know the fiery potion is just about to come 
In my nose is the taste of sugar 
And I got nothin' to hide here save desire 
And I'm gonna go, I'm gonna get out of here 
I'm gonna get out of here, I'm gonna get on that train, 
I'm gonna go on that train and go to New York City 
I'm gonna be somebody, I'm gonna get on that train, go to New York City, 
I'm gonna be so bad I'm gonna be a big star and I will never return, 
Never return, no, never return, to burn out in this piss factory 
And I will travel light.

We sat for a while he was very engaging

Wondering well I just couldn't discern
Will he come back come back to me

Over the columns that nestled the P.A.

Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off
With a skirt of green net sewed over
With flat metallic circles which dazzled and flashed
The lights were violet and [Incomprehensible] white
I had an ornamental veil, I can't bear to use it

With the way my hair was cropped, I craved, craved covering
But now that my hair itself is a veil
And the scalp inside is a scalp of a crazy
And a sleepy Comanche lies beneath this netting of skin

I wake up, I am lying peacefully
I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun
I desire him and he is absolutely ready to seize me
In, in, in, in, in heart, I am a Muslim, in heart, I am an American
In heart, I am Muslim, in heart, I'm an American artist and I have no guilt

I seek pleasure, I seek the nerves under your skin
The narrow archway, the layers, the scroll of ancient lettuce
We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly
The mole on the belly of an exquisite whore
He spared the child and spoiled the rod
I have not sold myself to God",Babelogue,1996
Patti Smith,"Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel

So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust

Because the night belongs to lust

Because the night
Belongs to lovers
Because the night
Belongs to us",Because the Night,1996
Patti Smith,"Nodding though the lamp's lit low
Nod for passers underground
To and fro she's darning
And the land is weeping red and pale

Weeping yarn from Algiers
Weeping yarn from Algiers

Weaving though the eyes pale
What will rend will also mend
The sifting cloth is binding
And the dream she weaves will never end

For we're marching toward Algier
For we're marching toward Algier

Lullaby though baby's gone
Lullaby a broken song
Oh, the cradle was our call
When it rocked we carried on
And we marched on toward Algiers
For we're marching toward Algiers
We're still marching for Algiers

For we're marching toward Algier
For we're marching toward Algier

Not to hail a barren sky
The sifting cloth is weeping red
The mourning veil is waving high
A field of stars and tears we've shed
In the sky a broken flag
Choldren wave and raise their arms
We'll be gone but they'll go on and on and on and on and on",Broken Flag,1996
Patti Smith,"Last night, last night I awoke up from a dream
Came face to face with my face facing the tombstone teeth
Of a man called Chiklets, he came down through the ages
With the desperate beauty of a middleweight boxer
He came beating the force field with the elegant grace

He was, he was trying to get a perfect grip
But there was no absolute grip
He was in a sailboat, in a glass bottom boat
And the bottom of a boat

He was coming down through the ages
Sea waxy molten, hot liquid spilling down to the spiny eye
Of the village the spinal eye, of the victim the spiny eye a tip
It was livin’ in, he was a victim like a question mark

Hovering over him what do you want from him
What do you want from him
He’s goin’ down on a dream too much unexplained
What do you think do you about

Think there was an actual
You think there was an actual connection at
I just can't imagine, I just can't imagine
A connection going down there

I can't imagine any connection
It’s like, like a boxing ring
All with gold ropes soft
Turned very soft desperate karat

Top spinning and coming down
Through the ages

Give yourself for fade out

Needed you, you withdrew, I was so forsaken.
Ah, but now the tables have turned, my move.
I believe I'll be taking my revenge.
Sweet revenge.

I thought you were some perfect read-out.
Some d-digital delay had obscured 
And phased my view of the wicked hand you played.
Ah, the sands and hands of time have run out, run out, ah you better face it.
Ah, this thing's run amok, this luck
I do know how to replace it with revenge.
Oh, sweet revenge.

I gave you a wristwatch, baby.
You wouldn't even give me the time of day.
You want to know what makes me tick.
Now it's me that's got precious little to say.
For the ghosts of our love have dried have died.
There's no use faking it.
Ah, the spirits gonna close in on you tonight.
High time I was taking my revenge.
Sweet revenge.

He waved goodbye to his comrades in arms,
And all the twisted things he'd seen.

With several thousand other names

As those bits of metal and the embers

Fanned out into the air

Just a boy going up
In flames in the smoke

Just another breath

As eternal as a sheet of marble
Eternal as a slab on a green hill

And all your fallen brothers
And all the ones not cut

We conceived of you
We conceived of your breath
We conceived of the whole human race
And we conceived it to be a beautiful thing

In the form of a handful of dust
Comes back in the form of a smitten child
Our raped daughters, ah the broken bones
Souls cleaved from hearts
They come back to us
And our hands are filled with their rotting tissues
But we turn not our backs
We press our lips
Into their cancer into the dust into the remains of each one
And that love is there and will greet you, will greet you

It's eternal love

Well here, go ahead, run through that flame
Awww man, running through your mind
You took a cat, you took a life, you took it by the tail
And you swirled it around your head
And you thrashed it, you smashed the life out of it
And you knew that it would be your own
But you wanted to feel, you wanted to feel it die
Because you know you would feel your own
You would feel your own
But you're remembered!
You're remembered!
You're remembered dead!
You're remembered dead!
You're remembered dead!
We remember
We remember
We remember
Everything

Patti Smith,"If you believe all your hope is gone
Down the drain of your humankind
The time has arrived 
You'll be waiting here as I was 
In a snow-white shroud 
Waiting underground

There by the ridge be a gathering beneath the pilgrim moon
Where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth
Where the great ones tremble
In their snow-white shrouds
Waiting underground

If you seek the kingdom come, come along
Waiting by the ridge there'll be a gathering 
Beneath the pilgrim moon 
Where the [railroad] thunders

Oh where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth
And as the earth resounds where the great ones tremble
And your humankind becomes as one
And then we will arise 
In our snow-white shrouds
When we'll be as one
But until that day we will just await
In our snow-white shrouds

In our snow-white shrouds

Patti Smith,"Hello friend, I've come a callin'
Passively stationed, active patrol
Slidin' in at high noon like some reluctant sheriff
Not wanna get involved in it all

Who stands guard for each other?
Why must we guard anything at all?
Anything at all

From the earth's four corners the people are calling
Forming equations but the questions are hard
All men are brothers, killing each other
And Mother Earth is wringing in wonder

Who stands guard for each other?
Oh, why must we guard anything at all?
Anything at all

Whirl away now
Whirl away now
Whirl away now
Whirl away

There's a cross on the road, there's a great mill turnin'
Some seeking answers, some born to dancers
You can hold on the blade and turn around forever
Be flung into space into another kind of grace

Who stands guard for each other?
Oh, why must we guard anything at all?
Anything at all

Whirl away now

Whirl away now

Give [Incomprehensible]
Some giveth their hand
Some giveth their land
Some giveth their life

You lay in the fields of grain, the staff of life all around you
But yet you, you will cut someone down
For their possessions, some material thing
And our children they're being blown away like wishes in the wind

For the sake of their coat
Or the colors of their coat
Or the color of their skin
Or the name on their shoes

And the mother cries
""Why they taken my son?""
And the father wonders
""Are they taking my boy?""

He extended his hand
He gave them his land
He gave them his bread
He gave them his heart

Said, ""Hello friend""
Hello friend
Hello friend
Hello friend

Patti Smith,"Toward another 
He has gone 
To breathe an air 
Beyond his own 
Toward a wisdom 
Beyond the shelf 
Toward a dream 
That dreams itself 

About a boy 
Beyond it all 
About a boy 
Beyond it all 

From the forest 
From the foam 
From the field 
That he had 
Known 
Toward a river 
Twice as blessed 
Toward the inn 
Of happiness 

About a boy 
Beyond it all 
About a boy 
Beyond it all 

From a chaos 
Raging sweet 
From the deep 
And dismal street 
Toward another 
Kind of peace 
Toward the great 
Emptiness

About a boy

Patti Smith,"Oh the story's told been told retold
From the sacred scriptures to the tabloids
All the fuss and fight none above a whisper 
The soul of gold the belly of a boy

Well they drew him from the forest 
Like they draw blood 
Tied him to a tree like St. Sebastian
And he turned his head and let the arrows fly
Through the trees, the trees
The ornamental leaves

Boy cried wolf 
Wolf don't come 
Wolf within 
Boy cried wolf 

In the ancient mold they're dancing down
Calling to the moon but it don't answer
And they fell on their knees
and passed the bowl around 
And the blood the blood the sacramental blood

Boy cried wolf
Wolf don't come
Wolf within
Boy cried wolf

I am the body I am the stream
I am the wake of everything
They bring me flowers that are myself
Garlands of blood that are myself
Slain the lamb that is himself

Torn reborn the cries of our dismay
Are nothing to the wind but whose to mind
Kings are lifted up and kings are thrown

Will breathe a truth

For destiny my china bird
Is calling for you

Near and far

Come and take a walk with me 
Stroll into infinity
We'll stroll along 
Until the dawn is gone
Midnight take it to the twilight

Let's turn it off and on off and on

Strolling ain't it wonderful
Into a light that lingers 
On and on, on and on

Strolling ain't it wonderful
Stars fall for we two
Bathed in a light of our own

That simply slips away 
You can rise above it 
It will shed easily 

It all will come out fine

Rolls on ahead 

Like a ship in a bottle 
Held up to the sun 
Sails ain't going nowhere 
You can count every one 
Until it crashes unto the earth 
And simply slips away 
You can hide in the open 
Or just disappear

And a twist of the wrist 
Will undo the stopper 
With abrupt tenderness 
Die little sparrow

Patti Smith,"On a field of red one gold star 
Raised above his head
Raised above his head
He was not like any other
He was just like any other 
And the song they bled 
Was a hymn to him 

Awake my little one
The seed of revolution
Sewn in the sleeve 
Of cloth humbly worn
Where others are adorned

Above the northern plain 
The great birds fly 
With great wings
Over the paddy fields
And the people kneel 
And the men they toil
Yet not for their own
And the children are hungry
And the wheel groans 

There before a grass hut
A young boy stood
His mother lay dead 
His sisters cried for bread
And within his young heart 
The seed of revolution sewn
In cloth humbly worn 
While others are adorned

And he grew into a man
Not like any other 
Just like any other
One small man
A beard the color of rice
A face the color of tea 
Who shared the misery
Of other men in chains
With shackles on his feet
Escaped the guillotine

Who fought against 
Colonialism imperialism
Who remained awake
While others slept
Who penned like Jefferson
Let independence ring
And the cart of justice turns
Slow and bitterly
And the people were crying
Plant that seed that seed 
And they crawled on their bellies
Beneath the giant beast
And filled the carts with bodies
Where once had been their crops

And the great birds swarm 
Spread their wings overhead
And his mother dead 
And the typhoons and the rain
The jungles in flames
And the orange sun
None could be more beautiful 
Than Vietnam
Nothing was more beautiful 
Than Vietnam

And his heart stopped beating
And the wheel kept turning 
And the words he bled
Were a hymn to them
I have served the whole people 
I have served my whole country
And as I leave this world 
May you suffer union
And my great affection 
Limitless as sky 
Filled with golden stars

The question is raised
Raised above his head
Was he of his word
Was he a good man
For his image fills the southern heart
With none but bitterness

And the people keep crying
And the men keep dying 
And it's so beautiful 
So beautiful

Give me one more turn
One more turn of the wheel 

One more revolution
One more turn of the wheel",Gung Ho,2000

Said you'd love me only
Kiss the ribbons in my hair
Said darling come and fly

Lifted me into your life

You marched proudly for the horn 
I prayed for your swift return
I waited for you so forlorn
'Ere to be alone 
I longed for you, I longed to die

The pillow's bare by my side
And yet I shall abide

For heaven has aset for me

Tracing the lines of face after face 
Looking down at their naked feet 
Bound in chains bound in chains 
Chains of leather chains of gold

And paraded them down the colonial streets 
And that's how they became enslaved 

They came across on the great ships
Mothers separated from their babes 
Husbands stood on the auction block 
Bound in chains bound in chains 
Chains of leather chains of gold

And led them to toil in fields of white
As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape

Am I not a man and a brother
Am I not a woman and a sister

They come down through time 
To embrace to enrage 
And in their arms even stranger fruit 
And they swing from the trees
With their vision in flames

Toward a mission yet unclear Advancing pole by pole

Fortune breathed into my ear Mouthed a simple ode

The pain of our existence Was not as I envisioned

One road is paved in gold One road is just a road

Boots that tramped from track to track Worn down to the sole
One road was paved in gold One road was just a road

In my Blakean year Temptation but a hiss
Just a shallow spear Robed in cowardice

Brace yourself for bitter flack For a life sublime
A labyrinth of riches Never shall unwind
The threads that bind the pilgrim's sack Are stitched into the Blakean back

So throw off your stupid cloak Embrace all that you fear
For joy shall conquer all despair In my Blakean year

What garden beneath her feet The one you drill
You drill Pulling the blood of the earth

Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,

Snow started falling,
I could hear the angel calling.
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.
The boy flew away and he started to sing.
He sang, “Break it up, oh, I don't understand.
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't look at me.”

The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,
I fell on my knee
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.
I cried, “Take me please!”

Ice, it was shining.
I could feel my heart, it was melting.
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.
I cried, “Break it up, oh, now I understand.
Break it up, and I want to go.
Break it up, oh please take me with you.
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,

Patti Smith,"I was dreaming in my dreaming 
Of an aspect bright and fair 
And my sleeping it was broken 
But my dream it lingered near 
In the form of shining valleys 
Where the pure air recognized 
And my senses newly opened 
I awakened to the cry 
That the people have the power 
To redeem the work of fools 
From the meek the graces shower 
It's decreed the people rule 

People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 

Vengeful aspects became suspect 
And bending low as if to hear 
And the armies ceased advancing 
Because the people had their ear 
And the shepherds and the soldiers 
And they lay among the stars 
Exchanging visions 
And laying arms 
To waste in the dust 
In the form of shining valleys 
Where the pure air recognized 
And my senses newly opened 
I awakened to the cry 

People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 

Where there were deserts 
I saw fountains 
Like cream the waters rise 
And we strolled there together 
With none to laugh or criticize 
And the leopard 
And the lamb 
Lay together truly bound 
I was hoping in my hoping 
To recall what I had found 
I was dreaming in my dreaming 
God knows a purer view 
As I lay down to my sleeping 
I commit my dream to you 

People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 

The power to dream to rule 
To wrestle the earth from fools

Can come to pass through our union 
We can turn the world around 
We can turn the earth's revolution

In this land
We placed Baptismal fonts
And an infinite number were baptized

And are you going anywhere?
Where are you going
Send me a letter, if you go at all

Ahh, the salvation of souls, 
But wisdom we had not
For these people had neither King nor Lord
And bowed to no one
And they had lived in their own liberty

Where are you going, 
And are you going anywhere?
Going in circles
Going in circles, anywhere

I saw the new
The inconstant shifting of fortune
And now I write to you
Words that have not been written
Words from the New World

Moving across my eyes
Lying on a ship
And gazing at the western skies
Tracing lazy circles in the sky

Wake Up!
Wake Up!

Where are you going,
And are you going anywhere?
Where are you going
Send me a letter, if you go at all

It's such a delight
To watch them dance
Be it sacrifice or romance
Free of all the things that we hold dear
Is that clear, Your Excellency?

And I guess it's time to go but 
I gotta send you just a few more lines

Moving across my eyes

And gazing at the western skies

Patti Smith,"In Arezzo I dreamed a dream
Of Saint Francis who kneeled and prayed
For the birds and the beasts and all humankind.
All through the night I felt drawn in by him
And I heard him call
Like a distant hymn

I retreated from the silence of my room
Stepping down the ancient stones washed with dawn
And entered the basilica that bore his name
Seeing his effigy I bowed my head
And my racing heart I gave to him I kneeled and prayed
And the sleep that I could not find in the night
I found through him
I saw before me the world of his world
The bright fields, the birds in abundance
All of nature of which he sang
Singing of him
All the beauty that surrounded him as he walked
His nature that was nature itself
And I heard him - I heard him speak
And the birds sang sweetly
And the wolves licked his feet.

(O Signore, fa' che sia strumento della tua Pace:
Dove c’è odio, lascia che sia Amore.
Dove c’è offesa, Perdono.
Dove c’è dubbio, Fede.
Dove c’è disperazione, Speranza.
Dove c’è oscurità, Luce.
Dove c’è tristezza, Gioia.
Fa' ch'io non cerchi tanto
Di essere consolato, quanto consolare.
Di essere compreso, quanto comprendere.
Di essere amato, quanto amare.)

But I could not give myself to him
I felt another call from the basilica itself
The call of art - the call of man
And the beauty of the material drew me away
And I awoke, and beheld upon the wall
The dream of Constantine
The handiwork of Piero della Francesca
Who had stood where I stood
With his brush stroked The Legend of the True Cross
He envisioned Constantine advancing to greet the enemy
But as he was passing the river
An unaccustomed fear gripped his bowels
An anticipation so overwhelming that it manifested in waves

All through the night a dream drew toward him
As an advancing Crusade
He slept in his tent on the battlefield
While his men stood guard
And an angel awoke him
Constantine within his dream awoke
And his men saw a light pass over the face of the King
The troubled King
And the angel came and showed to him
The sign of the true cross in heaven
And upon it was written

In this sign shall thou conquer

In the distance the tents of his army were lit by moonlight
But another kind of radiance lit the face of Constantine
And in the morning light
The artist, seeing his work was done
Saw that it was good

In this sign shall thou conquer

He let his brush drop and passed into a sleep of his own
And he dreamed of Constantine carrying into battle in his right hand
An immaculate, undefiled single white Cross
Piero della Francesca, as his brush stroked the wall
Was filled with a torpor
And fell into a dream of his own

From the geometry of his heart he mapped it out
He saw the King rise, fitted with armor
Set upon a white horse
An immaculate cross in his right hand.
He advanced toward the enemy
And the symmetry, the perfection of his mathematics
Caused the scattering of the enemy
Agitated, broken, they fled

And Piero della Francesca waking, cried out
All is art - all is future!
Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure
With a brush and an eye full of light
But as he advanced in age
The light was shorn from his eyes
And blinded, he laid upon his bed
On an October morning 1492, and whispered
Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure
Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure

And a world away - a world away
On three great ships
Adventure itself as if to answer
Pulling into the New World
And as far as his eyes could see
No longer blind
All of nature unspoiled - beautiful - beautiful
In such a manner that would have lifted the heart of St. Francis
Into the realm of universal love

Columbus stepped foot on the New World
And witnessed beauty unspoiled
All the delights given by God
As if an Eden itself, as if Eden had opened her heart to him
And opened her dress
And all of her fruit gave to him
And Columbus so overwhelmed
Fell into a sleep of his own
All the world in his sleep
All of the beauty, all of the beauty entwined with the future
The twenty-first century
Advancing like the angel
Advancing like the angel
That had come
To Constantine
Constantine in his dream
Oh this is your cross to bear
Oh Lord Oh Lord let me deliver
Hallowed adventure to all mankind
In the future
Oh art cried the painter
Oh art - Oh art - cried the angel
Art the great material gift of man
Art that hath denied
The humble pleas of St. Francis
Oh thou Artist
All shall crumble into dust
Oh thou navigator
The terrible end of man
This is your gift to mankind
This is your cross to bear
And Columbus saw all of nature aflame
The apocalyptic night
And the dream of the troubled King
Dissolved into light",Constantine's Dream,2012

Patti Smith Group,"Last night, last night I awoke up from a dream
Came face to face with my face facing the tombstone teeth
Of a man called Chiklets, he came down through the ages
With the desperate beauty of a middleweight boxer
He came beating the force field with the elegant grace

He was, he was trying to get a perfect grip
But there was no absolute grip
He was in a sailboat, in a glass bottom boat
And the bottom of a boat

He was coming down through the ages
Sea waxy molten, hot liquid spilling down to the spiny eye
Of the village the spinal eye, of the victim the spiny eye a tip
It was livin’ in, he was a victim like a question mark

Hovering over him what do you want from him
What do you want from him
He’s goin’ down on a dream too much unexplained
What do you think do you about

Think there was an actual
You think there was an actual connection at
I just can't imagine, I just can't imagine
A connection going down there

I can't imagine any connection
It’s like, like a boxing ring
All with gold ropes soft
Turned very soft desperate karat

Top spinning and coming down
Through the ages
41 B.C.
Give yourself for fade out

But these bitches are just too lame to understand 
Too goddamned grateful to get this job 
To know they're getting screwed up the ass 
All these women they got no teeth or gum or cranium

You screwin' up the quota, 
You doin' your piece work too fast, 
Now you get off your mustang sally 
You ain't goin' nowhere, you ain't goin' nowhere."" 
I lay back. I get my nerve up. I take a swig of Romilar 
And walk up to hot shit Dot Hook and I say 
""Hey, hey sister it don't matter whether I do labor fast or slow, 
There's always more labor after."" 
She's real Catholic, see. She fingers her cross and she says

All those nurses, all those nuns scattin' 'round 
With their bloom hoods like cats in mourning.

Down there not having crystal smooth 
Not having to smooth those hands against hot steel 
Not having to worry about the [inspeed] the dogma the [inspeed] of labor 
They look pretty damn free down there, 
And the way they smell, the way they smell 
And here I gotta be up here smellin' Dot Hook's midwife sweat 
I would rather smell the way boys smell-- 
Oh those schoolboys the way their legs flap under the desks in study hall 
That odor rising roses and ammonia 
And way their dicks droop like lilacs 
Or the way they smell that forbidden acrid smell 
But no I got, I got pink clammy lady in my nostril

Patti Smith Group,"The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway

The boy looked at johnny, johnny wanted to run,
But the movie kept moving as planned
The boy took johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in johnny
The boy disappeared, johnny fell on his knees,
Started crashing his head against the locker,
Started crashing his head against the locker,
Started laughing hysterically

When suddenly johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Coming in in all directions
White shining silver studs with their nose in flames,
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
Got to lose control and then you take control,
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi

Life is filled with holes, johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, ?oh, pretty boy,
Can't you show me nothing but surrender ? ?
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,
Taped to his chest there's the answer,
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow and go rimbaud,
Go rimbaud, go rimbaud,
And go johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi

There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes,
Twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes

Baby calm down, better calm down,
In the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
Up there -- there is a sea
Up there -- there is a sea
Up there -- there is a sea
The sea's the possibility
There is no land but the land
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.
(up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee
(on the screen)
And I looked at johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame
(in the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
(the spoon)
And let it deep in
(the veins)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening in my hand
And I felt the arrows of desire

I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(go rimbaud go rimbaud go rimbaud)
And go johnny go and do the watusi,
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined through the air,
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers,
(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)
The hairs were like wires going through my body
I I that's how I
That's how I
I died
(at that tower of babel they knew what they were after)
(they knew what they were after)
[everything on the current] moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land but the land

Looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
That went streaming through the sands like fingers,
Like arteries, like fingers
(how much fits between the eyes of a horse? )
He lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)
He opened his throat (your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard,
No one heard that cry,
No one heard (johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,
(his fingers)
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,
And so he seized the first
(his vocal chords shot up)
(possibility)
(like mad pituitary glands)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate
(there is nothing happening at all)
And go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep
Saw this sweet young thing (fender one)
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter

In the sheets
There was a man
Dancing around
To the simple
Rock & roll

I curled up the rug and I vacuumed my hair.

I even had you believing that I really really like it like that
But there was never a moment
Not a moment
Now you know
Now you know
Now you know
Now you know
You ever got within a hundred million miles of my soul

I spit, I spit in the eye
I tear, I tear out my heart
And I scatter the bits
I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I'm sold by a lie
By this I am able in all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I clearly recall every little bit

You left open the window till the morning
And the winter walked in
Reality fired her wooden bullet
Splintered under our skin
They say I'm walking on freedom
This is freedom
Now I know
Now I know
Now I know
Now I know
I still don't blame you for leaving,baby
It's cold living with ghosts

Patty Griffin,"We are swimming with the snakes
At the bottom of the well
So silent and peaceful in the darkness where we fell
But we are not snakes and what's more
We never will be
And if we stay swimming here forever we will
Never be free

I heard them ringing the bells
In heaven and hell
They got a secret
They're getting ready to tell
It's falling from the sky
Calling from the graves
Open your eyes, boy, I think we are saved
Open your eyes, boy, I think we are saved
Let's take a walk on the bridge
Right over this mess
Don't need to tell me a thing, baby
We've already confessed
And I raised my voice to the air
And we were blessed
Everybody needs a little forgiveness [Repeat: x1]

We are calling for him tonight on this
Thin phone line
As usual we're having ourselves one
hell of a time
And the planes keep flying right over our heads
No matter how loud we shout
""Hey, hey, hey !""
And we keep waving and waving
Our arms in the air
But we're all tired out

I heard somebody say
Today's the day
A big old hurricane
Is blowing our way
Knocking over the buildings
Killing all the light
Open your eyes, boy, we made it through the night
Open your eyes, boy, we made it through the night
Let's take a walk on the bridge
Right over this mess
Don't need to tell me a thing, baby
We've already confessed
And I raised my voice to the air
And we were blessed

It's hard to get

Patty Griffin,"Ain't no talkin to this man
Ain't no pretty other side
Ain't no way to understand the stupid words of pride
It would take an acrobat, and I already tried all that so
I'm gonna let him fly
Things can move at such a pace
The second hand just waved goodbye
You know the light has left his face
But you can't recall just where or why
So there was really nothing to it
I just went and cut right through it
I said I'm gonna let him fly

There's no mercy in a live wire
No rest at all in freedom
Of the choices we are given it's no choice at all
The proof is in the fire
You touch before it moves away
But you must always know how long to stay and when to go

And there ain't no talkin' to this man
He's been tryin' to tell me so
It took awhile to understand the beauty of just letting go
Cause it would take an acrobat, I already tried all that

Patty Griffin,"Diamonds, roses,I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

Everywhere is somewhere And nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is queer

Every time I see him he smiles
And he tells me how well he's walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die, he'd hear about it eventually

Patty Griffin,"She sees him laying in the bed alone tonight
The only thing a touching him is a crack of light
Pieces of her hair are wrapped around and 'round his fingers
He reaches for her side for any sign of her that lingers
And she says you are not alone
Laying in the light
Put out the fire in your head
And lay with me tonight
One of them bullets went straight for the jugular vein
There were people running,
A flash of light then everything changed
Nothing really matters in the end you know all the worries sever
Don't be afraid for me my friend
One day we all fall down forever
She says you are not alone
Laying in the light
Put out the fire in your head
And lay with me tonight
The wedding date was June just like any other bride
She loved him like no one before and it was good to be alive
Sometimes that can slip away as fast as any fingers through your hands
So you let time forgive the past and go and make some other plans
You are not alone
Laying in the light
Put out the fire in your head
And lay with me tonight
You are not alone
Laying in the light
Put out the fire in your head
And lay with me tonight

Patty Griffin,"You know you've done enough when every bone is sore
You know you've prayed enough when you don't ask any more
You know you're coming to some kind of understanding

Mama says god tends to every little skinny sheep
So count your ribs and say your prayers and get to sleep
Nothing is louder to god's ears than a poor mans sorrow
Daddy is poor today and he will be poor tomorrow

Hey that's the poor man's house
Everybody get a look at the poor man's house
Everywhere they went before must have turned them out
And now they're living in a poor man's house

There's nothing like poverty to get you into heaven
They got a lot of wine and fish up there
And the bread's unleavened
They got a lot of ears that heard a whip go crack
Lots of missing toes and fingers and scars upon their backs
Daddy's been working too much for days and days
He doesn't eat
He never says much but I think this time it's got him beat
It isn't that he isn't strong or kind or clever
Your daddy's poor today
And he will be poor forever

That's the poor man's house
Those kids are living in a poor man's house
They walk to school with the soles of their shoes worn out
And come home in the evening to the poor man's house

What are you chopping that wood for
Why are you growing that corn
Mama's sewing a brand new shirt and
You're wearing the one that's torn
I guess it's for some one else's kid who wasn't born 
In a poor man's house

I hated being your fool
So I got a little bit more mud on my face

Whatever I knew it was nothing at all
Nothing at all, just making me small
Smaller and smaller
I fall back

Sooner or later with a view from the ground
Chasing the race and the races run you down
Sooner or later with a view from the ground
And a tear in your eye
You say baby why can't we fly
Into the blue sky
High
Into the blue sky

Be my singing lesson
Be my song
When I tell you I'm falling
You tell me I'm strong
You say trees have grown tall
Birds have flown high
Higher and higher
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
I'll fly over a rainbow
I'll be sun kissed
Sail around the planet Venus
And send a long letter
Way back home
That says all that I know
All that I know is the blue sky

Who would know better than you

Well, I guess it takes while
For someone to really disappear
And I remember where I was

It was a day much like today
The sky was bright, and wide, and blue

And I wonder where you are
And if the pain ends when you die
And I wonder if there was
Some better way to say goodbye

Today my heart is big and sore
It's tryin' to push right through my skin
I won't see you anymore
I guess that's finally sinkin' in
'Cause you can't make somebody see
By the simple words you say

Oh I ran so far through a broken land
I was following that drummer
Beating in a different band 
And somewhere on the highway
IÂ´let go of her hand
Now sheÂ´s gone forever
Like her footprints in the sand

Toora loora loora lo
First the seed and then the rose
Toora loora loora li

My baby needs a pilot
She has no magic wand
To help her part the troubled waters
Of the Rubicon
But in my soul I know sheÂ´ll
Have to go this one alone
After all that is only way sheÂ´s ever known

But there is no lamp in all this dark
That could chase away her shadow
From the corners of my heart
I pray sheÂ´s ride a dolphin
But sheÂ´s swimming with the shark
Out where none can save her
Not even Noah and his ark

Toora loora loora lo
To the cradle comes the crow
Toora loora loora li

And down every road that bends

In the summer he'd march without any shoes 
Until the soles of his feet turned black

Like a dog running on a track
The wheels keep on going as fast as you get there

Just watching myself in some play
And the actress looks like she wants to go home
And lie in bed all day

Something as hard as a prayer on your back

When I was little I'd stare at her picture
And talk to the mother of God
I swear sometimes I'd see her lips move
Like she was trying to say something to me

When I was eighteen I moved to Florida,
Like everyone sick of the cold does,
And I waited on old people waiting to die
I waited on them until I was

I'm standing in the shadow of the hill
Feel the fear everywhere
Hope it don't get me killed
I'm standing in the shadow of the hill
I'm standing in the shadow walking blind
I've been unfair & unkind
Turned away from your suffering far too many times 
Now I'm standing in the shadow walking blind
Sister, brother, there's a fire on the hill
And it's burning like a lantern
Making all this time stand still
I'm standing, I'm standing, I'm standing
I'm standing, standing, standing
Mother, I am weak but I am strong
Standing in the darkness this long
But in the deepest darkness I listen to your song

Was all these are

When you'd come in in the morning
To whisper goodbye
Go work at the rain

Don't know why

Cause everyone's singing
We just want to be heard

Patty Griffin,"Say goodbye to the old street that never cared much for you anyway
And the different colored doorways you thought would let you in one day
Goodbye to the old bus stop frozen and waiting
The weekend addition has this town over-rated
You walk across the baseball green
The grass has turned to straw
A flock of birds tries to fly away from where you are
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye old friend
I can't make you stay
I can't spend another ten years wishing you would anyway

How the sky turns to fire
Against the telephone wire
And even I'm getting tired of useless desires

Everyday I take a bitter pill
It gets me on my way
For the little aches and pains
The ones I have from day to day
To help me think a little less about the things I miss
To help me not to wonder how I ended up like this
Walk down to the railroad track and ride a rusty train
With a million other faces I shoot through the city veins
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye old friend
You wanted to be free
And somewhere beyond the bitter end is where I wanna be

How the sky turns to fire
Against the telephone wire
And even I'm getting tired of useless desires

Say goodbye to the old building that never tried to know your name
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye old friend
You won't be seeing me again
Goodbye to all the window panes shining in the sun
Like diamonds on a winter day
Goodbye, goodbye to everyone

How the sky turns to fire

Tell them they've had their day, it's someone else's tomorrow

Farther and farther, floating away
Will never return now, all wooden and burned out

Just seventeen and already divorced
She took to the air with the greatest of ease

Some people want to know what it feels like to fly
Gather their courage and they give it a try

So she went to the tent of the lady of the snakes
Who gave her a potion and she drank it in
After that her heart never ached again
After that her heart never ached again

For wealth and what it will buy

Than to live in this world in a house of gold

Went to the well

She didn't know where he came from
But when he told her
Every sinful thing she had done
The man at the well
Blessed my soul and go on

""Do you know that man?""
She said ""No, I never saw him before""
They asked her ""Did you get his name?""

When he spoke, my soul caught on fire
And I'll remember that day 'til the day that I die

Blessed my soul and go on

He was standing off an angry mob
Defending a women who'd been caught
In the very act of adultery
For pity and mercy she sought
He said ""Ye who is without sin cast the first stone""
And when he raised her from the ground
All her accusers were gone
He gave her a smile, waved farewell and moved on

""Do you know the man?""

Patty Griffin,"I went back to Boston
Back to the city of lost love
I went back to the place
And recognized your face in the stone long gone

I walked around Harvard square
All the runaway kids are still hanging out there
I took the red line a wrong way
Across the river Charles

And they never fly

Reach up from the waves
You'll find that you're only waving goodbye

I went walking in Boston
A little bridge I used to walk on
I was slipping on a hog
And I flung into that sea of strong
Processing need not apply
For you to license to fly
Hey young lady don't be so surprised
You know you're not alone

Something's changed track
And they never fly
And they never fly
Reach up from the waves
You'll find that you're only waving goodbye

It was memorial day
I went to where you lay
There were thousands of people
Just like you in a chain graveyard

You came out of there awake
Looking for the sky
And got a slap in the face
Well hey
Desperate needs a big led
And gets put in the place
You better know your place boy

Something's changed track
And they never fly

But you leave the biggest tips

On the bed, on the chair
Did I send myself away
On a sleepy afternoon
Will I be returning soon

And the boy who had gone to defend me
She's a good friend of mine

When all those stones have all been thrown
Gotta give, get a chance to get a look at his kid
And hope he can live with whatever he did

Now meanwhile
He was reading magazines on the front line
He was trying not to think about her life
And what he might have done
'Cause it seemed like neither one of them
Were having any fun

See lately
She'd been acting kinda crazy lately
Oh man, I thought she was gonna hate me
'Cause I couldn't watch her little one
I had so much to do, I was so high strung

And it won't be long till daddy's home

You gotta bring your soldier home
When all those stones have all been thrown
You gotta give, get a chance to get a look at his kid
And hope he can live with whatever he did

And lately, all the hate escapes me
And lately all the hate just escapes me lately

So he phoned her
He said, ""Darling, I've been feeling so alone here
Am I making myself perfectly clear
And I'm on my way back just a couple more missions
And I start getting packed""

Danny flew his stars and stripes

Till he took off with the navy 

Jesus was a sailor, boys
Sailed on Galilee
If he went to work today
He'd have to sail the seven seas 

Danny took his fishing boat
A hundred miles away
To the waters no one owns
To the land of wind and wave 

All along the seacoast towns
Along the narrowland
They heard a storm was coming down
Two parts water one part sand 

The wind it drove the sea so wild
It opened like a jaw
Came down in a salty smile
And it ate up all it saw 

Fifteen feet the ocean rose
Fifteen feet it fell
When that boat began to fall
Must have seemed like hell

Had a wife and a baby
Saw them in the sea that night

Don't want to wish nobody dead
Don't want to be the girl on the tilt-a-whirl

All of this is only in my head
Thene we both pull up to the big red stop
And the cop says ""Go ahead""

Patty Larkin,"Italy
by Patty Larkin 
I'd like to go to Italy
Just to eat the food
Just to drink the wine
Just to go 

I'd like to go to Italy
Just to walk the road
Beneath the olive tree shade 

But Italy is a long distance call
Italy is a long distance call
Operators are standing by
But I don't speak Italian at all 

I have a map of Italy
And it looks just like a boot
Kicking aqua blue into the air 

A friend who went to Italy
Said the men are rude
They don't look at your eyes
Or your hair 

But Italy is a long distance call
Italy is a long distance all
Operators are standing by
But I don't speak Italian at all 

I'd like to go to Italy
So my passport would look used
Just to change my point of view
Just to go 

I'd like to go to Italy
Jus to walk the road
Beneath the olive tree shade

Patty Larkin,"Johnny was a Pyro
by Patty Larkin 
Johnny Was A Pyro and he acted like a baby
Wanted all of this attention I couldn't give
Drink a bottle of hard stuff, say I love you now save me
Just a big guy with a big sense of sin 

And the neighbor down the block in his underwear and socks
Keeping track of the losses and wins
With his wife hanging out the window wondering which way the wind blows
As I fumble the key in the lock again, singing 

Oh me
What am I doing with this ring on my hand
Oh me
If this is the good life who's choosin it
Oh me
Mama's best woman and daddy's best man
Oh me
I'm highly in danger of losin it 

Johnny Was A Pyro and he acted like a baby
Got a phone call from wild almost every night
Well he loved me but he really loved looking past me to the ladies
He was much too good looking for his height 

We were a couple of kis crawling out of the crib
Talking about the positives and the negatives of wine
Living our lives just like Hemingway did
But he was lucky, he was a genius most of the time 

Oh me
What am I doing with this ring on my hand
Oh me
If this is the good life who's choosin it
Oh me
Mama's best woman and daddy's best man
Oh me
I'm highly in danger of losin it 

He was sideswiped by the clue bus when it came to talking two of us
And the while thing ended ugly I guess
You can put your cards out on the table but if nobody wants to play 
Well, you haven't got a game you've got a mess 

I was looking at the judge leaning on my lawyer like a crutch
And the judge said what happened and why
I said, Johnny Was A Pyro and he acted like a baby
Now there's nothing like the sound of good bye 

Oh me
What am I doing with this ring on my hand
Oh me
If this is the good life who's choosin it
Oh me
Mama's best woman and daddy's best man

by Patty Larkin 
My name is Mary
Mary Magdalene
I let the devil carry me
To the dark side of a sin 

I heard his laughter
And I tried to run
Now there is no ever after
After everything I've done 

I'm all broke up
I'm all broke down
Got turned around somehow
Who is my savior now 

I took off running
Just to feel the wind
I shook off my innocence
Now I want it back again 

I heard the siren
Coming from the past
Ninety miles from nowhere
I was going nowhere fast 

I'm all broke up
I'm all broke down
Got turned around somehow
Who is my savior now 

My name is Mary
Mary Magdalene
I let the devil carry me
To the dark side of a sin 

I told the silence
I wanted to go back
But standing in the midnight shade
A shadow fades to black

I'm all broke down
Got turned around somehow
Who is my savior now

by Patty Larkin 
It was Me And That Train
One night in Colorado
Driving out of Denver
I was following a shadow 

Staring down the mountain 
With my mouth wide open
Wondering why
I thought about the ocean 

Up along the pass
The snow was blowing
On Me And That Train 

It was Me And That Train
Like the first time that I met you
You were holding up the sky
Leaning on your leather 

And I saw her with you
And I thought you were together
Like that moment in question
Took a ten second answer 

You were out the door
You were headed for me
Like Me And That Train 

And the trucks were sliding sideways
Like sons of bitches
They were putting on their tire chains
Rolling into ditches
And I crawled on by
Like God was throwing the switches
For Me And That Train 

It was Me And That Train
Like the night before Christmas
I was working downtown
A shopkeeper mistress 

And a guy in a ski mask
Had a gun in his pocket
And he pointed to the safe
And he told me to unlock it 

I put my jands in the air
And I laughed because I couldn't stop it
Just like Me And That Train 

And the trucks were sliding sideways
Like sons of bitches
They were putting on their tire chains
Rolling into ditches
And I crawled on by
Like God was throwing the switches
For Me And That Train 

It was Me And That Train
When I drove into the canyon
It was coming up the river
Like a long lost companion 

And the walls went to heaven
Into endless darkness
But the train lit up the sandstone
Like a thousand pardons 

Just then underneath me
And my beating heart was
Me And That Train 

And the trucks were sliding sideways
Like sons of bitches
They were putting on their tire chains
Rolling into ditches
And I crawled on by
Like God was throwing the switches
For Me And That Train

Look at your hand there in the wind
Familiar as your name
You're gonna spread your fingers like a wing
That will lift you up when you wave 

You're gonna wave good-bye
And the world will sigh

Whisper soft and low
It's gonna take you where the ocean ends
To the river red and gold

So she gave him the kindness of her hand
He had the smooth skin of a girl
And he moved like water through the sand
Out along the green fields
He said I do she said I will
Looking forward
Headed for the coast of Brazil 

Through the eye of a curtained window
She framed the portrait of her world
She'd watch as the sun stood waiting
She called herself a shadow of a girl
Autumn kissed the summer
She packed her things in the morning chill
Left the lace in the window waving
Headed for the coast of Brazil 

He lived the life of a beggar
But he was born a banker's only son
He was born an angel without wings
To the lady of Spain in old San Juan
Down at the harbor
They held their breath and stood still
Then they boarded a slow boat
Headed for the coast of Brazil 

Pray for the faithful
Pray for the dream that never rests
Pray for the pilgrims
Pray for the hope inside the breast
Pray for the good ones

East is east
And west is west
There's nowhere else to go 

Hey stay a while
Let the wild winds blow
Heal up by the fire
There's no where else to go 

I'll keep a look out for you
Keep your head down low
Keep that ticket in your pocket
There's no where else to go


All those high speed rides
We survived again
All those best laid plans
We'll leave to mice and men
All those damaged daydreams
Blown up in a row

Careful as you go

Patty Larkin,"I remember walking with holes in our shoes
I remember we weren't the kind to make an excuse
I remember thinking we would break all the rules
Where are those children now? Where are those children now?

I remember hellfire and brimstone be damned
I remember trembling at the touch of your hand
Crossing the desert to the California sand
Where are those children now? Where are those children now?

I remember angels who lent us their wings
Cigarettes and paperback poetry kings
Kicking up dust like we didn't need a thing
Where are those children now? Where are those children now?

Now the curtain calls and fails to fill me
I wander down the halls that used to thrill me

I remember singing, ""San Francisco Bay Blues""
I remember being happy just paying our dues
I remember thinking we had nothing to lose
Where are those children now? Where are those children now?
Where are those children now?

I said I was a boy
I'm glad he didn't check
I learned to fly, I learned to fight
I lived a whole life in one night
We saved each other's lives out on the pirate's deck
And I remember that night
When I'm leaving a late night with some friends
And I hear somebody tell me it's not safe, someone should help me
I need to find a nice man to walk me home
When I was a boy, I scared the pants off of my mom
Climbed what I could climb upon

And I don't know how I survived
I guess I knew the tricks that all boys knew
And you can walk me home, but I was a boy, too

I was a kid that you would like, just a small boy on her bike
Riding topless, yeah, I never cared who saw
My neighbor came outside to say, ""get your shirt""
I said ""no way, it's the last time I'm not breaking any law""
And now I'm in a clothing store, and the sign says less is more
More that's tight means more to see, more for them, not more for me
That can't help me climb a tree in ten seconds flat

When I was a boy, see that picture? that was me
Grass-stained shirt and dusty knees
And I know things have gotta change
They got pills to sell, they've got implants to put in, they've got implants to remove
But I am not forgetting
That I was a boy, too

And like the woods where I would creep, it's a secret I can keep
Except when I'm tired, except when I'm being caught off guard
I've had a lonesome awful day, the conversation finds its way
To catching fire-flies out in the backyard
And I tell the man I'm with about the other life I lived
And I say now you're top gun
I have lost and you have won
He says, ""oh no, no, can't you see?""
When I was a girl, my mom and I, we always talked
And I picked flowers everywhere that I walked
And I could always cry, now even when I'm alone I seldom do

I'll wake to find you gone
I'm learning how to lose you now

Your heart can feel no pain
I know, I know you'll soon be gone

With a heart shaped honeymoon suite

I'll hold my head up high
I will roll across these mountains

The other a new one

He wasted not his time away
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the things avail
But trusted one who never fails
Oh, Daniel prayed
Each morning, noon, and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night

They locked him in the lions' den
Because he could not honor men
But he prayed to God
Every morning, noon, and night
The jaws were locked; it made him shout
And God soon brought him safely out
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon, and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night

Now, brother, let us watch and pray
Like Daniel did from day to day
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon, and night
We, too, can gladly dare and do
And pray to God he'll see us through

Every morning, noon, and night

Rise up Lazarus
Rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe
Then you shall be released

Go forth John and Paul
Spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe
And they shall be released

Now Jesus went to Bethany
In answer to an urgent plea
Two sisters fell down at his feet
They began to cry and weep
They lead him to their brother's grave
Jesus knelt to God and prayed

(Chorus)
Rise up Lazarus
Rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe
Then you shall be released

Go forth John and Paul
Spread the Gospel to them all
Give them courage to believe
And they shall be released

Now doubters who would not believe
Spread the word of what they'd seen
Then they began to congregate
First two to four then four to eight
God watched faithful multiply
As they echoed Jesus Cried

Rise up Lazarus
Rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe
Then you shall be released

Go forth John and Paul

Give them courage to believe
And they shall be released

Sometimes doubt worldly worth
But if in Jesus you do trust
You will rise like Lazarus
So if your feelin' down and out
Open up your heart and shout

Rise up from the dust
If in Jesus you believe

I am a soul of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to east Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised
For many a year I have struggled
No pleasure here on Earth I've found
All through this world I'm bound to wander
There is no one to help me now
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many a year in peace I'll lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
It's fare-you-well my one true lover
I never 'spect to see you again
But there's one promise that is given
I'll meet you in God's golden land

""You'll never leave Harlan alive""

Oh, my grandfather's dad crossed the Cumberland Mountains
Where he took a pretty girl to be his bride
Said, ""Won't you walk with me, out of the mouth of this holler
or we'll never leave Harlan alive""

Where the sun comes up about ten in the mornin'
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
Till a man from the northeast arrived
Wavin' hundred dollar bills, said, ""I'll pay you for your minerals""
But he never left Harlan alive

Grandma sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where Big Richland River winds
And I bet they danced them a jig
And they laughed and sang a new song
""Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive""

But the times they got hard and tobacco wasn't sellin'
And old granddad knew what he'd do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal
And sent the money back to grandma
But he never left Harlan alive

Where the sun comes up about ten in the mornin'
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life diggin' coal from the bottom of your grave

To the anchor man out on the walk

Circondati dagli sbagli

Cammineremo insieme se vorrai
Dimentico chi sei

There's nothing there, you know

Could I have loved someone like the one I see in you
I remember the good times baby now, and the bad times too
These last few weeks of holdin' on
The days are dull, the nights are long
Guess it's better to say

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you

'Cause baby it's over now
No need to talk about it
It's not the same
My love for you's just not the same
And my heart, and my heart
And my heart can't stand the strain
And my love, and my love
And my love won't stand the pain
And my heart, and my heart
And my heart can't stand the strain
And my love, and my love

Patty Smyth,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge

And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge

Playboys and socialites, young and fly fly fly

1989: No pressure, but to the best that's in my section
Levels of a professional, skip school, create my own lessons
Confessions of a mad rapper, music's got me wrapped up
Green stretching only leads to red stretchers
He's next in line for the blessing, get your mind off mine,
Hustle something and stop relying on mine, molding a lesson while u letting time fly by

At age 17 addicted to ink, a rap fiend who had money dreams, my taste of fame couldn't compare to what I'd seen
Them dying, government lying', all for that paper cheese
Mom's cryin', watching her only son through TV, MTV, BET
He on now, wipe me down, no longer fighting through the crowd
I control the crowd, how you like me now? Wow

Diamond life, sugar baby we dynamite,
Playboys and socialites, young and fly fly fly

Diamond life, sugar baby we dynamite,
Playboys and socialites, young and fly fly fly

Back to the cold, motivational roads
No guidance, just violence and probational homes
Thinking my hot routes is all out, music gotta be my way out
Family gathered around I gotta make 'em proud,
Pops propped in the penitentiary laid out, hoping his son feel under a different cloud
I'm speaking directly into the crowd, nothing but personal,
Just thought you'd want to know the person
Far from perfect, but nearly word perfect
Must be he, rate him on the scale from one to me
Me equaling greatness, one equalling every ten haters
The rest couldn't make it due to unlikely behavior,
So be patient or end up the next patient
Emergency room, newspaper, the new rappers call 'em straight actors
Music wise, they playing safety and I'm shootin off safety
Aiming for greatness,

Diamond life, sugar baby we dynamite,

Now everybody wear your game face (Dynamite)
Forget everybody just do what he say
They wanna move like, they wanna be like, you can do it just like

PAttYCraSH,"When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up
I stare into space and don't say much
Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up
Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning Js, Baileys
Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs
Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
And plus the toxins I sip got me tall
Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles
Every day is like a blank canvas
Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it
Hand picked to live this life we take for granted
Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it
Smiling through the trouble we face, trying to manage
My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine
The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Before I rise and shine like a neon sign
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein
And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton
It's my only bonafide break from these confines
I need a change of scenery like a montage
These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside
I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod
And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline
I got to try different things in these trying times
Twenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five
It's come alive time, I picked a fine time
For getting open off life like a fine wine

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Sunday morning, plan my day out
Whole new blueprint, brand new layout
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out
But for the first time feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith
Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base
But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase
And I finally understand my right to choose
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds
Something inside said that's the move
And made it today, I'll restart fresh and new

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today

Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day",The Day,2010

Take a bite to the memory
Street dreams, this is the moment
The moment that feels like forever
This is the end to where I began
And it feels like forever
They say time flies down from sky and says never
I look down, all I see is never
And all I know is all I know

I was born faceless in an oasis
Folks disappear here and leave no traces
No family ties nigga no laces
Less than a full deck nigga no aces
Waitin' on Superman losing all patience
Gettin' wasted on an everyday basis
I'm stuck here can't take a vacation
So fuck it, this shit is damnation
This is reality mane
Ain't no surprise I've been bangin' without any mane
What is this gotta be brave
When into the night I'm going to go quietly mane
Life is a bitch and then you live
Until one day by death you're found
I tried to keep both of my feet on the ground
But I know my head is surrounded by clouds
Spirallin' down, destined to drown
Forever is just a collection of nows
Off on my own, nowhere is my home
Approaching infinities fork in the road
When I was young something I often was told
It's not a bargain if it costs you your soul
Costs you your pride, caution aside
I'm gone with the wind and I'm long for the ride
Wish I could rest and open my eyes
But time ain't finna fly down from the sky
A place where the lonely love
Not another soul's there, only us

Street dreams, close your eyes
Take a bite to the memory
Street dreams, this is the moment
The moment that feels like forever
This is the end to where I began
And it feels like forever
They say time flies down from sky and says never
I look down, all I see is never

Que mi cuerpo necesita 
Quitate la pena y perdón 
Pero primero la camisa 

Malditas las ganas que tengo de verte 
De que lluevas sobre mi desierto 
Hay entre los dos una cuenta pendiente 
¿Qué te parece si arreglamos eso? 

Ay tómame, llévame un ratito al paraíso 
Ponme las estrellas en el piso 
No hace falta tanto compromiso, compromiso 
Acuérdate que tengo la mente peligrosa 
Y esta noche que te ves como una diosa 
Se está poniendo buena la cosa, ay, la cosa

Me gusta, me gusta 
Tú tienes algo que me gusta 
Me gusta, me gusta 
Tú tienes algo que me gusta 
Tú tienes algo, tienes algo que me gusta 
Tienes algo, tienes algo

Ay tómame, llévame un ratito al paraíso 
Ponme las estrellas en el piso 
No hace falta tanto compromiso, compromiso 
Acuérdate que tengo la mente peligrosa 
Y esta noche que te ves como una diosa 
Se está poniendo buena la cosa, ay, la cosa

Me gusta, me gusta 
Tú tienes algo que me gusta 
Me gusta, me gusta 
Tú tienes algo, tienes algo que me gusta 

Tú tienes algo 
Tú tienes algo, algo que me gusta 
Malditas las ganas que tengo de verte 
Tú tienes algo que me gusta",Cuenta Pendiente,2018
Paty Cantú,"Ya ves, siempre acabamos, ay, así
Sólo haciéndonos sufrir
Por no evitar discutir
Por no evitar discutir

¿Por qué, ya no podemos hablar
Sin una guerra, empezar?
Y la queremos ganar
Y la queremos ganar

¿Y a dónde vamos a parar?
Con esta hiriente y absurda actitud
Démosle paso a la humildad
Y vamos a la intimidad
De nuestras almas en total plenitud
¿Y a dónde vamos a parar?
Cayendo siempre en el mismo error
Dándole siempre más valor
A todo, menos al amor
Que hoy no nos deja separar
¿Y a dónde vamos a parar?

Tal vez, por lo que fue nuestro ayer
Nos cuesta tanto ceder
Y eso nos duele aprender
Y eso nos duele aprender

¿Y a dónde vamos a parar? (a dónde vamos a parar)
Con esta hiriente y absurda actitud
Démosle paso a la humildad (démosle paso a la humildad)
Y vamos a la intimidad
De nuestras almas en total plenitud (en total plenitud)
¿Y a dónde vamos a parar? (a dónde vamos a parar)
Cayendo siempre en el mismo error (siempre el mismo error)
Dándole siempre más valor
A todo, menos al amor
Que hoy no nos deja separar
¿Y a dónde vamos a parar?

¿A dónde vamos? ¿A dónde vamos?
¿A dónde vamos a parar?

Pau Schoeffler,"We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll

Say you don't know me, or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight
We got too many runaways eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll

We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll

Someone's always playing corporation games
Who cares they're always changing corporation names
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible, write us off the page

Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll

We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll

It's just another Sunday, in a tired old street
Well if you got the toco, oh, then we just lost the beat

Who counts the money underneath the bar
Who writes the wrecking ball in two wild guitars
Don't tell us you need us, 'cause we're just simple fools
Looking for America, coming through your schools
Yeah

Don't you remember (remember)

Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll

We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll

We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll, oh

We built, we built this city
Built this city
Built this city
We built, we built this city
Built this city
Built this city
We built, we built this city
Built this city
Built this city
We built, we built this city
Built this city
Built this city",We Built This City/Too Much Time on My Hands,2009
