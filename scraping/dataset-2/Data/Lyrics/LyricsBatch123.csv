Day One,"There is a woman
Who lives in this town
That has my heart
Held in her hand

I see her in the
Streets every day
But I can't find
The words to say

But if I were a writer
And could write a good hand
I'd write of this love
That I don't understand

The words in my head
They come and they go
I'm thinking I love her
But she'll never know

And if I were a sculptor
And had a good eye
I'd carve out her beauty
In marble or ice

But these hands of mine
Are far from refined
I guess I'll have to accept that I am
Just an ordinary man
I'm just an ordinary man

Now, if I were good looking
And had a pretty face
And if I could walk
And speak with grace

And if I had style
Then I
Wouldn't have to look down when she walked by

And if I were a singer
And could sing a good key
I'd sing of this love
In melody

But this voice of mine
Is far from refined
I guess I'll have to accept that I am
Just an ordinary man
I'm just an ordinary man

I know one day she'll look
I know one day she'll see me
And maybe that one day
She'll want to be with me
And maybe she'll love me
For who I am
Just as that ordinary man
Just as that ordinary man",Ordinary Man,2000
Day One,"Shhhhh.. be quiet now, be still my darling
I can see you lying there in your bed
Even know you're ?only in my head
I'm so far away x6

And if you could see what I can see
And if you could hear me now baby
And I can tell you this paradise is lost
Flowers blossom in stone in this place I'm livin lost
I'm so far away x3
And what I think I'm trying to say is
I can't help thinking about you
And I can't help thinking about every one in you
I can't help thinking about you
And I can't help thinking about every one in you

Do you remember old times my friend
Who knows good old times
You seem so distant now
From these days of mine
I can see you clearly now
Joking and drinking wine
Even know it's only in my mind

And if you could see me now
And if you could hear me now my friend
I can tell you this paradise is lost
Flowers blossom in stone in this (soons ?)
I can I'll be coming home
I'm so far away x3
And what I guess I'm trying to say is
I can't help thinking about you
And I can't help thinking about every one in you
I can't help thinking about you
And I can't help thinking about every one in you

I wonder what you're doing now
And whatever you're doing now
I hope you're alright
Do you remember that night ?
That night seems?so far away x3

And I could see what I can see
And its only me that can hear me
And I'm the only one in those
Paradises lost flowers blossoms in stone (stolen?)
I wish I was back home x2",Paradise Lost,2000
Day One,"I said you're the woman from last night
Standing just to my right
You're the one that said I was sweet
When I left your kiss in my cheek
And said we could hook up sometime maybe
Well now is a good a time as any
She said I don't mean to offend you
But you're not quite how I remembered you
You seemed to look a lot better then
But I think you're nice as a friend
So pull up a seat and sit down
We're just having a drink and hanging out
So I tried to play it sexy and hurt
She said I came across as an introvert
So I changed to being a deep and profound
Until she asked me if I was feeling down
And when I told her that I was well read
She looked at me and just said : waouf waouf !

You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
Whatever it is I'm not buying

So I phoned her that weekend
She said she's seeing a barman called jonathan
He wears nice clothes and keeps his hair neat
But I could give her a call back next week
So next week we're out to coffee
She tells me she's really gone off me
I say gone off me' hey you don't know me
She said exactly so don't phone me
I said you haven't even given this a chance
She smiled and looked with a glance and said : waouf waouf !

You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
Whatever it is I'm not buying

You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
Whatever it is I'm not buying

When is this loneliness gonna end and
When will they stop crawling about their boyfriends (boyfriends)
When is a girl gonna get with me (me)
There must be one in this city see ' (see)
All I want is something that's real (real)
I'm tired of having to spiel (spiel)

Two months later she phones me up now
Saying hey I heard you're doing well now
Let's you and me go out for a meal
'cause I've never told you how I really feel
So how about it and you can meet me
I said which me did you want to see?
I got a girl now who knows who I am
So I can be my own man I'm flattered but

You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
Whatever it is I'm not buying

You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
You're trying too hard but keep trying
Whatever it is I'm not buying",Trying Too Hard,2000
Day One,"About 2 o' clock I left the party
 I'd been drinking red wine and talking hardy
 So I walked to the bus stop and looked over the city
 Said hello to the man sitting there but he didn't hear me
 So it's me and this stranger both trying to find a way home
 Waiting for a bus that was never gonna come
 So I said did you have a good night trying to make some discussion
 The man said what's your problem I said nothing
 'Cause I'm just walking now talking now and living now
 And you're just walking now talking now and living now
 In fact we're both walking now talking now and living now
 So just walk now talk now and live now

 It's getting half for three and I'm getting lonely
 I call out my baby for some company
 So we're lying there in bed talking about nothing in particular
 I was staring at the ceiling and she was reading kama-sutra
 Then she sat up and said you know our sex life is getting sort of circular
 So I took her to the desk and switched on the computer
 And said we're gonna take a trip down the information super highway
 But if you're gonna come with me then you've got to do it my way
 All it takes now is one push on the button
 She said what's your problem I said nothing
 I'm just walking now talking now and living now
 And you're just walking now talking now and living now
 In fact we're both walking now talking now and living now
 So just walk now talk now and live now

 It's around 4 o' clock and I'm back at the party
 They're still drinking red wine and talking hardy
 But now I've got a problem nobody wants to ask me what it is
 They said that they would only it's none of their business
 And someone says what's your opinion on Russian animal welfare
 I said that's the least of my problems that's be quite frank I don't care
 And someone said you have a good night trying to make some discussion
 I said what's your problem he said nothing
 I'm just walking now talking now and living now
 And you're just walking now talking now and living now
 In fact we're both walking now talking now and living now

Day One,"It was a windy day outside the cafe
He was drinking coffee, she was sipping chardonnay
And the were both from different (murks ? ) of life,
Hers' a better life, his' a harder life
He walked his rhythm in worn leather shoes, the sole split
Down in an old leather jacket
She walked her rhythm in designer shoes expensive,
Her style got it (bother ? ) quite overdressed
And then it happened, looking at each other imagine us as lovers
Don't ask said words, we only sat and sight
It felt right so stepped to her and said to her :

""leave with me and compete with me
Leave with me and complete with me""

As they walked there was a silence between them
And silence is that counts for words
She looked into his eyes, romanticised his whole life
He had that look that he was foreign
Get up and smoke and spoke his words like a ballon
He was unshaven, (haired are craven ? )
For danger of a stranger, looked like he had it in his nature
And she said : ""what are you thinking
What are you thinking about ?
What are you thinking, what are you thinking about ?
And he said:"" the difference between thinking and talking
Is that talking is the expression of thought
And thought is the unexpressed idea
So if I know it is enough and ( if I said it I'd've thought em .?
She said:"" you can't think enough""
He said:"" you can think too much, you can think up a dream
But there's no dream that you can touch""
""but I can touch you, so you must be true""
And said (it out ? )
That I can touch you, so you must be true and said (...? )

Day Ta Day,"Girl you're gettin' that look in your eyes,
and it's starting to worry me.
I ain't ready for no family ties,
nobody's gonna hurry me.
Just keep it friendly girl 'cause I don't want to leave,
Don't start clinging to me girl 'cause I can't breathe.
 
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free.
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
 
Girl you're a hot blooded woman, child,
and it's warm where you're touching me.
But I can tell by your tremblin' smile,
you're seeing way too much in me.
Girl don't let your life get tangled up with mine,
'cause I'll just leave you, I can't take no clinging vine.

hopin' maybe you'll call
Not you, you'll break a date

Here's my angle (think about it)
Takes two to tango and I ought to know

Who do you, Who do you, Who do you love?
Who do you, Who do you, Who do you love?

You always ask what for

Where's the danger (tell me 'bout it)

When I see you I cannot speak

Day-Shawn,"Wake Up!
This is the real deal not a test
Now society is calling out an SOS
Get down on the ground, put the earth to your ear
You feel that sound? That’s revolution you hear

Welcome to the greatest battle of all time
We’ve just officially been targeted by our own kind
The time has arrived now were sounding the alarm
Man up, grab your loved ones, get everybody armed

Prime all the triggers and try to remain calm
As we gather all the weapons and prepare the bomb
Now we got it on lockdown, were ready to go,
Get on the radio, send it out, let everybody know

The threat is getting closer, the sky is turning gray
Its right on the horizon, today is the day
It’s within the city limits rolling fast like a mist
Now were caught up in the midst, this is it
The Apocalypse

Since the very beginning of mankind
In every generation, every era in time
There has always come an instant where we must define
Who we are as a people when we must cross the line

This is that moment, now you’re gonna find
Exactly what you’re really made of inside
When comes right down to it what you gonna choose
To proudly hold your ground or just lie down and lose?

The brave at the frontlines, ready for war
The enemy approaching outside the door
Dust off your voice box, time to be heard
And as the gate drops
We’ll be screaming these words

This is our world, our streets, our war
Our lives, this is what we fight for
Our choice to make the wrong things right with
Our voice, we bring day to the night

This is our world, our streets, our war
Our lives, this is what we fight for
Our choice, we’re the voice of the globe
Turn up the volume so everybody knows
This is Our World

(Ladies and gentlemen, 
may we please have your undivided attention as our featured guest speaker now takes the stage)
Camaraderie is an oddity now in this age
Silence becomes violence when it’s mixed with rage
Tragedies and death; they say it’s all a phase
Society lying to me
It’s on the front page

Homicides, genocides, can’t run the streets
If you saggin’ and you flaggin’ its cold; you keep heat
I understand your plan; be strong not weak
My gut feelin’ is this killin’ goin’ make us obsolete

Let’s defy not rely on negativity
We gotta makeover, takeover these communities
Analyze, capitalize, opportunities
Speaking of change ain’t strange
It all starts with me and you. So what you gonna do?
Close your eyes and just glide till your life it through?
We’ve got work to do. Were gonna start know how?
By saying these words right here
Right Now!

This is our world, our streets, our war
Our lives, this is what we fight for
Our choice to make the wrong things right with
Our voice, we bring day to the night

This is our world, our streets, our war
Our lives, this is what we fight for
Our choice, we’re the voice of the globe
Turn up the volume so everybody knows
This is Our World

(You gonna stand by and just let somebody run your life? 
You gonna let somebody tell you what to do? This is your world 
You make the rules, you make the difference)
You think one man don’t make a difference, think again
Cause I just started an army picking up a pen

This begins a global collaboration
To take the whole world and make but one nation
This ain’t no imitation what you hearing is elite
That's why everything stops when you hear us speak

Oh! Back to the mission at hand, we’ve got a plan
Take the message that were sending and spread it across the land

It’s in black and white, it’s been written, been read
Now let every single syllable settle into your head

As it slowly resonates from your mind to your feet
We’ll make the earthquake from stomping this beat

Cause if you’re hearing this right now the battles been won
It’s spreading my friend, The Takeover Has Begun
This is our world, our streets, our war
Our lives, this is what we fight for
Our choice to make the wrong things right with
Our voice, we bring day to the night

This is our world, our streets, our war
Our lives, this is what we fight for
Our choice, we’re the voice of the globe

Life is such a crazy thing
It's never really what it seems 
Cause first we were chillin
Now I'm catchin feelins

And I'm saving every message you sent 
I'm tryna reading between the lines 
To see if there was somethin' I missed

Everything I needed was right here,

Control me (and I'm ready, girl I'm ready)

I really love your company, 
Hate it when you gotta leave

One day were making plans
And the next day girl you leaving me
Okay so I'm a jerk
I know I made you hurt
I know your girlfriend was right
I got what I deserved
I know the last time
You said it was the last time
But baby all I need
Is one more last time
I'll make the best of it
I'll stop all my bull-shit
And I'll become the man
You always said you wanted

'Cause since you've been gone
I just can't seem to get right
And I miss you more than you'll ever know
Girl I just want a chance to talk to you
Let you know that I've changed
Since you been gone
I stay awake all night
This bed just ain't the same
Without you here
I felt like I was alone
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone from me (let me talk to her)

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Girl all that really means is I just miss you
Girl you got me saying
Oh oh oh oh (oh oh)

I'm missin' you oh since you whoa

Rose petals in the tub.
Listening to your favorite song.
Every time our bodies touch.
This is what it feels like.

Any place that you want to explore I'm coming.
I'm assuming that you already know what pleases me.

I think I'm 'bout to lose it.
Just watching you move it real slow.
Don't let it go.

No need to speed up the pace.
I can replace the past you had.
And redefine what passion is.
Got me feeling all kind of ways.
You know I can't wait anymore.
Baby, when I'm with you it's like...


Like a brand new pair of shoes from your favorite designer.
This how it feels whenever you're touching me.

Inside of the phantom
And it's lookin' like a sauna
And I stay high and I still got my diploma
And I still keep the Maggie on me like Homer
And I'm too sick man I'm spittin' out a coma
And I'm still lettin' the money pile like goma
And I smoke that kill, y'all blowin' on begonias
And I keep a field of that grass like a farmer
And I keep that armor, try me and I'll spin you around
I'll be with the stars and I ain't talkin' tinsel town
That's right the prince in town, bitch tear the fences down
Like prince in town
Boy I shits a pound of that purple rain on the Marvin's day
You wit me now?
Too high you can't set me down

We got that A-K-forty seven
White right on champagne
And named it orange purple kush 
That million dollar top brand

Docters, requestin' dope weed
Blazin' up so much bomb
I gotta baggage on my fly

See see we just smokin' we just smokin',

If you got the bomb bomb nigga come and light it up

Yeah blaze up ain't nothin' like
Ridin' by, drivin' high

Dumpin' if you chokin' smokin'

Smoke slow when they hit you 
Caught you might pass out
Look over at the bitches 
Snatch a blunt up out a mouth bitch
Switch it to another scene
That has you smokin' endo green
Some homies be on that lean
Mix it with that endo' weed

My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

and I pack the deuce deuce of some act right juice 
I'm in my own, space and time

from this infectious enemy, they on the loose 
And unstoppable, Daz

Now imagine yourself in a bottomless pit 
with no way your climbin out, and this ain't the punishment 
Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react 
with intentions to keep on mashin, strap to strap 
Is this my boundary from county to county? 
Your homies want to try to soak me like Bounty? 
Dogg Poung Gangsta all day all night 
Partyin like a motherfuckin now all night 
But uhh, simple as fact I been wantin to serve your whole fuckin crew 
Now whatchu want to do? (Hmm, whatchu want to do? Yeah) 
Load up your weapon slowly step in caught your homey straight slippin 
You shoulda known from the jump nigga that I was trippin 
I gets to bustin (blaow blaow) you gets to duckin (blaow blaow) 
Dogg Pound Gangsta gets to dippin in the cut 
My performance is enormous the way that I stayed up on em 
I catch em and let em have it what's up, with my opponents 
I hold it down for the two and I'll be gunned down by no one

Face to face, punk you can eat a dick 
Cause you're all out of time, out of sight 
out of mind, somethin I wouldn't do without a nine 
I got a pocket full of papers and a trunk full of beat 
Mashin all through the streets rollin wit some heat 
I'm heated, repeat it, day after day 
Daily survival tactics in L.A. 
I'm on point and alert 
with skills like a huntin expert, fuck around and get hurt 
Lurked, I puts in work like a chemist 
Mentally known to cause motherfuckin dilemmas 
See me in black and beware 
It's a Dogg Pound Gangsta on the loose out there 
Now here's the kickoff, as I'm about to rip off 
Rage is knockin lips off, travellin like a spitball, I hit y'all 
Right between the eyes, smack dab in the middle 
with my rhymes or my riddles, ain't got no time to fiddle 
faddle, dibble, dabble 
Gotta Rock like Fraggle

Fuck around and you'll get chipped off like the Sphinx

Hit you in a second, one two mic checkin 
That's my lethal weapon like a chain and ball

Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang, is everythang

When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC

Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop
Have prestigious women 
That's the truth from the beginning
In and out of the fliest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind, 
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind

But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and really don't give a shit
About nothin' at all, just my Doggs, steppin' through the fog
And I'm still gonna fade em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin' and I be ryhmin'

So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin' dick
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket loc
Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow

If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States, period point blank.
If you ain't down for the ones that suffer in South Africa
From apartheid and shit. Damn it you need to
Step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step in
And start putting some funk in that ass

Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something

Break em off something

I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die

They wonder where me bailing and don't really understand
The reason why me take me law in me own hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
Me gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them riot in they Lakers and don't really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricade us like Beirut
Me don't show no love cause it's us against them
Them never ever love me cause it's sport to break the,
And kill at my own risk if I may
Delay to spray with my AK and put it to rest

Yes we have. There have been riots, rioting, well I don't wanna say
Rioting but there's been looting downtown, but right now Bree, what I want
To show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street

How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

What they told us today, in other words,
You're still a slave. No matter how
Much money you got, you still ain't shit

Sitting in my living room calm and collected
Feeling that gotta get mine perspective
'Cause I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row, is bailing
Laugh now but cry much later
Ya see when niggas get together they get mad cuz they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They find that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's thumpin, nigga it's time ta rob and mob
(And break the white man off somthing lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love them so they can't love me)
Yo straight putting down getting my scoot on
Let's jump in off in Compton so I gots ta get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or something
Got a VCR
In the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop

There has been videotape and you can see of the, aah, some of the crowd
Throwing things at the officers
And swinging at them as well. Like there was a young woman there.
You see she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand

How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die

One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
187 time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints so a 9 I throw away
Or get prints so my Uzi witta spray
POP POP POP another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like Pop, pop, fizz.
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't no dead do', I'm high off the indo
Creeping with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on that donut
And cracker so now he best to back up
I guess I gots ta pack up, filling the clip up, I zip up-
Town, the motherfucking cops are all around
Helicopters flying
These motherfuckers trying
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no's the poor black refuse to go

This is now covers a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these
Fires have been, aah, ignited. I mean, from here to the, aah, to the south
End of South Central is a long way

Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something

The outcome of this is destruction so the more fall
Niggas don't give a fuck so them bust and before
Niggas backing up three black shows
No justice so they copied ya right
And here I am again, me, turn the other cheek, me
Be too many wigs got me 9 to my tights
So me bust, flick cause he don't give a fuck
And me don't give a fucking of my problems
In with their fuck fuck

Blak blam, blam to them fall
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye
Dr Dre him bust gun shots
Diggity Daz and RBX them bust gun shots

Daz Dillinger,"Wake up, jumped out my bed
Hung in a 2 man cell wit my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I'm only 18, so I'm a young buck
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Ugh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting a rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
Betta be strapped wit yo shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time

Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Now, I'm holding a dove, sitting on swoll
27 years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thing to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G.
The little homies from the hood wit grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do
Didn't know we had a 22
Straight sitting behind his back
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I use to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (for what)
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread

Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Something for the real OG's to get wit
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie
No need to be uncalm if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo'
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo'
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip

These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowing ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound

I believe I got to see
We been making music since we were kids
Its all I want to do, for life
Keeping it real until the day I die
I stay funkish in my way
Continue to mash and don't forget to pray
I keep my hand on my steel
Because I love my life and I always will
Whatever people say to me
I take it in stride I'm thinking negro league
If you really don't know me
Then you best back up, I suggest strongly
They started this DPG
Until the day I D-I-E
For my L-I-F and E
No matter where I look that's all I see
And I know

[Chorus: x2]

Many niggas play to me
I think its because they see me on BET
'cause everybody knows my name
All the police think I'm serving game
Jealous niggas call us out
But I don't worry long as I hear their mouths
If ever they decide to kill
You better be prepared 'cause I know I will
I think I can guarantee
You don't want to be standing next to me
Before my final curtain call
My mistakes they really won't be long
If we bump this in the streets
Or even at some party
You niggas really can't see me
My request is that you stop trying
Before I let go

[Chorus: x2]

Everyday, the 45 stays I'm jacking forever
I busting taking now bowing down never
Gotta watch my back for these coppers
As well as the niggas that I kick it with
They stick you faster than these bitches will
Since I'm pimping everybody wants my riches
And I can't keep my god for buying weed acting every time
I smoke constantly and can't flinch me
From committing the murders so I chill and puff the herb
Who gots my back nobody
If little giant gaudy laying niggas down at the homey's party
Always be goin crazy I guess we are being who we are
Really say the nigga gotta be a star
I gots to get mine and if I'm blasting its my destiny
If I die then it was meant to be intentionally
Worry stressing no guessing your profession
When the murder take place set yourself a tech 9

Within minutes we get in it comin for you and yours
With these automatic toys throughout the world make noise
Dippin in low-lows, and jumpin out of fo'-do's

Catchin, many and any with the fo'-fo'
Blastin and mashin I cash in many for Death Row
Rest in peace to my homeboys who ain't alive
Now the mission is for us to conquer and ride

The worst California we droppin somethin on ya
Ain't no one to sound, like ta-pow, you a goner
For the simple fact we get Gang Related
We have the papers and you suckers hate it

What you gon do when we get loose and act a fool
Break the rules on you and dust you off with the tools

Only with the swoll rolls and the paper

With the Gangsta Boogie

I penetrate, send it straight to your middle brain
Three times dope similar to my nickname
A big Caine, ain't nuttin changed now I'm solo

My gangsta ass track with the Gang is my logo
Ridin with the top down, off lockdown
Time for me to knock down fool's whole compound
Like the World Trade Center
 
The world made thinner when I'm pullin on my girl gray trigger
Figure when I enter I intend to rule this
This industry fin to see I'm nuttin to fool wit
Like Jack Nicholson, I smack fickle men

And pack somethin in my penalty
Will well then they see the toppest servin a putdown
And I'm on this notice my opponents get took down
A crook down from my ground of clout

Representin Death Row when I was down and out
It don't stop

[Daz Dillinger]
I came in the game with the aim to maim
The gangbang murder main slang is strange
My first idea when I stare up in the mirror

Is how Daz Dillinger gon creep up on the scrilla
And if I don't plot then I'll probably not
Get my issue, so I gotta figure how to twist you
Hit you hard like a gauge shot

Watchin fools laid out when the bloodshot sprayed out
I shoot my way out these punks for rent
So duck when the slugs hit your trunks, you're finished
I'm comin out runnin that's to shake the scene

Break the green I'll scream out the gangsta theme
Do or die! Ain't no lie, that's the way I eat
Watch me scope out and choke out the prayout beat
GIve me six in the chamber fuck twelve in the box

Let the gravedigger be the one shovelin rocks, it don't stop

This how we live, ballin on why'all
Fancy cars and houes

Yeah, and you know we got this, so don't trip, ha ha
Yeah, and you know that
Yeah, real smoove

Gangsta, and we major

Its been addictive, my daughter can't get what she needs

No, fuck trying to reason

And a mission ain't a mission if nobody dies 
And a mission ain't complete if the enemy don't sleep 
Enemies rest in peace deceased fuckin' with me 
I got to 'complish a goal I'm out seekin' gold 
Expose the strap gotta let off the cousin rough and raw 
Never fell to my knees for shit cause I demand shit 
With this Daz Dillinger drillin' ya for ya shit 
On the streets for the sixth time in and out for the crime 
I rates crimes add up in food stamp dollars and dimes 
I'm slippin' slidin' fucked up nigga what up
In the cut flossin' like a motherfucker what up 
Beside all being now tell me where ya comin' from 
That ain't where I see things and nigga what's the outcome

For so many days and so many ways we been duckin' strays 
They delivers but still we some Bad Boy killers 
Hold the scrillas I dump in you niggas' livers 
Then watch ya body shiver and ya mama quiver 
From the way you just got lit up 
Hit up the Westside on my way out 
Y'all whole crew should've knew it was on 
From Makaveli's first day out now y'all gettin' played out 
And laid out for public display on this day 
Y'all niggas is history cause the whole crew is bitch to me 
Listen to me Idi How many of y'all can see me? 
Cause I'll tack that ass like A's attack DC

Yeah 
Everywhere I go 
'Nough gunshot are firin' out the ghetto area seen? 
I hava watch my back 
Too much crack seen? 
Watch yourself 'cause 'nough homicide a gwan in de area 

I hear some niggas clockin' major on the other side of town 
Strictly slidin' for a proper come up to come around 
Called up the homies from way back, who dream of gettin' paid 
Then finally get paid with the amount of 80 G's 
6:30 layin' in cut, prepare to get ready 
Me and Ty grew up, mashin' to get our feddi 
Food stamps galore, kick in the door get on the floor 
Make sure my homies get away smooth with the dough 
A hardcore motherfucker raised up not knowin' 
Now my dream is just a dream we're sellin' dope and hoein'
Moms can't tell me shit, I make the rules that I live by 
In and out the house, late at night, and plus I got high 
The homies influenced me to be the G of all G's 
Perfectly innovated to all my homies 
Pull out the Riviera, plus I kick up dust 
Pull out the brain, pull out the thing, cock back and bust 
It's just some gangsta shit, goin down on the Eastside 
Some niggas who died and tried to who ride on mine 
Pull on the 7 Carter with the homey Flossy Floss 
He's the homey from the Beach who's known for takin off 
Pile up the bird then swerve, conversate on smoke and submerge 
Finger on the trigger, contemplatin' on a murder 
I mean, takin life 'for life, cause it's right 
Shit, niggas gotta do, to earn they stripes, straight merkin'

[Chorus: x2]
It's some gangsta shit, that's going down 
Homicide, straight murder/homicide 
It's some gangsta shit, here in this town 
Straight murder

Word on the street is that them D-P-G niggas shot they homeboy 
Now the only sound in the town is gunfire 
Going down I sport the crown I give it up on motherfuckers 
When I roll through I thought you knew about them Doggs in blue 
Now forty-five, niggas bought em by the spot 
I'm on alert I'm down to work every nigga that I shot 
Niggas skied out quick, around the block who know we comin' back 
Post up early on the attack 
Slowly but surely spot an enemy slippin out his domain 
Rode up on him and let him see the twelve gauge 
The homey Ty banged him on GP because we stuffed him then we bagged him 
Cause he violated the rule of the streets 
Two redrums under my belt, it felt good bout to murder 
Haven't you ever heard of a murderer motherfucker? 
Cause I'm, a straight gangsta, doin' what I feel 
Niggas no need to tempt, for me to kill, straight blastin'
The enemy, can't see the hoes who try to get with me 
Understand where I'm comin' from the D-P to the G-the-see 
The niggas who trip, niggas that dipped 
Niggas that conversate with the Bloods or Crips 
It's just a West coast thang, gangsta thing 
Niggas come around here but surely can't hang because-a 
We don't hang with no bustas and sho' nuff 
Don't hang with no fags and niggas down to blast, straight merkin 

[Chorus]

Check it out 
I heard niggas kickin' static makin' noise 
Cold hearted want to get it started with my boys 
Automatic toys to tangle with niggas for profit 
Got shit on lock down cause I lets the Glock spit 
Soon as D-A-Z hits me on my hip, talk about chips 
The game run heatin' them clips, the gaze kicks 
Automatic tech nine spits, I gotta 
Roll with the Pound that's the neighborhood of murder 
Am I the only motherfucker ridin'? 
Am I the only rider but I found a whole pound of niggas violent 
I got the big homey Ty money worldwide 
From Portland, Oregon L.A. to the N.Y. 
I'm bout to crash in your door, unload the double four 
Then stash it, then we blasted all we saw 
The fo'-fo', the fo' double sparkin'
The gang walkin' up your hood like nothin' but trouble 
We straight gangsta shit

That's right 
We dat live by de knife will die by de knife 
You betta try save your life 
On your life dere might be a oversight 
Take my ad-vice and jump in a your ride 
Don't are-gue with de Death Row pride

[Featuring Nate Dogg  Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
Snoop (Daz): 
Yeah  what I'ma do right here is take my time  
and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace  
and my niggas behind the wall. 
See you when I get there  you know what I'm saying? (really doe) 
So drip with me as I go down memory lane. 
Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener  
(1 8 7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor). 
I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up, 
some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed. 
But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang, 
('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang). 
I bring you the motherfucking .38, 
(just get the MC and the homie Nate). 
So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide, 
as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side). 
Nate (Daz): 
Do you remember back on the East Side? 
Where all us niggas used to love to ride. 
We didn't care what we did, 
time was nothing to us we were just kids. 
Times are different now, but you still get stuck, 
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck. 
So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, 
keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. 
Snoop: 
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, 
June 17th, 1979. 
That's my first time being arrested, 
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit. 
I learned than from the G's, 
a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. 
More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, 
and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. 
So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, 
my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). 
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, 
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. 
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, 
she said: ""playing football should be your only fun son"". 
I'm like ""allright"" so we enter the house, 
come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. 
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, 
I looked at my momma and said: ""damn, why you snitch?"" 
They put me on punishment but that didn't work, 
now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. 
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, 
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. 
Nate: 
My homie told me one day he had a jack move, 
he said: ""come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth"". 
I agreed and said ""come on, let's go and jack them fools"", 
next day we were draped in the county blues. 
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), 
saying to myself ""I'll never fuck with that nigga again"". 
'fore I'm locked down I learned to be 
what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. 
Original gangsta 
Daz: 
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, 
never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. 
You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., 
beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. 
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, 
with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. 
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, 
because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. 
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, 
to let you know we can't take no more. 
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, 
and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. 
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, 
and ask myself: ""who the fuck should I really fear?"". 
I ran around with the best killers, 
thug criminals and drug dealers. 
Blasting niggas if they come near us, 
(???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. 
Knock on wood for good luck, 
serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. 
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, 
a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. 
Nate (Daz): 
Original gangsta (original gangsta), 
coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). 
Coming from the East Side... 
You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, 
see-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times] 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z, 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, 
shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P, 
shout outs to my niggas see, Style and me. 
Snoop (Nate): 
Yeah, straight up, based on a true story. 
you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta) 
You trick ass bitch!

Daz Dillinger,"Oh no! murder, murder, murder
Busting at these niggas who claim to be hard
Murder, murder, murder

Come and blast dat nigga daz and act rude
Coming through, murdering fools who claim to be hard
Pulling your motherfucker's cords
Me, we're going back for you to say that
Prepare for battle, load the narrator with pay back
Knowing where you motherfuckers rest and hang at
I'm in long beach, where the gang bangers hang at
Don't want more static, or panic, we're packing gats
And asking for shit, nigga, 'cause we're blasting
See, we're the gang, kicking just to maintain
Bang on niggas for a living, busting upon the selling corners
We on 'em just for twelve figures
Money, dope, cars and bitches, to getting richer

[Chorus: x2]
Oh no, niggas just wanna get killed tonight
Tripping on you, the way I feel tonight
Niggas better pack you guns

Glocks are popping off like turbo
Step into my circle, my word is out to serve yo shit
Money busters lyrically in motion
About to whip a ? the east side coast and
I'm the one they love to hate with a passion
I packs a blue steel, filled with skilled raps, blast it
Mc's get dealt with, my microphone's my third partner
Heat seeking like a missile when I drop ya
Style is proper, my execution-style of rapping
I'm packing a rap while you say ""why, what's happening? ""
My mind is going deep, like money mister, doing all
You couldn't see me with a crystal ball, y'all
It's critical, I'm thinking of a master plan
Come out with your shit man, I'm broke, feeling critical conditions
Listen, money on a dirt mission
Creeping to the night, beating tight, Armageddon

[Chorus: x2]

Watch out, here I come
Battling motherfuckers till the break of dawn
Homeboy, ring the alarm
It's d-a to the z, dropping the formula
And every nigga that I know in californ-I-a
Dat nigga daz will come out and play
Busting on niggas with an ak
So any given day you want some
Come and get some, you don't want none

Why do we bang?
Why do we bang for a living? we just don't know
Now it's time to serve y'all bitches ass niggas on an open platter
Yeah, ha ha

Fool, what nigga, you know that got your ass laying down?

You see, I take the ultimatum, disregard the outcome
I'm hard to outrun, and won't be outdone
I hate fake take away motherfuckers
I come up from the slums and I run, motherfuckers
No other than the gang, it's the slang and prosper
And bang us mobsters, while claiming oscars
While most niggas froze, they control their coast
They be home and broke, 'cause they've been known to choke
Like Malone, be gone when the playoffs come
But I'm a stay off one, liable to spray off some
Ammunition, I handle missions one on one
Niggas, come on, come and get their ? done
I'm the cannibal, the Hannibal lector of rap
A nigga steps up wack, and gets a setup-tax
We're the gang, and we're mashing, blast to maintain
We're the kings in the game, and things ain't to change

You shot my girlfriend when she was 3 months 
There went my children found out it was more than one 
You've got me limping and I can't move as fast 
But I swear on baby grave that I'm gonna get that ass 
What about my little sister, she used to get good grades 
But now she's paranoid goin' to school with a 38 
Now how much of this you think I'm gonna take

As much as I been feelin' and dreamin' this mutha fuckers mine 
I let my heat fly, I see him fallin' down 
And all I'm hearing is ""K-Plaw, K-Plaw, Paw Paw"" 
After the smoke clears I hear a baby screamin' 
I'm tryin' to make out but all I see is demons 
Father forgive me if I hurt this child let me die tonight 
Walk up to the Beemer see the kids alright 
I hand him to his cryin' mama tell her turn away 
Somebody punched up daddy's number and it's Judgement Day 
For anybody askin' questions you didn't even see my face 
Or else I'm comin' back

Luv, oh, you really want it, girl?

She was a Betty, I done knew back in the day
Little scary lil' bitch from around the way
Plus she sucked and fucked all day
With a little bit of Alize, Alize, Alize

I put it down for these young hoes
Get the pussy like I'm married
And send her home with the cock swoll, did her pops know?
Little girl that he tryna protect was in the crib doin' porno

Fo' sho' baby, I know these hoes
Step up too 'em and show these hoes
I never wonder to myself, ""Would she?""
I get deep in her mind and her pussy

Who dat? She was the world's greatest dick sucker
Play the note with the tongue while finger fuck her
I hit it in the back of the donk, in the back of the Benz
Got my dick in her ass, front of one of her friends

Face down, ass up
Bitch be still while I bust this nut
I rock hard while I'm in these guts
Wipe my dick and then that's enough

She wanna kiss me after she lick me
Slap the drunk, you know the ho got Tinesi
Daz, this punk bitch wanna get with me
'cause the ho lookin' for a P I M P

You know the ho don't know no better
I would rough ride ya ass but the magnum's better
I know a lot of niggas done paid ya bitch
Remember one thing, I got a major bitch

Pull up on the stroll, in the fo' door Caddy
Slapped the bitch, she hollered, ?No, no daddy?
I got the cash, if she don't, that's her ass
So quick, so fast

I luv gettin' my nuts rubbed
I luv gettin' my dick licked
I luv gettin' my nuts sucked

I luv gettin' my pussy ate
I luv when niggas see me masturbate
I luv it when you nut all in my face
I luv it, baby but I can't stand the taste

I once knew a bitch named Erica
Way back in the day, she had a geri curl
I made her suck my dick on the ferris wheel
Been pimpin' all my life, big player for real

I said, ""Come on girl, you know how it's 'sposed to be""
It's makin' me nut but feel our fantasy
Come on, come on, baby, won't you get the best of me
I smell pussy

Get T double D on the double stack
And one dose of the dick, she be doublin' back
See me, I've been known to shit on hoes
Cuff her cold, straight spit on hoes

I been known to step on a bitch
Put a thumb in your ass, while I slap your clit
But ain't no way that I'ma lick yo' shit
Tell 'em what she is Short Dog, bitch

I luv gettin' my head blown
I luv gettin' my nuts rubbed
I luv gettin' my dick licked

I luv gettin' my thug on
On dirty joints, in the school zone
I luv gettin' my thug on
Everything I cop, I put dubs on, I luv this

When I'm at the club
See a girl get freaky and I slap her butt
She try to say, ""Short Dog, that's enough""
You know I luv it little mam, can't pass it up

For one cause, and that's how it is why'all
Wise on up to rise on up dawg
Each one teach one, let the lesson be taught
It ain't my fault your homie Tommy Boy got caught

If he was slicker than grease, he woulda been at peace
Instead tryna ride while the war was at cease

[Daz Dillinger]
When me and Snoop was kids we always knew this kid named Tommy
His parents died left him with gangit kinds of money
But Tommy was a hustler from around the way
Stayed on the northside of town, is where he say

He payed attention to whatever, they was games so clever
If the situation was bad it can only get better
He ran around the dope house

[Snoop Dogg (Daz)]
So he put us up on his scheme
He knew that we was riders so he wanted us on his team
(Uh, poor Tommy)
Get you money, size team (uh)

Get you money man
(He was out to get paid)
Get you money man (Poor Tommy)
Get you money man (Me and Snoop on his team)

(Get paid) Gotta have that money man (get you money man)
Get you money man (Get you money man)

[Snoop Dogg]
Tommy was a rider, big money
Tommy had everything, it wasn't funny
All the younger G's used to look up to him
But there was no way, that the bigger ones could do him

They would try him, try him, everytime he was slick
But he never would slip, he always had his grip
And if he did, he'd get away 'cause he was just to fast
Homie up Tommy, Tommy, Tommy's out to mash

Get it, get it, get it, 'cause ya gotta have it
And when ya get make sure ya grab it and stab it
Maintain it, brain it, the way you got's to
'Cause this is somethin' to rock to

[Daz]
Man, we sacked up dollars and Caddies,
Omiscious muggin' 'em for him
We had to gather up cash - whoever owed it to him
The hitman had hit us, niggas runnin' shit,

And never wantin' to quit us, when the machine gun spit
Now we really deep in the game, now it's murder and drugs
No names involved when that nigga caught a slug
Tommy told us forget it, that he's always down wit us
The problems of the murder will be acquitted (young nigga)

[Snoop Dogg]
Now word on the streets is that Machine Gun Tommy,
Ridin' on big ballers for a pastime hobby
So if ya havin' money, and ya smoke big weed
First thing ya need is a security team

And we provide, or should I say we ride for Tommy
My compadre, and if he say ""spray em"", we spray
So I suggest, you get with the 'PG,
or find yourself layin six feet dizzy

We was down with big Tommy
(get you money man.. get you money man.. get you money man)
On the streets doing his thang, gettin paid

We had money, jewelry and expensive cars
Niggas who didn't know us, finally know who we are
We was important to the neighborhood like presidents and mass,
Everytime he do a lick he break us off our proper share

A couple of days Tommy was on top of the world
Threw a party with the homies, invited gangs of girls

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, it was off the hook you know
We had everything from Indo to blow (What, you sniff blow?)
Oh hell no, I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'
If Tommy find out, boy he'll be trippin'

So I stay A-Ok, but anyway
Tommy got somethin' to say, to say, to say...

All my homeboys luv that bass

[Kurupt]
All I want is my gold deez
Talkin on my phones and a Armani's

Switches or not as long as-it got beats
All my homeboyz on the cut like we don't give a fuck
What the fuck? what bounce my homeboys rounded

G'ing in full control hittin' up in mo' control

Chorus - Daz (Kurupt)

And my shit lookin' hell'a clean
You can hear me around the corner music bangin'

Wanna buy dippin' high wit the homeboyz

Cruzing not givin' a fuck rollin' about 3 miles an hour

Old school cadillac cutless then 64's

[???]
See me and my girls will buy a lexus jeep
Rollin 6 deep till you hear the beat
Bumpin' loud move twice lets move the crowd
Gettin' rowdy rowdy wit my bumpin sounds

Showing all y'all niggaz that I bump the best

And now we back wit a little rhyme
We can't stop can't quit 'cause we ?? the grind

[Daz,(Kurupt):]
Yo ( Gangstafied back on the block)
Straight up

You can't stop you can't rewind the time
You can't think about the past
So look forward to life, and keep on ?missionin? on the grind for yours

Chorus:(2x)(minor changes 2nd time)
We can't stop, can't rewind the time
Off of dollar bills nickles and dimes
On everythang homeboy that I'm down for mine
Until we get we it be out here on the grind

[Daz]
I wake up with the birds, early as fuck
Stash my dope in the cut, serve the clucks
Lil' bitches around the way they know what's up
They wanna bust, wanna try to smoke a nigga weed up
It ain't shit to flip a double up, and I love when I'm comin up
I got thangs for these suckas when they runnin up
Telling all y'all fools y'all ain't one of us

[Kurupt]
Nigga, get a glimpse of a fact plus that, Blaze
Move into the hood with all the OG's
That help me get paid homie, we a unit
Doin it how a gangsta do it, Run through it
And stampede the block like bitch
Your on the wrong side to be servin your shit(yeah)
Jack nigga, Daz, and Kurupt the Kingpin
Back on the smash, with heaters to reclaim the ass

Chorus:(2x)(minor changes the 2nd time)
We can't stop, can't rewind the time
Off of dollar bills nickles and dimes
On everythang homeboy that I'm down for mine
Until we get it we be out here on the grind

[Kurupt]
Yeah nigga, half a days gone by
Ganstafied, givin it just up livin my life
It's hard to survive
Without grabbin 9, and pump five-fifty-five
Forty-five many Mack eleven
Gunshots non stop to funk pop
Then pop baby glocks
(Homie you ridin or not?)
Me and the homies are the first to bust
And y'all cowards dyin tryin to be like us
Gangsta

[Daz]
With three mouths to feed, it's the life I lead
I guess I'd die in the life of greed
Muthafuckas 'round here die to bleed
For set, joints nigga, or half a key
I remember when I came up, niggas rang up
Some Cripped up some niggas flamed up
Crossed your name out, straged my name up
(Quick to thow the gang up) What up?!
I guess I'm blessed with the gift of rap
Or I'll bless you with the gift of crap
Like that, white, black, mexican, and jap
Homeboy do anything for a scrap

[Kurupt]
Mark up yo hood like this, anybody killa
DPGC fuck y'all niggas
Deep inside we feel like fuck y'all hood
Hell naw bitch nigga it ain't all to the good
Chorus:(2x)(minor changes 2nd time)

You watchin' the range, I'm floatin'
And ain't no stoppin' the rain
Cock and I aim, I see you bitches jockin' the name
Boppin' to fame, a crooked nigga droppin' in pain

Rockin' a cain, back up bitch, you blockin' my lane
Tryna foul on a nigga 'cause you hot in the flame
Fuck you, and them ho ass nigga's you run wit'
Fuck your whole street, you ain't no motherfuckin' O.G.
'Cause O.G. means, means you a original gangsta
Understand pure motherfuckin' man
Ain't no police or judges, just nigga's holdin' grudges

You mark ass bitches is low budget
Straight traitor's, so fuck you and the glass that you puff on
Don't smile in my face, when you see me get the fuck on
Dope fiend ass nigga, tryna to get a free check
Talkin' that shit, but you's a motherfuckin' bitch
So when you see a nigga on the flip duke
I'll flip you, you must be smokin' dip fool
Nothin' but a bitch fool

Means, means you a original gangsta
Understand pure motherfuckin' man

Call baretta's on my dog, nigga's get sweated for they shit
If all a law enforcement, nigga's get deaded for that shit
Thought you was a street nigga, pulled a heat nigga at that
Come to find out was a cunt that got slapped and didn't scrap
'cause you know what motherfuckers like you do wit' nigga's on the set
Finish fuckin' face and leave ya clean cut shirt wet, and jet
'cause I'll smack the shit outta ya bitch ass you wanna run to the one's
Tell 'em about the cash and the stash, and were I got my guns

And you know I'm the bird man 'cause I sold so much coco
Beware of the crack pipe, that's by far in ya life
I got heroin by the balloons, kabooms and mushrooms
And my 38. specialist puttin' banker's in they tomb's
I'm one, shot, killed, and these bullets all go
And you takin' finger print's, and mugshots photo's
I use to beat bitch nigga's till they face turned blue
But they get weak in dice water, and pedal you in the sue
And it's true

Smokin water by the pearl, runnin' the street wit' double earl's
I did it all 'fore I can see, walk, and crawl
Made it out the ghetto, bustin' a male, so I can wet y'all
Took a while 'fore I ball
Wanted for eight or nine murder's and spoke came
For cocaine, raw game, another die for what he claim
And where I'm from they know my name, I 'cause lot's of static
Automatic's and canic's, and nigga's start to panic

Ain't no ruler's or leader's runnin' the set
Outta respect we G's, YG'S, and O.G.'s connect
Fifteen, sixteen in a chevy we roll
Get you full of hole's, god dog, you scream echo's in fo-fo's
Who dare to mack wit' the tarantula and scorpion
Brought you in the depth's of danger when I tortured it
I love it when the bustaz squealin'

Step up too 'em and show these hoes
I never wonder to myself ""Would she?""

Slapped the bitch, she hollered ""No, no daddy!""

Way back in the day, she had a geri curl
I made her suck my dick on the ferris wheel
Been pimpin all my life, big player for real

I'm makin things cappin fast
Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along
Face lookin stupid broke startin
Feelin dumb, i'm young but i'm a grown man
Takin thangs into my own hands
I'm tryin to own here
But life a twist ya like a twister
Get twisted with this
It seems on but its off
I keep missin this shit
I'm high but i try, to stay focused wide out
Lookin dead at the chips
I blink they dip
Its hard to hang on but i can't let go
Smokin on my last breath
Blow out life what's left is death
Now i can go on or i can g or make a right
Whatever way that i turn its still death after life
It don't discourage me, i ain't got nuthin to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But i learn 'cause i see, and i earn 'cause i g
But these problems probably havin niggaz prayin to see
At an early age so at an early stage in life
I chose to get my ish tight ya gotta struggle and fight
It cost an arm and a leg just to live on your knees
And i'm tryin to keep my sanity god help me please

(chorus)

Mischeavius and devious is how my life was
Puttin the serve down for cabbage just to keep the niggaz buzzed
Some of the money makin muthafuckaz from the other side
Was thinkin about a jack move tryin to whoo-ride
Gettin jealous 'cause my music got this rap game sewn up
Them niggaz want to trip whatever back they get blowed up
Blown up or not you can still get shot
You don't never play those muthafuckaz i'll always not
Rule number one, pay attention to this shit
don't be fuckin wit my niggaz on the midnight shift
Shit shiggy shack, gettin it on, to the break of dawn
Now he's known for servin more than an oz. so
He's got a 187 on his muthafuckin chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
He's lookin for the music from the night before
Trouble 1, he layin low all in gettin that dough

Now its all about the dollars
Impalas that bounce
Havin cars and bitches on a proper amount
Caught a million chillin
Robbin banks for many muthaz son
Life and darkness
We all get it started, cold hearted
All around it my life won't change for the good
As soon as i walk out the door, i'm called by the hood
Daz, would you come and ride for me,
Hey yo daz would you soldier would you would you and die for me
The tradition's got a lot of niggaz killin for dumb shit
The ogs think then brung guns to control shit
Every midnight i be loaded, high as a kite
Besides with the drama the dog fight street fight
And a lot a mob puttin on mo
Problems solved, but revolved whatever with a fo-fo
But sure i did the record blast five times
254 sentence to jail time

and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace  
and my niggas behind the wall. 
See you when I get there  you know what I'm saying? (really doe) 
So drip with me as I go down memory lane. 
Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener  
(1 8 7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor). 
I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up, 
some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed. 
But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang, 
('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang). 
I bring you the motherfucking .38, 
(just get the MC and the homie Nate). 
So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide, 
as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side). 
Nate (Daz): 
Do you remember back on the East Side? 
Where all us niggas used to love to ride. 
We didn't care what we did, 
time was nothing to us we were just kids. 
Times are different now, but you still get stuck, 
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck. 
So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, 
keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. 
Snoop: 
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, 
June 17th, 1979. 
That's my first time being arrested, 
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit. 
I learned than from the G's, 
a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. 
More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, 
and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. 
So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, 
my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). 
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, 
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. 
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, 
she said: ""playing football should be your only fun son"". 
I'm like ""allright"" so we enter the house, 
come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. 
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, 
I looked at my momma and said: ""damn, why you snitch?"" 
They put me on punishment but that didn't work, 
now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. 
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, 
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. 
Nate: 
My homie told me one day he had a jack move, 
he said: ""come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth"". 
I agreed and said ""come on, let's go and jack them fools"", 
next day we were draped in the county blues. 
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), 
saying to myself ""I'll never fuck with that nigga again"". 
'fore I'm locked down I learned to be 
what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. 
Original gangsta 
Daz: 
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, 
never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. 
You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., 
beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. 
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, 
with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. 
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, 
because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. 
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, 
to let you know we can't take no more. 
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, 
and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. 
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, 
and ask myself: ""who the fuck should I really fear?"". 
I ran around with the best killers, 
thug criminals and drug dealers. 
Blasting niggas if they come near us, 
(???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. 
Knock on wood for good luck, 
serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. 
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, 
a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. 
Nate (Daz): 
Original gangsta (original gangsta), 
coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). 
Coming from the East Side... 
You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, 
see-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times] 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z, 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, 
shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P, 
shout outs to my niggas see, Style and me. 
Snoop (Nate): 
Yeah, straight up, based on a true story. 
you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta) 
You trick ass bitch!

Where we at first is where we at last, where we last cash
One last toke will make your smoke ride high
I'ma give everything like pushing the button
Now how does it feel when you die for nothing?
Metropolis crumble, apocalypse mo' lines surround and dine
Let loose in at least a Nam, calculate keep time
Finish the World War I've been a star
The knock quiminitar(?), strange and restrain
Retired and rewired, melodically molecules
Strategy and logic enables our positions then points us missiles
All sided equal... deeper than pistols
For instance... unknown the science of forensics
Get your backpacked like ten sticks
Hit like ten sticks hit with the effect of tense ticks inglow(?) sticks

Popped out bodies dropped off on Rider's road
I've seen and foreseen the unseen
And able hardly able to separate the myths from fables
I'ma buy a Baltic while you purchase fireplaces

Light up the night nothing everything in sight
I'ma cross the finish line with both legs broken

Don't specialize and ill crack your bones

Daz Dillinger,"A lot of people say when they smoke weed 
It makes them feel nervous or not in control. 
Not for me. When I smoke weed I just feel good. 
You know, this one time I was in the Bay 
Hangin' out with some of my buddies, smokin' a blunt. 
Everyone's getting highfy. 
Me being the outsider I am, 
I wanna be involved to. 
So I jump in my buddies car, 
I'm ghost ridin the whip down E. 14th St, 
But he forgot to tell me he didn't have a wheel alignment.
One thing pot definitely does it makes you 
Shut the Fuck up Bitch!

[Chorus: x2]
Nigga I'm dangerous, A wild big blue pit, 
The type of dog you don't really wanna fool with
You get bit cause I'm dangerous 
You get bit when my homie stay sippin'

Yea

My name Daz I'm a cool what it is nigga 
Rollin with some niggas that split a niggas 
Wig I'm just chillin' up tryin' to get it popping 
Kill you about my paper if you plottin' 
Don't stop it I gives a fuck bout what you talking 
Give a fuck bout what your hopin' 
If you come for mine your body is a target 
I got some drink and a swisher full of that shit 
Hit you with this pistol I can make you hit 
A back flip you know my name you can see it in my face 
Ridin' through the streets with heater on my waist 
And the last thing I need is a case 
I keep bail money with a cool 50 K 
Just to remind ya with this pistol 
I'll blind ya leave you dead in your tracks nigga 
That's where they find ya I'm the most gangsterous 
You can think of don't be surprised I'm the nigga you hate to love

[Chorus: x2]

They took Tooky but he still lives in us he tried to say he? give? 
Schwarzenegger didn't give a fuck 
It's every man for himself 
So keep a pistol tucked, 
As far as rap goes it ain't hard to see the Crip in Us! 
A lot of nerves everybody gotta get rushed 
It's like a big picture painted by a killas brush 
Self defense be the case I'll be home for lunch 
A little drum sticky koosh and a swisher blunt 
Daddy was a ridah Moms was a wisher six dead homies 
Cause I've been that nigga I'll take your bitch 
I don't know if I'm a be back with her 
I'm hittin' niggas up every time I start spittin'
Take a peek make your whole block shiver niggas drop and roll 
With the shit I deliver I'm a Dogg Pound general 
Second in command you cross that line nigga 
Your dead where you stand you and your man Nigga

[Chorus: x2]

Now I'm back on a creep 'n real low key 
Niggas make a move Fuck an O.G. 
Niggas can't hold me I hold heat 
And the temperature don't rise slowly it's lonely 
On these cold streets Wheel it, 
Any car that's available hop out guns out, 
Naw we ain't scared of you
Yea it's true, you should see what clip bananas do, 
Run up in your crib ain't shit your man you can do.
He'll get hit through his shirt, through his vest, through his T, 
Through his chest and when I'm done with him ain't a damn thing left 
Just leekin' out his flesh 
Pourin' liquor out his vest 
And if you ask about me then the answer will be yes. Yes. 
This some g shit real niggas fuck 
With you can holla when you see me nigga but

Daz Dillinger,"Where they at?

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's

Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

And kept on stompin'
When y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton

I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm makin' all the dough

You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me

Tried to dis Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it

Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Gettin' money out your ass, like a motherfuckin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya Toby
Used to be my homey, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren, 'cause I remember when you drove a be 2-10
Broke as a mothafuckin' joke

Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys
You little maggot, Eazy E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree
With no Vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' bout?
Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs

Grand Hustle president, heart of a lion and the nuts of an elephant
Trap music heaven sent, you hating and it's evident
You trying to stack presidents, I'm tryin' to set precedents
The comparison is insulting my intelligence

'Cause real recognize real, and real you ain't never been
You never will, I catch ya where you chill,
Holla at ya where you live nigga, fuck a record deal (what's happenin')

Breaking my victims, lining them niggas all with the light
Get it right, hold it tight, blast with all your might
See we hustle for them grands 'til the early light

Ain't no stopping the man nigga with grands in my hands
Living the fast lane, grand hustle the gram when the cash came
(Grand hustle nigga)

The police book me, take my fingerprint and last name
If I'm stuck in a cell, how would I maintain
Lock up all these niggas, the penitentiary mind frame
I strive for perfection, my method is quite collective

Check out the fuckin' way I just rep it
This dog pound gangsta in the back take a licking
Rims shining, fresh paint, T.I. counting paper
Big moves stay on deck with the tools
All y'all niggas and bitches and niggas get sprayed with the tools

This how we hustle for the paper, cause the hustle get harder
I'm dog pounded out, an Atlanta Brave starter
Money, weed, and bitches, 24 inches conversating

And dick print in her, and I go up in her
She get managed, like the Asian wanting Spanish
And you know I got to have it, put your mouth on me baby

Get to fucking, and baby girl can't manage
She can't stand, her ass bigger than the whole damn planet
She don't look to better, like Janet

Long as I got a rubber, Z-Ro gon bone a broad a day

When I hit it, she gon injure her ankle like Hardaway
Doggy style, come out and come back from a yard away
Punish the panocha, I'm going south
Do that thang with your mouth, and I'll be hard all over

Look how they jock me, when I'm rocking the stage
On that X and I'ma hit it, like I'm cocking a gauge
I'm like em with hair down they back, or rocking the braids
They love my dick, and want me to stay in they cot for the day

But I got bidness to handle, and paper to chase
Finish sucking my dick, and then get your ass out my face

I met her back in high school, used to dig out her homies
She never snitched on me 'cause baby was in love
I was all she would dream of all she would think of
She worked nine to five, I rolled up smokin bud
Independent baby loved to live life exqist
From Atlanta G.A. and plus she new how to kick it
She wan't an erotic stripper
Dancin that's where I first met
Sayin' to myself ""I gots to go get her""
Waved a hundred doller bill in the air
Said come here baby pulled up a chair
Got you shakin my very dear
That's when I said baby you the one work it the best
I say you the bomb and stuck a five down her chest
Buzzin lovin the scean was all what it seem
For me to get inside her world was all aplayers dream
She picked me up in a six hundreed 
Music bangin and thumpin and the only thing she had to say ha ha

How you make me want to leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you 
This is what you do

While all of this is going on
I try I try to fight but the feelings just to strong

She said you Daz what's your fantsay

Don't wanna fuck with me
Dogg Pound Gangstas
We do it like that
Motherfuckers out there be like, takin our styles
Be trying to do they own little dissing
But they can't do it, you know
So we gonna, do it like this
Sit back relax and get a cool one

Have you ever heard of a slaughter, I oughta start dippin
Sippin on that S-T get's me to trippin
I don't slips I bangs
With that mad ass Dogg Pound Gang it's a DPG thang
Kurupt from the S.C
You wanna test me let's see if you'll survive .45 times
Like a hollow point headed for your dome
Take a couple of steps, turn around and it's on
Couldn't withstand the murderous mental
I subdue, and then take two to your temple
When I cause holocoust from what's spittin
Niggas collapse and when the straps is clickin
Look, this is how it's done nigga, one two three
I grab my strap you best run nigga
I gives a fuck, Kurupt's the kingpin of the click
Littlest G, with the biggest dick

Shit, a motherfucker better recognize
With a twist of my wrist like O.J. you all die
I snack on motherfuckers like a bone
Known to be the shit upon the microphone ever since I was born
Not to ever love a bitch
Learned game after game, that's why we are the best
Motherfuckers be gankin styles minute after minute
But soon as you did it I smelled the niggas shitted


Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

Bitches butterfly all day, while I steady make my pay
Every single day in the LBC
Cruising through the Eastside, me and Lil' Style
When I back up a green six-fo' busting freestyles

There's no escape, give me the papes and the tape case
How much money can a nigga make in one place
The review, ain't shit new
You stupid motherfuckers can't fuck with my crew

I see all these niggas trying to get with my kin folk
Get so many busters on the West Coast
And then to say the least
I see a few trick ass niggas layin low on the East Coast
And the question is asked
Do you wanna rap, scrap or blast to that nigga Daz
I'll be the first one to him em
Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knocc Out and every nigga down with him
Cause I'm a Natural Born Killer
In a Steeler hat motherfucker cuz it's like that

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include
Whose quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud
It doesn't make a difference, cuz it's about
Who's the quickest on the draw to end all existence
For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools
These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room
Assume, it's only for conversation, so let's
Conversate slip a nigga the .38 then dip
Empty out the clip
Mind on stead-trip, cuz niggas talk shit

Now if, a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive
And if I was in your shoes, would I survive
Probably not, you'd probably let your Glock go pop
Now drop, to your knees
And picture Dat Nigga Daz flowing in the breeze

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

From the twitch of the eyes
You can see the line, just know it when you see it
Cause it messes up the flow, to the real fillings y'know
And I'd rather be sipping on a glass of wine
Can you feel yourself in the room with Everlast
Trying to steal a flow, I don't think so
Cock-blockers come with their hearts beating jealousy
Then away like a stray dog
Tryin to claim every bitch as his own

And we keep them shotguns like huntas
We smoke thunda, it put me under

Inside of the phantom
And it's lookin' like a sauna
And I stay high and I still got my diploma
And I still keep the Maggie on me like Homer
And I'm too sick man I'm spittin' out a coma
And I'm still lettin' the money pile like goma
And I smoke that kill, y'all blowin' on begonias
And I keep a field of that grass like a farmer
And I keep that armor, try me and I'll spin you around
I'll be with the stars and I ain't talkin' tinsel town

Boy I shits a pound of that purple rain on the Marvin's day
You wit me now?
Too high you can't set me down

We got that A-K-forty seven

See see we just smokin' we just smokin',

If you got the bomb bomb nigga come and light it up

Yeah blaze up ain't nothin' like
Ridin' by, drivin' high
Me and all the hommies smokin'
Dumpin' if you chokin' smokin'

Smoke slow when they hit you 
Caught you might pass out
Look over at the bitches 
Snatch a blunt up out a mouth bitch
Switch it to another scene
That has you smokin' endo green
Some homies be on that lean
Mix it with that endo' weed

The ghetto relationships that you go through as lovers
The wrong choice to begin with
Slam it on usin' profanities, tryin' get me locked up quick

Pushin' and shove in', fightin' and fusin'

And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling

Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure

Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does

To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war

And not just a tip, I wanna give you all of it
She's a model, all tall and shit
I'm too short, but I ain't got a small dick
Just ask around, I fucked a lot of whose in this town
I get down, I come long and white
And when I pull it out they all wanna ride
The sun's coming up we started at four
I switch so much game, it's hard to absorb
And everything you believe she hates, like pimping, she appreciates
'Cause my women, understand the game
It's all about the money, give a fuck about the fame
You never get a chance to go out with me

See you a hot mess with the booty and thang thang
Swinging in the club when you drinking that drink drink
Smoke in the air chilling all in the zone
Fuck me on the dance floor with my clothes on
Too short ah, imagine that
She threw me the pussy, I threw the dick right back

Running from the military, Junta hot on their tracks
For the love that why their uncle packs a bomb in their bags
What the fuck, you'd do the same with no options in hand
So stop with the wack raps you illiterate stale
Horse shit, you just a piss in the gale force winds
Battling me like I have to start busting for you
I'm like a suspect package, I got nothing to prove
Fuck it, I'll serve you straight from the kitchen
And kill your fly shit like Norman Bates with a pigeon
Listen. I'm deaf and blind to your fallacy war
Like a land mine child victim all bandaged and sore
Damage and break you down until your spirit is vanquished
Like traditional ownership does to indigenous factions
It's more than just black and white, like racism
Cause the face of hate appears when you face the mirror
This more than people starving to eat
Cause food for thought is running short in this marketed scene
It's hard to believe when you feel like smashing the mirror
But Charlie Chimp will pick you up like an angry gorilla

Yeah I'm back in that pattern
I sit up late with a spliff and wait for the magic to happen
Just for rapping wack you're catchin a slappin

I'm a play strategically and take everything you got
Ciecmate! Game over, now you know the deal
Here with my bro's and we're pro's in our chosen fields
Standing tall like a wall to wall, public letter blockbuster
Got a lust for life, plus a lot of love for those I trust with my life
I'm a live my life like I like on any given night and anything else isn't right
Time's ticking by, time's making changes, time's turning friends into strangers
I'm trying to find what the aim is, but time's limited
I've gotta make payments and for everyone, everyday it's the same shit
Big brother wants us all to put it in a statement
But it's built on lies like the Bush administration
The media be feeding ya and we just believe it huh?
Behind the curtain men are getting greedier
We need to peel the curtain back and hurt em bad
And then spread the wealth around to all those who've been getting held down
Can I get some help now? Or can I get a hell yeah?
I'm saying this for everybody's welfare

Depict me like David Hicks holding that rocket
A mix breed of Scottish and a modern day Australia's
Home but Mundine treats us like an alien, no
Man fuck that
Singing Waltzing Matilda with my rucksack
Cut back on the ego, leave rap to the albino
Rip you quicker than teeth wrapped around a T-bone
See know evil speech insightful
Solid gold heat like Hussein's rifle
I'm spiteful, only loyal if it's like that
Starve man's best friend, he's gonna bite back

Dig your grave like letting Michael J. play with your kids

Finding a good one like finding the Loch Ness
Monster, and not Kody Scott
But down for my team and known what I got
When it's my shot, take it never look back
Or ever make it, dedicated to my fate a known gladiator
Yeah your favourite, I run with wind
Pauly Poltergeist and the Brothers Grimm, yeah you know me

Rest in peace bottom feeders, the scourge of the earth
Proof God doesn't need us, from fetus to birth
First. my mums didn't plan me, so meet plan b
The worker bee, Ron Burgendy where the pants be
Quite a big deal, 90 something kilo
Aim for the best but got Shaq at the free throw
Overweight. Shit I can't hold a job but I can hold a steak
Wash it down with a bunch of brown bottles
Plutonic made it for snake charmers
The bass bang harder than face planting in chain armour
Heavy metal, hammers banging the hang over
In my headspace, until it's dead weight

(I'm the calm one, but my crew is sorta sick)
Yeah, big l is the first to represent.

Yo, on the mic is big l, that brother who kicks flavs, god.
Known for sendin' garbage mcs to the graveyard.
I pack a gat, not a slingshot;
Step to this and get an ass-whoopin' like rodney king got.
Or get beat to your death like cochise,
My laws is no peace, fuck the police.
M-C's get braggin' about cash they collect,
But them chumps is like ray Charles,
Cause they ain't seen no money yet.
Trash rappers I tax and spark,
I be wettin' niggas up like water rides at action park.
A nigga stuck me, and that ain't funny son,
So I got money gun, they wet him and his honey bun.
Cause phony faggots I froze, it's a fact,
I flip fast on foes with fabulous fantastic flows.
L is the rebel type, I'm rough as a metal pipe,
Fuck a benz, cause I could pull skins on a pedal-bike.
Props, I got the most, no mc comes close,coast-to-coast,
Shows I host, foes I roast, adios, I'm ghost

[Chorus]

Yo, street ? in new york is a place this nigga stands
With a machete I'm a crazy Eddie scissor hands.
Born with such a thirst to kill,
I can tap 200 quarters from a $50 bill.
Cuttin' bitch-niggas down with a hundred pound axe
Like I was raised by psycho-crazed lumberjacks.
So in a battle I be stabbin',choppin' M-C'ss like trees,
Piece-by-piece buildin' cabins.
I'm a maniac magician, Abra cadabra,
Makin' pain appear cause I'm-a grab arusty chain to make a noose
To choke your ass so hard, you're spittin' fuckin' adam's apple juice.
So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.
Baseball battin' 'em, splattin' 'em,
So many homicide records, my cases went platinum.
D'shawn is nice,
Known for givin' out head cracks without touchin' dice.
Just pain and punishment from the boogie down bronxter,
D'shawn the maniac street mobster.

[Chorus]

It's the f-I-n-e-double-s-e,
Don't play or stress me
Cause that shit don't impress me
I make papes off the shit I create, and then dictate
So get your motherfuckin' shit straight
I got skills and I'm hard to kill,
So y'all bitch-ass rappes better chill and just guard your grill
You grab a mic and always get hype
Talkin' bout fuckin' niggas up
When you can bearly beat your dick right
So stop ridin' my dilznick
Cause I can still kick the ill shit on the motherfuckin' real tip
Hit like foreman when I'm brawlin'
Those who think I'm fallin, I'll play your monkey-ass like a organ
I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine
Crab-ass rappers, don't even front cause y'all know the time
So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left

Check-check-check it a to the g is gonna wreck it.
On stage, on my record, so nigga don't forget it.
I'm the man. the one-man-band is on my right hand.
(his name is show nitwit, so get wit the program)
I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.
Styles will vary, they won't carry over.
Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.
Tryin' real hard to get it,
You can forget it, because you don't got it.
And my skills are excellent, diggin' in the crates
And it's time to represent!

In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most

And the friends that pretend to be your folks

This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?

It's telling me it aren't over
Light years away
Light years away, away, away

Satellites are crashing down
I watch you disappear at the speed of sound
Much feelings out of control
And where my heart lays
Now a black hole

Miles and miles away
Closing my eyes
Just to see you again
Memories are not enough
To leave me with

And my fire's burning
The fire's burning
Oh, I feel this love
And I'm giving up
'Cause nothing left for me to say

I'm reaching up
'Cause we're burning now
A million light years away

It's pulling me like gravity
It's telling me you aren't over

A miracle of God gave a virgin a babe

He brings peace on Earth, His mercy is mild
God and sinners reconciled through the birth of a child

He stood before Pilot an innocent man
They cried ""crucify,"" He supplied demand
He was mocked, spit upon, His clothes were torn
Royalty was represented with a crown of thorns
They placed Him in a robe, they gave Him a staff
As they gambled for His garments Roman soldiers laughed
Upon Golgotha they crucified Christ
Sent from above to cold pay your price
On His command opposition was through
But Christ said ""Forgive them, they know not what they do""

Shocked to find the rock removed that served as a door

As she fell to the ground she began to weep
Heard a voice and turned to hear the Savior speak

He's alive, she cried, like the prophecy read

""Better is open rebuke, than hidden love""
So say the words... 

Silence is golden but these are the words
That the world needs to hear
[brothers and sisters]
Terms of compassion will cause a reaction
As love drives them near 

But still we choose to hide behind the face of pride
Pretending we are blind to the calling
This is my point and case, if hate can be erased
With such a simple phrase, why are we stalling?

Of the love that they feel

Some have a heartfelt emotion
But never the words to reveal 

I think we all relate, so why are we afraid
To let our hearts convey what we're feeling?
There is a world in need with hungry souls to feed
And love can intercede if we're willing, so...

For the greatest gift of all to be abused

The sand that he walked was also his bed
The words that he spoke made the people assume
There wasn't too much left in the upper room

With skins on his back and hair on his face

I can't get enough of You
So help me God
To put my faith in You 

Infected by the skin I'm in this starving with desire
And Jesus ain't the latest thing to come across the wire
I throw myself at mercy for I am the chief of sinners
But daily taking up my cross
Has brought it's share of splinters 

You're there when I call
And You're there when I fall
Even though I don't deserve it all
You, You light my way
Through the night and the day
And from You I will not stray  

God so help me
This is my soul plea
I'm desperately devoted
I can't get enough of You
So help me God

Cause You are the one I need

Cause You are the one I'm seeking

But the fight in me remains 
I am weary, I am worn

This is harder than I thought 
Harder than I thought it'd be

Takin' every part of me 
Harder than I thought 
So much harder than I thought it'd be 
But empty's never felt so full

Poured out, used up, still givin' 
Stretching me out to the end of my limits

This is what real love 
Feels like 
This is what love feels like poured out 
Used up still willin' to fight for it 
This is what love feels like 
Yeah, this is what it feels like 

Like floating confetti 
The beautiful gets messy 
When the fallout finds the floor 
But in the depths of the trenches 
Is the richest of riches 
Love is calling us to more

Talib Kweli-Verse 1:

It's a funky sen-sa-tion ain't it?
I'm havin a conversation wit'cho imagination
It was explainin how you was waitin, for somethin amazin
Like when it come out you out the door racin to the store (*zoom*)
It took a lot of perse-verance and patience
We was preparin for our place among the ancients
Yo basically yo' take on me ain't makin me
or breakin me and yo I hate to see a fake MC
I take out all my competition from like A to Z
Cause I get fly more frequently than a travel agency
That's what I'm made to be, hip-hop through my artery
An important part of me the soundtrack to my oddysey
It got me, rockin retardedly
Pardon me for speakin incorrect politically
Anything less would be me speakin hypocritically, and I don't do dat
You lingerie MC's I see through that
I make a point about you and your crew, go ""Tru dat""
Who dat? It's the Reflection
Remember the name, slid in the game before the ""2000 Season"" came
Breakin the chain, usin the pain as our ammunition
to blast Babylonian towers out of position
It's the Reflection and we poppin like your ears on a plane
We make you disappear like tears in the rain
The fears in your brain is clear when I appear on the terrain
and bloody your nose
I got more lines than co-CAINE that's why you sniffin' around
We diggin' for different sounds to keep it hittin'
Straight up the only way we gettin' down with the sound is provacative
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
You got a issue with that then it ain't my problem kid
Y'all niggaz gotta eat, we gotta live, yo
We all gotta eat and gotta live

Talib Kweli-Verse 2:

We remain, hotter than the blue part of the flame
I got a glock in my brain
that baffle weapons inspections like Saddam Hussein
and rocks with the impact
Gettin beat with socks filled with ten-packs of tokens
Men's backs get broken when I get open
Words more than spoken
Most of dem MC's on the first thing smokin
Leavin town at the same time causin traffic on the interstate
We stay droppin classics cause the key word is innovate
These cats is so plastic that we call 'em laminated
Tried to duplicate the style quickly got frustrated
More desperate than dudes who search people's ashtrays for clips
I burn MC's like Coca-Cola through the paint on your whip
Shit! My rhymes is like a magnifyin glass
When I shine my light through it, I burn up everything in my path
Last Dragon like Lee-roy (sho' nuff) rock for the b-boy
My rhymes are so sharp you catch cuts that key-loid
Destroyed the decoy, most of y'all d-boy, my culture
It's not that I hate, y'all just p-noid cause y'all fake
Embarassed and ashamed and don't know where to put the blame
And never hesitate to call out my name!
I ain't effected by the negative
It's the Reflection and we dealin with the positive
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
It's the Reflection kid
Never gotta look between the lines to get the messages
You're too sensitive, checkin out our references
The turntable and microphone specialist
It's the Reflection kid, it's the Reflection kid
It's the Reflection kid, like that like that

Tengo en mi mente grabado el momento
¿Por qué te fuiste si aún me estás sintiendo?

Te pido vuelve
Que tú no Sabes lo que estoy sufriendo
Ya no me importa parar más el tiempo
Si al despertar te encuentro aquí a mi lado

Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life

Yo creo que me mataste
Desde que te fuiste
Porque no siento el corazón
Y todo lo veo triste
Que me tranquilicen,
Que me psicoanalicen
Que me hagan lo que sea
Mientras tú vengas y regreses

Te espero en la casa
La puerta está abierta
Y Siempre lo ha estado
Por si tú regresas
Ven dame la vida
Un beso me basta
Para recuperar todo lo que
Me hace falta
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life

Intento continuar mi vida
Pero mire donde mire
Veo tu retrato
Ok, y para que decir mentiras
Sabes que yo para amarte
Siempre fui un novato

Solo me quedan huellas de tu
Bye, bye, bye
Mientras nuestra historia ya
Es historia
Si supieras que me ahoga
Tanta libertad
My life is over (Magan)

Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life

Calma este tsunami
Que arrasa en todo mi interior
Sin ti no hay nada de mí
No Music, no life
No hay nada por lo que ser yo

Vuelves nunca

Rapper dritter Art landen auf dem höchsten Dach der Stadt
Observieren Feinde durch geweitete Iris
Du glaubst wir kommen in Frieden, aber uh-uh, wir schießen
Bang Bang, ich kill deine Gang Gang
Mein Style ist zwar dreckig, aber guck, die High-Tops glänzen
Es ist D.C.V.D.N.A., next level
Mir sitzen die Bullen im Nacken - Deutschraps Seb Vettel
(Yo) Eyau DCV, was geht bei dir, Bro?
Plötzlich macht so'n halbstarker einen auf De Niro
Ich schieß so 2, 3 Kugeln in seinen Schädel
(Alles klar bei dir?) Schon OK, hat sich erledigt
Ich leb wie'n Rockstar, die Leben wie Roboter
Wir stehen auf, wenn wir Bock haben
Und die, wenn's ihnen ihr Boss sagt
Stoff, Bargeld neue Sneakers, ich lieb das
Vom Dealer zum Deal, in Originals Adidas
Krise interessiert uns nicht, für uns sind das goldene Zeiten
Keiner hat's damals geglaubt, als wir es prophezeiten
Süße Träume, Gringo, wir verdienen Geld im Schlaf
Wir schleusen uns in die Szene, Wölfe unter'm Pelz vom Schaf

Nicht so viel, und bei dir so?

Ich versteh nix, alles klar bei dir?

Was redest du von gut verdienen? Ich möchte von Rap nix hören
Komm lieber morgen Fußballspielen, verstehste?
Ja, wir haben keinen Chef, der meckert
Fragen nicht nach Urlaub stellen, keinen Wecker
Nein, wir müssen nicht mal auf die Uhr schauen
Aber ich will was mit Freunden erleben
Doch durch die neuen Probleme
Bekomm ich sie nicht mehr so häufig zu sehen
Ich leg mich pennen, wenn sie aufstehen
Muss ständig Lieder aufnehmen
Hab keinen Schlafrythmus und kann nichtmal aus dem Haus gehen
Ohne dass man mich erkennt
Verdammter Kack, wie mich das nervt
Egal, einfach ignorieren und so tun, als hätt' ich's nicht gemerkt
Ey, ich leg mal auf, Lust, morgen mal vorbeizuschauen?
Jeder nimmt paar Zeilen auf, einfach auf die Scheiße hauen

Und deine Lines enden alle mit einer schwulen Betonung
Trotzdem war mein Album nicht mal unter den Top 100
Der heiß erwartetsten Releases
Aber die werden sich noch wundern
Ich ermord heute Mittag die Sportfreunde Stiller
Wenn du nur wüsstest, was für 'ne verdammte Vorfreude ich hab
Ich schieß dich über den Haufen
Aber wenn die Bullen mich vermöbeln
Werd ich politisch und schreie: ""Staatsgewalt ist keine Lösung""
Du hörst Rap mit Message, weil du keine eigene Meinung hast
Und tauchst mit dem Kopf in deiner viel zu weiten Kleidung ab
Meine Flows sind so krass, dass Sido die Superstarz
Jetzt ""Superstar D-C-V-D-N-S"" nennen will

Aus Liebe zum Rap, ich ziele mit der Gat
Auf deine Stirn und jage die Kugel in dein verficktes Gehirn
Plündere deine Tasche und verpiss mich von hier
Kann mir's im Geschäft nicht mal leisten zu klauen
Dann heißt es auch schon gleich in den Bau
Weil ich auch noch Gangster bin wenn der Beat nicht mehr läuft
Ne Quatsch, war ein Witz, mach in wieder an, ich hab Schiss
Sido findet meine Witze nicht zum Lachen
Kann man von einem Mario Barth-Fan auch wirklich nicht erwarten
Nach diesen beiden Zeilen ist der Beef auch schon beendet
Denn ich bin undissbar, Sido Legende
Doch jetzt zum wesentlichen, warum wir schießen?
Weil wir G's sind

Today was fine, tears at times
A weak ridge from pressure from the hinter to the heartland

Who knows what it'll be?
A briny breeze
Collars on the upturn, a nod towards the winter

And Monday is a Monday
Tuesday's a thunder day
With a wind that chills you to the bone
Wednesday, don't mention Wednesday!
Not a good one at all!

Otherwise fine...
Otherwise it's dandy
Otherwise fine
Otherwise it's over the top!

You got really rotten weather; it's so hard, I know
Tell me where a weatherman should start
When he's miles from his sunshine
Promise you the warmest winter fire
When outside it's freezing cold
Promise you the bluest summer sky
It'll shine just for you

And it'll be the outlook for Thursday
Your guess is good as mine!
We'll be together, yeah, together by design!

Yes me,
We went together like peaches and cream,
And teachers and teens,
And shoes and jeans,
And I said that,
'cause we was so sophisticated,
On the first date,
I was late,
But you still waited,
I wasn't late on purpose,
I swear 2 you,
You know I've made mistakes in the past,
But I'm there for you,

And we both know I held you down like a clutch,
So please don't rush,
Into a next relationship,
Remember the days we spent together,
From 11am til 6,
And you see you yeah,
I like you 2 bits,
I ain't ready for the quits,
So please don't quit it,
It will be fixed,
Our relationship I wrote it,
Down in a tune,

Would you like if I told everyone that you was my girl and you was my wife? (Would you like that, would you like?)
Would you like if we was life?
Would you like if I read your mind?
Would you like if I knew when you was upset so I could make you fine?
Would you like if I could sing?
So I could sing sweet melodies to make you go weak? (Would you like that, would you like?)

Would you like if I took my time
And gave you more respect and then maybe you'll be mine (Would you like that, would you like?)
Would you like if this was for you?

Hear the deep painful sound.
Fire, fire in my eyes.
Go away friendly guy.

Feel the pain in my soul.
My heart is twin around
With barbed wire of rage.
My body explodes of life,
But my soul runs straight to hell.

My own rage devours me.
I drown into the swamp,
And the swamp it comes from hell.
But I fight, fight myself.

Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

De Danann,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1996

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

De Danann,"Walking all the day near tall towers where falcons build their nests
Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts
Soar Black Head against the sky
Between the rocks that run down to the sea
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay
Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away
Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay
Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight
Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light
Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in you e'er blue sky
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland

De Danann,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

There's a pale drooping maiden who foils her life away
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

De De Vogt,"I went all the way to Paris to forget your face
Captured in stained glass, young lives long since passed
Statues of lovers every place
I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love
I walked through the ruins, icons of glory
Smashed by the bombs from above

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us.

Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil
There's just no medium for life
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth
In a dusty cathedral the living God called
And I prayed for my life here in earth

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us.

There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon
Bleeding its light like a lamb
And the town is illuminated, its tiny figures are fast asleep
And it dawns on me the time is upon me
To return to the flock I must keep.

So we must love while these moments are still called today

De De Vogt,"During the time of which I speak it was hard to turn the other cheek
To the blows of insecurity
Feeding the cancer of my intellect the blood of love soon neglected
Lay dying in the strength of its impurity
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
They've all gone and left each other in search of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery

There I am in younger days, star gazing
Painting picture perfect maps of how my life and love would be
Not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection
My compass, faith in love's perfection
I missed ten million miles of road I should have seen
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
Left each other one by one along the road of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery

Rain soaked and voice choked like silent screaming in a dream
I search for our absolute distinction
Not content to bow and bend
To the whims of culture that swoop like vultures
Eating us away, eating us away
Eating us away to our extinction
Oh how I wish I were a trinity, so if I lost a part of me
I'd still have two of the same to live
But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal, as specks of dust we're universal
To let this love survive would be the greatest gift that we could give
Tell all the friends who think they're so together
That these are ghosts and mirages, all these thoughts of fairer weather
Though it's storming out I feel safe within the arms of love's discovery",Love's Recovery,1989
De De Vogt,"In the ink of an eye I saw you bleed,
Through the thunder I could hear you scream,
Solid to the air I breathe,
Open-eyed and fast asleep.
Falling softly as the rain,
No footsteps ringing in your ears.
Ragged down worn to the skin
Warrior raging, have no fear.

Secure yourself to heaven.
Hold on tight, the night has come
Fasten up your earthly burdens,
You have just begun.

Kneeling down with broken prayers,
Hearts and bones from days of youth,
Restless with an angel's wing,
I dig a grave to bury you.
No feet to fall,
You need no ground,
Allowed to glide right through the sun,
Released from circles guarded tight,
Now we all are chosen ones.

Secure yourself to heaven.
Hold on tight, the night has come
Fasten up your earthly burdens,
You have just begun.",Secure Yourself,1989

Mic in de hand en we bossen voor buit
Hou het sickie zo simpel. Bespaar je de rimpels
""Je haat op m'n stijl."", terwijl je staat op m'n gympen
Gemaakt om te pimpen. Jij om te fronten
Altijd in je ooghoek, net als je oogpoep

Uitermate nep als ik raps van je rap
Klippen door je schuur, dorp of plantsoen
Ghostwrite m'n moer, kork of tantu

Geen rapcentjes, geen tapen, geen stang
Totdat hij uit het niks op tv kwam
Ineens changde z'n hele leven, bam
Shows in het weekend, geld op de bank
Gelukkig aan het sterrenstof, maar telt het nog dan
Hij wilde proeven van elke soort drank
Men probeerde hem te zeggen hij was telkens zo lam
En na een tijdje zat ik crazy in de put
Toen uit de lucht kwam vallen Lady Luck
Ze werd zijn baby en hij was haar baby terug
En alle vlinders in zijn buik zeiden nee tegen die drugs

De John Sisters,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",(Love Is) The Tender Trap,2001
De Kast,"Ze zeggen wel dat je blijft hangen
Aan 't type waar je niet op valt
Ze zeggen ook ""overal zoeken
Het heeft geen zin, liefde komt niet op bestelling
En de overslaande vonken evenmin
Je hoort ook wel van die verhalen
In de goot door een gebroken hart
Wat dat betreft leef ik gelukkig ongedeerd
Liefde heb ik veel gegeven
Maar 'k heb niemand ooit aanbeden of vereerd
Refr.:
Duizend keer heb ik me vergist
Duizend keer de verkeerde smaak
Zonder je te kennen heb ik je gemist
Maar deze keer is het raak
En want je bent
De hemel en de aarde
De zon, de sterren en de maan
De mooiste en de liefste
Hartstochtelijk, spontaan
Ik laat je nooit, nee nooit
Ik laat je nooit meer gaan
Het lot daar kun je in geloven
Als je aan anderen de keuze laat
Maar ik kies zelf en hou m'n leven zo in eigen hand
Ik wil er liever middenin staan
Dan dat ik sta te kijken langs de kant
Refr.
Ik dwaalde en zocht
En wist nooit (waar ik uit zou komen)
Ik sliep regelmatig bij vage vriendinnen
Met wie ik uiteindelijk niets wou beginnen
Soms iets teveel, iets te vaak (risico's genomen)
't Liep te vaak uit de hand, 't ging tot over de rand
Maar deze keer, deze keer is 't raak
Want je bent
De hemel en de aarde
De zon, de sterren en de maan
De mooiste en de liefste
Hartstochtelijk, spontaan
Ik laat je nooit, nee nooit
Ik laat je nooit meer gaan
Je bent de hemel en de aarde
De zon, de sterren en de maan
De mooiste en de liefste
Hartstochtelijk, spontaan
Ik laat je nooit, nee nooit
Ik laat je nooit meer gaan

Tú eres la única que me hace morir de ganas
Usted se suelta el pelo cuando baila y me enloquece (farru)

Déjate llevar por el boom boom 
Del bajo cuando azota 
Pégate a mi cuerpo
No te hagas la loca y baila 
Tú no eres una santa

Si tomas este servidor te invita
Ya yo se lo que tú necesitas

Que la noche no se va a acabar temprano
Siénteme y dame de ese calor humano

Más allá de la ropa
Más allá de besarte en la boca 
Más allá de darnos un par de copas 
Tú haces que me eleve la nota 
En la cama me agotas 
Cuando te mueves así, bailando 
Sigue rozándome así, guayando 
Como te brilla la piel sudando 
Sigue sigue me estás descontrolando

Ella se activa, es una Killa
Que a cualquiera intimida
Su movimiento me inspira

Y si te gusta el guayeteo
Entonces dale hasta abajo
Sin que nadie lo impida
Como cinta adhesiva
Pégate a mi cuerpo agresiva

Como asesina
Esa nena tiene cría
Vamo a embarrarlo como pan de mantequilla
Chiquilla tócate los codos con la rodilla
Trépate a mi palo
Como si fuera una ardilla

Amanecí y ya tú me estabas buscando
Gárgolas y yo no sabía
Ella es una chica decidida a gozarse la vida
La visto en la disco par de semanas corrida

A ella se ve que le gusta la presión
Y se activa cuando canto mi canción
Ella quiere
(¡Algo maravilloso nene!)
¿Cuándo lo quiere?
(¡Ahora nene!)

Y si te gusta como canto reggaetón
No perdamos tiempo
Úsame si quieres acción
Ella quiere
(¡Mucha seducción nene!)
¿Cuándo lo quiere?
(¡Ahora nene!)

¡Hey ya!

Hey! (Yo!)

Hemos hecho este género trabajando duro!
Sobrepasando situaciones!
Sobrepasando el sistema!
Así somos nosotros!

Definitivamente y sin duda!
Volviendo a marcar otro nivel en la música!

Prra!

Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Ahí les dejo al mío!
Mario!
Comételos vivo!

Ya hace su entrada inesperada
El que menos pensaban (¡Mario, dale!)
Hoy dejo atrás todos mis modales
Pa' los que pensaron que yo no me podía ir calle
Pues confundieron mi humildad con no tener coraje
Se equivocaron de nuevo, les vo'a pasar el rolo
Pa' los que pensaron que en esto no podía solo
Alex, dame la verde y solo los desplomo
Al fin de cuenta, si vamo'a morir que sea a nuestro modo
Gárgolas, poniendo reglas desde antaño
Sé que en esta liga solo llevo un par de años
Que las estrellas de este género ya están jugando
Pero yo soy el sexto hombre que los mata saliendo del banco

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Okay, llego el turno del Vale'
Precaución que ando con mis anormales
Un combo de artillería que a cazarte salen
Y que a plena luz del día revientan cristales
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales
Sácale furia, no corre...
Y si acaso dudan de la cría de este flaco
Bajen pa'l barrio que no salen vivos de la 24
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales

Estos cabrones quieren que los dejemos feos
No bromeo y no les tengo miedo a los feos
Soy guerrillero y en la calle como les campeo
Mucha cazaera, mujeres y fumeteo
Como los pompeo, me voy hasta abajo si se forma un peo
Si frontean yo los sueno y aquí no hay duelo
Tú lo que hueles es a sepelio
Pague tu entierro porque mi vida en esto es primera
¿Quién dice que no te bajare de ese globo helio?
Aunque frontees tú no eres Grayskull
Cambio ese CD de Terminator
Que aquí nadie es intocable
Y to's somos iguales
Viviendo en una selva
Que los que viven no son tan anormales
Dando break, pero conmigo no te resbales
¿Okay? (¡Conmigo no te resbales!) ¿Okay?

(¡Es el turno del gorila!)
Llego la maquina de guerra, el truck Mackal
Yo no vo'a atacar si tu combo saca'l* (¿?)
De la jaula el chacal que 'ta loco por machacar
Quieren inventar y te vamo'a maltratar* (¿?)
Yo no 'toy fácil, considérame difícil
Yo controlo el zodiaco desde Aries a Piscis
Tranquilito, papo, que usted mea como missy
Y el gorila tiene letra pa' dejarte en crisis
Considérate un ""cover"" pa'l pecho
Que tengo escobas pa' barrer
A los que se fueron por techo
Se me hizo largo, estrecho
Pero de hierro estoy hecho
Y este artista de WyY tiene derecho

Y mira ahora quien llegó, la gárgola de ""Agresivo""
Rompiendo y partiéndolos, educándolos con mi flow
Son las mujeres las que hacen que yo salga de noche
(¡Tuti!) (¡Blam, blam!) WD-40 pa'l Lacoste
Suelto suelto y sigo envuelto
Y viendo como paralizo tu momento
Heyyyy, yo siendo la voz del momento
La única gárgola que el sol no convierte en cemento

No dejes que se te hunda el barco y cómprate un parco
Te aplasto, chequea en tarima cómo es que parto
Le caí de asalto, el bacalao reparto
Tú pediste tres tazas y saliste harto
(¡Ah!) Ya resolvimos marroneándola
No busques más, somos las gárgolas
La quinta parte fundiéndola
La compe', tu combo de la envidia se rompe
Porque ahora estamos encendidos, ¿y tú a donde?

(¡Oye!)
Ese negro es gárgola, es el negro
No hablen mucho, saben 'e donde vengo
Tengo mi propio flow, no me vendo
Si no sirve es que es sendo cerdo
No amenaces, nunca tiemblo
Mala mía si te ofendo
Yo no ofrezco si no tengo
Tú quieres que encienda
Prendo prendo (¡Ma'!)

Esto es pa' las gárgolas, sin miedo
Entra Cosculluela y to' el mundo se cae al suelo
Pa' tirarte contra mi 'tas bien loco
Hay muchos que suenan como tú
Pero como yo suenan pocos o ninguno
Salgo gigantesco y oportuno...
Consumo el humo mientras cargo el peine de la sumo
Gilipolla, prende bien atrás que 'ta la hoya
Que quien no atiende la cocina el kiosko se la arrollan
A mi me encanta saber que tengo lo mío plancha'o
Y si me muero mañana te juro que me fui gasta'o
Cuñao, brega en el norte que yo sigo las señales
Suenen los timbales, jale, bajen los metales
Disque 'toy en guerra, ¿con quien?, nunca se sabe
Cuando sientas la presión, men, esa es la clave
Sigo firme, me paro en la mía y que van a decirme
El príncipe del verso, no vayan a confundirme

Y tuve que irme tras de ti, yo luego te hice reír
Y pude sentir que conectábamos los dos, baby

En el momento en que me percate de tu sencillez
Y lo bien que tú reflejabas con tu timidez
Y me motivé a hablarte de tu mirada

Y esos que me dicen obligándome llegar a ti
de tu sonrisa y precisamente de la forma
Que te expresas de mi

También de la forma que tú me describías
La manera de llegar a ti
No hubo nadie que detuviera

Para donde los dos queríamos seguir
Dime que tengo que hacer pa' conquistar tu piel
Solo explícame porque es tan difícil acercarme a usted

En el momento en que te vi, no pude mentir
Y tuve que irme tras de ti, yo luego te hice reír
Y pude sentir que conectábamos los dos, baby

Momento en que te vi, no pude mentir
Y tuve que irme tras de ti, yo luego te hice reír
Y pude sentir que conectábamos los dos, baby

Ella sabía todo lo que yo quería
Y se reía cada vez que algo gracioso decía
Me interesaba, interrogaba  y no mentía

Me interesaba besarla y no podía
Sentí mi corazón como fuerte latía
Y ella seguía con una dulce simpatía

Me interesaba interrogaba y no mentía
Me interesaba besarla y no podía
No me esperaba esto cuando ella me beso

El pensamiento que anhelaba, nena ya se cumplió
Ahora estamos los dos para los dos
Descarguemos esta sensación

Dime que tengo que hacer pa' conquistar tu piel
Solo explícame porque es tan difícil acercarme a usted

En el momento en que te vi, no pude mentir
Y tuve que irme tras de ti, yo luego te hice reír

Te eh dejado un montón de mensaje si quieres me llama o cojee el teléfono
Es José quiero hablar contigo

Ey mami es Coscu perdona que te llame privado es que llevo como tres meses
Tirándote y no has contestado como tu has estado?
Yo me imagino que bien dime si todavía estas oliendo al trabajo en el tren
O si tienes novio quizá por eso es que ni te consigo
Que yo sigo y no es que este syko quiero ser tu amigo
Yo quisiera hablarte a veces me miro al espejo
Y lo practico por si conversamos no lucir pendejo
Pero a quien yo engaño?
Yo se que esto me hace daño
Ya te eh cantado cuatro conciertos de Cristian castro en el baño
Bajo la lluvia inclusive le agua fría de mi ducha
Eh llegado hasta el nivel que mis vecinos me escuchan

Me gritan Coscu deja el enfango brother ya no sigas!
Esa gata esta muy dura 'pa ti esta fuera de tu liga
Y todo el mundo dice que tu estas fuera de mi presupuesto
Sin saber que siempre sueño contigo cuando me acuesto

Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad (sueño contigo)

Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad

Estas barras que yo tire 'pa ver si te impresiono y quizás me mires
Con los ojos que hacen que todo el día el melón me gire
Yo me esmero le pido a tu prima que me acomode pero ella tira la mala
Ese Coscu que mucho jode !

Madrugada y de noche esta en un cuento de hadas
Yo me pregunto como duermes si con cuantas almohadas
Si tu te arropas o te gusta que te arropen primero
Dime que pensarías si olleras mis voces de Homero
Yo a ti te espero la noche son largas
Y a veces pienso que no hay otra como tu
En este planeta tan inmenso quiero llegar a conocerte
Y a veces le pido a dios 'pa por si el llega a convencerte
Que te explique de bajas y altas que tengo un mundo para ti
Y tu eres la que falta!
Pero por el momento yo sigo matando las horas
Dejándote todo estos mensajes en tu grabadora baby!

La noche no es la misma si no estas aquí
Y en mi mente tu siempre estarás
Si es mi alma que no quiere gritar

Solo me siento yo solo recuerdos del amor
I don't know if you're another love

Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad

Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad

Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Llevo mucho tiempo pensando en ti
(Mami tu sabes que yo me la paso pensando mucho tiempo pensando en ti)

Ok enséñame como mueve eso atrás que electrocuta
Buscando un títere que le de duro y la ejecuta
Que le haga, solo lucha libre la escuna, ah
Satisfacer su paladar a carne cruda
Ya ella ya no usa retro son ? Que le gusta
Mucho kush kush mary jane en la hooka
Lo que ella quiere es amor mucha sex y ternura
Y que la prenda como un Philly que le da en calentura

Así que dale duro duro pa que rompa la pista
Con esos movimientos tu cuerpo me hechiza
Sin mucho palabreo ella cae solita
Cuando ve a los chulitos llegando se paraliza

Que no era solamente yo 
Que tú sin mí puedes ser tú 
Pero sin ti yo no soy yo 
No sé qué me pasó 
Siento que me pierdo 
Siguen pasando los días 
Y más yo te recuerdo

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo 

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo 

Si esta almohada hablara el mundo se enteraría de mis secretos 
Como que tengo de todo pero sin ti sigo incompleto 
Que triste ironía recordar que un día fuiste mía 
Pero tengo que aceptarlo aunque mi alma esté vacía 
Lloro como un niño cada vez que miro el portafolio 
Yo sin ti por esta vida es como el mundo sin petróleo 
Tengo el control del juego y de todo su monopolio 
Pero mi corazón se sigue acercando a su velorio 
Aun hay vida porque nunca se da una despedida 
Sin que dios decida una chance a una mujer arrepentida 
Un hombre que se arrepiente nadando sin corriente 
En un océano donde no se oculta lo que se siente, baby

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado 

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado 

Y ya quisiera que algún día cayeras en tiempo
Que no solo vivas el momento 
Que te detengas y pienses 
Que todo pasa como el viento 
Mientras se sufre es lento 
Quisiera que recapacites baby 
Y que juntos terminemos el cuento 
Que no lo facilites baby 
Deja mostrarte lo mas profundo de mis sentimientos 
Mientras paseamos, de amor hablamos 
Y si lo perdimos, lo recuperamos 
Luego nos besamos y recapacitamos 
Actuemos, que el amor revive si luchamos

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo

Querida luna que me escuchas Y alumbras todas mis noches 
Dile que me perdone y el pasado no me reproche 
Que somos humanos y nos equivocamos por error 
Y lo importante es arreglarlo y hacerlo mejor 
Dile, la casa sigue igual, sus cosas son intocables 
En cada esquina de este hogar hay un momento inolvidable 
Una lagrima se derrama, un corazón que la llama 
Y antes de yo acostar a la otra prefiero botar la cama 
Me hago daño pero es que la extraño 
De nada me valen los consejos ni los regaños 
Pueden pasar mil años, pa' el amor no hay límites ni tamaños 
Yo te seguiré dedicando conciertos en el baño

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado 

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo

No encuentro la manera ni a explicación

Ya deja de llorar y vamos dilo
Que te vas, que me dejas, que ya no vale la pena
Intentarlo de nuevo, que murió
Yo sé, tu eres mariposa que vuela, buscando libertad
Y yo un moribundo sin esperanzas, sabiendo que te vas
Y quizás ahora ya no nos queda nada
Pero ahora amor de mi vida si te vas, quiero decirte

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes
Que diosito te acompañe
Y que te vaya bien, vaya bien

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes

Siempre tu serás mi princesa
Bien suave, suavecito como seda
Ojos achinados como una muñeca
Y me hipnotizan tan solo con su belleza
Pero ya no voy a sufrir por ti
Consíguete otro man que lo hará por mi
Se acabó el amor que yo tenia para ti
Ya me cansé de rogarte

Pero dime baby cuál es tu falsedad
Pero dices que me amas y por qué te marchas
Me acusas de maltrato y de infidelidad
Pero todo eso es mentira, nada de eso es de verdad

Te ciegas con las mentiras de tus amigas
Pero ellas no te dicen que conmigo quieren estar
En lo más profundo de tu alma, sé que me amas
Después que estés feliz, te juro viviré en paz

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes
Que diosito te acompañe
Y que te vaya bien, vaya bien

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes

Ya no hacen falta las palabras
Cuando esa mirada tuya, dice que te vas
Y yo aquí solo en la nada
Imaginando en lo que pudo ser
Y nunca será, que te vas tú y me quedo yo
A nadie obliga a nadie a quererse
Me tocó perder, pero no hay rencor
Yo te deseo buena suerte

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes
Que diosito te acompañe
Y que te vaya bien, vaya bien

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes

Que nadie se meta más que dañe la relationship
Hoy me vestí de blanco, todo blanco pa' ti
Me bañé del perfume que te gusta
Escápate conmigo y quítate la ropa
Que desnudos vamos a grabar un feat

Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar

Escucha bien princesa, sólo ten una decisión
Tú das la aprobación y yo ejecuto

Adicto al rojo de tus labios siempre quiero más
Esa manzana prohibida que me hace pecar

Sí
Si estar en mi cama es lo que más te gusta a ti
Devorarte, parte por parte, házmelo así

Yeah
Lentamente acariciarte y provocarte
Cumplir con tus deseos, que solo ves en tus sueños
Probar de tu veneno, que me hace volar hasta el cielo
Como una estrella fugaz, perdido en tu universo

De La Soul,"Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up, and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we more than rough, we callin' your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes
Yo, don't scandalize mine
I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin' for crime, halt! Who goes there?

Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear
Shinin' black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare

While we rockin' it, I'll rock in it (rock in it)
Like the little ball inside the spray can
Providing three coats for both child, woman and man

God bless the God, lay these Streets Wall to Wall
It go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry click
It went, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

It ain't my fault your ass is on the asphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam' who though you brought harm, you see
I'm iced out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cookies, y'all just rookies to me
Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D
Why try? Maseo be gettin' high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'
Man, my topic of talk is sheddin' shame all over your game
Like them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin' is the past drug
A life filled with that's what thugs love
Snatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice
while it muffles your voice

Now when I'm swimmin' through the joint, I put the funk on hold
Cause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss

Most crews are post-current while we're forever
Direct beats that's contagious, loved by all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity
of hard-hitters, for real

I got niggas in the streets that'll blast your ass for the shine
And get, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, if you a fat chick gettin' your fuck on tonight
Then go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin' our sound
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, and to my broke niggas on the corner holdin' me down
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Yo, I swear Tommy gonna get it, he done did me wrong
I had plans to buy more land, plant corn
Bust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks
Set backs is gonna get my ass to be hostile
Rockwilder the beat, top dollar defeat
Big money's make the big decisions
Keep hip-hop alive, it's just an intermission 
Back to the second half of the feature flick
Dick stacks and fuck rap

I had a name for makin' paper since paper mache
Now my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play
While you broke niggas reach drunk much quicker
You don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor
Went from God to God damn

Damn God, you're killin' it
Should incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it
Rap cats talk with no will in it

Soundin' like they virtual
This joint'll hurt you, yo

Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed
(shh shh shh, shh) They did a job
Took all my goodies out from under the tree, except the CD's
of shiny-suit rappers and flossin' emcees
who fail at takin' it to rhyme degrees

Man, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes
You need to not get nappy with me
Or else we gon' ""relax your mind, let your conscious be free""

Yo, where my Wall Street niggas, if ya up in the stands
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
To my women that'll throw they hands against they punk-ass man
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, if you never been shot or stabbed
Brick City go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, I gotta catch a cab back to the lab so I can smoke
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!",Oooh,

Got everybody's PA in my house, my house

Yo!  It's been instilled in me since infinite y'all
Usin' these minutes like I value the call
Put your money in the bank, and hold rank
Over friends who ain't got leadership skills

I got the sheep in my eyes so I can't sleep
We like the, land and laid, the brand old way
Grand operate the scandal way, L.I. sheist
I play the Xbox instead of fuckin' with dice
I hate losin' to those who walk away with my dough
'Cause I dozed, Tracy broke me
And now she want to see the resident provokin' me
To pop wheelies on my bicycle, watch her eyes twinkle

One house, two houses, third house
House rules so house take bank, watch Dave bank
Banner had 'em on the hawk since Atlanta extravaganza
Gamma ray rap I make the Hulk snap
Jump back like James Brown, hey now
When the liquor over we smokin' the hay now
Delegatin' numero dos, I holla out the sound of los
And keep the Island close to me

[Chorus: ]
Much more is what we got in store
Just believe me
Much more than they can see
Is how it'll always be, believe me (gotta believe)
  
I got verb skills, babies and bills, brothers who smoke krills
And still tryin' to get himself together from it
Knowin' he can't quite run it like me
I'm on the cutting edge of what's alleged to be, hot
And when you rock, it's just impersonations of me
The rightest MC, MP with the V in the middle

I belittle your plan, courtesy, of NY dirty see my man
My base of fans are made up of many; with kids allergic
To belts lettin' they mind melt from drinkin' the Henny
And them straight and narrow types who be waitin' to hear
Them drums say the revolution is near - are you listening?
Are your eardrums open for christening?

We got God Body MC's with these tools
While some others play God, they just God damn fools with it
I don't cuff mics, I rough mics up rough and rugged
Get the girls to love it
Still and all five-oh came to my mic check
Tellin' me I left lacerations around my mic's neck
Domestically disputed and you just might get
The undisputed underdog servin' y'all threat

Bang-oh-bang until you burn your shoe soles
Cause you are now dancing to the new soul

Live is the motion of the soul step
Set the exposure to my one step
This scene'll last to the next step
All those in favor take a big step
True to the Soul, we'll never back step
In sense to that, we don't half step
Just as a reminder from the last step
Negative ones are lost in footsteps

Levels we've set will never go down
Competitions commence the step down
Those involved with peace who know the Soul's down
Can see that the Soul has got a new sound
Dance until you find yourself a new part
If you don't then I'll give you the True part
When received you'll see the real small part
Of the new way is no part at all

De La Soul,"Greetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

Eye know Eye love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

Eye know Eye love you better

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Take my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me cause

Eye know Eye love you better

It's I again and the song that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how
Eye know Eye love you better",Eye Know,1989
De La Soul,"(Mary had a little lamb)
That's a fib, she had two twins though
And one crib
Now she's only fourteen, what a start
But this defect is ground common in these parts
Now life in this world can be such a bitch
And dreams are often torn and shattered and hard to stitch
Negative's the attitude that runs the show
When the stage is the g-h-e-t-t-o

Which is the one to blame when bullets blow
Either peter, jane, or john or joe
But joe can't shoot a gun, he's always drunk
And peter's pimping jane, and john's a punk
Infested are the halls, also the brains
Daddy's broken down from ghetto pains
Mommy's flying high, the truth is shown
The kids are all alone
Cause it's just the ghetto thang

It's just the ghetto thang (word)

Who ranks the baddest brother, the ones who rule
This title is sought by the coolest fool
Define coolest fool? easy, the one who needs
Attention in the largest span and loves to lead
Always found at the jams, but never dance
Just provoke violence due to one glance
The future plays no matter, just the present flow
When the greeting place is the g-h-e-t-t-o

Lies are pointed strong into your skull
Deep within your brain against the wall
To hide or just erase the glowing note
Of how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat
Truth from trugoy's mouth is here to scar
Those who blame the g for all bizarre
So open up your vents and record well
For this is where we stand, for the true tell
Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways
Now there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play
If ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range
Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change
Though confident they keep it kept, we know for fact
They lie like ghettos form, cause people lack
To see that they must all get out the ghetto hold
The truth they never told
Cause it's just the ghetto thang

It's just the ghetto thang (word)

Do people really wish when they blow
Out the cake candles, and if so
Is it for the sunken truth which could arise
From out the characters in which the ghetto hides
Roses in the ring supply their shown relief
Granted it's planted by their shown belief
Kill and feed off your own brother man
Has quickly been adopted as the master plan
Posses of our people has yet to provoke
Freedom or death to them, it's just a joke
What causes this defect, I don't know
Maybe it's the g-h-e-t-t-o

It's just the ghetto thang (word)

Standing in the rain is nothing felt
When problems hold more value, but never dealt
With buildings crumbling to the ground
Impact noise is solid sound
But who's the one to say this life is wrong
When ghetto life is chosen strong
We seem to be misled about our dreams
But dreams ain't what it seems
When it's just the ghetto thang

Stop, sit and study cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all

Cause this is the pitch of the year

Though you heard Dove crying 'I ain't fair'

In performing this melodic misfit

De La Soul,"I was walking on the water when I saw a crocodile
He had daisies in his hat, so I stopped him for a while
He delivered me a message, a massage to soothe my stage
What it was was more then plug-up dosage
More than DAISY age
Conversation drew a rule
Which the crowd will roar by millions
Mr. Crocodile said, 'Dove, you must look
For now the villains try to hold you underwater
But one thing we all must heed
Sony Walkmans keep us walking
De La Soul can help you breathe when you tread water'

As I walked along my journey
I thought 'What have I just learned?'
In a flash I saw commotion
There was movement in these ferns
Silently the silence came, was it the end of my world?
I shouted out in fear, 'Who's there?'
'It's me,' said Mr. Squirrel
'I've searched for you all over, now you're found
No time to waste. We must find the Preacher Man
We must find the P.A. Mase, all my population's dying
And we're all in tune to doom
Like the Daisy, I need water
I need chesnuts to consume'
'Mr. Squirrel,' I said, 'I'm sorry
But the problem can't be solved
If there's no one here to help, and no one to get involved
Always look to the positive and never drop your head
For the water will engulf us if we do not dare to tread
So let's tread water'

Now one weary day I woke, my alarm said 'Plug time's up'
Filled my bath up with the water, gargled with my gargle cup
As I bathed I felt a presence, and I'm sort of ticklish
I looked down and then around and I heard
'Hi! I'm Mr Fish. How do you do? As for me
I'm in tip-top shape today, cause my water's clean
And no-one's menu says Fresh Fish Filet
See I look past all my worries, which is something you must do
Though you're fed up, throw your head up
With this advice from me to you
And that's to tread water'

As my day went unexplained, time was finding nothing fun
As I walked along the sidewalk, I heard
'Psst, excuse me, Plug One'
From my Soul, De La that is, I hollered
'Yes, are you talking to me?'
'No alarm meant,' he said, 'Let me introduce myself
I'm Mr Monkey'
'Mr Monkey, I pledge you slap of five
Now how does your problem meet?'
He said, 'My bananas are at their ripest, but they all
Stand at three feet. My swinging hand is bandaged up
Could you help me with this chore?'
I brought him down to the Native shop
And bought him copies of the De La score
Which assisted well in his elevation
Now all bananas is at his grasp
He decided with this accomplished
He would put me on to the path
He to my to live by the Inner Sound, y'all
Which would bring me health in showbiz
Then to use them, not abuse them
And then in the words that got me to 'em

A fat funky fruit with a whole lot of tang
A little something called ""Doing Our Own Dang""
Breaking the beat others wished they broke
Bass line so dope that you just might choke
Don't bite off something that you can't chew
And don't trail behind when I'm coming through
Fronting the feel that you really can't feel
Cause you're trying to feel what's on my reel to reel

[Q-Tip]
A tree is growing
Can't you see what I see? A white blue fruit to boot
We count to ten before we pass the crews, now that's family
Equipped with the brothers and the sisters and the sisters and the brothers
And all others, with the funky flairs, the bugged-out hairs
It's the life of Riley, I'm really ready
Gazing at the dollar fill of rap
The cool June bugs, the wicks, the wacks
Praise the rhythms for what it beez
And praise the Lord for the JB's

[Posdnuos]
Isn't it cool when you cut your hair
And the blood is red instead of sellout green
This is not the music for an R&B mind
This is flower intertwined with a vine
(In other words this is rose)
You see what I mean? Or see what Grandpa Bam saw
Funk we transmit is unstable
One condition if I am able to say
(Yes you may) Well hey, let's get on with it
Vocal confetti is thrown, sometimes spitted
Out the vents of hecklers and fans
Either which way they all hop on the van
The band, the band, here comes the band
The tribe of fingers all on one hand
Me, myself, and I are dark
Monie Love the mouthpiece, it's now yours to spark

[Monie Love]
Sister Monie, the only one here who missed a plane back to London
Residing with my brothers and I learned a lot from them
About the group, how to be smooth and play funky
And sometimes rated it's kind of funky, but it's cool
For we are beyond the stereotypes
Coordination crazy, but still it sounds hype
Rocking on and off beat, and I do believe I'm right (You're right)
Am I wrong? (Yeah, son)
Don't be mad, be glad I missed the plane, I'm staying
With the Brothers Jungle, Soul, and the Tribe I'm saying
Funky funky rhymes that always stay in swing
I believe we doing our own thing

[Chorus]

[Afrika]
Well my family sets all the trends
From soul to soul, large to loose ends
And I all my groups like kill? 
(Cause that's where the money's at)
Yeah, the industry's filled with copycats
R&B mixed with sloppy raps
Tribes like us always open doors
But what for, so you can get yours?
You ain't in to it, all you want is profit
So I ask you please to stop it
Leave me alone, get off my bone
Cause I'm doing my own

A new seed, a new breed
A new man you to feed the greed
A new pair of boots for a new piece of butt
Sweet daddy are you there? (Sammy be	 is on the cut!)
Spinning back for a rap that's laid back
Read to kic back, those get no slack
I may rock a rhyme or I may start to sing
But still, I'm doing my own thing

[Dove]
In comes the mood of Jungle and Daisies
Play the same and let the vibes grace me
All hold hands and let's walk about
And form a circle and talk about
Don't follow the path that we're stepping
Truth to the soul is what I'm cramming
Reasons for this is that the family's strong
And like Bob Marley said ""We're jammin'""
Seeing is believing, so see and believe
And let the groove of the new proceed
A whole bunch of love, peace signs, and fun
So let's do what's got to be done, you know?",Doin' Our Own Dang,1989

Not the false disguise of showbiz

Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up
(Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

I won't lie, I love b-u-d-d-y (why)
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny
I seem (very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip
(Gotta gotta flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out

Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul

Answering any other service,
prerogative praised positively i'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my utility
After the battle they admit that i'm with it

When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called
Plug tunin'

Flock to the preacher called pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the plug form aroma
Then grab a daisy to sip your favorite brew
Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior,
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man chuck d said, 'what a brother know'
Dance while i play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls china and jette
The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic
From de la soul and a prince from stet

Dangerous to dance, posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid

Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick

Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative
Flow to the sway 'cause i say fa-so-la-ti
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set we get fat and we swell
Motions of the soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the soul found the motto of a naughty noise called
Plug tunin'
Vocal is local so believe that
This chant shan't rely on the strong lap
Trying and live so you best realise
That the gift that i present, i say gift wrap
Style of the tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study 'cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all
Watch while the pitcher is pitching
'cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard dove crying 'i ain't fair'
Those who think de la's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the be	-be	 'cause if you try to grieve me
You'll be hung by the wire of the plug tune

I smack a fish if you thinks
My connection ain't thick, dick
Headed like a punk whip
I travel miles with a rhythmic lip
I rock an Afro
In '83, gee, yo
And spray the sheen so I get a Soul Glow
I play the corner tough
And me and Mase pull puffs on a blunt

Givin' high-five is what I want
So I puff a blunt, I don't front
I get spliffed, get a stiff
Then I go hump a stunt
Like a pimp pro
(Nah, man, a super ho)
That's cool cause I'm still an Afro bro
Yeah, I'm live for my life is hectic
Every hour, every minute, every second
I keep a level head and stay down to earth
Cause I've been an Afro since birth

Yeah
Now I hold my crotch cause I'm top-notch
I run amok Sasquatch, and I like to eat live crab
I've got five beepers, you scab
But you can find me directly on the Ave
(You niggas cheat me, well who's that!)
My breath never smells wack
I eat the watermelon Tic-Tac
Before I kiss myself I always jump back
(Yo, gee, this track is stack)
(And you know that)

I do three flips
When a punk flip on my duke lifts
But I flex more strength when I'm asleep
On the other side with his main tapes
Make her dry her face, buy her gold earlocks
But I may, she flocks round me like a donut
She got sprinkles but I bite my way out
More brothers come about, try to scheme slick
But the Native Tongue's thick
Lick 'em real good, like a real hood should
But the fly tape let the car speakers shake
I ran a cop down, I smile a frown with a but
Show gold teeth, cause I ain't a vegetarian
Not scared of beef, sport a feather like Chief
Got a scribble pad, you can get these gonads
Cause I'm big-willed, blow off like a seal
Cause connection with the Afro is real

I be the gift of gab, but be a bro with a diss
Because it's tough to bluff a cab
No wonder Melle Mel is 'Rrrr-RAH!'
I play of tape of the son of La-di-da
My cousin Rilo sells blow, a G a day
Keeps his kids hooray, a size nine and half
I kicks my tricks, is to live for Island
I mug a mug vic, but I's cool, I self
With the quickness I bust the true slang
Show no pit to those who don't understand

The Maseo got tailed with the big bail
I busted loose but now the blue goose is on my tail
I seen the ghetto go lower than it is
(He don't care, cause his nigga's selling crack to the kids)
My jeans are brand new, with twelve more
In the closet with my silk, and below
My 45 pack thick, draw quick
If a nigga starts some shibidibidit
My crib is uptown, downtown, L.I
And another crib in Queens
I munch some cornbread, Boar's Head
My favorite pork chops and
A plate of collar greens
I chill with Shymel, Akeem, Jaheed
And the Rastafarians'll be the crown in
And the Poppa
But the connections are still a high-five

'Cause I had a pair of blue jeans on

Ripped uniform and bottom bell

Thought about his mama
Thought about his father Josephine
Nobody could help the boy when he hit the concrete
Ooh-aww-oh
The last words said by Johnny
But now he's six feet under and he's dead

De La Soul,"Jody got a cat but she won't let it out
Oh tough luck, cause it makes Jack pout
Waiting on the wins he moves to the next
Searching for the cheese, looking for the text
In the Big Blue in search of the skins
Grinning and laughing, laughing and grinning
Padlock Jody got the whole scene played
No knockin' boots till she's 14K'd
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
Cause now in the hood he's

Till one ring came, Jody blew a spark
Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practicing the range, bellowing the blues
Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
""Yo, Jody, yo, gotta go, got a date""
Padlock Jody's screaming ""Wait, wait, wait!""
""Don't worry, hon,"" he replies, ""I'm keepin' the faith""

I'll never do the baseball with you again
Yo, I'll never do the baseball with you
Cause your hoochie-coo was so smooth
Was it such a sin to let, let me in?
Hooked by your ever-so-shyness
Want that bush, heard you're from Flatbush
Ran after ya, caught ya
Brought ya to Long Island, stylin' for a while
In my hut, I was on a cut for a peck
A silly Greg Peck
You tried to play me new, Plug One you disconnect
I'd try to touch your hair (You would say no)
Yo, I'd try to touch your hair (You would say no)
Is is cause you want my financial flaunt?
First you gotta please me, nice and easy
But I guess you want that in reverse
So I stand Plug First can see
We got a serious block
Turn the other way, ooh what do I spot?

(You're banned, honey dip, you're banned)
(You're banned)
Yo, you're banned
Ya banned by the preacher man
You played yourself a stew
Now to me you step, never mind love
The faith is being kept

Now remember 'bout Padlock Jody, here's the fact
Jack little wick but she was acting wack
Jack wanna lay but laying ain't exact
For the past four or five she was banned by the pack
Hip to the witness, putting on a plan
No money, no more Puddy Tat for the man
Jack knows that honey means playing a game
Only wanna bowl, got nabbed for the fame
Claude Van Damme (God damn)
Sam was the man that you planned to command
Nothing new about a neighborhood
You know what? Padlock Jody wanna cut
Jack's thinking cap, make mine into a pack

De La Soul,"This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie
Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly
Around this time the slammin' joint was “Milk is Chillin'”
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game

Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?
You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool
Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school
He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey
He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's
Child, ya got the best of pops anyone could have
Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad

Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon
But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain
While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom
And he would toss and then would force her to give him head room
Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen
But when she'd fuss, he would just commence to slappin'
(Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's
The deal?)
I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal
Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him
And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em
And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'
How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him
When I got home, I found she had tried to call me
My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry)
I tried to call the honey but her line was busy
I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon

I received a call from Misses Sick herself
I asked her how was she recoverin' her health
She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute
She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot""
She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile
Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol
That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one
She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one
Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates
Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits
There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip
He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip
You're just mad he's your overseer at school
No need to play him out like he's someone cruel
She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else
Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self

Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses
And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes
Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother
He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother
As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie
I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?""
I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'
She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!”
None of the kids could understand what was the cause
All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus
Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to
Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to
Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over",Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa,1991

But let the herd know if beef they wanna throw
Lunches of punches is what I bestow
Oodles of O's it has my hoes in mic checks
O's take the shape of medallions and specs
Don't forget the O's that let the air in my nose

Eat the Al Greens, won't sniff the Kurt Blows

Hoods like to play macho, you know
Guns going ""Bo!"", people hit the floor
Don't have a piece but an arrow and bow
Target it firm cause I'm head Comancho
Charging barricades like a raging rhino
The donuts come big and some in jumbo
The landlord is finished but before I go
I'll give a shout out to Quest and my fellow Jungle Bros

Knocked by the dock of the bay by the shore
Swimming in the rhythm of the hi-de-hi-de-ho

So loose, so loose, so loose with the tap dance
The funk, the funk, funky funky stuff I bring
My tribe, my tribe, my tribe is known as Native Tongues
Consists, consists, consists of Jungle, Quest and others
Get played, get played, played a lot on radio
And also, and also, and also by some foul brothers
The Pease, the Pease the Pease Porridge never failed
It kept, it kept us calm, our stylin' merry
But late, but lately loonies acting real bold
Can't sip in luxury my apple cranberry
Girls watch, and watch, and watch I dance the big tut
Our home, our home our homeboys has to plan tricks
Don't real, don't real, don't realise the Native Tongue
Is rollin' strong and we're startin' in the megamix

Question, and that's if only I can ask this question
Can I? (Yes you can!)
Why do people think just because we speak peace
We can't blow no joints?

Mase, this is the ninth day I've reheated this porridge. You know it
Keeps me peacefully, no?

Yeah, but my tolerance level has now peaked
And now it's time for some heads to get flown

We bring, we bring, we bring, we bring the peace of course
But pack a nine inside, inside my De La drawers
A picture, picture, picture, picture painted pink
Could turn to red, to red, to red in blooded quick
But in a single file my Native Tongue is calm
I'd rather, rather pass a brother a pound or palm
I kick, I kick, I kick a verse of unity
And shack, and shackle steps to the beat, beat
I click, I click the TV to the Simpsons
And sip the Porridge deep into my system
So mel, so mellow mode is my day mode
Inside the studio or on a road
The Shwing, the Shwingalo is the now step
It's murder if you bet cause you're life's jep
To praise, to praise the Soul is on a down drag
It's false, because I'll spray you with the Black Flag

Hey D, hey D, hey DJ set the record up
It's time, it's time, it's time to tame the naughty pups
Throw on the Touching Fingers serenade
So we can throw our lemonade
In their face and kick their little butts

People wanna get ragged with the reruns
Me not, me not, me not scared to trudge a bit
They can't, they can't, they can't get close to none
I tap, I tap, I tap a dance war skit
The por, the por, the Porridge got crazy cold
We won't, we won't eat until the heads are flown
Take advantage to a cool one's peaceful ways
But when, but when we fly that head all the people say

Here in Frogland, we always eat our Porridge, cause it keeps us frogs
Real peaceful like

Come on everybody, wear your rollerskates today
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday-ay
(Is the word, is the word, is the word)

Now as you pump your fist I reminisce
To a bounce, rock, skate, roll
Fess to impress
Hey, pretty diamond, do you like the way I'm dressed
Cool, keep the faith and be my mate
Cause all we need is feet
(And rollerskates)
But promote the hustle cause it keeps me thin
No need to talk, look who just walked in

(Is there a Dred on skates?)
Yes, man
(So kick the wham on this jam)
Oh Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold back up the track, grab your rollerskates y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
Sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' quick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, spinning and winning
No hackeysack, let let me in
Spill on the bottom away, but it's okay, huh
It's a Saturday

Now let's all get baked like Anita

Watch Mr. Lawnge, don't look at the peter

Feel on the fun, I'll feel on the

Hey, watch that!

It's a Saturday

Now is the time
To act the fool tonight
Forget about your worries and you will be all right
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Dis to the hit list, pitched by the hit
Caught by the herds of those in the pit

Just because I'm fallin', saved by the weed
With dred, cause you know indeed I'm shwinging it

Try with the games cause the fools'll take shape
Stuff to the too tough, grave is in the groove
Sop it like Sound, yo honey make a move
Shufflin' your feet, that's stiffer than a nap
Open up an eardrum, don't wait for the cap
Sip a third of lager, extract the waste
Tell me tell me tell me, can you get a case?
Never oops honey, dope not a threat
Peace be found on your color telly set

Talkin' bout Hey Love
Wanna be your push and shove

Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love
Discover all the football teams
Mack and eat jelly beans
Run in the cold with no jeans
Get yourself sick till we're seen
Catch the flu and make tea
How Dan Stuckie life will be
It's all about you and me

Talk about what?
Don't play stupid with me, you know what we gotta talk about
What?
About you becoming fully dedicated
So we're about to go through these line-runs again, huh?
You're damn right. I wanna know whatever you do for me has
Anything to do with love
Look, I come all the way from L.I. to the Bronx to see you, isn't
That showing you love?
You see that's just it Pos, I don't wanna be just your Bronx
Love, I wanna be your Hey Love
You wanna be my what?
I said I wanna be your Hey Love. I mean it's just not the mood
Being one of the many girls on your
List, and you wouldn't be dissing me like this if I was your Hey Love
Look, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose
Yeah but you even give better treatment to that girl named
Selina from uptown like a Daisy. You even
Gave her some of your special donuts for free
So this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts
No, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about Hey Love
I don't understand why you're dissing me, it's not like I'm Paul
I don't have two kids in every state
But you probably got two girls in every state, if you're not

I'm looking forward to going and just beating

What a fucking great job I have!

I wonder why I feel so good. Could it be the music?
Could it be my breakfast? Or could it just be the fact that
I just hate everybody, dammit!
Life is grand, life is great, I'll get myself a real cheap date
Some woman I can take to McDonalds, spend a dollar twenty-five on

Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo""
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape""
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask
""Was it def?""
And with the straighest face I be like, ""Hell yes""
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call

Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes bi-da miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here bi-da miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny
Jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me Myself and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
""Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like ""Oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer
Who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone
She'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak""
So no problemo, just play the demo
And at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind
Cause I'll just lay it down the line

Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number

Just another area 
For me to patrol 

Just another area 
That shows I got soul 

Just another area 
For me to patrol 

Just another area 
That shows I got soul 

I got soul you see  
I'm swimming in the De La 
I'm in my hood man  
My manhood worries ya 

I'm known for sampling of soul food 
Off the old school plates 
When I met up with my niggas from the 718 
One the Jungle Bro, the other Questers from Queens 
Yet I had the matrix of the 516 in my jeans 
So I sided with my funk to bring my second on call 
For me and the Sheep, our mission's on the beach of 804 
(You're runnin' on an empty tank) 
But still get paid in full 
(And get the girls) 
Man, I'm packing gravitational pull 
Bring the instamatic avalanche, my code intervenes 
I'm out to scout the areas that remains to be seen 
(What?) 

Well, many many digits had me seeking in my Wizard 
Man, who's ringing up my area  oh! 
I used to shoe it to the bridge but that's gone 
Like the 718's out of Vietnam 
Sniffin' skypagers had me drugged 
(Man I knew a psycho) 
703's on my love bug 
I made mates with the brothers up in 215 
Crazy Buddhas in my mind 
My Chattanooga champ had me late for the camp 
And my 202 keeps me marvelous 
I guess Mars was my hideaway 
But if the stars for a getaway

Since I'm capable I conjure up a walk in this way 
I slip a syllable for Aspen and a Chester souffle 
I be the 919 seeker, 'cause ain't off logic 
So when I'm with my crew I always have a place to sit 
Due to this, a brother tries to play me 
(Yeah, like one in 514) 
Yo, some kid tried to flip on me 
They instigated a brawl 
(So we set our knuckles on stun and made them all fall) 
Then I just laughed 
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha) 

(We whooped that ass) 
And put the feelings aside, I know who I am 
I cast the grain by the pound 
I make sounds with the horn 
When I color the corn, caught the fit 
And sit the two when honey slung the tip 
Well I'm taking my finds to the 301's 
And I'm playing my flute in the rear kibbut 
My man from the 908's, he don't like it like that 
So I pipes till the sunshine hikes 
A kettle of our master plan makes a Malibu idol 
(God forgive me) Well, it's a hook 
The third to the 0 to the 5 had top feel the vibe 
When the 516 played convicts 

The man Maseo is here to put the habit along 
And what you have, I'm 'bout to speak about your area code 
Is it 918? (No) 
Is it 212? (No) 
Speakin' on 404? (Hell no) 
What about 516? (I dunno) 
What is it? (Not tellin' ya) 
What is it? (Not tellin' ya) 
What is it? (Not tellin' ya) 
What is it? (Not tellin' ya) 
(Huh? What?) 

Just another area for me to patrol 
I got status 'cause I'm baddest with the paint 
Giving upside down frowns to London wood 703 
Her moms didn't like it, I had to let be 
For the fact I lays bricks 
'Cause my semen ends with the letter T 
My seed is hard to submerge 
I play the tack in the wall if my rear's not watched 
'Cause some knuckle might just head for the urge 
But I got Prince Paul in the Area 
(Oh, it's like that now) 
I got Hot Dog in the Area 

(Eh eh eh) 

I got the Violators in the area (Ah) 
I's got the Violators in the area (Ah) 
It don't matter where you hide, I clear up the fall 
Cop the fuck outta here, you fake-ass fraud 
Clear my area

And how I relate, the same side of my gates

And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eyescan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew up with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz/fuzz
A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special

I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
(Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin up the stream

I can't cook, but being a cook I'm servin' much to eat
I got multiple stabs of jazzy
Sassafrassy as I caught the fame of soul
Years after mama had me tell ya gladly
I plugged for the tunin'
Which cause eyes to zoom in

Which put your person into focus

No longer kelvin mercer but the posdnuos
Plug one yo I found fun
In the scribblin' of speak
On a naked white sheet
Most recognized by my dark brown self

Yo you found some wealth?

More in my mind than in my pocket
But I's got every girbaud that ever sagged
I met some hoes, met some girls
Did a tour that took me all around the world

Did a tour that took me all around the world

I hit the shines but I'm shooin' it now
Remember when the floor might have had a spine
Well it's all bent over
The dayglo nigga gets the red door mat
It's a roller coaster
When your shit's burnt toast
Now Mr. club owner knows your jam
When your jam is tha jam
And there's a tab at the bar
My mindstate's great
No thanks I don't drink
I sip the bobo
Then I kettle it quick
I felt the heave in the jeave
Tap it in the basement
Diggin' my own understanding quick
Let me get the single out
Think mr. radio say the starlight
Is the same star bright
I'm thinkin' how a nine and a blunt is a switch
But turn out the lights and some will go bitch
It was one mc after one mc
Play the lamp post do the blow wit dynomite
Well it's okay and it's alright
Cause our birthday cake's external light
It'll all get graphic
People made of plastic
Look at the shine wit my 50 watt eye
But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch
I fame it to a name from denver up to maine
And lovin' deluxe

Funny funny how time flies
When you have some light on the face
Cause the focus is the fickle
'stead of fusin' I'm a use it
To the utilize the trickle caught the rush
But I play hush
While andres titus is the grabbin'
As a fan will put the hearts to mush
Lush dalea would hear the public beat
The same way for titus when he blacked the sheep
But as the knee went deep
To deeper off the charts
The album faded to black
That's when the amnesia starts

""Ain't you?"" yeah I is 'im
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog
Caught the light being true dog
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen
In the scene or in between
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight

Man I got beats up my sleeve like you wouldn't BELIEVE! 
Whatcha mean BizMarkie? Whatcha mean BizMark? 

Ah with my ""ah one two"" I substitute about a loop 
So let me serve with the slope, with the Plug of two scoops! 

Mr. Miyag' never did dip for Dove 
Bootleggers my legs and, grit about a hug 
And who gets the Motts, I knots by the chance 
I rain-dance I rain-dance 
But steppin just a bit I don't need another shadow 
Makes makes, is gonna be the new man's motto 
Don't increase the bull, because my pulley is broken 
And my belly is full 
It's a second I reckon on the bone and the ball 
Makin London bridges fall, so check it 
I bring a point to the joints that we change and chop 
But we could bring it back to the beatbox!

Serenade her cause I gotta record 
When in the womb I was naked now I 
Chill with latex cause of how I, enter 
The black wood without a splinter, provin 
I had the chills what helps in movin, asses 
Saw the light cause I got glasses, so we 
Sip the cappuccino slowly 

I'sah makes the big money! 
I drive big 

Cars, serve the bubble like a bar tender 
When in flight like a sender, lace 
Sticks of dynamite on bass, head 

Lace the shoe until he dead 

Run! Cause the cop is gonna come 
This my Plug style 

So they can kiss my, grits 
Hold my balls without a mitt grab 
The mouthpiece to talk the dag nabit 
I keeps goin like that rabbit, ricochet a dame I need a Snicker, 
Satisfy the Norman to the Gladys, Knight 
My glasses help me see the light, so we 
Sip the cappuccino slow 

In life, it's what you see is usually whatcha 
Get, won't take a Drag-without-a-Net, no 
To put the rhythm in the, bone 
Marrow, laid the pipe to please Cari-lou 
I don't know! 
If it's true
That's a fumble
Well catch a fever from the jungle
Chocolate, nubian girls flock to it, sweets 
And if I can't sample beats, get the 
Beatbox equipped with the, dirt 
BizMark and Doug E. works, fine 
Mase work the wheel I tangle lines, hark
The light is thirsty in the dark 
So we 

It's like I saw it in the river but my M wasn't fixed 
Super heavy like a Chevy pump a Maseo mix 
I had some screams in my pockets, and played it kinda hush 
And did the outs (got to check out, the avenue) 
I peeped the Zoah on the gimme gimme, plus we hit the plat' 
Then the amps was on samp's, the villains got fat 
The Natives weren't the neighbor then to, nigga please
It's a hustle for a joint when your settlement G's 
But we still be on the wax because it acts like that 
We still be on the moves because it moves like that 
So there ain't no reason to don't stop 
'Cause we can bring it back to the beatbox!

Product of a North Carolina cat 
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie 
Who departed life just a little too soon 

And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame 
As we go a little somethin' like this 
Look ma, no protection 
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay 

And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough 
So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay 
I am an early bird but the feathers are black 
So the apples that I catch are usually all worms 

But it's a must to decipher one's queen 
From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ 
I cherish the twilight 
I maximize, my soul is the right size 

I watch for the power to run out on the moon 
(And that'll be sometime soon) 
Faker than a fist of kids 
Speakin' that they're black 

When they're just niggas trying to be Greek 
Or some tongues who lied 
And said ""We'll be natives to the end"" 
Nowadays we don't even speak 

I guess we got our own life to live 
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? 
Every now and then I step to the now 
For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool 

Now I won't apologize for it 
This is not a bunch of Bradys 
But a bunch of black man's pride 
Yet I can safely say 

I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside 
I've always walked the right side of the road 
If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs 
But a man with a plan 

And if I was a rug cleaner 
Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am.  
The Plug Two brand with the flavour 
In the flute watch the sniffin' 

So a sack of shows in demand 
I read the diction from the second page 
I got the one-two gauge 
Baritone to the izm fan 

Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink 
So let me need ya to my ems go 
I push the infinite and carry it 
My carrier's the three over one 

So my pluggins already know 
Lick shots with moo 
Catch the boo 
From a ghost in the heckling crowd 

If I give a foot 
Jack Ville caught a spill 
When a still came from my mouth 
I brought a head down south 

I don't check for the noose and the neck 
So I never tell my ems 
That finesse is knocking at my door 
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun 

And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore 
I bring the element H with the 2 
So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade 
It's just mind over matter 

And what matters is 
That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade 
I keep the walking on the right side 
But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong 

'Cause that's how he wants to be 
No difference, see

Are seeds that are no longer planted

Gonna (gonna) take my time (my time)

Trying not to boogie with the devil take my lessons just to keep my dance

Self expression makes it health for self aiight [x3]

They playin' themselves!

You remind me when I reminisce of you (yeah)
All the freaky things I want to do, to you (that's right)
Rub me up, rub me down, rub me all around (what)
Kiss me here, kiss me there, kiss me, kiss me everywhere!
Tell me what the cost to get in line 'cause you are mine tonight
Gonna give you all I got to give, as long as you rub it right

Now I forgot how to forget so I remember your face
With your pretty accent, wearin' man-attract scent
Others fakin' constantly stakin' out pockets of dreams
Always tryin' to sham too that's why they crave champagne
But the blame still remains not to be on you
I know your style and your love lasts Long like the Island I'm from
I'm on the drum man, and it's all good
Cause I flexed on your ex, make sure he understood
That you would, never again want to be his wife
So we connect lips to hips, and uh, eyes to thighs
You're my so-phisti-cated, lady
All mine, if you wasn't I'd go crazay

Baby baby won't you be my baby baby yeah baby, this is uh
Baby baby be my baby baby baby baby Posda on the microphone
WRMS rocks the best hey hey hey it's the fat man
Scoop Wonder ear in your hand
That was JFB, baby baby baby oh bay-bah!

Mummy I saw one day
She was on some fume vapors
Givin' me lip so I continued with the caper
Cat litter had me sniffin
Since outside the palace
Eyes sicker than aids
Game harder than a callous
Tried to enter in her shit
She had locks on the session
Tellin me how her last man
Taught her ass a lesson damn
Well, I'm not the mayor
I take care of my dimes
But I excluded I had nickels
Addin' up to her kind
Short stacks with a wristful of jewels

Sayin she didn't need a man
To make her out for a fool
Dig it, miss, my love is credited in cupid account
And if you need that extra help
Gigglin, figurin' I had jokes for her humor
Then she broke out with the words
About knowin all the rumors
""See, all you niggas rappin be like pedigree dogs
Thinkin you can have me leashed
Around your microphone cords""
Somethin 'bout her lit me up like july
And with them onions in the pants
I couldn't help but cry
Seemed lost in the essence
But i had to find my way to take
Action for the digits just to set up a date
Thought my shinin was on
I had the skirts in the bag
Until i took a bit of time
To peep the price on the tag
She said ""I'm that salt and pepa
Who like pushin it to sisters
You need to get to walkin with it mister
I think you betta listen""

[Listen all you fellas, here's what good love is]
[Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands]
[Listen all you fellas, then you won't have to worry no no more]

We was at some outside jam one saturday night
When this pretty ass girl got locked in my sight
She was a ghetto philosopher
Yeah you know the type
Thinkin' Mary J. and sade understood her strife
Caught me lookin', ""Yo what's cookin?""
""Nothin' from around here
So don't approach or hope
To be the man of the year""
I said listen deer or rabbit or whatever the hell you be
I'm not the one to embarrass
But the one to emcee
I traveled the world q uarters on my relationships
Used and abused by hoes
So my royalty stubs
But above all
I brought my daughter into this earth
So I understand the need
Of women feeling of worth
She glanced deep in my eyes
And said ""oh shit, you're ill
I like the way your mind
Moves around at will
Still, let me apologize for soundin so sassy
But you niggas act as if my ass
Has a sign that says harass me""
Her name was gail from the union of dale
I made her remove the shades
So her eyes could tell me the plan
Yo where's your man?
""Oh that nigga's past tense
Painted bruises on my face
Haven't seen him ever since""
Gave a pinch to my bottom
And started rubbing my back
She said ""i bet your ass is darker
Than a mobb deep track""
Only one way to know it
And i was down to show it
So we jetted back to my crib to set it
She made it known
""I've owned thoughts of you
Since that song 'meeny-meeny'
Can't believe you're about
To be all up in between me""
Man, the flag was lowered
So my wood was raised
Followed a shielding of my building
To protect me from the blaze
This granted access to
Southern parts of her borders
Did you have her comin'?
Like the new world order
I caught her with the right combination
A good combination
Keepin' it in her hard, man
You betta listen

Now this goes out to all area clicks
Centralized and way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the de la/de la/native tongue
In the mix
Just like log cabin syrup my sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area clicks
From manicured lawns to projects bricks/bricks/from 718 to the 51-6
Remember to keep the mos def/native tongue
In the mix
Straight butter hits, drop as a good as it gets/gets/straight butter hits

Now, come on y'all, get live get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So don't none of y'all just be misled
The de la's gonna do the body good like wheat bread

Shakin laces out of shoes, mos def bought the brews
Sittin indian squats to make that red tie knots
See I'm out to get the core like in them rainbow pops
Swingin life like a hammock, invested like stocks

Via sinus complex, I aims to clog it up
Snappin by the pain as a crew hear the gain
We remain on your mind like skulls, not a golem
I'ma show it in the house all perimeters are blown

Native tongue come through to make you say yes yes
This is the body mos def style fresh like baby breath

We are the killer combination with the size to administer
The beatdown to swell up all three of your eyes

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop

I don't bug out I chill, don't be actin ill
No trick in ninety-six, native tongue gon build
But we be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
'Cause to me, mc mean, make it clean
When I speak on groups and I'm smooth like gabba d
Tryin to hang out with dove and catch love in aberdine (word up)
I bag dimes like my man born on august 17
Life be nuttin but a river son I'm swimmin upstream

Playin wait up, with the data servin your ears
With information due to confirmation of the nation's most
Wicked ways of livin, like them glassy eyed beans
Inhale to smoke the fiends, while bangin a table
Rated at the high point of the mass
Rippin mc's at the top of a class, occasionally
Rippin some sucker's face
Or some suckable ass from a girl
It's a big brother beat for the wide wide world

I'm makin memos off these demos back in eighty-nine
Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind (right)
Did the hustle with a couple of us, but soon noted
That my niggaz buttered benedict rolls, and then voted
I wrote in the dark so I could feel it like braille (uh-huh)
Heard the big brother beat, got locked with no bail
Came to set like equators invented, with the heat
Yo mos def how you radiate to make it complete

Right, so when I shine the light crabs wince
Manifestin for the future here in the present tense
No doubt, I love the sound biggin out off your jeeps
Son I want the little kids bangin big brother beats

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop 

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop 

We straight butter hits, we straight butter hits
Perfecta, perfecta
Perfecta, perfecta
Perfecta, perfecta
