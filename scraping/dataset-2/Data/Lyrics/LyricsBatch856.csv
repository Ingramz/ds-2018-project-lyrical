Pleasure P,"I ain't got a lot
Sooo don't even trip
I'm supa dupa fly
You know that I'm the shit
T-twenty on the dash
Got forty on my hip
Throw up a bunch of cash
Make that record do the spins
They say hello hello hello aloha
Cause they know I'm the shit
They say hello hello hello aloha
Aloha
Cause I'm so fly

I'm supa dupa fly
You can call my missy's boo
Pull up in the SLR
Have all the mammals sick of you
All them college credits
You can throw them things away
You ain't gonna be needin' a job
You fuckin' with Jose
Hey hello hello aloha
I go hard
I'm so fly
We so hot
They so not
Them other niggas is lame
Seened you on the sidelines time to put you in the game
Coca be the name
Parties up in Diddys house
Push them through the door say show em what the city about
Touch a couple blocks got the dough and skate off
And just like Bernie me and my baby made-off
Hello

I ain't got a lot
Sooo don't even trip
I'm supa dupa fly
You know that I'm the shit
T-twenty on the dash
Got forty on my hip
Throw up a bunch of cash
Make that record do the spins
They say hello hello hello aloha
Cause they know I'm the shit
They say hello hello hello aloha
Aloha
Cause I'm so fly

Try to play me short
And imma have to fade it quick
Fresh up off the porch on that kool aid and them tater chips
Don't fool with lames 'cause they be on that hata ish
If you gotta problem wit me go ahead say that shish
I'm scuba divin' in Jamaica trick
Put the mic down I'm on now don't needa bake a shish
Or you can find me on the charts
Or up in St. Broads racin' European cars
Speedin' pass the law hit my baby mama raw
And she my baby mama 'cause them other chickens flaw
Ooh now baby gurl I'm watcha call
A supa dupa pimp there's pimpin' when I'm involved hello

I ain't got a lot
Sooo don't even trip
I'm supa dupa fly
You know that I'm the shit
T-twenty on the dash
Got forty on my hip
Throw up a bunch of cash
Make that record do the spins
They say hello hello hello aloha
Cause they know I'm the shit
They say hello hello hello aloha
Aloha
Cause I'm so fly

Now tell me why these hatas wanna see the end of joe
Honestly I'm runnin' outta ways to spend my dough
I'm burnin' down the stores
I'm such a shopaholic
What you know it ain't trickin 'if you really got it
Louis scarfs, Louis frames, Louis chucks
Louis boxers, got all the Louis she wants yeeeahhh
And you ain't got nothin' for us
Millions from tourin' and the crib ain't gotta mortgage
Yes I'm the rain man
Must I remind you
Throw it in the air
Watch her spread it like the swine flu
Haha they say joey on some other shit
And if that bitch start actin' up
I go and grab my other bitch

I ain't got a lot
Sooo don't even trip
I'm supa dupa fly
You know that I'm the shit

I think he was the one
There's no many of his kind
Danger pictures darkside pictures
Bad behaviors and a vision of the future

Clockwork orange, Alex devil's eyes
Horns and halos, nocturnal flies
Surrounded by voyeurs and crack smoking lawyers
Nasty ah ah Stanley fueled by the drama
And he will never be erased of the memories
His virtuosity launches me
He will always stay in my mind territory
Nasty ah ah Stanley bring it out the drama

[Refrain]

Eyes wide shot

How many guys copy ideas of his work
Psycho movies, palsy, ballsy
He'll stay on my mind for a long time
Crazy ah ah Stanley fueled by drama

But behind closed doors she a nasty girl, behind closed doors she a nasty girl.

I met this girl named Keysha, she was so sweet
Nails stay manicured, pretty little feet
Shoes so sexy, body so hot
Hair lookin' like she just came from the shop
Legs so smooth, clothes so tight
Style so sexy, make her just right
Never too much, never too little
Black laced bra, Vicki secrets in the middle
Eyes so innocent, smile so bright
Works in the mornin, but she'll party all night
All for a man, all 'cause she bought it
All 'cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it
Product of her birth place, know about the streets
Clean in the work place, dirty in the sheets 
Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed

Had to sneak her outta choir for her to put it on me

One thing about her she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin' laundry
Favorite toy of mine is my lil bunny
Bow legged and glasses, such a real woman
Sex all night, go to work every mornin'
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her me too mommy
When you get off work daddy gon' punish
You're my nasty girl forever I promise

And nothin' underneath so its an all night deal
I'm a number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her Vitamin D
But wait, I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
She said she needs some evidence and to show her the proof
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth
Cause I'm hung like a jury

I pointed at the donk and told her this supposed to be yours
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga and she went for it
First time I [called ?] her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil bustie baby cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whenever I wanna get off she know how to get me right

Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl

Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bo-legged and bend the [corner ?]
She proud to be fuckin me, cause I'm stuntin on `em
It feel good to be fuckin a real nigga don't`uh
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin her off, cause she aint with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat [her under ?]
[?] snatchin [?], I'm tellin ya, I promise
I exposed her to real, and now she hate lame

My nigga e'erytime I think this shit gettin' rough out here
for me my nigga...I just remind myself dog Monday through
Friday homie...From eight in the mornin' to five in the evenin'
dog...It's some niggas in the court room 'round the country
my nigga...Fightin' for they muhfuckin' lives dog...The
crackers bannin' niggas e'eryday my nigga

My dog went to court today they gave him fifteen
Cracker banned my lil' nigga he was se'enteen
Young nigga don't even know what all that time mean
Pussy ass crackers done shattered my nigga dreams
They holl'in' mandatory they want him to do the whole thang
Nigga showed up in court on my dog and did his thang
Nigga did my nigga now I got to bust his brain
Nigga woulda did me my dog'd do the same
His lady callin' me cryin' and now I feel her pain
Tired of losin' all my niggas to the chain gang
In thirty minutes a nigga whole life can change
Cracker over sinister niggas when this shit gon' change?

[Chorus:]
Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real
Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel
Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real
Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel

Ain't talked to my dog yet but I know he sick
Next fifteen years of his life behind a fence
Cracker find a nigga guilty and hit him wit' the bench
Gave one of my dogs twenty-seven on his first offense
The time they givin' the nigga for the crime ain't makin' sense
They jacked the number up now it's eighty-five percent
They did that to make you fuck niggas out there snitch
And put conspiracy in the game to railroad the click
And crackers feel like niggas ain't got no common sense
A nigga paper ain't right they banned off the rip
A public defender don't get you shit but a long trip
And judge sentencin innocent niggas without a guilt

[Chorus]

How in the fuck can fo' birds get you a life sentence?
But give a cracker seven years for money launderin' millions
Shoot a nigga in the leg they sentence you like you killed 'em
Cracker catch you wit' that iron and throw you under the buildin'
You a nigga that mean you guilty 'til proven innocent
Money talk and bullshit walk a thousand miles
You ain't got a paid lawyer then don't go to trial
Crackers owe each other favors, they'll swap ya out
""You give us him, we'll give you him"" know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Nigga took thirty years on a cop out
Fuck you get thirty years for breakin' in a bitch house?
Crackers playin' a dirty game boy this shit wild

Plies,"[Chorus:]
Damn my P.O. I ain't gon' stop grindin'
Violate me if ya want gon' have to come find me
Lookin' for me in the streets I'm somewhere shinin'
Live every goddamn day like it's Friday
Damn my P.O. I ain't gon' stop grindin'
Violate me if ya want gon' have to come find me
Lookin' for me in the streets I'm somewhere shinin'
Live every goddamn day like it's Friday

Tell the feds if they comin' they better come now
They got my chips straight now I'm ready to retire
I ball 'til I fall homie thug 'til I die
And if I died today I know I'll probably fry
But if I hit the right lick I can live nice
Think I'm scared to go get it you goddamn lie
My money go to lookin' funny I'm gettin' on seventy-five
Non-stop homie straight to the Cuban's island
I like to get money, fuck hoes, and rock ice
Give a damn who don't like it, it's my life
That's why I drank e'eryday dog and stay high
Catch me in the strip club lettin' money fly
And goin' broke the only thing that can make me cry
I told my P.O. she can't change me don't even try
The street life got me gone I don't know why
Tryna at least see a couple mill' 'fore I die

[Chorus]

Before I went to sleep I prayed for a hundred squares
Told God he'll bless me if He really cared
Know you fuck niggas prayin' for me to get killed
Know you crackers wish you could give me a hundred years
That's why I ball and stunt for the niggas in jail
Cracker gon' have to kill me 'fore they put me in a cell
Nigga told me to turn myself in I told him ""go to Hell""
Cause if they want me they better do they job and that's real
Worst thang they can do is hold me with no bail
Until that shit happen been done ran across a whole mill'
I thug it out 'til the end homie that's how it is
Life too motherfuckin' short for me to sit still
I can't leave these streets nigga they pay my bills
I gotta be dead in prison nigga for me to chill
I asked a trick the other day why he pop pills
He told me I'll pop 'em too if I knew how it feel

[Chorus]

I wake up e'ery mornin' lookin' for a money bag
When a nigga died and he was broke then he died sad
If I was on my dick you niggas'll be glad
Squeeze eights on the donk just to make you mad
Long as my heart still beatin' nigga I'mma get cash
Live every motherfuckin' day like it's my last
Indictment money in my pocket and 'Gnac in my system
Need every muthafuckin' day like Christmas
Heared the crackers downtown givin' out big numbers
I know some muthafuckin' haitians givin' out triple.

Check my track record homie all I beat is stallions
I done smashed already shit you can have her
If you want her better catch her better gon' snatch her
Want straight animals over here, no hackers
Better put the cuffs on her 'fore the goons pack her

My money looking funny nigga just making it barely shit ain't how it use to be nigga ain't
Fronting the package gotta choke me a bitch outta something I gotta have it I'm on my
Dick dawg gotta make something happen

When a nigga money fucked up it's hard for him to think straight
Seem like a nigga life in park when he ain't got cake
First thing that cross a bitch mind shit he gotta take
You can stay broke forever or you can make a shape
Cause when you broke bitch talk to you any kinda way
You on ya dick bitch don't wanna here shit you gotta say
If you ain't built for this street shit den get out the way
Cause when a nigga broke everybody's fucking gravy
You either get money out here or you fucking hate
You think a nigga gone give you something den keep waiting
You betta suck up yo muthafucking pride and chase it
Cause when a nigga broke he ain't pose to have patients

[Chorus]

I don't know if God trying to punish me or my luck just bad
I don't know which one of 'em it is but I need some fucking cash
I rather be in prison broke then out here without a stash
They say when it rains it pours then how will it last
Before I let it rain on me I'm a let a bitch crash
With all black on chie five and ski mask
The streets judge off what you got not what you had
I took a lost and it hurt me fucked me up bad
It ain't no feeling in the world like loosing ya last
I ain't got no choice I'm fucked up gotta bounce back
Seems like it take forever to get to get it but you can loose it fast
I rather a muthafucka visit me while sitting behind a glass

[Chorus]

The nigga that invented robbing I bet he was broke
Cause when you fucked up out her it ain't no fucking joke
And all bets off when a nigga money low
A nigga willing to take chances he ain't neva took before
And willing to cross a muthafucka for the love of the dough
I can't fault nigga cause I done did that shit before
If you gone take it just be ready to play it how it go
It's every nigga for self this shit cut throat
I bet I past me a nigga for he past me tho
For every nigga balling it's a hundred niggas hunting
I don't know if he told but these yung niggas thuggin
So why you outta balling it's some niggas riding lucky

You play stupid and give me away if you want to
You say fuck it, it's over then I guess we threw
I know if I caught you cheatin I probably cut you loose
Don't get it fucked up ain't tryna tell you what to do
Whatever decision you make I got to live with it
Whatever yo answer is jus make sure you can deal with it
But if we do break up I'm a keep tryna get it

Cuss me out and let's fuck bay and gone kill it

Plies,"Ey, I'd like to welcome all you motherfuckers man
To the home of the goons,where the grave yards over crowded
And where chopperz is a must

You caught slippin' crackers goin' find your ass, not breathing
100 wholes in your ass with your body leaking
Nigga ridin' with 'em drums, nigga for a reason
'Cause down here we in the middle of murking season

Stay on your porch nigga if you ain't ready to make a shake
'Cause this the home of the bodies, check the murder rate
Money and ski's is the only, that'll be the murder case
So you better kill him if you don't want him at your court date

If you comin' you better come with 'em choppers and don't fake
'Cause if you bullshit, you're the one that's getting erased
This niggaz murikin' out pussy niggaz in broad day
Where-ever you get caught slippin' at that's where you lay

And like they say nigga no face, no case
As long as these goons are lurkin' these streets ain't safe
The more rounds you shoot nigga the less aim it takes
It's murkin' season so you pussies better stay out the way

Murkin' season don't end, this shit year round
It ain't never drop, murkin' season never slow down
It's impossible to many choppers floating around
These young niggaz they sick with it on that 4 pound

Lil cuzin' 12 and all he talking is murkin' now
Old lady said she got woke up by that chopper sound
Say she got on her bed and laid back down
From what I heard 'em crackers fired 120 rounds

4 motha fuckin' dead bodies laying on the ground
Niggaz bettin' on it now, who goin' get off first?
Running your fuck box better, what how you choose your words

That nigga sending threats pussy, you got a lot of nerves
Niggaz would leave your motherfuckin' brains on the burb
This ain't the 80's dawg, niggaz getting murked
Everywhere you turn you see dead niggaz ono t-shirts
Everytime I pass by the grave yard I see a herse

Not respecting these streets is what got you niggaz fucked
That oussy nigga ain't about it, he just know how to bring tongue
Runnin' your dick, suckin' lips would get you chopped up

I know plenty niggaz like you that done got touched
You talking loud 'cause you got a chopper nigga that ain't enough
I know 100 niggaz that got choppers but only few would bust
You got the mouth of a killa but you ain't got the guts

You got the front game down packed but you ain't got the nuts
You probably got off before but you ain't wack nothing
This the wrong place to play games dawg, the streets real
Trying to impress a mothafucker would get you nigga killed
Murking season is official, now this shit for real
",Murkin Season,2007
Plies,"Aye, I like to welcome all you motherfuckers
To The Real Testament
This where the truth get told
And bullshit ain't tolerated

Before I sell my soul I?ll lose everything
You can lock me up, cracker, I?ma get out and do the same thing
You take this rap shit from me, I?ll find another game
Don't get this shit confused, nigga, this was never my dream

I only [Incomprehensible] without a scene
I?d rather kill myself before I?ll live a lie
Before I ever turn informer, nigga, I?d rather fry
My momma lost me to the streets, I told her don't cry

Told her if she understood real she should understand why
The wrong slip in these streets and crackers had your life
Been had plenty of money, nigga, but never paid tithe
Nigga was caught up in this thuggin', I apologize

You call the nigga your dawg but will he really ride?
This nigga know how to get money but will he testify?
Give a fuck why you told, snitchin' somethin' I can't buy
Rather I sell a hundred thousand or I sell a mil'

The fact remain the same, nigga, I'm still real
Broke my heart, they gave my lil' homie 15 years
I put a cast on my heart in place of the tears
He told me, ?Plies, I'm livin' through you while I been here?

The realest shit I ever heard, that shit gave me chills
And I?ma get that time off him if it?s God?s will
I don't know when God comin?, that's my only fear
Been drankin? since I was sixteen, it help me think clear

Don't come to my funeral if I ain't fuck with you while I was here
Some fuck niggas in the county now who tryin? to get me in there
But niggas in hell want ice water so I don't care
The opposite of you, fuck niggas, ?cause you a square

I know of some fuck niggas that hate me that I ain't never met
Never talked to me, never even seen me yet
Only thing they know is I'm where they tryin? to get
Respect it or check it, nigga, ?cause I don't know this shit

I been dealin? with envy, nigga, ever since I was a git
Hated by many, loved by the same so I'm even, bitch
Now I put my hand on the Bible, swear to tell the truth
You liked to hear lies
This is the wrong CD to listen to, nigga, nigga
",The Real Testament Intro,2007
Plies,"Hey, Mama, know I ain't never tell you this before
But it really hurt me knowin' I'm runnin' you crazy
I wanna talk to you real quick

My momma told me while I run these streets she can't sleep
Her phone ring late at night, she think some'n happened to me
Her nerves so bad right now she can't even watch TV
She turn her head every time she see a police

She scared to look 'cause it might be me in the back seat
Whenever she hear about a shootin' her heart skip a beat
She heard the Feds was in the town, her knees got weak
She know I'm at the house, the only time she at peace

Her blood pressure through the roof all because of me
Her favorite words is 'Dope ain't the only way to eat'
She told me other day she hope I don't die in these streets
I just pray to God she don't wipe her hands with me

I'm a goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby
Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin' me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin? me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

Remember the nights me sittin' up in a cold cell
I'm wakin' you up out of your sleep, it's me callin' you from jail
You ain't say it but I know inside you mad as hell
You called off from work just to bond me out of jail

I get in trouble, I call you, seem like it never fail
Can hear you now, ""Boy, you need to sit your ass down somewhere""
I come and eat, I take a shower then I'm outta there
I know I'm stressin' you at times, seem like I don't care

You wrote bad checks for me to have somethin' to wear
You risked your freedom for me, nowadays that's real rare
Every time I think about the shit, I wanna shed a tear
That's why I buy you some'n for Father's Day every year

I'm a goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby
Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin? me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

Goon to the streets but to my momma I'm still her baby
Raised a street nigga by yourself, you a hell of a lady
Shit I'm doin' now got nothin' to do with how you raised me
Shit killin? me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

You did the best you could with me and I love you for that
Wanted me to stay in school but that ain't where my heart was at
I got exposed to the streets and fell in love with stacks
And all the times I hurt you wish I could take it back

When Daddy left us you stepped up and took up his slack
I know I'm selfish and feelin' there's some'n I know I lack
This shit I'm doin' now I know you raised me better than that
You taught me how to be a man and showed me how to act

Sometime I wonder how you still proud I'm your son
After all the stuff I took you through and all the shit I done
Well, like you told me when God want me, how I can't run
Before He take me, want you to know how much I love you, Mom

Shit killin? me to know I'm runnin my momma crazy

I think I'm speakin' for every street nigga 'round the world
I don't think we sit down long enough sometime
Just to realize what we takin' our momma through

Plies,"[Verse 1:]
I went to see my nigga, he doing 17 1 of the realist niggas I dun ever seen
Got caught with a bird his record was clean coming back from Dade all he needed was to speed
He was a real soldier but his partner was greed, went out with that 40 how is 17 yrs worth
A key shit cause 20 grand will get you 10 a piece he ain't want to hurt nobody
He was just tryin' to eat he had a real job went to work 4 days a week said
Dis was his last trip and he was getting out the streets he a good nigga a second is
All he need.

[Chorus: x2]
Sum niggas made mistakes fucked up circumstances now they life gone probably goin' die in
Da pin.they dun gave up life they put it God's hands what happened to a miracle all he
Ne is a 2nd chance.

[Verse 2:]
Wish I had 2 chance 2 sentence the judge kids and watch em beg for they life like me
Niggas did give them a life sentence for something that wasn't big.
Before they get granted they appeal they gotta do 10 you gotta be on the other foot for
You to understand the scariest thing in the world is to be a black man I wish
Wat my future hold I wish I knew in advanced I approach life every day just hoping
I win a lot of us already lost they sitting in the pen dis shit crazy cause God forgives sins.
But wen it comes to the system that shit don't bend I guess it do depending on the
Color of yo skin.

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
I though it was understood that nobody was perfect how can 1 mistake make yo
Life worthless God made us all we here to serve a purpose yo life in 12 strangers
Hands and cum back with a verdict but is that fair what if they all was dirty you mess up
1 time and they cum back with 30 what if you ain't got money yo hold family hurting
Den you ain't got a choice you gotta cop out early but if you were rich you wouldn't had that
30 but what if the judge racist ain't nobody around to overrun it the system fucked up
It ain't sturdy welcome to America home to the controversy

Been stripped of my emotions
Feels like I been stabbed
I don't know what I would do if my nigga passed
Emotional roller coaster
When it's over I be glad
Can't do nothin bout his health
It's startin to make me mad

After dis all is over
Gotta put my heart into cast
I feel so empty
How long will it last?
Ain't nothin' in the world that
Chu can do right now that can
Make me laugh

Niggas caught him slippin
Hit him from both sides

Don't know what I'd do next
Mama told me pray more baby
And worry less
Ever since I got the news
I been emotional wreck
Don't know if its all a dream
Or if its just a test
He had tubes in his nose
Some runnin out his neck
Can't even look at my nigga
Can't stand to see him like that
I feel all his pain
I'm under so much stress
I jus hope he make it

Before you take me god, help me get my family straight.

I asked god why he didn't bless me with a silver spoon.
Cause if he did, I would never have had to be a goon.
If he gone change my family, I hope he change em soon.
I'm tired of answering my phone, hearing bad news.
My grandma on a walker, she can barely move.
Just to tell me she love me, take all her breath to do.
She on a kidney machine I know it's hurting too.
4 times a week gotta get her blood drew.
She say the bible and a prayer is the only thing that get her through.
Why my grandma deserve this, god what did she do?
Though just cause I had a lil' money I could buy her a new one.
She hold the family together she's one I can't lose

My auntie got AIDS and I'm watching her suffer.
Why she gotta die cause she was in love with a hustla.
Even though she's dying, she say's she still loves him.
I know if I see him again, I'll kill that mothaf**ka.
Only get 15 minutes to talk to my brother, cause he in prison gotta go see him if I wanna hug him.
Some niggas willing to lose their freedom just for thuggin.
Cause he made a mistake I gotta be here because I love him.

Cant even have a family reunion, cause it's always drama.

Why my family luck so bad, I sit and wounder.
We ain't close like we should and it's taking us under.
The only time we come together, is to have a funeral.
Sit around and talk about each other, spread rumors
I know its some of my fault, cause I don't talk to em.

Bentley alright, get more attention than the donk
No shirt, pants saggin' with big charm
If it ain't top of the line, I don't want that blunt
Geeked in this trap, come through the front
Jack boys ridin', tryin' to find what they want
Ball last night, 4 G's what I spun
Before you fuckin' wit me, better take his lunch

Just sitting here thinking bout my little partner
Who just got killed man its wild tho
How the motherfuckers you love the most
Seem like them the ones who always die first homie
Dog I just wish I had the opportunity
To just bring my nigga back for just 1 day homie

[Chorus: x2]
Wish I can bring my nigga back for 1 day
And Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby momma done went stray
And how them fuck niggas who claiming
They love you done walked away

[Verse 1]
God give me my nigga for 24 hours
So we can ride and laugh at these pussy ass cowards
Get to the liquor park and let's talk for hours
Show him how if the nigga die how they lose they power
Nigga forget about ya dog after they give you them flowers
Ol' trifling ass baby momma done got wilder
Now she fucking the nigga you robbed with the pink impala
Like I told you before dog that ho sour
You can fuck these hoes dog but don't handle them
Bitch you ain't got shit dog money arouse them
After a nigga dead and gone they lose they value
Ho cried at ya funeral and changed right after

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2]
When you first died a nigga sat around ya momma all day
But since ya funeral them niggas ain't went that fuckin' way
Cause when you die yo dogs suppose to step to the plate
You ain't gotta worry I got her I'll make sure she straight
Make you question if the love was real or was it fake
Out of sight out of mind I guess it's true what they say
When you was here them ones was main niggas in yo face
You ain't gotta deal wit them fuck niggas you in a better place
I almost cried when I seen yo son the other day
You couldn't deny that one boy look like you all the way
I thought love was forever I guess that ain't the case
First you die then they bury ya the niggas walk away

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm sitting right here homie eyes full of tears
Never thought that pain last this many years
One thing I've learned from all of this shit life real
Rep yo name till I die homie that's how I feel
Watch how everything changed since you got killed
Two days after you died niggas broke in yo crib
Niggas saying yo lil' cousin the one who sold yo wheels
This shit probably shouldn't fuck with me but it really is
Motherfuckers showed me what Shasta really is
What's gone happen to me after I die one of my biggest fears
See what my partner done been through got me scared to live
I pray to god my life don't end like his

I feel like fuckin'

[Chorus: x2] 
I'm just in one of them moods, I feel like fuckin'
Wanna lay up in somethin' wet, and punish somethin'
I want a nice lil' baby who ain't got on nothin'
I got a taste for some pussy, I feel like fuckin'

Ate pussy in the shower for the first time last week
I got a confession to make to the world, I'm a freak
I think about wet pussy, all in my sleep
My fantasy is to get caught, fuckin' on the beach
The best pussy you can get is when you gotta sneak
I call my lil' baby a shooter, when she nut, she skeet
If I had my choice of how I'ma die, I'd be in some pussy, beatin'
Bammin' pussy, then leave and cause a nigga cheatin'?
My baby sore, cause I done fucked her twice, this evenin'
Said I fuck her so good, it feel like she dreamin'
Got her playin' wit herself for no apparent reason
Need some more of that pussy, cause a nigga feinin'

[Chorus: x2] 

All this liquor keep me horny than a motherfucker
Just text bay and ask her could I come fuck her
Only yak here, but shit, her ass in trouble
Goin' to beat bay, so that mean no rubber
That's my motherfuckin' best, nigga, that's how I cut her
We been fuckin' for a while, that's how we fuck each other
Love diggin' in lil' mama, cause it get gutter
Seem like that pussy go to runnin', soon as you touch her
When I get in that pussy, I'm tryin' to pull a muscle
Ready to come up out these boxers, so I can gon' and fuck her
I can blame it on the liquor, if I wanna suck her
Know I'm ready to fuck bad than a motherfucker

[Chorus: x2] 

Can be four in the mornin' or two in the afternoon
Just thinking 'bout that pussy get me in my mood
Knowin' that pussy on its way, get me in my groove
Nothin' like a bad bitch, who body smooth
Lay her flat on the bed, and look at her in the nude
Then fuck on every inch of the whole room
Money first, then pussy, then food
Around fat pussy, it's hard to keep my cool
Gotta turn my head, so I don't fuckin' drool
I can tell when I want it, feel my boxers move
Yet they pussy get wet, when they want it too
Good pussy the worst thing you can ever lose

I'm sick of this shit dog, I'm tired of being broke, 
I wanna live like the rick folks,
I want the house with the big boat, 
I wanna wake up one mornin' ain't gotta sell dope

I'm tryin' to stay hood but I ain't tryin' to die here, 
I need to be able to spend money with out fear, 
The kinda money I can bawl for the whole year, 
I wanna crib so big I can disappear, 
I want the marble floors with the hangin' chandeliers, 
I need to be able to drink yak instead of beer, 
I don't want a deck behind my house I want a pier, 
I want a walk in closest, a closet full of gear, 
I wanna be able to buy 4 new whips every year, 
And leave the TV runnin' dog while I ain't here, 
I ain't gotta worry bout the bills cause the money there, 
I wanna live like the rich folks up in here

[Chorus: x2]

When a nigga tell you he likes sellin' dope hes a damn lie, 
Cause if he did then he'd sell dope for no price, 
We just willin' to take chances and get by, 
Ain't like we like to do it, we gotta sell by,
Cause if you don't theres a good chance you goin' to die, 
All we need is a lil' money and we alright, 
Cause most niggas just want a piece of the good life, 
The worst feelin' is the shit you can't buy, 
Whats fillet mion when you ain't got the money to try, 
All that miracle shit don't work for my kind, 
One thing about us we like to shine, 
Guess you shouldn't expect shit if you don't wanna grind

I don't want no gun I want a million fuckin' dollar bills, 
Be in mind its brand new and sit it on the edge, 
Walk into my sons room, and you can't tell if its mine or his, 
I want my son to be the first one with a wheel, 
I want to send my son to collage and pay it up for four years, 
Let the streets be mad and tell 'em he ain't real, 
The motherfuckers hate you when good is how you live, 
Cause nine days broke is what the streets call real, 
The same motherfuckers who cant pay there fuckin' bills, 
Take it from me being broke, that ain't trill
It feels even better bein' worth a couple mil

Found myself thinking bout her, shit kinda spooked me
More time we spent together more she got attached
I love being around her, seem like the perfect match

She knew her place, played her role, and she was cool with that

Got kinky with her, told her dress up like a lawyer
I was the judge last night I gave her all the orders
Worked it real good turned her round and doggystyled her
Told her if I gave her any more might have to charge her
Felt the vibe in the room the feelings getting larger
Took her from the bench and I done turned her to a starter

Ay dawg. if you lookin for plies in da club, know what I'm sayin. I'm easy to find bro. only thing you gotta look for is all da goons bro. I keep tellin ya'll dawg. I'm opposite all them niggas ya'll see on t.v. bro. I'm a tell you where I be at bro.

[Chorus: x2]
I don't hang in da v.I.p. so stop checkin.
I'm posted with da goons boppin, hand on weapon.
In da corner with da thugs and convicted fellons.
Lookin for me in the club, I'm in the thug section.

[Verse:]
Wrong section, this ain't where da cris get poured.
This where da pills get popped, dro get rolled.
Where the thugs posted and ducks get soaked.
Better keep ya head up and ya eyes open.
Might not wanna chill over here if ya ain't dumpin.
If we don't fuck with ya pussy nigga then keep floatin.
We gettin loose a lil bit, but everybody focused.
Cause everybody on yack and every body scopin.
Keep a unit in my face and back against the wall.
And hand on fire in case I gotta get off.
Ain't nothin over here for ya but problems dawg.
Surrounded by all hood bitches, no model brawds.

[Chorus: x2]
I don't hang in da v.I.p. so stop checkin.
I'm posted with da goons boppin, hand on weapon.
In da corner with da thugs and convicted fellons.
Lookin for me in the club, I'm in the thug section.

[Verse 2]
You a cris popper n nigga ima yact dranker,
You a pussy ass nigga, I like donks ain't'a,
And you ain't comfortable round thugs I can tell ain't'a,
The street niggas make you feel like yo life endangered,
All these lil goons you see me wit I can't contain'em,
Lil mama say she don't like thugs well I don't blame'a,
Cause if you slide wit one of us shit we try to train ya,
Keep it real with you lil mama all us like to mangle
You either comin or you stayin this shit easy ""thank you""
Klick full of murkas slash hoe catchers
N at the right time nigga we gon apply pressure
N all the niggas over here certified wettas

(verse 3)
Now if you ain't respected by the streets, then pussy nigga move
'cause this section over here reserved for the goons
And we ain't friendly over here so give us some room
We ain't hard to find nigga just follow the fumes
Any nigga can't hang over here 'cause we got rules
Nigga look like he wanna do something, then do her too
Better keep your feelings to your self and stay cool
You needa handle you're liquor pussy or get blue
Last nigga that played tough, he made the news
Gettin of on the bitch in the club, ain't nothin new
'cause every nigga over here 'bout whateva its on you
'cause hoes only ones that ridin and fightin nigga shoes
Just 'cause it look like we ballin nigga don't get fooled
'cause one of you fuck niggas, can change a nigga whole mood
Nigga can go from ballin to a murkin' attitude
And in the section over here only real niggas approved

See, my shit blindin'
His shit don't shine
'Cause that shit ain't real
His gemstones - they fruity pebbles
Just like Flinstones
And he had his 'Roley' on
But I ain't even notice his arm
But his diamonds cloudy
And he ain't shiny
And I heard his shit Tick, tick, tickin'
Oh man, this nigga trippin!
See, we poppin' bottles and smokin' bugga
Actin' cocky
Big thangs with fat pockets
Wearing seventy-thousand dollar watches
My overseas friends
Are breakin' thangs in
Invest in a smaller hit town
Shakin', bakin', and breakin' it down
We gettin' top dollar
'Cause we got that top powder
Hos slob on our Johnson
'Cause Johnson got that best powder
We call a grand a dollar
We gettin' money, holla

I did five trucks since the first quarter
I'm on the right path at this rate
I'll be sellin' slabs by the halfs

I'mma mother fuckin' goon
So whatever chick I fuck with
She got to be a goonette

I'm her goon yeah
And shes my goonette
I'm her goon yeah
And shes my goonette
Goon

For her birthday I bought her a pink ski mask
When I piss her off she don't let me eat the pussy when she get mad
But real nigga I ain't gon't lie I done fucked her on the rag
It was like she was spottin', she ain't bleed that bad
She don't like to drive the chevy, drank too much gas
Gave her sixty and told her fuck it go buy the jag
She say she know when I'm lyin' to her cause I talk fast
Cut her friends them loose, she said them hoes crap
She like me
She don't fuck with rappers, they lie too bad
Pussy fat, I told her it look like she wearin' a pad
She ain't a ten or a dime, she a ten and a half
A goonette is the baddest bitch you can ever have

Shes my baby, yeah
And I love her to death
Shes got good loving, yeah
And she keeps it on deck
She holds me down, yeah
While I chase these checks
Im her goon, yeah
And shes my goonette
Goon

She play tough and she act hard, but she cry easy
Say if she catch me with another bitch, she gone leave me
You fuck em' good and you take care of em'
They don't want you cheatin'
I first met her she was green dawg, but now she seasoned
She like to drank what I drank, she don't like to drank really
She don't trust no bitches, she feel like they schemin'
She hood as ever, she can talk just like them white folks
I don't know if she can fight for real, but she talk shit though
And everytime she get drunk she like to straighten the hole
First time I fucked her, I acted like the rubber broke
She act like she couldn't take it, she make me fuck her slow
But now she grab my ass, and make me fuck her mo'

Shes my baby, yeah
And I love her to death
Shes got good loving, yeah
And she keeps it on deck
She holds me down, yeah
While I chase these checks
I'm her goon, yeah
And shes my goonette
Goon

I don't want no dingy bitch, give me a goonette
Can put her hair up in a pony tail and still be that
Can be the just woke up, and pussy still wet
And she can be dead ass broke, but she can still dress
And everybody can piss her off, but she wont stress
And just to make sure I'm good nigga she gone check
And every two or three months nigga she get in check
Her biggest fear when it come to me is another bitch
She had her choice, to be gettin' fucked and not necked
If I had my choice, we'd be gettin' fucked and then neck
And now she listen and observe so she talk less
The next bitch to be my lady is a goonette

Shes my baby, yeah
And I love her to death
Shes got good loving, yeah
And she keeps it on deck
She holds me down, yeah
While I chase these checks
I'm her goon, yeah
And shes my goonette

Turn the lights on

Your pussy so good
I wanna put alarm on it
Like baby food, I wanna put my tongue on it
If you‚Äôs a stripper baby
I‚Äôd put the ones on it
I love getting on that liquor
And going dumb on it
I want it off the market
Put it in the freezer
And when I slide through
You can unfreeze it
You got flowers in
You got that good seed
Like being in the rain
You get wet easy

I swear the pussy so good
I might fuck around and put something on it
She said what you got on it?
I said anything that you want girl
But if I buy them bags, buy them shoes, buy them purse
Then nobody better not be getting that pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
And if I paid them bills every month on the first
Then nobody better not be getting my pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
I swear you do it so good
I swear
Turn the lights on

You won‚Äôt get the voicemail
I answer you first call
Even if your light red
We still talk
You're like sushi, baby
I give it to you straight raw
And I‚Äôm breaking bread, you the first off
You like Florida to me, you stay warm
I‚Äôm the real Energizer bunny
But the hood version I keep going
We start off with kisses
You hear me snoring
I show off your finesse
Then I hit you with bam bam bam

I swear the pussy so good
I might fuck around and put something on it
She said what you got on it?
I said anything that you want girl
But if I buy them bags, buy them shoes, buy them purse
Then nobody better not be getting that pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
And if I paid them bills every month on the first
Then nobody better not be getting my pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
I swear you do it so good
I swear
Turn the lights on

When it come to the snatch, you a poster child
When it come to get it in, you versatile
When it come to the threads, got your own style
When it come to me, though
Make you throw in the towel
Your back cute, your ass better
My ex was good, but you even better
Need to run for office, the White House
If it‚Äôs bout how good your sex is, you gon' win hands down

I swear the pussy so good
I might fuck around and put something on it
She said what you got on it?
I said anything that you want girl
But if I buy them bags, buy them shoes, buy them purse
Then nobody better not be getting that pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
And if I paid them bills every month on the first
Then nobody better not be getting my pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
I swear you do it so good

At the end you may lose nothin but teeth
That's fly
But nowadays ask kids
When they have beef, you might die
Why?

While niggas beef about this and biggedy-beef about that
I'm with my soldiers in the Rover, never sober, fuck that
Yo dun, I run with wild Crooklyn niggas with gats
Pigged-push wigs back on corner spots full of criggedy-crack
My niggas click back, kid, that's why we hold somethin
And break your punk ass down just like you stole somethin
When I rock with Chubb you block show me love
Nigga what, want beef, we drawin first blood

[ Krazy Drazy ]
Well, it's the riggedy-rhyme dropper, the hip-hopper, you know the name
I ciggedy-can't explain (why niggas beefin in the game)
You see, I niggedy-never get shocked when a nigga get wet
Tiggedy-talk that shit, I guess you're bound to get hit
The rap zone's now a war zone, we fight on sight
We wiggedy-wildin out, provin all these white folks right
We like some crabs in a barrel tryin to get on top
The Hit Squad, Chubb Rock represent hip-hop
So kill the beef

Well, when I first dropped the bait back in 1988
I couldn't wait to get straight and dominate state to state
Went to feud, bullshit evil, exterminatin flows
Check your grip, don't slip or get a dose on how it goes
Jealous niggas, gun triggers, fuckin up the game
But me you can't tame, an outlaw like Jesse James
We got east versus west, bullet-proof tef' vest
Who's the best? But let it rest, because there's no contest
Temptation, accusations need to stop
Unify hip-hop, PMD, Chubb Rock

Now - I will come back to the groove
Now my man Common on wax slayin Ice Cube - anyway, that's cool
That nigga somewhere 'higher learnin'
And of course there's that famous beef between Parrish and Sermon
And that's cool, both those niggas killed Jane
And now there's Nice without Smooth - that's insane
And I heard they squashed that, and that shit should cease
Cause black mutha-uckas shouldn't beef

Pnau,"Despite our many differences, I will take a chance
And dream of dusty moments, a movie star romance
If ever I could tear you from your nightmare to my dream
I'd smash you bedroom window, and I'd muffle your soft scream
If ever I were sure of you, the way I'm sure of me,
I'd trap you in my arms, and I would be- 

With you forever, with you forever, and ever.

Now I walk the borderline, against a sky of stone
I wish you were beside me now, but I know that I'm alone
Maybe I should leave you now, maybe I should stay
It matters more than trauma, it's the passion, not the play
I've made a million promises, I'll break a million more,
And set the lens upon so I'll be

With you forever, with you forever, and ever...

The bad machine's upon you, and it's me
And it's me. and I'll be. and I'll be...

I'll kiss the ground at your feet, we'll rise up from the ashen heat

There's a million moments left burnin' on the highway

It's been one hill after another

Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing

Which is the voice that I was meant to hear?
How will I know?
Where do I go from here?

And even learned to say goodbye

Beneath that milky hide
There's emptiness inside

I wonder if they even bleed

Killers at the core

They're different from us
Which means they can't be trusted

I fall in love when I'm immersed, but it's for the music that I thirst
What's worse is that we giving up our souls for the purse

Did you see her? Did you approve?
What if I asked this of you?
Would everything you'd say be true?

When I was young I played with toys
Games were small then, not so involved
My toys meant most of all
You know how kids are when they're small

But now today I find a lot has come to change my mind
It took some time to understand
Older people play little games in another way
Their castles crumble to sand
A lonely hour to withstand

Remembering her is not all that bad

And if I'm someone that you could know

Eyes that search like the morning sun but never finding
Silently I can feel the glow and I'm not minding
But then you know I've been tryin' to show
Why it makes me cry, I'm talkin' it over from the inside

Something new and oh, so sacred
Grows within the depths of you
But still I just can't keep from wonderin'
For I'm but a child, too

Changes timelessly fill the spaces
It's so blind of me
I've seen the faces of a gifted few
Who can help us break our chains that bind

Thinkin' all the time, why I can't unwind?
You must feel the pain
Why it makes me cry, I'm talkin' it over from the inside

Somebody said it was a good time
To me, it was a long, long time

And he got lazy

Songs they got to slippin' and right-hand man took to trippin'
And the leader passed it on
Familiar faces I seen, similar places and I wonder
How we left some traces

Come the moon, go the sun
And I believe there's something on the run
Catching up we ran so far behind

Give me somethin' to believe in - so hang on tight

And there are people who ride a train
Into the city and back again
Only to get up in the same old frame
Could you reckon with them blues
In a world that's win or lose
Any fool could see
It goes on just the same

So many people inside the past
Talkin' 'bout these days they're movin' too fast
And the future it will not last

Lookin' worn and withered, I heard a lonely cry
Of what could have been

We were doin' it right

Here in the night so far away from it all
Out of my sight, how far down did we fall
From grace created
Oh how we related
In the picture from the days
The Days Gone By

You were letting your friends get in the upper hand
I had to turn the other way
You could not understand
And now we're out on our own
You have to wonder what lasts
When all that's left to recognize
Is a scene from the past

Out of my sight, how far down did we fall
How far down did we fall
How far down did we fall

back in the middle of sixty-four

I swore I had been there before
When a shot rang out and suddenly I was face to face

Sometimes we are all we got, this time I have not forgot

his troops had left him there for dead
Laying up against a big oak tree,
it had all come down to either him or me

Is this the last thing I'll ever see?

How will you feel tonight

Always running
You never walk
Do you ever listen
Or do you just talk

Afraid to take a chance
You'll always lose
You only like to dance
In the same old shoes

How will you feel tonight
When you're all alone
And you still think you're right
How will you feel tonight

Desperation
We've all had our share
A different situation
When there's nobody there

You ride in a wind of uncertainty
Filled with only vacant dreams
From another time another place
If you could see the lookon your face
Whish you could be in my place

How will you feel tonight
How will you feel tonight

",How Will You Feel Tonight,1995
Poco,"Wasn't that me
In the lead tonight
Still a little behind
But I'll be alright

Ridin' down hard
Who do you think you are
In the lead tonight

I'm livin' with the hurt
I wrecked a thirty dollar shirt
It's the rule of the west
When you ride with the best
You can live with the hurt

I ride everything
They put under me
Ride real good
In bad company
Don't feel no pain
For I will regain the lead tonight

I'm livin' with the hurt
I wrecked a thirty dollar shirt
It's the rule of the west
When you ride with the best
You can live with the hurt

It's been one for the cowboys
And three for the bulls
Anyway I see it
I got my hands full
Don't feel the pain
Just a step away from the lead tonight

Special care
The kind you can't get
Just anywhere

Oh my heart is surley breaking now
Sixteen days before I'm back in town
I'm caught between a rock and a hard place
I'd give anything just to see your face

Bringing me that special care
The kind I can't get just anywhere
Bring to me that special care

Ten thousand miles through some
Lonely days
It's enough to change some of these
Gypsy ways

And another place

Like a sufi in trance, can't break it

I clicked my heels three times just like you said

And she can paint a prettier picture of your future.

Of my life in this house
Trying to find a way to get out
Looking for a sign
That I should open the door
This craziness is getting me down

But today is the day
We break free

Walking down the stairway
To the traffic below
Anything could happen
I know
But I'm sick of everybody
Telling me what to do
I hear you
Hey but I already know

And today is the day
We break free

It's clear in my mind
After all of this time
What I feel my love

There are so many times
That the sun doesn't shine
But I'm here my love

And today is the day

Maybe I should wait
Just a minute or two
It's getting cold now
I feel so insecure

That is so hard to please
And the past
Is a pebble in my shoe",Today,1998

I've been lonely, I've been wild
And when I see it in your eyes a wilder cry than even mine
I know something's hidden inside

how her life will be affected by this experience.

Why is it a house of leaves?",Spanish Doll,2000
Poe,"A terrible thought has moved into my mind
Like an unwanted room-mate drunk on wine
It feeds on my happiness won't pay the rent
I must take proper measures to evict it

A terrible thought has moved into my mind
A giant rat that's nibbling on my pride
It's tearing away my patience and my wit
I must take proper measures set a trap for it

What a terrible thought

I don't care what you've done
I don't care who you've won
I know in the end you'll have your fun

But you can't have it hear
And I won't let you steer
You know I don't want you in my mind

I must stay calm you know and I must be clear
It's gonna take a hundred thoughts to make this one disappear
A train like that could travel a soul for years
A terrible thought could have a terribly long career

What minds have you shredded
I bet they regretted
Having ever thought you up
Just look at you shine
committing your crimes
You know I don't want you in my mind

'Cause you're breaking my stride
You poisonous vine
You're strangling me inside
You're breaking my stride

You poisonous vine
You're strangling me inside
You're breaking my stride

What a terrible thought...

What is your greatest worry because you seem to be worried all the time

Sometimes I can't hear myself think

You have to speak a little louder,
I can't understand a word you're saying

Sometimes I can't hear myself think",Terrible Thought,2000
Poe,"(Second phone call to mother)

Daughter:
Mom? are you there? are you sleeping? I'm so bummed.
Maybe if I sing a little song you'll pick up:

Sometimes I'm so afraid of my heart
Of it's constant hunger for whatever it is it wants
He way it stops.... and starts
",Terrified Heart,2000
Poe,"My mother spent 10 years sitting by a window
Scared if she spoke she would die of a heart attack
She listened as her dreams silently screamed
They drowned like little dolphins caught in a fishnet

You gotta back it all up you gotta talk the talk
Hey everybody when I hear the knock

Hey did you ever get the feeling that it's really a joke
You think you've got it figured out and then you find that you don't
So you say goodbye to the world and now you're floating in space
You got no sense of nothing not even a time or a place
Then suddenly you hear it it's the beat of your heart
And for the first time in your life you know your life is about to start

Will that desire to communicate, would not look the way your house looks today",Wild,2000
Poe,"I live at the end of a 5 and 1/2 minute hallway
But as far as I can see you are still miles from me
In your doorway
And oh by the way
When the landlord came today
He measured everything
I knew he'd get it wrong
But I just played along
Cause I was hoping that he would fix it all
But there's only so far I can go
When you're living in a hallway that keeps growing
I think to myself
5 more minutes and I'll be there
Inside your door
But there's more to this story
Than I've been letting on
There are words made of letters
Unwritten
And yes I forgive you
For leading me on
You can think of it like this
When you can't resist
I'm in your hallway standing on a cliff
And just when I think I've found the trick
I'm tumbling
Like an echo
'Cause there's only so far I can go

It's all coming... 

It's all coming back to me now
That strange and almost endless dream
Where I was you and you were me
You opened up your eyes and I could see
That you were falling from the world
As endless as a shooting star
In orbit around me thinking I was somebody else
And terrified to look at me and see yourself

Well you were like a dream
And I am just a trip you are on
When the trip is over you will go back to the places that you once belonged
You will look for comfort there and when you do you'll find that it is gone
And that is when you'll dream a dream where I am you and you are me
And then you'll know my love

So don't be afraid
Your heart is in me and it's racing so fast now
'Cause everything we ever were or ever will be
Is shapeless as a changing cloud

Your letter written on the sky
I need you now to read it through my eyes
When you see just what I see
And tenderly watch it change
And just let it be

'Cause I am like a dream and you are just a trip that I am on
When the trip is over I will go back to the places where I once belonged
And I will look for comfort there and when I do I know it will be gone
And that is when I'll dream a dream where I am you and you are me
And then I'll know your love

So quiet... now....

Sing...
This is just some trip that we are on
When the trip is over we will think of this as some place we once belonged

Will change the world
And then suddenly means something better

Every single thing I see
Good or bad you make it mean something better
Every pleasure every pain
Every nightmare that I dream
Make it mean something better

With only word you change the ending of a tragedy
And summon power from the injuries

Will change the word and then it
Suddenly means something better
Everything single thing I see
Good or bad you make it mean something better

And I think that I'm starting to drown
Even when I try to take you down
Every time that I think I'm alone

And I can't find a word on my own
You take me home then...
You change the world again

With only one word
You took a war out of my history

Could change the world and give my... back to me

Seep through doorways... cracks and crevices
My gage just die from lack of

Know we dead ass won't, won't, won't, cop the pleat
But then you never met a nigga that's as cocky as me
Pull a flame, throw it out, make 'em drop and then freeze
Let 'em know I ain't playing; pop one in his knee
Have his team and cops come gunning for me
Have gat men coming; have 'em running from me
Where them missiles come from?

Runnin with a bunch of stupid crazy motherfuckers
Niggaz fuckin their money up, niggaz gettin knocked
And jealous motherfuckers, they want the whole block
Though I could start flippin gettin on a mission

But I need much more, no time for bullshittin'
Niggaz listen...

The H-E-A-T- makes me crazy
I want to bust somethin, figures, touch somethin'
The heat is on, got a niggaz blood rushin'
I want to touch somethin, niggaz bust somethin'

Yo, all I know is guns, all I do is slug
I'd rather plug you with the heater than to have you front
My life revolves around the snub 4th
Stay gettin those outside of New York
Bullets from the cornerstone, I'm bringin home a arsen
Interstate 95 North to the Jackie Robinson
Watch out for D's in caprices in tauruses
Empire mistakes for cops, mad nervous
Back at home sell a few burners
Keep a miz and a seven mil for my personal
Walk with benevolence, holdin twin fifths
380's in the whip, a mini-eagle for my chick
That nigga P is sick, I need a silencer connect, see me
Niggaz be lyin, tellin stories, tell it walkin'
My nigga's into drugs and extortion
Knotty head for them niggaz on the nightshift pumpin'
The heat is on nigga....

[Chorus] - 6X",The Heat Is On,1999
Poet,"Chorus:

Life's full of love and hate
So we got crums to make
Survival's at stake
We under pressure
Still, we need to treasure
No exceptions, drastic measures
Its my life, no exceptions
Life's full of love and hate
So we got crums to make
Survival's at stake
We under pressure
Still, we need to treasure
No exceptions, drastic measures
You got one life, no exceptions

Now who ran guns with Bounty, did a joint with Rakim
A song with Mariah that had the whole world poppin
Who that be the are-A-Double P-E-are
Niggas fuck with this and they get sent to the E.R.
Now I'm rockin jams with the Screwball fam
They connected so thick, with them men in submission you know who ???
Screwball and the Mobb so sick
We repin' QB son, they wouldn't understand it
We roll so thick that niggas get Noyd
Niggas don't want it 'cause Noyd bring noise
No way, niggas can't stop me, son it shocked me 
They tried, I pulled out and popped three

Chorus

Hey yo
Light the blunts up, cook the coke up
One Times out, so what motherfucker I'm tryin to blow up
And when they show up I put the cracks in the stash
The gats in the grass, when they roll I just blast
With no problem bumpin Primo, to niggas we know
You try, you die like Peschi in Casino
No exceptions to the rule, the Ball to the Screw
Go back like ""check one two""
Street gang to the rap game
Worldwide thang, thugstyle niggas feel the pain
Gotta go hard and sunshine they rain
Blow the block up, fuck niggas, with no exceptions

I'm'a blow my steel, grab the chicken as a human sheild
Break elbows and wheel, no exception is the drill
Is it real, I'm cryin blunt retaliation
Follow ?wallet? for your information
4-1-1, scoop all we want dun-dun
Cash is the issue, while you blab about ya pistol
But you never blast a missile, ship your bagette pistol
Gettin scissors on they gun shot wound, you doomed
With no exception

Chorus

Yo, the streets baptised me to money and war
Gettin yours is a law that we never ignore
We score twice or more, keep it moving twenty-four
We seven days with no rest, still fresh looking
Our names inflamed with the smell of tongue cooking
The hoods rotten, we see the ??? from the crabs plottin
The sneak kill, sabatoge our deal
But we overlook it, 'cause our environment is crooked
And hard to finger who the D's got as a singer
Spillin the beans on the dealers and the fiends
So I move separate and conversate with the connections
On the low key, gettin this money with no exceptions

Chorus

Yeah that's right
We all Screwball up in here
No exceptions baby
My team go to any extreme to get the weight up
Streets don't stop, streets don't stop
No exceptions
Gotta get it, gotta get it
All in it to win it

Poet,"""Basically over, basically over, basically over""--Raekwon (Scratched my Primo)

The games over, feds took your Range Rover
Your man snitched and your girl's screaming ""I told ya""
About those over the shoulder boulders that you be having
Niggas smile in ya face, behind yo' back they back-stabbing
Laughing, talkin 'bout all ya business
How much you got to score with, to niggas you went to war with
How many guns you got, and where you go to cop
You shoulda seen me coming down the block
You was gettin hot, but you didn't give a fuck
You make a G in a day and spend it up
In a black Benz tinted up, pound of weed twist it up
Henny pourin out ya cup, livin it up
?Daddy Warbuck? style

Chours: repeat x2

I watched niggas rise, I watched niggas fall down (Fall down)
I seen it all, it went down in my town (Where, where?)
Called Queensbridge, where the fugitives live
Where some rap kids (Rap kids) can turn to big wigs (Big wigs)

My niggas rollin dice and fled
Braggin to the nigga with the slice in his head
Now there's a price on his head
For pullin out on Lil Bro
Flashin his heat, he askin for beef
Conference call, ready to brawl
Caught him on a Blaz'a 
He breathing hard like he got asthma
Choice words he spoke, headed for disaster
Last to the gramma I spit
Told him ""Fuck you and whoever you get""
He's like ""Whatever kid""
Fourteen days later
Whole team made they way to my block
Young bucks with guns tucked and cocked
Like they runnin the spot
I'm'a load one bullet for all of y'all
You saw it on my face, war ready
I'm callin the pace, its gettin more steady
Don't bite what you can't chew
Dumb little niggas like ""That ain't'choo""
Yo, recognize what it coulda came to
Put a whole in you, just like a navel

Chorus

Now keeps your eyes on
Screwball, these rap dons, QB  icons
Play the project with a firearm
Fully loaded, I keep a razor that's coroded
I'll slash you with it, 'cause every rhyme is crime committed
Speak it 'cause I did it before, I got on
I ?dub? niggas moms up til they first born
Til they only child, you pull car you'll get a wild
One, I'm at the bottom of the struggle tryin to rise son
A wise one, step ahead, keep my fam fed
Broke bread off this game and I held my head
You want details, then lets negotiate crack sales
New guns that's watched the game, clientale
Yo we rock well, we keep our name ringin bells
>From this mic to the street life, we doin this right
See we swore to these streets to vibe
And draw heat, fuck a peace sign

(That is a fact) 
(Listen to the hit)	--> Ice Cube
[ VERSE 1: The Poetess ]
Growin up as a kid I never understood the things my dad did
Like hittin my mother, me and my brother hid
In the parlor from the chaos, the cryin and the cussin
The fightin and the fussin
I used to go to bed holdin my ears tight
Filled with fear when I hear moms and pops fight
I never quite understood what the reasons were
How could he love my mother if he kept on hittin her?
I don't know, but what I do know is this
Love hurts when it's comin from the throw of a fist
And the list goes on from the mental to the physical
Use of verbal abuse, beatdowns, it ain't cool
It's bad enough we got it rough in society
Oppression and poverty, no need to be fightin 
Each other, a brother hits a sister, and he's a bigger nigga
He ain't nothin if he gotta hit, pick a
Innocent victim three times smaller in size
Head honcho, macho in whose eyes?
Only a fool tries abuse to utilize 
Physical force to control, hurt, brutalize
Time for change, to rearrange the chain of thought
Unball your fist and think of the pain was brought
To the hearts of your brother or your sis
Love hurts when it's comin from the fist

Now I want you to think of six women that's close to you
And I want you to think if somebody was beatin on em
What would you do?

[ VERSE 2: Def Jef ]
I wish my step pop would stop hittin on moms
She got bruises on her arm from protectin her face from harm
Bein done he looks at me and says, ""What you're seein, son
Is me disciplinin my woman
You're gonna hate me for the rest of your life
But this is my wife""
And I'm thinkin I want to stab him with a steak knife
Too little to interfere, I wish he would disappear
But he won't, so I put the pillow over my ear in fear
Dreamin when I get to be a man I'ma stand up to him
If I see him hit her again I'ma do him
I encourage her to go, she says, ""No
I love him, I stay""
""Mom, what you see in that idiot anyway?
He beats you and mistreats you
Daddy wouldn't do that"" 
But she said: ""Your daddy did it too""
Ain't that much love in the world to be gettin bruised for
Used, abused or even singin the blues for
He's addicted to inflictin abuse, he said he'll quit
If he's the one with the habit, then why you always takin the hit?
A weak later the same shit - I doubt it
I'm grown now, mommy, don't even worry about it

(In 20% of child abuse cases a spouse will be involved in)

[ VERSE 3: The Poetess ]
I was twelve years old when daddy started to get rough
Puff in one hand, the other holdin a glass of that 80 proof stuff
He never got enough, I thought he was tough, but it was all a bluff
I tried to understand and got verbally beat down
But I thought one day he would come around
But man, oh man, was I mistaken
Nothing's right in his life and the abuse I was takin
I was accused of things I never thought of
Good grace got no praise
But I got a lotta negative words thrown in my heart like a dart
With the point of steel
Killin me softly at his will
The big one came when I got the blame for
Not bein the joy of a boy that he aimed for
One day I came home, he was sittin in the chair by the front do'
Just waitin to let go
(Where you been all night, out hoein?)
He didn't raise, rolled up in his gut, I got a blow
And that was it, the last hit, he'll ever do
The pearl handle was popped and cocked and it blew
The only thing on my mind was payback, let's say that
I've put an end to that madness and pray that
I can overcome what mentally dad did well
While I count the days in my padded cell

(Several women a day are killed by ah, battering)
(Listen to the hit)	--> Ice Cube
[ VERSE 4: cool G. Rap ]
Does he love her or does he hate her?
That's what I'm thinkin as I look at mommy hooked up to a respirator
It started with a smack
And that smack became a punch and then a kick and then a broken back
But mommy never dropped dime
Now she's damn near blind, yo, what the hell is on my pop's mind?
I feel like gettin daddy done in
And put like one in his gun and pull the trigger and start runnin
Man, I see the walls turnin red
I'm gettin kinda fed so instead of the lead, how bout a burnin bed?
In order for my mother to last
So while he's laid up, straight up, I be puttin some gas on his ass
Blow him up like a grenade
And this is for all the times my mother used to wear shades
Tryin to cover the damage he did her
So when that fire's on your ass you remember how you hit her

I hold precious like 24 carat gold
Visions of my life back in a time of backpackin'
Struggling empty pockets pipe water I be guzzlin'
Thirst from burning sun blazin' down the earth
Ipoh City the land where my hip hop gave birth
*YOGI B*
Let me tell you a true story my true story
From the kampung to city unbelievable glory
I sat down in solitude and wrote rhymes everyday
I dreamed I would be a great rapper somehow someway
So I journey on up and down every record label in town
$ 1.20 for the mini bus but mostly I walked around
Took all the rap competitions shared my skills wit so many
Major labels won't sign me up but Hip Hop ain't about money

*POINT BLANC*
The present situation back in '97
Lifestyles hectic circumstances be critical
Intense pressure drivin' my mental maniacal
Craftin' an album on a level that be radical
Still I remain the mack as I was way back
True to the fact that hip hop's my greatest asset
*C.LOCO*
It's human nature we survive when all other fails
Try to make a living when fools tellin' tall tales
Undeniable rap skills made viable
It's not impossible high standards are attainable
Without doubt when we're two steps ahead
Indirectly cause a revolution in the industry
Totally incur phenomenal popularity
With mad respect and hold street credibility
The Ammo be Poetic give props to our name
I still be the same Mad Wizard in tha game

Ago as an innocent young brat who loved
Hip hop glad that I did now no one is gonna
Stop me even though there are gonna be hard
Times and good times I see as if I've never
Gone through this pain and misery no matter
What changes my devotion I will be the same
And my emotion and my name
The Black Chinaman seeking no fame no
Temptation bootie calls nor Asian dolls
Hey Siew Koon ! It's time I've learned my lesson
No way no more of this stress of this foolishness
Appreciate my kindness baby
*YOGI B*
Destiny comes in the sound of Positive Tone
With three other MC's now Yogi be not alone
You fear my talent although you I never dissed
Now it's my turn superstar but just answer me this
Don't try you know you'll miss

So you better change your location

Mo Thug be the love
Slug for the perfect picture
Chronic bud to save your struggles
So somebody suffer, scriptures
Time to rip ya, hit ya really good
I'll split ya, ditch ya
Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane
Bone, II Tru, Hustla'z, and Shifters (We are the soldiers!)
Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets
Where they playin' for keeps, so fake soldiers...

[Mo! Hart]
Late hours of the eve
Now brothas out schemin'
Tryin' to break your heart
Gotta alleviate the problem before it even start
Sit relax and never losin' my composure
Brotha done told ya, better beware
'Cause this Mo Thug click got plenty of soldiers
Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die
Never esitate don't flip
I can pin you all in them disguises
So if you want to come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

[Jhaz]
why'all want no lovin' to a sister flowin'
Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

[Souljah Boy:]
It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)
With a MAC-10, reactin' like you really want to know what's happenin'
Down with buckin' why'all with me strap and best a be duckin'
'Cause I'm blastin' real fast when I see fake-ass O.G.'s

[Ken Dawg]
I'm ridin' real; Mo Thug is where I be
I'm down with Ken
So put 'em up as I cock the pistols
Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many want to roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go
So let's make our dough, for sure

I gotta get mine
And scream out, ""Mo! (Mo! Mo!)""
And let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone
Mo Thugs'll follow
Chain gang remainin' the same
Flamin' my dank, and drinkin' brew
Think about that hangin', clockin' my bank
And thuggin' with trues, fools, you know it

Close enough for ya to let ya know
It's do or die forever, ridin' together (we're ridin' together)
'Til the day of the stormy weather
Pleasure and pain is all in this trip
Only scripts to flip is these old Mo Thug hits
This click of soldiers, who keep it real until the end
Some green in their hand, and we in it again, right

[Brina]
Let a sista nip this in the bud
You can't face me, this playa
Hell of a rhyme, sayin' these family scriptures
The last to remain by sneakin' up on you, backdoor
Hear 'Brina comin' relentlessly bustin'
Trues bringin' the drama for them bustas, never no bluffin'
No, gotta run my game tight
Never know weaklings, when a sista fall victim hit 'em
We Cleveland original money makers up in your system

[Boogy Nikke]
It's the Mo Thug Family Scripture
We singin', my people and me
Ya better believe the family tree's much deeper
Than what you see and believin'
Hey, gotta give up peace to the love inside of my halo
Gotta stay headstrong for soldiers
Like I told ya we need peace (Dear Lord, can you help me?)
(Never forget) to pray for the people
'Cause when you need 'em, they there
You better beware Mo Thugs' steppin' with weapons
We comin' with the word of the Lord
To teach the people not knowin', we showin'
It's Armageddon again, we comin'
Better be ready, boy (I'm ready)
You better be teachin' your people
To write when this day's done, pray soldier boy

We soldiers trapped in this world
Don't step in our face or my bullets ?
Fed up with these haters, I'm breakin' 'em up
'Cause they fakers, and fakers fakin'
Pullin' them gat on Mo Thugs
But ain't no soldiers, this lunatic get the chrome
Now they get gone (on the dark
'cause the gat flipped) with them roll
And handlin' them demons makin' me crazy
Knowin' that Gates can't be fucked with
When I'm swangin' them thangs
I'm feelin' ?, and I'm bustin' men
Gotta load me clip when I rip
Then slip them slugs up out the chamber
Shoulda flexed upon me, stranger

Busta, you in danger
Tell 'em they in danger

[Mo Thugs Family]
All consequence

[Krayzie]
I take it that flippin'
Realize what it is that you have missed
Attention: be down for the family
That don't get no realer than this
Now what you gonna do when that won't get better, man?
You playin' within the game
That's why we done train and prayin' everyday
Family never divided
You heard it before, but this time you can buy
Some bustas fell off, we leave 'em behind
I'm mean we tried, but they could not fall in line
So this is what we've done, hell: eliminated haters, every one
Keepin' it real, makin' a mill
How do you feel? (I just want a mill, mill)

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Steady puttin' it down
Just the way we told ya Mo Thug soldier got ya
Back at it, (postin')
Puttin' your face on the ground
Murdered execution style, leavin' 'em roasted
All the while I'm servin' you hookas solution ?
Don't you wonder why niggas that hate me die?
With my family multiply
Scriptures be puttin up the tracks
Takin' a journey deep on the darkside
If you want fuck with
You better have the heart to handle the pressure
'Cause my niggas surin' to test
Weak niggas prove you ain't hard
Step with your ho-card, remind them of the St. Clair style
How we do it always, keep foldin'
Flippin' through the pages of literature

Recreatin' my heart and cleansed my soul
And now it's time to roll, but the Lord done blessed me
And Mo Thug to see a lot of places, baby
Playa hation has stopped that plannin', now they prayin'
Dear Lord, before You blow Your horn
And open up Your door like Matthew's verse
? said You comin' in the scripture
Better be ready, boy
I'm ready to make a change within myself
And bow down to the playa haters
Shady ladies still be drivin' me crazy, baby
But I don't stress about this evil, dirty position
In my possession I want my wings to match my halo
While I'm steppin', baby - I step to the Lord with my tattooed tear
Because I repent, I'm searchin' for peace
I'm tired of the beast within (the beast within)

(Chorus)

[Mo! Hart]
An angry child growin' up in this world of confusion
Tried not to give in to the ways of evil and disillusion
Daddy was a tyrant, still raisin' hell whenever hostile
Didn't have the right guidance, 'cause bro was always in the hospital
Anger clouds my mind in repeated repititions
When I lay down at night to close my eyes
I feel vicious ass-whippins
Commandments say ? honor thy Father
Each time I look around, somethin' seems to get that much harder
But just like my man Daniel, I can stand the test of time
But my mind does tend to wander away at times
But all the while, I stay strong, and I keep my faith
Try not to flip out when I got you hungry lions in my face
Steady schemin' on a way to come up off of me
Please, Lord, help me
Deliver me from this agony (this agony)

(Hook)
God grant serenity for the sins that's in a me
Keep me from hurt, harm, and danger, and be a friend to me
(The Lord is my shepherd - I shall not want
He makes me lie down in green pastures
He rests me beside the still waters
He restores my soul)

[Tony Tone]
I gotta save my soul, soul
I gotta save my soul
Turn to the Lord, 'cause times are bad
You know it's almost time to go
Searchin' for peace and I'm on my knees
God, please set me free
In Jesus' name, I don't want these sins within
You're my only friend, givin' us one life to live
And I give my all to You, but demons' schemin'
Thinkin' this Hustla's slippin', really got me trippin'
Listen, stay on my mission
That's my ticket to get to Heaven
Doin' wrong has got me stressin'
But I thank You for my blessings
Givin' me a chance to change my life and repent, but it's so hard
Just been in situations facin' the devil
Where's my God? I know give way when He come
These wicked streets just ain't no fun
We killin' each other with guns
Yet You gave Your one and only son
He died for us, 'cause peace is all we need
Better believe in Thee, and you will see that
He is what we need to rest in peace and live eternally

It's almost over, gotta repent and cleanse your soul

They were just a reflection of your self-respect.

But now I let it whiz on by.
You can't tell me LB can't fly!
Kiss my wings, you can't hypnotize me!
Hear the M-singer singin' this bye-bye.
I changed my mind bout this here relationship
That you've become so complacent with.

I've changed my mind.
You've sacrificed everything we had
For a happenin' price.
Changed my mind, plain and simple
Now tame and gentle
Changed my mind, I tried
I kept it quiet now why the hell

Poets of the Fall,"Times when I just can't
Bring myself to say it loud
Afraid that what I'll say comes out somehow awry

That is when it seems
We move in circles day to day
Twist the drama out f the play to get us by

And it feels like fear
Like I'll disappear
Gets so hard to steer
Yet I go on
Do we need debate
When it seems too late
Like I bleed but wait
Like nothing's wrong

You lift my spirit, take me higher, make me fly
Touch the moon up in the sky, when you are mine
You lift me higher, take my spirit, make it fly
Where all new wonders will appear, oh

Like the other day
I thought you won't be coming back
I came to realize my lackluster dreams

And among the schemes
And all the tricks we try to play
Only dreams will hold their sway and defy

When it feels like fear
Like I'll disappear
Gets so hard to steer
Yet I go on
Do we need debate
When it seems too late
Like I bleed but wait
Like nothing's wrong

You lift my spirit, take me higher, make me fly
Touch the moon up in the sky, when you are mine
You lift me higher, take my spirit, make it fly
Where all new wonders will appear, oh

You lift my spirit, take me higher, make me fly
Touch the moon up in the sky, when you are mine
You lift me higher, take my spirit, make it fly
Where all new wonders will appear

Take me higher

Make me fly
Take me higher

More than you know it, I'm aware 
Of this connection that we share 
Yeah I know it seems like sometimes I don't care 
But you are the colours that I wear 
It's been a few hours, nearly dawn 
You've been real quiet all along 
Now I cannot help but think there's something wrong 
Hey baby what's going on? 

3 AM we seemed alright (Couldn't be better, couldn't be better) 
On our way into the light 
Now 3 AM is gone 
Along with where there's nothing wrong 
3 AM we seemed alright 

If I have been thoughtless, let me know 
I can take a hint you know 
Though I'm a little slow 
Just don't keep it in you 
Lest it take root and grow 
The bottom line here is I love you so 

3 AM we seemed alright (Couldn't be better, couldn't be better) 
On our way into the light 
Now 3 AM is gone 
Along with where there's nothing wrong 
3 AM we seemed alright 

3 AM we seemed alright (Like never better, like never better)

Poets of the Fall,"Sometimes I know there is nothing to say 
So, do I pick up my puzzle and just walk away? 
Do I follow my conscience? 
Am I mock sincere? 
I don't know what I'm doing here 

I have a knack for perceiving things 
I can see how it sounds 
I can feel how it sings 
When you paint me an image of who you are 
I know it's the best by far

Don't, don't, don't say you care

I'm gonna give it my all 

Riding along with this train of thought 
I see everything 
I find all I sought 
And I try to kick the habit of trying to reach

So please...

Don't, don't, don't mess with me 

I'll say it's not surprising 
You're sweet talking, mesmerizing 
Juicy and appetizing, true 
But will I need to get over you? 
Feels like my sun is rising 
Tick tick tick, synchronizing 
Readjusting, organizing me 
Is this fiction reality? 
Bless the uncompromising 
With no shame for advertising 
When my needs go through downsizing 
I need someone to pick up my beat 
My dreams need realizing, candles on sugar icing 
Judgment and harmonizing 
Or it'll end up like before 

Don't, don't, don't mess my hair 
If all you do is fake it 
Don't, don't, don't say you care

Poets of the Fall,"Silly thoughts of small deeds. 
Everything that once answered to your needs. 
The thoughtless but kind. 
The caring but blind. 
Everything fades away.

Everything fades away, 
Come turning of the tide. 
For your love I'm sorry. 
For your pain, don't worry. 
Everything fades away.

Silhouettes and false leads. 
That which drew you, 
Like a crow to glass beads. 
Secrets spied. 
Wishes sighed. 
Everything fades away.

Lonely street signs
Power lines

Flashing by

And we keep driving into the night

Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

Your breath
Hot upon my cheek
And we crossed
That line

You made me strong
When I was feeling weak
And we crossed
That one time

Screaming stop signs
Staring wild eyes
Keep on flashing
Flashing by

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye

And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye

The devil grins from ear to ear when he sees the hand he's dealt us
Points at your flaming hair and then we're playin' hide and seek

And find a way to break the fall, find out the cure for all

Poets of the Fall,"I'd stay the hand of god, but the war is on your lips
How can I brace myself for razor blades on whips
When everything with meaning is shattered, broken, screaming
And I'm lost inside this darkness and I fear I won't survive

I could pray and trick with a double tongue, but the only fool here's me
I choose the way to go, but the road won't set me free

Poets of the Fall,"I've walked the distance, I paid my dues and tried to have a go at what I thought I knew was real, held
No appeal
I've been to places, I've seen the tidings,
I bought a book of rules for every coin that I could steal
And so I came to gaze upon the stars, when they were yet unborn
And consequently, tear at my old scars, and the mask I had outworn

So when I'm crying alone
Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone

Grow me a garden of roses
Paint me the colors of sky and rain
Teach me to speak with their voices
Show me the way and I'll try again

I've heard the rumors, started fires, I sowed a sordid lot of plays for keeps for what I need, behold
The demons that I freed
I've tried my best at wearing the hard hat, but healing doesn't seem to happen when you hide away the
Seed
And so I came across the medicine man, and he showed me what I'd forlorn 
For if I'm stayed it happens by my own hand, and my own voice full of scorn

So when I'm crying alone
Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone

Grow me a garden of roses
Paint me the colors of sky and rain
Teach me to speak with their voices
Show me the way and I'll try again

Without you I'm nothing at all
And life has the face of a morbid game
With you nothing seems impossible
It all seems to fit the frame

So when I'm crying alone
Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone

Grow me a garden of roses
Paint me the colors of sky and rain
Teach me to speak with their voices
Show me the way and I'll try again

Oh, the things you see
Makes ignorance bliss for you and me, yeah,
When arrogance does publicity, 
Smiling happily

It's a merry go round and around and around

The begging boy becomes the begging man
The zealot never saves the sacrificial lamb
And a child want's to know if the Candyman can

Everybody want's the fancy car

So you can hold your head up high come what may

Poets of the Fall,"Looking at the road that rises up ahead
I thought I'd learned a thing or two
But this is where it's all made new
N' I gotta throw my hands up
I can't go on if I can't stop

Look the leaves are dead
The moments gone, there's no surrender
Forever now unsaid
The words that might've warmed December
'cause it's all inside your head
Like fragments of a dream you remember
So never mind, your clever mind, never mind me

Staring at the ceiling from my bed
I thought I'd earned a chance or few
Thought I'd be paid in due
Time isn't made for waiting
Past isn't worth debating

Look the leaves are dead...

Feeling like a fool again
Just need a new direction
A new beginning , a new beginning
I can't hold back and I can't hold on
It's all about gratification
See me running, see me running

Look the leaves are dead.
",Clevermind,2008
Poets of the Fall,"In these days of man made wonders we still bicker over flies
When you come seeking for forgiveness, I'll be forced to choose my side

If I deny you what you're searching, do I do it out of fear
Am I ruling out my reason, killing that which I hold dear

Out of my way I'm running, with an excuse just underway
Reality's so daunting, and I've got no way to explain

Cos when you're sleeping right next to me, I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name, why do I turn away and run
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds, sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds, diamonds for tears

In the light of recent findings, there's no greater taint than grace
But to relinquish all our bindings, always finds us out of place

If I rested here a while more, would you hold me to your heart
If I knew what it's meant for, would I know to play my part

Out of my way I'm leaving, another excuse before I'll stay
Reality's applauding, I know I don't know the right way

Cos when you're sleeping right next to me, I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name, yeah, I know you're the one
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds, sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds, diamonds for tears

Is it a lost cause 
Can we overlook this taint
Are these the dead laws
Like a doubt eating the saint

And though I fear these shackles, like my darkness closing in
I will hold out my hands, I will hold out my hands

Cos when you're sleeping right next to me, I know you're the one

There beside yourself, choking our tears
And you aced avoiding possibility
When you placed your bed's on bittersweet

Oh now don't you worry
No need to be sorry
Time to still lightly

'cause the love you used to feel's still there, inside
It may be a faded photograph, but I know you care, so don't hide it
If you're scared, I'm here beside you,
If you get lost I'm here to guide you
And I'll give you peace when peace is fragile
Love is all the good in you 
Love is peace when peace is fragile

You've been going out of way to agree
Like you've been rubbing yourself all wrong just to be somebody else's genie
Catering to your disasters every need
Waiting to finally be set free

I said baby don't worry
Life will carry
Just take it slowly

'cause the love you used to feel's still there, inside
It may be a faded photograph, but I know you care, so don't hide it

",Fragile,2008
Poets of the Fall,"She can see about four satellites every minute of the hour
And find a four leaf clover where you never saw a flower
She's habitually paradoxical, a parallel perpendicular

Barefoot in nightgowns, that's how she dances in the rain
Sundown to sundown, like she was washing 'way her pain

As she is beautiful, she's unpredictable
Damned irresistible, is it plausible to hate her
She is my common sense, revels on decadence
But what's the difference, it's impossible to bait her

She can really be a handful like the brownies that she bakes you
It can be a tad hysterical, but never quite the breakthrough
She's some kind of an epitome, the sea of intranquility

In flimsy nightgowns, barefoot she dances in the rain
Sundown to sundown, like she was washing 'way her pain

As she is beautiful, she's unpredictable
Damned irresistible, is it plausible to hate her
She is my common sense, revels on decadence
But what's the difference, it's an impossible debate
",Miss Impossible,2008
Poets of the Fall,"Yeah decency, she done left our home
On her rollerskates, so I guess she's pretty far gone
Left me with my greed, to answer for my own
For how could a deadened sense tell right from wrong

So thanks for nothing I ain't feeling the magic
Kinda comic how I got tragic
Mirror mirror on the wall
What do you give someone ho has it all

More, just to be sure
I got what I wanted, so naturally I want more
What I paid for, entertain me now
All I want is more, 'cause I like it
Too good to let it go, keep it coming
'cause I want more, 'cause I'm not sure
What I really wanted, so all I want is more

Yeah modesty, her rule now overthrown
Packed her teddybear, so as not to go alone
Left me with my pride to live beneath a stone
For how could an amputee ever pick a bone

So tell me something, isn't this a bit drastic
My smiles are turning to plastic
Mirror mirror on the wall
What's the secret for staying droll

You know it isn't particularly funny

All about the money, all about the money
All about the money, all about the money

I'll be the super-absorbent-man, watch them flock to me in single file
And I'll need to do it with style, I need to keep me up to date
Swallowing the sun run another mile, it's overrated how we underrate

I dance in tune with what I fear
To do adrenaline
Completely rapt with what I hear
When passion colors everything
The songs I sing, from way out there to deep within
The face I wear behind my grin
The price I've paid for my original sin
Everything, everything, everything

I have a mind for simple things, but things are not of mind to simplify
There's always some loophole technicality you buy into and pay until you die
Money doesn't bring me joy, it's more like a darling dead weight
And I seem to have lost my appetite, it's underrated how we overrate

I dance entangled with my dear
She pulls my every string
Completely trapped yet never here
When passion colors everything...

Parade the rain on my parade
Before I'm back to my defenses
To watch the whole thing escalate

And so out of place
That you can see anything there that you wish
Kiss my bliss
It's like I'm a welcoming freakshow doormat
Held in awe while growing fat in the head
This is where we all should see red
A big fat wet slab of red

And I see that it makes me anti everything
And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin

Revelation leading to my psychosis and inspiration
Digest another hallucination, psychosis by recreation
Happy till the next deterioration, psychosis

For you it's a different notion of music and motion
A dance of lights, a prosaic ocean
A delicate, nearly transparent creation of somebody's soul on the screen
Has caught you in between
Of somebody's life on the stage and somebody's life on the frontpage
And this is where we all should see red
A big fat laughing mouth of red

And I see that it makes me anti everything
And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin

Seems to be the recipe for a new sensation
Think it's gonna make a trendy revolution
Quite the contribution to the unnatural selection

Never goes out of season

It never stops as it turns, there ain't no passion, yet it burns
Introducing my prison

Losing myself in this place, soon I'm gone without a trace
Freed with that final incision

Look my heart it's a bird, it needs to sing and to be heard
Not this clockwork precision

And the machine grows idiotic
Who's gonna be its ingenious critic

Everybody loves the perfect solution
To beat the odds against the poorest possible substitution
What you see is never what you're gonna get
Everybody's playing revolution roulette

Leaves you no arguments to trade, you can try the key or you can wait
But the lock will not open

So you're left with sanity to lose, 'cause the machine is a ruse
Another invention to rule them

It's like a fistful of snake eyes, a hand grenade with bye byes
Like a million spent on nothing

It's kinda like a pick in their lock, when you never went ""knock knock, hello, anybody home?
I'm coming in"".
With a touch of foreboding

And the machine grows parasitic
Who's gonna criticize the good critic

There ain't no trick to winning double what you bet

Would that make it excellent, yeah
If I wanna be the one
Should I book me an interview
To get an audition

N' I need your love the most when I least deserve it

Gotta get a shot of something
Before I'll enter the ring
Gimme just a minute, just a minute

Did I really cut open the goose
Just to lose what's in it

Should I open my wrist again
To find the way in
Yeah, if I wanna be the one

Poets of the Fall,"Today is in the air
Again today another incident that just went off
No way this time I will not take the blame
It's pretty obvious who need to shut up
Ashtrays filled with the fruits of our transgression
Here and there sarcasm overflows
To stay I'll need this sitcom to be re-run till I get the gist of just how it goes

So what would you have me do?

Give me a reason c'mon now make my day'cause I'm out of cheeks to turn the other way
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel.

Somehow I've been blindsided by my own kindhearted notion of just who we are
No doubt we'd have collided anyway with the indicted and you raising alarm
First round I'll take my bows into my corner take my vows regroup and run back again
Bloodhound and off no better pedigree than what you see so you could not offend
Did I act like a fool 'cause I didn't know what to do when you gave me just a little bit more than I bargained for a little too much in my hands when my hands are tied

It's the ultimate fling to go frolicking licking the muck from the soles of the boots of your pride every time you lied

Give me a reason c'mon now make my day'cause I'm out of cheeks to turn the other way
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel

Gime me a reason c'mon now make my day
Spoken my pleas now someone's gotta pay ask yourself just how lucky do you feel

Lines that speak the truth without a sound
In your eyes awaits the tireless hunger
Already looks for prey to run down

So why do we keep up this charade
How do we tell apart the time to leave from the time to wait

What does tomorrow want with me
What does it matter what I see
If it can't be my design
Tell me where do we draw the line

The dance of flames and shadows in the street
Make poetry nobody's ever heard
The weight of loneliness stands on your feet
The cage already there around the bird

So why don't we join the masquerade
Before it all falls apart before our love becomes insatiate

What does tomorrow want with me
What does it matter what I see
If I can't choose my own design
Tell me where do we draw the line

Where's the cooling wind
Where's the evergreen field
Where's my mother's open arms
Where's my father lionheart
S'like the sun's gone down
Sleeps in the hallowed ground now
With the autumn's browns leaves
With the one who never grieves

What does tomorrow want with me
What does it matter what I see
If we all walk behind the blind
Tell me where do we draw the line

Whatever tomorrow wants from me
At least I'm here, at least I'm free
Free to choose to see the signs
This is my line

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

For fear of the truth oh
Should I take the blame
Or should I stand in your way
Or is it too much too late

Look into my eyes
I'm dazed by the light
It took me by surprise
Your sadness last night
Maybe it is fate that
We made this mistake
Now it's too much too late

What about us
Are you scared enough
That you need someone to run to
What about us
Are you strong enough
To throw the dream away
What about us
Are you scared enough
That you need someone to run to
Reality come back to me

Look into the past
Reflect on the pain
Did we move too fast
While feelin' the strain
Why are we feelin' this hate
Now it's too much too late

What about us
Baby got to realise
Ooh come on you know
You got me hypnotised out to control
Got no soul at the stage of the game
The danger of the roll of the dice playin'
Around with our lives
Makin' all the decisions no alibis
Let's feel the flow come on lock the door
Don't cuss 'n' tell me some
I wanna know about us

Cause hearts fail on all sides

For so long, I never thought I'd find you

In your refuge of love

Guess I believed you'd come and go
Like every other love in my life
And, oh, I tried you so
Yet faithfully, your patience won my willingness
And slowly it became clear to me
That you gave you life
So I could spend mine in...

Sometimes we don't see eye to eye
We don't agree, we don't know why

So for the sake of god's own son
Can we put away our differences
Lay down our pride
I think it's time we start turning the tide

Shall we gather at the river of forgiveness
Come together at the waters of love
Flowing like a fountain from the mercy giver
Shall we gather at the river

The ones we're called by christ to love
But there's redemption at the riverside
The water's deep, the water's wide
It can wash away our bitterness
The current is strong
I think we've been out in the desert too long

Where the healing waters flow
It only takes a little
To heal a wounded soul
It will only bring us closer

In this tangled web we weave
But tomorrow may just be ok
See here's what I believe

Better days are on the way my friend
Just a ways on down the line
I believe that just around the bend
Everything's gonna be fine
Better days are just a dream right now

Bringing us better days

Well the storms won't stop descending
And the rain won't cease to fall
And there ain't no use pretending
Cause it's bound to find us all
Well it's easy to get hopeless
And drive yourself insane
But before you stop and set up shop
In the middle of the pain
Remember

About attitudes and positive thinking

Everyone, watch and pray that the sun will shine on a brighter day
Join your hands, lift them high for this gift of life

When love came down, at Christmas time
When love came down, at Christmas time
When love came down, at Christmas time
When love came down, at Christmas time

So close your eyes and share the dream
Let everyone on earth believe
The child was born, the stars shone bright
And love came down at Christmas time

Close your eyes and share the dream
Let everyone on earth believe
The child was born, the stars shone bright
And love came down at Christmas time
And love came down at Christmas time
",When Love Came Down,1999
Point of Grace,"God's passion is an endless river
White water running wild
In a restless rushing fury
To see souls reconciled.
It reaches wide across forever
It's dangerous and deep
And while some venture to the shoreline
Some even dare to leap
Chorus:
And The River rages, The River runs
All through the ages, Long after I'm gone
There's a truth I'm finding I can't ignore
Whether I dive in or stand on the shore
The River keeps rushing on.
All of those who ride the rapids
Have a message they must tell
There's a joy in being lost in something
That's bigger than yourself
And though the current takes you places
Where you learn to lose control
If you think you're going under
He'll never let you go, never let you go
Chorus
",The River,1999
Point of Grace,"I've tried to wrap my mind around the thought of you
I stretched myself so far I nearly come unglued
You hold the universe inside your hands
Still you thought of me

I can't believe
Is there no limit to your love for me
As shallow as this selfish heart can be
You are the maker of reality

And I stand in awe
You are God

[Chorus]
Who am I
To understand your ways
Who am I
To give you anything but praise
Who am I
To try and solve the mystery
Behind the heart and soul of all that I believe
Who am I

You're every reason for my heart to hope
Creator of the things I've yet to know
You are the river for my thirsty soul
You are my desire
You are God

[Chorus]

I am your child
I will follow, who am I?
You gave your life
For my tomorrow

[Chorus]",Who Am I,1999
Point of Grace,"I'd just as soon try and count
The stars up in the sky
And look for all the raindrops in
The river rolling by
Stand a better chance to know
How many granders sail
Than to measure the love there is
Between His outstretched hands
Oooh, God's love
Forever on and on
Oooh, God's love
Forever on and on
(On and on)
Every passing hour shows
The time is running out
The voice of Heaven is calling out
To a heart that's losing ground
Though the pain in this world we know
Is coming to an end

An eternity begin

deep down inside where my fears are hiding.
Whisper so tender the way that you do.
There's a love that's forever

Reach for a star and I long to hold you.
How can this love be so simple for you?
That you reach out and touch me,
