Fats Navarro,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,1999
Fats Navarro,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1999
Fats Navarro,"Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart

Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you",Guilty,2000
Fats Navarro,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Fats Navarro,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you

Above all, I want my arms about you!

For everything that love could bring you brought me

Never tell me dreams come true

Ever tell me he will care

It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

Underneath my finger tips
Tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah
I love to have a supple melody
Just tricklin' off o' my lips

And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?

Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

And invite the Vanderbilts to tea?

Interviews and pictures in the press
What a way to speak on twenty bucks a week
Don't forget that Rockefeller started out on less

Everything we touch will turn to clover
In the magic land of what's to be
But until your baby puts it over
Baby, have a little dream on me

In the magic land of what's to be
Till your daddy puts it over, skip it

And he said:are you going my way, baby, can I take you there?

It was the first warm night spring, and love was everywhere. I didn't think twice as I jumped into his ride, streeetlights flashing by, as I whispered in his ear.

CHORUS:
Put the ride on cruise control, loose your drop top tune into that old school soul, baby, close your eyes and kiss me. Baby, make me loose control. She was so hot couldn't keep keep my eyes on the road, then she touched me.

Smooth ride down the road side underneath a starlit sky (I'm beside you).
Relax, sit back and enjoy the ride I'll put into auto drive are you down to be my boo?
Baby, we can take this anywhere you wanna go. 
Oh girl, tell me what you really like, there's no
Wrong or right, and that's just what we'll do.
Let me ease your body, babe, from head to toe,
Gently move it closer take it nice and slow. I couldn't resist such a sweet tender kiss, time stood still, it felt like perfect paradise.

Tell me what should I do, what should I say.
I'm lost for words so I'm coming to you, sistas.
Will you help me, see I don't know, where to start, to find the keys to win over a woman's heart.
Well first, things to remember when your game comes into play.
Gain your composure show respect and you'll be okay, because the ladies really like it when.
When you don't succeed, don't get offended.
Listen when she speaks and don't pretend.

[Chorus:]

Yeah she says that she like you, too, but she's too shy come and talk to you so.
Boy, you have to make that move if you want her to be yours.
[Verse 2:]
Show me a man that will be me, love.
Love me for me.
I'm not asking much.
See true love don't come easily and if it's meant to be, it happens natuarlly.
If you don't look for love, it might actually find you.
Now tell me what you want, what you need.
Cause I be thinking ya'll be bout diamonds, pretty necklaces nice cars, bling bling.
I thought ya'll made it clear, love don't' cost a thing.
Tell me if I'm wrong or right.
I don't want to make the same mistake I made before, she walked out the door cause her love I ignored.
I just want to take my time and explore her world cause, truth be told, I really like this girl.

[Chorus]

Now it don't matter the size of your bankroll.
Cause I'm an independent women, I can take care of my own.
I don't care bout your escalade or your sprees sitting on chrome.
Cause when it comes to a woman, you need a girl that you can take home.

Ooh ooh ooh I like that girl. [2x]

Want you to be down with me like I'm with you, yes, you, girl.
You know you drive me crazy.
Ooh ooh yeah.
You got me saying, ooh ooh yeah.
You got me going, ooh ooh yeah.
You got me singing, ooh ooh yeah.
I'm feeling everything ya'll been talking bout.
And for her it's time for me to kick the player out.
With no doubt it's been running through my mind.

[VERSE 1 (VALURE)]

something about the way you look at me, keeps me wonderin, could this be my destiny, maybe take a chance
At love again, claim you as my man, and spend eternity, with you as my king, sharing every dream,with love
And everything, hold onto me, don't ever leave me, no, keep me in your arms, don't let go

[CHORUS (GABRIELLE AND EDDIE B)]
They say, when you find love, then hold and treasure it, don't let it slip away, could this be love,
Cause it feels right but I'm afraid it might, just be lust

[VERSE 2 (RAP) (RON)]

could this be lust or love that I feel for ya, 'cause if it's not love tell you now wat's up, I don't wanna
Lead you on but it's too late, my intentions were to love you let's conversate, on the real I feel lust
Got the best of me, and I ain't mean to break ya heart, girl, seriously, I'm not sure if this love but
I'll stop frortin, it was a one night stand now we feelin suttin, and if love take ova it'll be alright,
It'll open up our eyes and give us insight, I wasn't planin to raise no family wit chu, but understand
This is real I just met chu, plus we just left the club and you tipsy, you wanna come to my hotel and freak
Me, when you look into my eyes tell me wat chu see, you see a playa from the love and you want me

[CHORUS (GABRIELLE AND EDDIE B)]

[VERSE 3 (EDDIE be AND VALURE)]

there's a old sayin, if you can't get the one you love, love the one you're with, but I'm not positive
That this will be one hundred percent.
I thought that you loved me, you made my heart believe.
I believed it, too, but you expect more than I can do.
But wat about the plans we made, why you gotta be this way??
I'm not sayin I'm not in love wit chu, but I'm not ready to commit so soon.
But it wasn't too soon, to take wat you need.
Don't drown in fantasies, cheak reality, I gotta be a man for me.

I'm tired of you pushin' luck 
It's all the stupid things that you do 
That makes me so fed up with you (here we go)

Here you go talk talk talking again
Need to cut the act out cause its just pretend
What you say is not fair (no that ain't fair)
And if you know me better than you'll realize I don't care

But when you don't think (I don't care)
You do flawless things I'm just giving you fair warning
About the hurt and pain

I'm fine without caring don't try to scare me
Your words don't mean $hit to me so I won't let it get to me No

But who will be your friend that day when you fall
And when you need someone to talk to who can you call 

No I don't need nobody else but me and myself
Don't mean to seem selfish but I can't help it

What it all boils down to through all the hate she still loves you
Wait a minute the bottom line 
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right 
By the end of the damn day it's not about what you had to say 
She's you sister why can't you make up make the past be gone
So you can move on (Move on)

Stop listen up
No I ain't tryin to hear it now
So why am I wastin time if you being childish
We're just two women comersing so why are you so upset
Your not a women yet (Silly me how could I forget)
So what's the deal with you and your main friend (you wanna know)
When are you going to break it off with him 
It's over
Whatever
Go mind your own
I think it's best that I leave you (me) alone

So you can move on (Move on)

Can't stand the things you say (don't you ever shut up)
Choices that you make
Why do 
Why do you keep hating on me 
Girl your so clueless your foolish you don't understand
Oh you could never be me 
When will you understand I can't change who I am
You're to damn stubborn to receive hate 
So what
That's your problem
Oh well
Can I help you 
Please

Like a perfect ten in a magazine were the girls that caught my eyes
Sophisticated queen with the sex appeal
Beauty no less than a dime
But the girl that really caught my heart wasn't anything like that at first glance you wouldn't see it...
But she was really bad
-papasito, venconmigo
-dejame demostrar a ti
-que tu no puedes ver
-la mujer (marya-dentro) de mi

[Chorus:]
She's just an average girl
Ain't got no mink and pearls still she's like royalty
She's a princess in disguise
She's got a heart of gold
Within a tale untold, that's where her beauty lies
She's a princess in disguise
Her smile is like a twinkle in the sky
A diamond in the ruff with the heart of a child
Her true beauty is more then skin deep
Because the essence of a women is hidden underneath

-tomame al castillo que estan en los nubes
Hasme princesa de tu corazon, mi serviente de amor

No matter where I look, it can't get no better than this
My princess, my goddess, you came from up above
I'll treat you like royalty, with all my love

And his faithful heart would not consider any other wife.
For three years peaceful joy midst the rushes of the pond,
Proud and gentle was the loving of the last two island swans.

Their love was like a circle, no beginning and no end,
With his lady by his side a treasure and best friend.
And the pond was all so peaceful with the rising of the sun,
Young and free like the island breeze their life was just begun.

'Til a dread day in November when the searing cold did start,
Stalked the hunter with his bow, he put an arrow through her heart.
Husband come to my side let your feathers warm my pain,
For I feel I will not spend another day with you again.

And the cold winds blow,
He was brave but he's laid low.
By her body in the isle of mist,
I saw him give her one last cold kiss,
One last cold kiss.

Of swans the people talk of only one in this days tide,
They brought him twenty ladies he would take no other bride.
They say he will not move from the place where she did fall,
Once so proud he's beaten now, he will not speak at all.

He was brave but he's laid low.

For someone like you to remain on side
And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide

I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know
Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain so sure
And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl

Faultline,"I slipped away last night
Took me away from sight and the place I know
All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch I threw

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain on side
And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide

Von Edelmut und reinem Herz will ich nun erzählen.
Auf langer Reise mit der schönsten aller Frauen
Hab ich deren Zauber die Welt verändern sehen.

Und nun beginne ich ihr Wesen zu verstehen.
Und warte wie die Vögel auf das erste morgen Lied
Das mein Leid voll Wonne muss vergehen.

Von den Elben bat mein Herz verzehrend.
Denn Niemals kann’s euch Reinheit in dieser Welt bestehen.
Noch seh' ich ihre helle Haut
Noch höre ich ihr Abendlied

Bring mich nach Haus

Of paradise, where roses grew

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Fausto Papetti,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1998
Fausto Papetti,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way,1999

For me and you my part-time lover 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 
If I'm with friends and we should meet 
Just pass me by, don't even speak

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Ces endroits qui faisaient taire le vacarme
De mes idées noires

Les sommets qui jouent les mâchoires
Et ta cage thoracique se resserre
Quand tu les regardes de haut en bas

Emmène-moi revoir juste pour un soir
Le vert fluo des rizières
Qui triomphèrent de ma colère
Et consolèrent mon désespoir

Emmène-moi revoir une dernière fois
Ces choses qui faisaient sauter
Mes pensées périmées

La poussière orange des sentiers
Le béton brûlant de Miami
Et puis aussi les gens
Qui dansent à Tivoli

La jungle urbaine de Port Royal
Sniper Alley et ses tramways
Qui domptaient ma part animale
Au mois d'avril et au mois de mai

Il faut vraiment qu'on reparte le plus vite possible
Parce que tu sais que là
Ça devient carrément insupportable

Il faut qu'on se noie encore une fois
Dans les nuits fauves
Et les grands soirs
Qu'on récupère un peu d'espoir

Et tous les autres ensembles 
Trompe-toi, sois imprudent, tout n’est pas fragile 
N’attends rien que de toi, parce que tu es sacré
Parce que tu es en vie 
Parce que le plus important n’est pas ce que tu es, mais ce que tu as choisi d’être

Qu’est-ce qu’il te prend de faire des trucs pareil? 
Pourquoi tu te fais du mal comme ça? 
Qu’est ce qui ne va pas? Parle-moi, tu sais que tu peux tout me dire

Si tu nous entends, attends-nous! On arrive 
On voudrait : tout comprendre, tout savoir, tout voir, tout vivre 
On cherche la porte du nouveau monde pour pouvoir s’y fondre en grand

Si tu nous entends souviens toi que t’es pas tout seul. Jamais

Qu’on s’embrasse, qu’on soit des milliards de mains sur des milliards d’épaules

Pour en faire sortir les choses qui blessent.
Grâce à la parole, réussir à s'armer
Contre les sales pensées et faire des plans, 
Serrer les poings, serrer les dents 
Les cogner, leur rentrer dedans.
Essayer d'attraper les syllabes à la volée 
Pour en faire des bougies qui éclairent 
Et qu'on placera sous les paupières

Qui permet de tout voir. 
Eux, les machine à observer, 
Les machines à mettre des mots sur tout
Eux, qui écrivent plus vite que la pensée 
Et avec ça, ils agrandissent la vie.
Ils font apparaître les fils 
Qui relient toutes les choses entre elles.
Et ça leur donne le courage de tout affronter, 
Même la Kolyma.

Rien entendu et surtout rien compris.

Faut pas attendre, 
Faut pas attendre qu'il soit trop tard pour dire qu'on tient aux autres
Qu'on a besoin d'eux,
Qu'on plongerait devant es balles rien que pour eux, qu'on sera toujours là.
Faut se dire la vérité, faut oser s'avouer les choses importantes. 
Faut se dire les mots qui font barrage
Qui donnent du courage quand il y a du blizzard. 
Et toi qui nous voit déjà vieux, 
Avec des machins qui nous sortent de partout, des tuyaux des aiguilles.

T’es pas un modèle de vertu
Et puis c’est vrai que t’es pas non plus

D’ailleurs, si on regarde ton corps
Quand tu te mets à poil
Faut bien avouer que tout nu
T’es pas vraiment l’homme idéal

J’ai aussi appris que tu rêvais
D’être Lennon ou McCartney
Qu’est-ce que tu veux, mon vieux?
T’as fais de mon mieux, ça s’est pas fait

Et puis on m’a dit que la nuit
Tu cherchais à revendre ton âme au Diable
Pour qu’il te rende moins laid
Plus fort, aimable et stable

Tu deviens rapidement assez sale

ÇA t’arrive aussi d’être un peu
Libidineux
Quand t’es pas carrément insistant
De faire des trucs pas très élégants
Pour t’excuser le lendemain
Piteusement

Et puis tes coups de sang, tiens
On pourrait en parler aussi
Quand tu sors les crocs

Absolument incalculable

Je sais pas comment tu fais
Pour dérouiller autant
Même si je crois quand même
Qu’à la longue, ça t’a un peu abîmé
En dedans

D’ailleurs on t’entend parfois dire
Des choses étranges
Des trucs pas nets
De parler à l’envers et de raconter des histoires

Fauve,"Je sais même pas par où commencer en fait.
En même temps c'est la première fois que je fais ça,
Donc vous m'excuserez si ça part un peu dans tous les sens
Ou si je suis un peu trop confus.
Faut dire qu'en ce moment j'ai bien du mal à mettre mes idées au clair quand même.
J'ai bien du mal à trouver mes mots.
Enfin voilà, j'vous dresse le tableau vite fait
Je suis né dans une famille plutôt aisée, j'ai toujours été privilégié.
J'ai jamais manqué d'amour, ni de rien d'autre d'ailleurs,
Et même si ma mère, qui vient quand même d'un milieu assez populaire,
Était parfois un peu sévère avec mes frères et moi.
A l'école j'étais bon élève, à la maison j'étais poli.
J'me souviens pas avoir fait trop de conneries étant p'tit.
Par contre, j'ai fait des études correctes,
Et aujourd'hui je sais que mon parcourt est plus ou moins tracé.
Disons que je sais où j'arriverais si je continue sur ma lancé.
J'aurais probablement une femme et de beaux enfants,
Un crédit à payer, un épagneul anglais et un coupé-cabriolet.

Et pourtant vous voyez, ça fait maintenant presque 6 mois que je dors à peine,
Que j'peux n'rien bouffer pendant deux jours sans même m'en apercevoir.
Et quand j'me regarde dans le miroir j'y vois un mec bizarre,
Pâle, translucide, tellement livide, à faire sourire un génocide.
Docteur j'rigole pas, faut que vous fassiez quelque chose pour moi,
N'importe quoi, prenez un marteau et pétez-moi les doigts,
Je sais pas, parce que là je peux vraiment plus.
J'peux plus sortir dans la rue, j'peux plus mettre les pieds dans des bureaux.
De toute façon je suis devenu incapable de prendre le métro.
Ça pue la mort, ça pue la pisse, ça me rend claustro et agressif.
Et puis j'ai vraiment l'air d'un gland dans mon costard trop grand et mal taillé,
Que même si je voulais faire semblant y'aurait toujours marqué en gros ""troufion"" sur mon front.
Et puis tous ces gens qui cherchent absolument à s'entasser,
Qui poussent, qui suent, qui sifflent entre leurs dents comme des serpents.

""Vas-y du con, monte, monte, t'as raison""
De toute façon t'auras beau être le premier arrivé,
À la clef on va tous se taper la même journée scabreuse.
Les yeux collés à l'écran de l'ordinateur,
Tu te détruis les pupilles à lire en diagonal
Des choses auxquelles t'entraves que dalle.
""Non mais tu comprends, il est hyper important ce dossier,
Le client il raque 300 euros de l'heure, alors tu te débrouilles,
Tu vas chercher sur Google si il faut mais tu me finis ça pronto""
""Ah oui, vous avez parfaitement raison, oui.
C'est de ma faute, oui.
Je suis pas assez réactif.
Han c'est drôle, oui, collez-moi des gifles.
Connard, et si t'allais plutôt te carrer des poignées de porte dans le cul pour voir?""

J'en ai assez d'me taper à déjeuner des salades composées à 12 euros,
Ou de la barbaque en carton mouillé.
De manger sur un coin de table,
Puis de passer des après-midis minables à enculer les mouches,
Et finir par embrayer sur des after-works entre collègues.
Mais quel cafard, à croire qu'on aime tellement s'faire enfler la journée
Qu'on en redemande le soir.
Mais bon, faut dire aussi qu'on y rencontre des meufs,
Ou plutôt des célibattantes,
C'est-à-dire des nanas qui comme nous ont des problèmes affectifs.
On se présente, on leur raconte des cracks,
On leur dit qu'on est collab' alors qu'on est à la fac
Et qu'en vrai on passe notre temps à user nos culs sur des bancs trop étroits,
À écouter des types chauves déblatérer, déblatérer, déblatérer toute la journée,
Déblatérer sur tout, et surtout sur n'importe quoi.
Et heureusement, les journées se finissent toujours de la même façon
On rentre et on se fait beau pour la soirée,
On met nos polos cols relevés, puis on se retrouve au Q.G.
Pour picoler des demis à 5 euros.
D'ailleurs, quand on a un peu de plomb dans l'aile,
On a souvent envie de jouer aux rebelles et crier au tôlier
""Dit-donc tu t'prends pour qui enfoiré,
Tu trouves pas que ta bière elle est un peu chère?""
On le ferait si on avait un peu de cran dans nos artères,
Mais on préfère se taire et continuer à gaspiller notre tune,
À user notre salive pour pas grand chose, et à fumer comme des sapeurs,
Histoire de s'amocher à fond avant d'être vieux,
D'agrandir les valoches qu'on a déjà sous les yeux.
A part ça on parle surtout des filles qu'on a vu sur le net,
Et puis d'celles qu'on aimerait attraper en soirée,
Car ce soir, comme tous les soirs, on va essayer de niquer.
Mais surtout pas de faire l'amour, parce que l'amour, c'est pour les pédés.
Rien de bien choquant finalement.
Des gars parlent des filles qui baisent,
Des filles qui baisent pour dire qu'elles baisent.
La baise, on en garde toujours des regrets, parfois des maladies.
Au fond on fait ça sans plaisir, sans réelle envie.
C'est surtout pour ne plus penser.
Ça cache des plaies à vif, mais ça c'est un secret.
En vérité on est perdus, désœuvrés, désabusés, seuls comme des animaux blessés.
On est tristes et nos cœurs saignent,
Mais on se cache derrière nos grandes gueules et nos mots durs.
Entre nous on s'appelle mec, meuf, bâtard, baltringue, bitch, gouinnasse, connard,
Parce que sans le vouloir, les autres sont un combat permanent.
Décidément docteur, on vit une chouette époque, et dans une chouette ville aussi.
Paris, Paris la nécropole, Paris qui sent la carne,
Paris qui petit à petit entraîne dans sa chute des fragments de nos vies.
Paris c'est tellement sain, et nous sommes des gens biens,
Tellement biens qu'on est trop bien pour nos voisins,
Auxquels on prête pas plus d'attention qu'à la pisse derrière la cuvette des chiottes.
Parfois j'ai juste envie de hurler
""T'approche pas de moi, t'approche pas de moi,
Me touche pas, me touche pas, t'approche pas de moi!""
Docteur, il me faut un truc, n'importe quoi, sinon je vais craquer,
Je risque de cogner une vieille, un passant, un mioche.
Et ce sera moche, ce sera vraiment moche.",Sainte Anne,2013

Fauve,"J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière
Quand je me demande ce que je fous ici
Et que je colle ma tête pendant
Des heures sur l'oreiller
Tétanisé, assommé, incapable de rien

J'en ai marre de faire semblant
J'en ai marre de faire comme si tout me glissait dessus
J'en peux plus d'entendre les sirènes
Même à travers le double vitrage

On prend les mêmes et on recommence
Je m'étais décidé à sortir parce que
Je supportais plus d'être chez moi
Je suis allé rejoindre des gens
Dans un de ces pubs irlandais merdiques
Qu'on trouve sur les grands boulevards

À une table sur ma gauche y avait un groupe de filles
Dont une qui m'a tout de suite plu
Elle était un peu mate de peau
Mais avec des cheveux châtains clairs
Ou blonds foncés je sais jamais

Mais surtout elle avait l'air douce
Bienveillante et sereine
Comme si elle avait pas renoncé
À rien, comme si elle avait jamais douté de la beauté du monde
Ni de celles des hommes

Je me suis fait quelques films
Osés mais jolis,
Restait tout de même à établir le contact
Ce qui est impossible à faire en réalité
On nous le fait croire dans les films
Mais c'est une vaste arnaque
Ça m'est retombé dessus d'un coup
Je me suis senti seul, triste et fatigué
J'y arrive pas sans toi,
J'arrive plus à encaisser
Comment est-ce que ça va se finir ?
Comment est ce que je vais faire ?

J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière,
Que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments
Qui fonctionnent plus bien
Que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonines
Que tu me dises que c'est rien
J'ai compris que tu voulais pas de moi pour l'instant,
Mais je me force à croire qu'avec du temps
Tu changes d'avis et dans mes nuits
Je rêve encore que tu m'emmènes danser
Jusqu'au matin

Sur la musique, on va on vient,
On s'éloigne et on revient
Puis tu t'élances et je te tiens
Je te retiens du bout des doigts
Pour te ramener contre moi

Sur la musique, on va on vient,
Corps contre corps, main dans la main
Plus rien n'existe, plus rien de rien
Quand je te tiens du bout des doigts
Pour te ramener contre moi

Je me suis fait tirer de mes pensées
De la pire façon possible,
Une grande claque sur l'épaule,
Le truc que je déteste
Envoyée par un genre de rugbyman pas très discret,
Un gars que je connaissais un peu

Alors ça va l'artiste?
Il me dit,
Les amours, tout ça?
D'ailleurs aux concerts tu dois bien te faire plaisir, mon salaud !
Le genre de choses qui met tout de suite super à l'aise,
Qui te rapproche encore un peu plus de l'eunuque dans son harem
Je lui réponds que ça,
C'est soit un mythe complet,
Soit c'est moi et mes petits camarades qui sommes des manches
Évidemment, il se met à me charrier,
Me dit que c'est pas possible,
Que j'ai un problème, que je suis pédé

Pauvre vieux, si tu savais combien de fois, je me suis posé la question,
Sincèrement qu'est-ce qui déconne chez moi ?
Pourquoi dès qu'il y en a une qui est gentille,
Je me barre en courant ?

Ça m'est retombé dessus d'un coup,
Je me suis senti seul, triste et fatigué
J'y arrive pas sans toi, j'arrive plus à encaisser
Comment est-ce que ça va se finir ?
Comment est-ce que je vais faire ?

J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière,
Que tu me dises que je suis hors de danger
Que mon état va s'améliorer
Que tu passes ta main dans mes cheveux,
Que tu prennes ma vie pour en faire
Quelque chose de mieux
J'ai compris que tu voulais pas de moi pour l'instant,
Mais je me force à croire qu'avec du temps
Tu changes d'avis, et dans mes nuits,
Je rêve encore que tu m'emmènes danser

Plus rien n'existe, plus rien de rien
Quand je te tiens du bout des doigts
Pour te ramener contre moi

J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une cigarette ou d'un verre
A chaque fois que je dois sortir dans la foule

Je me dis que ça peut pas être comme ça,
Qu'il doit y avoir autre chose
Jusqu'ici j'ai pas trouvé des tas de raisons d'exister
Mais j'ai besoin de croire en quelque chose de profond, de solide
J'ai besoin d'être porté par un espoir

Je voudrais faire l'effort permanent et sublime
Je voudrais être à tes côtés, simplement
Pour que la vie ne puisse jamais nous mettre à genoux

J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière,
Que tu m'aides à trouver le sommeil,
Qu'on se réveille dans des draps blancs
Que tu dises que c'était qu'un mauvais rêve,
Que tout ça c'est derrière moi maintenant
J'ai compris que tu voulais pas de moi pour l'instant,
Mais je me force à croire qu'avec du temps,
Tu changes d'avis, et dans mes nuits,
Je rêve encore que tu m'emmènes danser

Les mots qu'on m'avait appris ont disparus,
J'ai du mal à faire des phrases construites comme il faut,
Mais pour une fois j'en ai pas envie,
C'est comme si mon esprit était à moitié éteint,
Qu'une partie était restée avec toi là-bas.
Le paysage défile par la fenêtre du train,
Qui nous emmène à nouveau et j'me dis,

C'est beau les plaines,
C'est beau le mois de juin,
C'était beau hier,
C'était beau ce matin,
C'est beau les filles quand les choses sont douces,
Sans violence ni dépit j'avais failli oublier depuis le temps.
Cette nuit à côté de toi c'était comme du lait,
Comme du coton qui m'a enveloppé de nulle part.
Si on me l'avait dit j'y aurais pas cru,
Alors j'me repasse le film en continu.
Les images de la veille se superposent au détail du wagon,
Elles flottent devant mes yeux comme sur la houle.

J'te revois perdue dans la foule
Avec tous ces mongoles bourrés qui dansent n'importe comment.
Et j'me revois moi essayant de t'atteindre en évitant les gens qui hurlent
Et font des grands gestes absurdes.
Et toi qui attend, terrorisée, au milieu du chaos,
Et puis tes joues et puis ta peau.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
J'me suis perdu, j'ai bu la tasse,
Pour les bras d'une infirmière, j'me suis conduis comme une crasse.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
Mais si tu m'jures, que tout ça c'est du passé,
Alors d'accord on tire un trait, on recommence à s'apprivoiser.

Zoé, Zoé, aujourd'hui j'ai huit ans,
Et j'voudrais qu'ça dure un peu,
J'écoute absolument pas ce qu'on me dit,
J'fais semblant d'être assis à mon siège,
Les gars m'parlent
Mais c'est comme si on était de part et d'autre d'une porte vitrée.
Je regarde le paysage défiler par la fenêtre du train
Qui nous emmène à nouveau,
Et j'me dis,

C'est beau les champs,
C'est beau le mois de juin,
C'était beau hier,
C'était beau ce matin,
C'est beau les filles quand y'a pas de peur, pas de dégoût pas de mépris.
Quand les choses sont limpides,
Cette nuit à côté de toi c'était comme une lueur dans les profondeurs.
J'me suis enfin senti reprendre des couleurs,
Si on me l'avait dit j'y aurais pas cru.
Alors j'me repasse le film en continu.
Les images de la dernière fois se superposent au détail du wagon,
Elles dansent par dessus le monde matériel.

J'te revois sur l'herbe au bord du fleuve,
J'revois la forme des nuages, les péages, les routes, les villages.
Et j'nous revois dans le nuit chaude tout à l'heure.
Le vent dans tes cheveux les lampadaires qui défilent en orange.
Et toi qui t'excuse en pleine rue,
Et puis tes larmes et puis tes bras.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
J'me suis perdu, j'ai bu la tasse,
Pour les bras d'une infirmière, j'me suis conduis comme une crasse.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
Mais si tu m'jures, que tout ça c'est du passé,
Alors d'accord on tire un trait, on recommence à s'apprivoiser.

Zoé, Zoé, aujourd'hui j'ai huit ans,
Et j'espère que toi aussi.
J't'imagine en train d'émerger doucement de cette nuit un peu courte,
Ton pas léger sur le béton nu.
J'croise deux doigts pour que tu sois comme moi,
Dans un état un peu second.
Et qu'tu regarde rêveuse les raild au loin,
En espérant voir passer le train qui nous emmène à nouveau et qu'tu t'dis,

C'est beau l'été,
C'est beau le mois de juin,
C'était beau hier,
C'était beau ce matin,
C'est beau les garçons quand ils sont gentils et droits,
Qu'ils sont vertueux même s'ils sont un peu maladroits
Cette nuit à ses côtés c'était spécial et nouveau,
Et moi qui pensait t'connaître j'me suis trompée.
Si on me l'avait dit j'y aurais pas cru.
Zoé j'espère que tu t'repasse le film en continu.
Que les images se superposent au détail de ta chambre,
Qu'elles flottent au dessus de ton lit défait.

Quand on a traversé la ville dans la chaleur naissante,
Et qu'sur le coup la crasse et la laideur ont parus presque supportables.

Zoé j'ai peur de souffrir comme toi,
J'suis plus habitué à ça.
Je sais pas où ça va nous mener
Mais j'crois qu'il faut qu'on s'donne les moyens d'être fixés.
Faut qu'on se revoit.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
J'me suis perdu, j'ai bu la tasse,
Pour les bras d'une infirmière, j'me suis conduis comme une crasse.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
Mais si tu m'jure, que tout ça c'est du passé,
Alors d'accord on tire un trait, on recommence à s'apprivoiser.",Lettre à Zoé,2014
Fauve,"De ma fenêtre je vois les élèves du lycée Rodin
Qui sortent de cours en poussant des cris de joie,
Les garçons paradent, ils ont l’air plein de sève,
Et les leggings des filles serrent leurs jambes
Et leurs fesses encore fermes
J’aurais bien aimé connaître le lycée public
Apprendre la vie au bon moment
Être à l’aise un peu couillu et effronté faire ma puberté dans les temps
Piquer des trucs dans les supermarchés, perdre mon pucelage tôt,
Me prendre des droites et en redonner quelques-unes en retour sans m’écraser
Mais ça a pas été le cas non loin de là,
Moi j’étais plutôt de ceux qui rasent les murs
Qui font pas de vagues un genre de grenat
Un gentil petit collabo’ coincé du cul et peureux comme y’a pas
Qui fait tout bien comme on lui demande
Qui se lève tôt se couche tôt et travaille quand il faut
Mes parents m’ont pas forcé j’ai fait ça tout seul comme un grand
Puis je me suis obstiné durant des années
Forcement ça a fini par me jouer des tours
Depuis j’essaie de faire avec, j’essaie de faire dévier le sillon
Ce sera pas facile non,
Heureusement j'suis pas seul pour faire taire la voix qui me répète,

Tu seras lâche et impuissant,
Résigné, soumis, déprimant,
Insuffisant, pas adapté, spectateur dans le fossé,
Tu seras tout seul, divorcé, sans enfants, remarié,
Alcolo, adultère, fils indigne, mauvais frère
Tu seras amère, trop sévère
Malheureux toujours en colère
Méprisable, imbuvable, égoïste, insupportable,
Tu seras ce qu’on te dit, tu discutes pas,
Ici-bas c’est comme ça,
T’as compris le jeu p’tit merdeux?
C’est la roulette tu choisis pas.

Ah ouais tu crois ça?

Bah écoute, j'sais pas pour toi, mais pour moi ce sera,
La tête haute, un poing sur la table
Et l'autre en l'air, fais moi confiance
Avant de finir six pieds sous terre, j'aurais vécu tout c'qui a à vivre
J'aurais fait tout ce que j'peux faire
Tenter tout ce qui a à tenter
Et surtout j'aurais aimé

De ma fenêtre j'vois les gens qui partent au taff'
Y'en a qui ont fière allure avec leur beau manteau
Et leurs belles chaussures
D'autres au contraire ont l'air de ramasser sévère
Toutes celles et ceux qui s'en vont une fois de plus
Servir la soupe aux autres
Ma conscience de p'tit blanc me rattrape aussitôt
Tu vois, tu devrais arrêter de te plaindre
Mais pourtant je sais pas
Est-ce que c'est nous qui sommes devenu des baltringues
Est-ce que c'est le monde qui part en vrille
Parfois j'me dis qu'on nous a tellement habitué au goût de la culpabilité
Qu'on est devenu incapable d'y voir clair
Par exemple, moi pendant longtemps j'me suis acharné
À me ranger dans une boîte
À avoir une vie normale sans accro, sans risque, sans drame
Avoir un métier normal, un salaire normal,
Des sentiments normaux, une femme normale, une mort normale etc etc
Mais j'ai pas pu, c’était trop pour moi
J’étais pas assez endurant
Alors à la place j'ai chercher une feinte pour vivre dignement
Et aujourd'hui j'me saigne pour essayer d'aider les miens
La bonne façon d'agir
Selon des nobles fins
Et un jour enfin donner tord à cette voix qui me répète,

Tu seras dominant ou noyé
Écrasant ou écrasé
Carnassier ou dispensable
Gagnant ou donné négligeable
Tu seras semblable à tes semblables
Comme tout le monde, ou dégradable
Plus malin ou trou du cul
Tortionnaire ou corrompu
Tu seras battu et silencieux
Ou bien cruel, mais victorieux
Rigoureux ou inutile
Féroce ou détails futiles
Tu seras ce qu'on te dit tu discutes pas
Ici bas, c'est comme ça
T'as compris l'jeu petit merdeux
C'est la roulette, tu choisis pas

Ah ouais tu crois ça?

Bah écoute, j'sais pas pour toi, mais pour moi ce sera,
La tête haute, un poing sur la table
Et l'autre en l'air, fais moi confiance
Avant de finir six pieds sous terre,
J'aurais vécu tout c'qui a à vivre
Et j'aurais fait tout ce que j'peux faire
Tenté tout ce qui a à tenter
Et surtout, et surtout j'aurais aimé

De ma fenêtre j'vois un bout de l'enceinte de l’hôpital
Si je penche un peu la tête
J'peux peut-être arriver à voir le bâtiment des consultations
J'repense à toutes ces fois où on m'a dit,
T'es trop sensible
Mais ça va aller, fais pas cette tête
Bon OK, ce sera peut-être pas tous les jours la fête
Et le docteur de la tête qui me répète que c'est comme ça,
Qu'il faut que je l'accepte
Que c'est comme le diabète, qu'il faut vivre avec
Alors j'essaye chaque jour que Dieu fait
J'ai pas dit mon dernier mot t’inquiète
Y'a rien d’écrit, rien d’écrit
Et nique la voix qui m'dis,

Tu seras schizo', bipolaire, trop fragile, suicidaire
Tyrannique, incurable, repoussant
Pas regardable
Tu seras sadique, narcissique, voyeur, pervers
Égocentrique, destructeur
Dépressif, obsessionnel, compulsif
Tu seras damné, condamné
Étendu sur la chaussée
Déformé, mal branlé
Démoli, trois fois rejeté
Tu seras ce qu'on dit tu discutes pas
Ici bas, c'est comme ça
T'as compris l'jeu petit merdeux
C'est la roulette, tu choisis pas

Ah ouais tu crois ça?

Bah écoute, j'sais pas pour toi, mais pour moi ce sera,
La tête haute, les coudes sur la table
Le poing en l'air, fais moi confiance
Avant de finir six pieds sous terre,
J'aurais vécu tout c'qui a à vivre
Et j'aurais fait tout ce que j'peux faire
Tenté tout ce qui a à tenter
Et surtout on m'aura aimé.",Loterie,2014
Fauve,"Vieux frère,
J'suis encore arrivé en retard ce matin
Comme hier,
Comme avant-hier,
Comme tous les jours depuis 3 semaines
Il est à peu près 11h,
Et j'dors encore sur mon clavier
J'ai le nez dans la manche de ma veste pas lavée,
Qui dégage une odeur bizarre
J'fais semblant à un point où c'est devenu absurde
J'suis vraiment une imposture

Et aujourd'hui encore j'vais mettre en marche
Le simulateur de travail pour envoyer des bouteilles
Aux autres vieux frères et aux belles
Qu'est ce que j'fous là,
Où est-ce que j'vais
Est-ce que ça va être ça ma vie,
Rester 40 ans sur les mêmes rails?
Mais je serai jamais assez fort,
J'aurai jamais les épaules,
J'arrive plus à suivre,
J'ai déjà des points de côté des 2 côtés

Heureusement ce matin c'est un peu différent
C'est grâce à ce qui s'est passé hier soir quand on était ensemble
Quand on était ensemble avec les autres vieux frères dans les mots,
Dans les bruits, les tambours les échos et les images,
Et qu'on a avancé sans baisser la tête
Qu'on a pu transpirer et crier sans contraintes,
Sans retenue et sans crainte

C'était impensable de vivre ça,
D'avoir le droit de sortir ce qu'on avait dans notre tête,
Depuis tout ce temps, ces choses
Dont on pensait que tout le monde se foutait
Ça m'a fait du bien
Ça m'a fait du bien parce que c'était vrai, parce que c'était sincère
Parce que c'était nous, vieux frères",Rag #3,2014
Fauve,"Vieux frère,
Tu dois encore être en cage à cette heure ci,
Moi j'ai pas fait grand chose depuis ce matin j'ai écris un peu,
Je me suis touché un peu aussi

Ce midi j'ai vu les autres vieux frère elle est belle
C'était éclairant comme à chaque fois
Et puis cette aprè'm je suis allé récupérer mes affaires
C'était tellement étrange

J'ai dis au revoir à la photocopieuse
Puis à ceux et celles qui restent à bord
Ils m'ont souhaités bonne chance
J'ai hâte qu'on se rejoigne tous dehors demain
Au premières heures du jour et qu'on s'en aille enfin

Tu te souviens quand on parlait de changer de vie,
Si on avait su que ça arriverait

Moi aussi je suis inquiet forcement,
On a pas été habitué à tous ça c'est vrai,
Mais je sais aussi qu'on sera pas seul, qu'on sera avec tout les autres vieux frères
Et qu'ensemble on a de quoi faire,
Et puis les signaux sont là tu les entends et tu les vois comme moi

Alors finalement même si on sait pas où tout ça nous emmènera il faut qu'on ose
Qu'on fasse le geste,
Il faut qu'on se lance vieux frère

Je crois qu'y a rien de plus fort
Je sais pas comment expliquer ça, c'est que ça se voit dans les yeux,
Tu te dis merde j'ai l'impression de faire quelque chose
Tu croyais pourtant c'est pas grand chose

Pourtant, c'est pourtant, c'est pas grand chose.",Rag #4,2014
Fauve,"Je me suis mis à, à déconner complètement
Y'a quelque chose qui a sauté là dedans
Je sais pas
Je pense que c'est parce qu'inconsciemment
J'ai eu l'impression de perdre le contrôle
De perdre le contrôle sur toutes les choses
Dans lesquelles j'étais impliqué
Sur tous les éléments de ma vie
Ça m'a plongé dans un état de colère
Absolument indescriptible
C'était insoutenable
C'est comme être enfermé dans une boite sans lumière
Dans laquelle le temps s'arrête
C'est comme être dans les limbes en fait
Tu peux plus aller en avant plus aller en arrière
Tu peux plus aller dans aucune direction
T'es complètement bloqué
À l'arrêt en panne
T'as les pieds dans le ciment

Je me suis senti comme un requin tigre
Vous savez que les requins quand ils avancent plus
Ils crèvent
Et le requin tigre c'est le plus agressif
Quand il est immobilisé il défonce tout ce qui passe
Et c'est la même chose avec les loups quand tu les coinces
Moi je me servais de la musique et des mots et de l'écriture pour avancer
Pour progresser à travers l'existence
Alors quand j'ai perdu ça ben
Ben j'ai perdu ma capacité à progresser
C'est comme ça que je me suis mis à gueuler

Tu peux plus interagir avec le monde
Tu te renfermes petit à petit
Tu deviens totalement hermétique aux autres et au quotidien
Parce que le matin quand tu te réveilles
Et le soir quand tu te couches
Quand tu marches quand tu bosses
Quand tu parles quand tu conduis
Tu te répètes en permanence
En permanence
Je suis nulle part
Je vais nulle part
Je suis pétrifié
Et je serai jamais rien d'autre que ça

Il faut choisir de, de pas y penser
Choisir que ça existe pas
Choisir de pas avoir de problème avec ça
Il faut sortir
Faut voir ses amis
Et attendre que ça revienne",Requin-Tigre,2014
Fauve,"On a parfois le cœur soulevé par la sauvagerie du monde.
On est écœuré par l'annonce d'une nouvelle tyrannie.
Le raffinement des anciennes par les mensonges.
L'odeur du fumier dans les villes.
L'horreur qui pèse sur tous nos lendemain.
On s'engloutit alors dans un sombre désespoir.
On a peur, on a honte puis on est triste d'être humain.
On réclame en pleurant une naissance nouvelle,
Ou du moins l'admission par baptême dans une nouvelle confrérie.
Et on redoute de n'pas pouvoir obtenir ni l'une ni l'autre,
Que le monde refuse de s'arrêter pour nous et qu'on ne peut que le quitter.
Plonger dans une douteuse éternité.

Notre foyer lui même nous semble hostile
Comme si tous les talismans qui définissaient notre identité
S'étaient retournés contre nous.
On se sent déchiré et en pièce et en morceaux.
On prend alors avec terreur que si on n'peut pas s’asseoir pour réunir ces morceaux
Et les assembler à nouveau, on va devenir fou.
Mais parfois se produit pourtant une manière d’événements mystérieux et éblouissants,
Qu'on contemple encore longtemps après,
Et avec un émerveillement mêlé du respect qu'impose le sacré.",Tunnel,2014
Fauve,"Vieux frères
Vieux frères, j'vous écris en pensées alors que vous êtes sûrement déjà en train de dormir,
Cueillis par le sommeil,
À part évidemment notre vieux frère qui veille
Et les autres vieux frères qui se lèvent de l'autre côté de la Terre.

Vieux frères, c'est une nuit claire et silencieuse.
Le blizzard du dehors est enfin reparti.
J'voulais profiter de ce moment de répit pour vous parler de quelque chose,
De quelque chose d'important.

Vieux frères, y'a longtemps, plusieurs années déjà,
On m'avait offert une amulette, un genre de talisman
Qui m'avait pratiquement sauvé la vie,
Qui m'avait permis de mieux voir, de distinguer les cordons d'argent.

Vieux frères, malheureusement, on me l'a enlevé.
Il s'est éteint après avoir clignoté comme un néon fatigué.
Je l'ai perdu puis retrouvé puis reperdu et reperdu encore 100 fois,
Jusqu'à baisser les bras.

Mais pourtant vieux frères,
Contre toute attente,
J'crois qu'il est en train d'se passer quelque chose.
Je sens que quelque part à l’intérieur, ça recommence à bouger,
Que les pulsations reprennent.

Vieux frères, au début, elles étaient très faibles et très espacées,
Au point que je l'ai entendais même pas
Mais depuis ça s'est accéléré,
Petit à petit.
Depuis, on dirait que la machine que j'pensais hors-circuit est en train de redémarrer.

Vieux frères, ça a commencé y'a plusieurs mois mais au début j'ai pas relevé.
Comment je pouvais me douter en même temps?
J'ai pas remarqué tout de suite les flash colorés dans le noir,
Les éclats furtifs sur les parois et les visages.

Vieux frères, d'abord c'était sous les arcades
Lorsqu'on a cru toucher le fond et y rester pour de bon
Mais qu'on a réussi à resserrer le cercle par deux fois
Puis y'a eu les fumigènes, les fusées parachutes tirés de partout
Comme des cris d'ralliement faisant écho dans les vallées.
Ensuite, ça a été au tour du vieux frère qui a changé pour devenir sage,
Puis au tour de l'autre vieux frère qui s'est remis en selle pour toujours.
J'me rappelle aussi de ce soir du moi de mai,
Du jeu de fléchettes et qu'on était encore rentré seul comme des cons mais soulagé d'en rire.

Vieux frères, encore après y'a eu la route.
On traversait les grands espaces du Loiret
Quand j'ai vu notre vieux frère prendre une photo avec ses mains.

Et enfin vieux frères, y'a eu hier soir
Hier soir à 10 000 pieds alors que l'avion était plongé dans l'noir,
Chacun votre tour, en quelques secondes,
Comme en plein jour, comme dans les rues
Quand la nuit tombe,
Chacun votre tour vieux frères, vous vous êtes allumés,
Vous vous êtes parés d'un halo bleu doré, j'ai cru voir un tableau. L'temps s'est arrêté.
J'vous l'jure sur tout ce que j'ai de plus précieux,
J'vous le jure sur la vie de tous les vieux frères, sur celle des belles et sur la mienne.

Vieux frères, j'crois que j'suis en train de retrouver la vue.

Vieux frères, c'est c'que j'attendais depuis tellement de temps,
C'est pour ça Que j'bossais dans l'noir, que j'écrivais des mantra
En m'faisant violence pour y croire,
Sans savoir à quoi ça pouvait ressemblait réellement
Parce que j'avais oublié.

Vieux frères, peut-être que j'suis cintré,
Peut-être que ça va disparaître, peut-être que j'me suis trompé,
Peut-être que c'est que dans ma tête
Mais pour l'instant c'est là et bien là
Et pour preuve je l'ai dans l'creux d'ma main
Au moment où j'vous adresse ces phrases.

Alors vieux frères, avant d'se faire ken encore une fois,
Avant qu'les ténèbres avalent cette flamme,
On va mettre le dernier coup de rein et montrer les dents,
On va replonger dans l'torrent
Et peu importe pour combien de temps parce que maintenant on sait qu'ça peut exister,
Que c'est possible.
Vieux frères, on va s'casser de ce tunnel,
On va prendre notre revanche vieux frères, on va gagner la belle.",Vieux Frères,2014

Ça va t'faire tout drôle, le soir, où les choses que tu pensais avoir enfouies
T'font savoir, qu'en fait, elles étaient là, juste là, planquées sous l'tapis
Elles sortent une main, puis te plantent une seringue dans l'pied, avant d'disparaître
Alors là, ça t'prend à la gorge, comme des odeurs d'ammoniac

Mon optimisme débile, mon zèle dangereux, mes réflexes à la con
Mes accès d'colère, ma culpabilité bidon, ma sexualité en vrac et mes fantasmes tordus
De hurler ma peur panique des autres
Ma mesquinerie sournoise, mes regrets, mes erreurs

Encore le même réveil
Seul dans les draps sales, putain
Dans les draps sales de mon sommeil
Encore rêvé d’mes dents qui tombent
Cette fois-ci y avait aussi des morceaux d’ongles
Du sang séché
L’autre fois j’ai vomi du verre pilé
Je finirai par me les limer, mais plus tard, plus tard
Pour l’instant je tâte ces dents désunies par le tabac
Du bout de ces doigts jaunis par le tabac
Je sens cette haleine vieillie par le tabac
Sortie par ces lèvres qui veulent plus rien avaler
Ou seulement deux trois fièvres, des canettes et des pots délavés
Dans ces nuits, en chien de fusil
Quand mes os apparaissent translucides
Quand mon cœur tape et perce, limpide
Contre ma peau

Encore les mêmes larmes
Et moi je me surprends à les faire tomber sur la cigarette qui diffuse
Je passe mon temps à pleurer n'importe quand
Pleurer dans mon lit, pleurer sur ​​les chiottes, pleurer sous la douche
Mais surtout pas devant les autres, non, ce serait être salaud
Y'a que les écrivains qui savent rendre ça beau
Tout ce que je peux faire c'est de passer la journée à brûler comme une braise
Brûler comme une braise, le cul vissé sur ma chaise, à faire
Ces minables sourires qui puent l'encens
Ces sourires jaunes d'arnaqueur,
Avec toujours ces dents et ces lèvres sans couleurs,
Et cette langue si sèche collée contre mon palais
J'arrive à peine à sortir des râles
Je préfère encore tordre mon visage pâle et me racler la gorge
Et déglutir dans la grille de l'évier mes crachats noirs, mes soupirs,
Et puis me regarder dans la glace
Me tâter la gueule, me tâter les gencives
Je voudrais
Je voudrais me casser la gueule, me casser les gencives
Pour secouer le sac à geindre que je suis

Si ça s'évapore pour rejoindre le néant
Si ça devient tout, c'est le temps
Le temps seul qui finit par le dire
Une relation, c'est un potentiel laissé à l'avenir
Mais pour moi, le ciel s'est posé comme un couvercle
D'un simple geste, elle a refermé le cercle
Et tout ce qui me reste c'est un empire de vent et de poussière
Où l'on ne sait pas rire, où l'on ne connaît que la pierre
La ville n'est qu'un charnier, peut-être une île, rien d'autre à faire
Que regarder se vider à côté des autres ses plaies, et les fêlures de ses côtes
Mais pourquoi est-ce qu'il faudrait encore que je saigne?
Je me sens déjà suffisamment vidé

Il a fallu qu'elle se souvienne qu'elle ne m'aime plus
Le seul désir qu'elle m'a laissé c'est de dormir avec mon frère
Tout ira bien, la douleur vient, la douleur passe
On y arrive

Même les déchets remontent à la surface
On se lève un matin sans cette odeur rance, sans cette odeur d'encore
On se rend compte que la souffrance vaut toujours mieux que la mort
C'est moins définitif aussi
J'ai pas envie j'ai pas envie j'ai pas envie j'ai pas envie
Qu'on trace encore le périmètre de ma vie
Il m'reste encore quelques kilomètres et quelques envies
J'peux encore m'en aller rouler loin dans les fumées
Jusqu'à ce que la voûte devienne bleue
Et j'peux encore choper des croûtes, me brûler les yeux
À mater le soleil décliner
Peut être que tu le trouves moche
C'est vrai qu'on y trouve que de la cendre, que de la roche
N'empêche qu'y m'reste encore mon empire de vent et poussière
Qui n'est pas à vendre
J'y suis roi et j'y dors, j'y suis tellement fier
Le cul posé dans le froid sur mon trône de pierre
Même que j'm'y balade encore
Libre et la bite à l'air",Azulejos,2015

Et cette vieille Chinoise qui pisse dans la rue à trois mètres de l'entrée du Franprix
Et la fille sur le quai regards noirs sourcils froncés

Et le cosaque pouilleux qui transportent sa maison de quartier en quartier
Et les cahiers qui s'abîment les mains dans la glace sous les cascades de néons bleues

Et lui qui trouve pas parce qu'il cherche pas
Et lui qui veut se casser loin
Et elle qu'à le regard vague et lui qui maîtrise pas son cerveau
Et elle qu'est tombée malade alors qu'elle n'avait rien fait à personne
Et lui qu'a plus d'élan vital
Elle est où ta rage, elle est où ta passion
Elle est passée où ta gaule de six mètres de long
Et elle qui comprend plus sa chatte parce qu'elle s'est faite sauter trop de fois sans qu'on la rappelle
Et ma tête qui me joue encore des tours
Et moi qui galère à m'mettre à couvert
Qui me frotte trop près aux débris
Qui m'perd trop souvent dans l'triangle des Bermudes

Et l'odeur d'feu d'bois qui m'colle à la peau
Et ma tête d'anxieux c'matin
Et le champ de bataille quand je nous vois tous éparpillés éclatés en vrac
Et nous qu'on se branle H-24 puis qu'on se flagelle parce qu'on se branle
Puis on dit qu'on fait et en fait on fait pas
Alors on dit pas et puis on fait puis on se fatigue

Fauve,"Vendredi 5 Juillet, 22h57
Je descends la rue dans la chaleur de la nuit
Pas mal de monde, pas mal de bruit
Un léger souffle d'air tiède traverse mon t-shirt et glisse sur ma peau
Ça fait comme les caresses d'une ado timide
Les trottoirs et la chaussée sont pleins,
Y'a de tout des Blancs, des Turcs, des Cainfrs, des Indiens, des Albanais, des Pakis
Des gens pouilleux, des gens sapés, des filles jolies
J'en croise une plus âgée que moi et je me dis que j'aimerais bien essayer une fois
Pour pas mourir idiot
Je circule entre les épiciers, les taxiphones, les kebabs louches
Les affiches de chanteur du moment mondialement inconnus et les bars branchés
Où j'ai jamais trop su comment me tenir mais c'est pas grave si certains y sont bien
Alors c'est bien
Ça sent le cumin et le safran, la bière renversée, la cigarette, la viande grillée
Ça sent l'été, le vrai, celui qui répare mais déjà je dois m'engouffrer dans la station
C'est pas grave ce soir rien peut me toucher
Je flotte au dessus du sol les planètes sont alignées
Dans les galeries pas de grosse surprise encore cette odeur douteuse
Et ces 4 par 3 toujours pas indispensables
Pour un film obscur qui fera sûrement un four, une comédie raston
La énième tournée d'adieu d'un groupe de vieux musiciens aux cheveux teints
Pour des spectacles de jeunes comiques en théorie pas hyper marrants
Pour des marques de vêtements portés par des filles
Qui ont l'air d'avoir des problèmes avec leur père
Et une campagne pour la mobilité qui sensibilisera peut-être personne
Mais avec une actrice plutôt mignonne
Et là je re-croise ces deux filles longilignes qui se tiennent par la main
Exactement les mêmes que j'ai vues hier près de chez mon oncle
Je trouve ça touchant et étrange
Autant que cet immense Guinéen au bout du couloir qui braille avec une voix métallique
Comme un putain de cor tibétain
Une goutte d'eau croupie tombe des poutres Eiffel dont la peinture fait des cloques
Elle atterrit dans mon cou c'est dégueulasse mais j'ai pas le temps de jurer
J'entends la sortie de la rame au loin
Ce soir rien peut me toucher, je flotte au dessus du sol, les planètes sont alignées

Dans la rame un Kosovar qui joue d'une trompette-violon bizarre
Je me demande quelle vie il avait avant,
Tandis qu'il anime mon trajet et celui du groupe de ricains à côté
Ils ont l'air un peu perdus avec leur physique tout lisse de gros bébé du futur
J'arrive à mon changement je passe devant les vendeurs de fausses clopes à la sauvette
Qui courent, qui crient, presque jour et nuit
Ça m'effrayait parfois quand j'étais gamin
Et qu'on venait dans le quartier avec ma mère et les frangins
Mais maintenant ça va, maintenant c'est cool
Je monte vers le quai de la plate-forme aérienne
Et à chaque fois que je suis là bizarrement je repense à cette fille
Avec qui j'ai fait l'amour pour la première fois
Elle habitait juste à côté
On m'avait dit que c'était un peu une traînée mais en vrai pas tant
Ça avait été une jolie nuit
Je laisse mes pensées dériver où elles veulent
Constatant avec satisfaction le plaisir d'arriver à faire rouler les images et les mots
Comme sur des colliers de perles
Mais j'oublie pas que je dois faire des chansons
Dans tous les cas ce soir rien peut me toucher,
Je flotte au dessus du sol, les planètes sont alignées

J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
C'est fou comme le temps file
J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
Et je pourrais me dire que les belles années sont derrière moi
J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
Pourtant j'ai pas de regrets
J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
Et ce soir j'ai l'impression d'être en '98

Je sors et toujours la chaleur dehors
J'avance sous la voûte des marronniers qui font comme une tonnelle
Je serais bien aller dans les magasins pas loin
Chez ces mecs pas méchants mais un poil suffisant
Poser mes doigts sur un instrument mais c'est fermé et puis il faut que j'avance
Tout d'un coup sorti de je sais pas où de la musique genre malienne
Mais chanté en espagnol ou peut-être de la folk indienne
En tout cas un truc que j'ai jamais entendu mais j'aime bien
On dirait Dear Prudence, y'a des drums rondes et mates et asynchrones
Ça intéresse pas beaucoup les blédards désœuvrés qui traînent dans l'allée
On arrête pas le buis' aller ça s'enjaille, ça s'embrouille
Y'a une odeur nouvelle dans l'air depuis quelques temps
Une odeur d'apocalypse
Je me surprends à penser que le déclin est arrivé, ça y est c'est pour nous
Mais malgré tout je suis pas si inquiet, après tout faut arrêter
On a de la ressource, on est pas les derniers burnés, on va se démerder, bref
Je suis arrivé en bas de l'immeuble terminus, je dois monter
Ce soir rien peut me toucher je flotte au dessus du sol, les planètes sont alignées

Fauve,"Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Et à travers les roselières
Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
J'irais chercher, les hautes lumières.

Aux innocents les mains pleines,
J't'emmène lancer des médailles dans l'eau bleue des fontaines
Et cueillir à nouveau ces visions qu'on s'offrait autrefois,
Comme des couronnes.
Ces visions qu'on s'échangeait pour se dire, pour se rappeler,
Je suis veilleur, tu es musée.
Je veux sentir les feuilles de menthe craquer sous nos dents
Avec la chlorophylle qui s'échappe.

Et t'faire écouter le son de carillons qu'fait le claquement des drisses de pavillon
Contre les mâts, avec en fond le grand fracas de la mer qui rapporte,
Et au dessus la procession de cargo des nuages bas et blancs.
Je voudrais te faire rencontrer les femmes cyprines et les bolqueens
Qu'elles nous habillent de robes et de diadèmes au croisement d'Amsterdam,
Et d'la 80ème pendant que moi je te mettrais au poignet des bracelets de tissu
Qui deviendront des bracelets de fleurs, puis des rubans, puis des violons.

Je porte le blason d'mon clan,
J'l'ai désormais gravé sur la face visible de mon cœur,
Mais ça ne fait pas mal rassure toi au contraire,
J'ai fait broder nos souvenirs étincelant sur des manteaux de nuit
Qu'mon offert des frères tisserands drapiers de canut
J'ai à la main mes aussières, je suis prêt.

Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Et à travers les roselières
Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Je t'offrirai les hautes lumières.

Aux innocents les mains pleines je t’emmène plonger dans la Seine
Et nager dans les courants fort de Beauchamp,
Nager dans les rivières, remonter les ruisseaux,
Puis prendre un bain brûlant, où je laverais ta peau
Au lait d’ânesse, avant de sécher ton corps moi même
Comme avant, quand on était adolescent.

Je veux faire l'amour dans les champs, dans les clairières, dans les taxis,
Je veux faire l'amour partout, même sur les toits de Paris.
Je veux résider au creux de ton cou, et dans tes draps parfumés aux lilas,
Tandis qu'une madré enveloppé d'un châle rouge bénit nos fronts
En silence avec des croix de baume au camphre.

Je te montrerai comment décrocher les boules blanches des symphorines
Pour les éclater sous nos pieds et entre nos doigts,
Avant d'aller regarder la lumière d'un lampadaire qui rougeoie
Et qui vacille sur les berges du fleuve endormi,
Dont les risées de vent emplissent la surface.

Je veux offrir cette cigarette à ma mère,
Cette cigarette d'après la guerre et son odeur vanillé,
Je t’emmène voir le granit rose de ses îles qu'on ne peut pas déplacer
Mais c'est pour nous protéger,
Je t'emmène tout rejouer, peut être tout perdre,
Mais peut être aussi tout rafler, tout braquer, tout gagner

Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Et à travers les roselières
Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Je t'offrirai les hautes lumières.

Aux innocents les mains pleines je t'emmène voir
Taulet, Cavour, Sienne et Navone,
Toucher la faïence des rues de Lisbonne,
Et le marbre blanc, lisse et brillant des palais.

Je veux entendre les Salam des chauffeurs,
Et qui nous crie, les enfants je vous emmène à Orléans si ça vous plait.
Je veux t'offrir le tintement des couverts d'argent contre le cristal
Et les mots précieux des miens.

Je veux écouter les histoires des anciens encore et encore,
Ces histoires millénaires qui renaissent,
On s'est connu y a trois mille ans, on se retrouve maintenant,
Et nos enfants feront de même.

Je t'emmène loin des griffes de la colère, loin des regrets, loin des nausées,
Je t'emmène loin de la barbarie et des odeurs de kérosène brûlé,
Je t'emmène courir après des filles, après des garçons, après des rêves,
Et contempler les vivants, ces gens qu'on croise parfois
Et qui nous font tomber amoureux pour deux, pour trois.

On doit encore parcourir la terre,
On doit trouver cent mille sœurs et cent mille frères,
Pour plus jamais être seul dans les cimetières,
Alors sur la colline du Palatin, par dessus les dômes byzantins
Bientôt nous serons postés, nous armerons nos flèches de diamants,
Pour devenir sagittaires et décrocher, les hautes lumières

Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Et à travers les roselières
Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Je t'offrirai les hautes lumières.

Sortez les stylos et les carnets
Allumez les bougies et réveillez les esprits, faites chauffer les machines
Montez les basses, dégueulez les kicks, faites claquer les snares
La nuit va être longue vieux frère
Vieux frères ce soir encore je vous appelle en renfort
L'heure est à nouveau venue de tremper des torchons dans la paraffine
Et de descendre au fond de la mine
De faire ce truc qu'on a appris à faire au fil des ans depuis tout ce temps qu'on roule ensemble
Braconner les mots juste pour avancer
Tout mettre à nu avant de coucher ce qu'on a sur le cœur sur l'instru'
Nos quêtes, nos frustrations, nos rêves et notre vécu
Sans non-dits, sans compromis, sans jamais de tendre notre cul ni écarter les fesses
Bancale c'est pas grave, bancale c'est très bien
Mais tiens moi à distance de mes désirs mesquins
Je sais qu'il faut mettre ça au placard sinon c'est baisé
On peut pas se branler, miner des mondes et toujours construire et charbonner
Même si parfois je vois bien que c'est compliqué
On est pas encore tiré d'affaire, il reste du taf, il en reste à faire beaucoup à faire
On se doit d'aller au boulot, au bout du tunnel avec toute notre hargne
Jusqu'à nous coucher comme des masses le matin venu pour rempiler dès le réveil
Alors ce soir on va embrayer, mettre en marche le deuxième chantier
On se reposera plus tard t'en fais pas
On se reposera quand on sera vieux, vieux frère

Aujourd'hui je regarde en arrière, je me surprends à sourire
Tous ces souvenirs en si peu de temps
Ça m'a fait comme une seconde naissance
A une époque je pensais que ma vie était derrière moi
Et si j'avais su tout ce qui m'attendais, tous ces moments, tout ce qu'on a construit
De rien et à bout de bras
Et je suis fier de ça, ça me fait du bien
J'crois que j'suis plus heureux, moins amer, moins en colère qu'avant
Plus apaisé aussi j'espère
Moi qui était bon à pas grand chose en tout cas dans ma tête
J'ai récupéré de ma dignité
Au passage j'espère en avoir fait profiter les miens autant que j'pouvais
Mais c'est pas fini, rien n'est gagné, on est peut-être à l'abri pour l'instant
Mais il faut rester vigilant
Et puis on a pas encore tout dit parce qu'on a pas encore tout vu
Il en reste dans l'éponge, il en reste dans nos casiers, il en reste sur notre route
On a pas encore été au bout de l'histoire, au bout de nous même,
Au bout des autres, au bout du monde, loin de là
Et on s'arrêtera pas, on s'arrêtera pas tant que ce sera pas fait
On a ce privilège, cette torche qu'on peut tremper dans la paraffine
Et on va continuer à descendre au fond de la mine pour creuser
Creuser jusqu'à la sortie, on a passé tant d'années à attendre,
À chercher dans le noir comme des galériens
A marcher sans savoir où aller, à se faire du mal pour rien
Hors de question de flancher ou de revenir en arrière
Je sais que je peux compter sur toi vieux frère

Mes rires profonds, mes cris de joie, mes cris de guerres,
Mes coups de sang, mes coups de poing, ma mystique
Tout est à vous
Ma chaleur, mes mains, mes triques, mes saillies, ma queue, mes nuits
Tous mes ornements, des mes bagues à mon collier
De ma lame à mon armure
Et mon palladium et mes arcanes
Prenez aussi ma fortune, mes coups du sort, mes coups de cocu
Mes aubaines et mes peines avec, mes combats
Ma victoire, mes succès, mes défaites
Mes causes perdues, mes batailles gagnées, mes blessures apaisées

Mon rang, mon calme plat, mon continent
Vous mon monde, ma nation, ma terre, mes collines,
Mes hauteurs, mes océans, ma jungle et mes forêts
Avec les fleurs des champs, mon aurore boréale
Mon amour, mon mariage, mon chandelier
Tout est à vous
Vous mon flambeau, mon feu de Bengale, mon bouclier

Vous mon pavois, mon grand pavois
Mon étendard, ma bannière, mon blason

Ce qu'on entend par relation d'ordre sur un ensemble

Face au miroir, j'craque une allumette
J'invoque le feu et j'fais tourner mes mantras à voix basse
J'les égrène comme un chapelet
Bientôt va falloir montrer les dents et rentrer dans l'arène
Sous les strobes et l'bastringue
Le stress me tourne autour façon vautour, j'en mène pas large
Mais j'sais que t'es avec moi, qu'tu peux faire jaillir l'orage de tes doigts
En c'qui m'concerne j'serais pas en reste
J'aurai l'chrome dans ma main droite même si au début j'tremblerais peut-être
Allez écrase ta sèche dans un verre plein
Avale ton mélange d'une traite

Et serre-moi contre toi

On va reprendre notre place dans cette colonne

Regarder la folie reprendre ses droits
Danser comme des pantins
Tanguer d'bâbord à tribord

Qui s'remet à hurler sur les avenues et les boulevards
Avec la rage d'un ex-taulard qui ferait le tapin
J'me raconte des histoires étranges et puis j'essaye d'penser à rien
La panique me sert les rouleaux façon vie ragot
Mais je sais qu'tu seras jamais loin,
Toujours dans le coin d'mon œil dans mon champs de vision
Toi qui peut cogner si fort,
Quant à moi j'te laisserai pas t'porter t'inquiète
J'essayerais d'faire en sorte que l'air dans mes poumons soit brûlant
Aller passe toi d'l'eau sur le visage, mets toi quelques gentils claques,
Fais craquer tes phalanges et serre moi contre toi
On va retrouver les gars
On va reprendre notre place dans cette colonne
Dans ce cortège des bras cassés, des lâche-rien, auquel on appartient
Plus que quelques secondes et on pourra encore une fois
Jouer aux Indiens sur un champ d'mine
Hurler à la lune
Danser comme des pantins
Tanguer d'bâbord à tribord
Et chanter tous ensemble, ce refrain, à la façon d'un chant d'marin

Que la fièvre marche avec nous
Sous les arcades et sous les coups
Fleur au fusil, sourire en coin
Tête en avant, oublie tout
Lâche tes chevaux, rends-les fous
Attrape la fureur à pleines mains

Fidèle compagnon d'voyage
Face au vacarme, j'ai mes rituels étranges

L'angoisse me file la courante, c'est pas gagné
Mais j'sais que t'es là toujours à ma portée
Comme j'suis à la tienne, tu l'sais
J'tiens mes promesses, je mens rarement
J'ai des cartes pleins les manches, pleins les manches
Et tous mes talismans
Aller aller, avale tes pilules
Descend, rejoins moi dans la rue que j'te serre-contre moi
On va rattraper les autres
On va rattraper l'train
On va reprendre notre place dans cette colonne
Dans ce cortège des bras cassés, des lâche-rien, auquel on appartient
On a des heures d'vant nous pour buter la nuit, boire, fumer, s’abîmer la santé
Et s'dire des belles choses et fantasmer
Profiter du temps qui passe
Danser comme des pantins
Tanguer d'bâbord à tribord
Et chanter tous ensemble, ce refrain, à la façon d'un chant d'marin

Que la fièvre marche avec nous
Sous les arcades et sous les coups
Fleur au fusil, sourire en coin
Tête en avant, oublie tout
Lâche tes chevaux, rends-les fous
Attrape la fureur à pleines mains

Que la fièvre marche avec nous
Sous les arcades et sous les coups
Pied au plancher, amour au poing
Tête en avant, oublie tout
Lâche tes chevaux, rends-les fous
Attrape le tonnerre à pleines mains.",Sous Les Arcades,2015
Fauve,"J'ai jamais vécu de happy end ailleurs
Que dans des salons de massages douteux d'Asie du sud-est
J'ai pas besoin de tes faux miracles en plastique
Ni que tu me serves des five-timers, romantiques au rabais
Je veux pas de tes mauvaises contrefaçons de sentiments
Il me faut du vrai, du complexe, du diamant 24 carats
Alors sauf ton respect, mets toi au cul tes scénarios bidons
Ceux qui embarque la peau avec quand ils prennent feu façon nylon
Façon made in China
Tu peux garder tout ça
Cette fille dans la publicité m'aimera jamais
Même si t'essaies de me la faire à chaque fois
Tori Black non plus ne me baisera pas
Elle baise plus en dehors des plateaux
Quand elle rentre elle est fatiguée, elle est crade c'est normal, c'est pas grave
Et merde amenez-mois de la raide, du rouge, du seroplex ou même les trois
Si ça marche pas je peux encore taper dans le liquide de refroidissement
Les escort-girls, j'y lâcherai tout mon compte, tout ce qu'il faut
Tant que tu fermes ta gueule

J'ai pas besoin de mon horoscope, ni de matériel de bureau nickel
Ni de la vitesse de la lumière,
Ni d'une nouvelle voiture plus intelligente que moi
Ni d'une nouvelle conscience, ni d'un meilleur cerveau
Ni d'un nouveau moi-même
Nouveau quand bien même je saurais quoi en foutre
J'ai pas besoin de problèmes de santé et encore moins de nouveau défi
J'ai déjà tout ce qu'il faut merci
Alors arrête de me parler comme à un abruti
Je veux pas qu'on me serve la purée ni qu'on me fasse mes lacets
Et puis ton truc c'est mal fait, tu trouves pas, mais regarde-toi
Tu fous le bourdon
On a envie de se jeter d'un pont tellement t'es con avec tes machines,
Tes petites machines dans ta tête
Parait que tes traits grossiers, tes faits tranchés
Tes choses trop simples pour être honnête
Mets tes couilles sur la table tiens
Au moins une fois dans ta vie
Crache ta valda, remonte ton froc t'as le cul qui fuit
Et boucle la ça fait comme bruit blanc c'est épuisant
Bordel on s'entend plus penser
Faut sucer qui pour que tu nous foutes la paix

Au passage tu peux aussi rembarquer tes diagnostiques de rebouteux foireux
Par exemple ""Julien n'est pas un commis démissionnaire""
Ni aucun autre de tes raccourcis
Julien rêve de mers turquoises, de calme et de poésie
Comme beaucoup d'autres il n'est pas un schéma
Ni un animal c'est pas un objet
Julien est complexe, il se dope gentiment, va en boite
Caresse son collègue quand il est amoureux fort dans les cuisines
Julien a besoin de sens profond
Et moi j'ai pas une envie débordante de fumer la gueule de mon voisin
D'ailleurs je crois bien que c'est pareil pour lui
Alors te donne pas de peine, reprends ta merde tes dernières haines
Ravale ton venin, tes hantises, tes psychoses ça me sert à rien
J'ai pas besoin de nouvelles peurs ni de nouveaux cauchemars
Ni de nouvelles tocades, j'ai déjà largement donné c'est bon là
Et puis tu veux que je mette ça où?
J'ai pas la place, nulle part
Mais que dalle je te dis
Alors remballe, remballe et tire-toi loin d'ici
Tu me feras pas croire que l'autre est un enculé puisque l'enculé il est en moi
Et au passage t'as le même chez toi
Donc tu me verras pas sauter sur mes semblables
Et tu me mettras jamais derrière un flingue ou uniquement
Uniquement si t'as des chances de passer devant
Peut-être que la vie est une chienne
C'est vrai qu'on entend ça parfois en attendant
Moi je vois des milliards de choses douces et belles
C'est pas du sable artificiel, c'est du métal très solide
Comme le parfum des fleurs
Je vivrai, passerai le règne de ta terreur",T.R.W.,2015
Fauve,"Alors que le bruit de nos talons sur le macadam trempé résonne dans la nuit de Décembre
Alors il faut rattraper le temps perdu
Le temps passé loin l'un de l'autre
Je suis un peu fébrile et toi t'as cet air un peu songeur
Tu fais ce bruit avec tes lèvres que je connais par cœur
Les mots se font rares mais peu importe
Les silences comptent aussi et on a toute la nuit
Alors que l'odeur d'amande sucrée de nos haleines alcoolisées
Nous revient par la buée qu'on expire
Alors les langues se délient
Alors on ose enfin parler, se dire les choses
Tu es partie, je suis resté, on a changé
On s'est construit chacun de notre côté
Et j'ose pas trop le dire mais souvent tu me manques
Et je suis heureux à cet instant de pouvoir simplement te regarder
Dans ma poche un briquet, je fais des étincelles par série de trois
Réflexe bizarre je sais, mais je voudrais que ce moment s'arrête pas

Si le bateau coule, si le bateau sombre
Je te suivrais, je serais comme ton ombre
Tu me trouveras toujours dans ton sillon
Dans les sales moments comme dans les bons
Et si le ciel s'écroule, si les continents plongent
Je te suivrais même jusque dans tes songes
Tu me trouveras toujours dans ton sillage
Dans les lignes droites et les virages

Alors que nos visages engourdis par le froid brillent sous le crachat nocturne
Alors on discute à bâtons rompus comme à cette époque bénie où tu partageais ma vie
J'aime toujours ce que tu es, en fait même plus qu'avant je crois maintenant que t'es plus là
Et puis y'a quelque chose de plus lumineux, de plus coloré, de plus vivant
Je trouve ça séduisant
Dans ma poche un briquet, je fais des étincelles par série de trois
Réflexe bizarre je sais mais je voudrais que ce moment s'arrête pas

Si le bateau coule, si le bateau sombre
Je te suivrais, je serais comme ton ombre

Alors que le bruit de nos talons sur le macadam trempé résonne dans la nuit de Décembre
Alors il faut rattraper le temps perdu
Le temps passé loin l'un de l'autre
Tu me dis que bientôt peut-être on va se retrouver
Que bientôt peut-être tu vas revenir
Alors mon cœur s'emballe mais je le garde pour moi,
Je me contente de sourire et de jouer avec la pierre de mon briquet
Toujours ce briquet dans ma poche, je fais des étincelles par série de trois

Fauve,Je revois encore Dan m'expliquer sa théorie en s'agrippant fermement l'entrejambe Il me disait comme ça avec cet accent que je t'épargne « Il faut distinguer le cock music et le smart music tu vois (pas de fermeture de guillemets) Rolling Stones Pixies AC/DC Guns ‘n’ Roses etc. C'est une question de génération mon petit gars » OK il a peut-être raison je sais pas Il y a quelque chose d'ironique dans tout ça Comme si une fois le Big Magnet s’était dit « Tiens Pierrot amène-toi qu’on rigole Tiens tu le vois l'autre taré en bas ? Et bien moi j’ai décidé que pour les cent prochaines années il avancera les yeux bandés » Et Pierre de répliquer « Seigneur soyez pas pute laissez-lui au moins des indices par-ci par-là j’en sais rien » Et il en fut ainsi Depuis Jour et nuit je traque les épiphanies Avec la rage d’un mercenaire sous crack D’un alcoolique en manque de Jack D’un dément D’un amant qu’on plaque Jour et nuit je traque les épiphanies Avec la rage d’un mercenaire sous crack D’un alcoolique en manque de Jack D’un amant qu’on plaque D’un dément qu’on claque Je revois encore Matthieu et les étoiles dans ses yeux entre deux cigarettes fumées à la fenêtre de ma chambre Il me disait comme ça « Mon vieux tu savais que le verbe cristallisait la pensée ? Je te jure un mot sur une idée foireuse c'est exactement comme un baiser T'as pas remarqué ? C'est une question de perception » Et au fond je sais qu'il a raison Il y a quelque chose de mystique dans son affaire Pouvoir ramasser les mots par terre et les jeter comme des pierres Contre les parois plongées dans le noir pour en faire sortir les choses qui blessent Grâce à la parole réussir à s'armer contre les sales pensées et faire des plans Serrer les poings serrer les dents les cogner leur rentrer dedans Essayer d'attraper les syllabes à la volée pour en faire des bougies qui éclairent et qu’on placera sous les paupières Ou des jolis bouquets pour une fille qui nous plaît Finalement c’est pour ça que j’écris Je revois encore Thibault éclairé par le halo de la lampe à pétrole Il me disait comme ça entre les vapeurs d'alcool « Tu sais qu'on peut flotter au-dessus du sol Rien qu'avec la parole ? Je te jure On faisait ça quand j'étais enfant Sur le terrain vague derrière chez mes parents C'est juste une question de conviction » Et je prie pour qu'il ait raison Il y a quelque chose de magnifique dans son histoire De savoir que si tout foire il nous en reste dans les tiroirs Grâce à eux qui ont reçu le feu sacré qui permet de tout voir Eux les machines à observer Les machines à mettre des mots sur tout Eux qui écrivent plus vite que la pensée Et avec ça ils agrandissent la Vie Ils font apparaître les fils qui relient toutes les choses entre elles Et ça leur donne le courage de tout affronter Même la Kolyma En attendant moi quoi ? Moi j'ai rien vu rien lu rien entendu et surtout rien compris Mais c'est pas grave je t’attends tant pis La parole comme vaccin contre la mort La parole comme rempart contre l’ennui Parler parler encore Parler pour affronter la Nuit,COCK MUSIC SMART MUSIC,2016
Fauve,"Regardes pas les affiches
Fais pas gaffe aux signaux
Mets bien tes mains sur tes oreilles
Quand t’entends rire les narvalos sauvagement
Ceux qui portent leur membre à bout de bras
Qui te disent qu’un cul ça s’attrape ou ça n’est pas

De quoi t’as peur?
Alors dis leur que ton machin est contrarié
Que parfois quand une fille te parle
Tu sens tes billes se rétracter
Depuis que cartonne au box-office
La grande idée selon laquelle la compassion c’est dépassé

Dis-leur que tu te sens seul
Et que tu sais plus quoi faire pour trouver un peu de chaleur humaine
Aller au bois pour que quelqu’un accepte enfin
De toucher ton zob
Tripoter de la lycéenne
Porter des robes?
Te trémousser en talons hauts comme un gogo
Puis arpenter les ruelles sombres en secouant ta clochette

C’est un peu à cause de tout ça si tous les soirs c’est la même histoire
Métro apéro lexo clopes et pornos à l’ancienne
Sur lesquels tu t’entraînes rageusement
Même si ça fait longtemps que ça t’amuse plus vraiment

Mais il faut pas que tu désespères
Perds pas espoir
Promis juré qu’on la vivra notre putain de belle histoire

Un truc bandant un truc dément qui redonne la foi
Un truc comme ça

«Bonsoir quelle chance de se croiser ici
Bonsoir bonsoir je voudrais partager tes nuits»

Tu connaîtras les nuits fauves je te le promets
Elle sera tigre en embuscade quand tu viens te glisser sous ses draps
Tandis que toi tu feras scintiller tes canines lorsqu’elle enlève le bas
Elle t’offrira des feulements dans sa voix lorsqu’elle reprend son souffle
Qui s’échappent dans la cour pour aller faire gauler la Lune
Des coups de bélier invoqués comme un miracle
Et qui veulent dire «Si tu t’arrêtes, je meurs»
Toutes ces choses qui te la feront raidir rien qu’à te souvenir
Pour le million d’années à venir

Malheureusement tout ce qu’on t’offre pour l’instant
C’est des chattes épilées et des seins en plastique en vidéo
C’est terrifiant
Tout le monde veut la même chose
Même les travelos rêvent du prince charmant
Et pourtant on passe notre temps
A se mettre des coups de cutter dans les paumes
A trop mentir à force de dire
Je t’en supplie, me parle pas, range la guimauve, écarte les cuisses
Ferme ta gueule, laisse-moi juste kiffer mon va-et-vient de taulard
Et m’endormir direct moins de trois minutes plus tard»

Ta peau brune et tes lèvres mauves
Tes seins tes reins tes cheveux noirs
Et qu’on se noie dans les nuits fauves

En échange de tout ça
Je t’offre ce dont je dispose
Mon corps mon âme prends tout tout de suite
Et qu’on se noie dans les nuits fauves

Et tant pis si on nous prend pour des demeurés
Bien sûr qu’on sait qu’ici c’est pas Hollywood
Sauf qu’aux dernières nouvelles
Le fantasme c’est encore gratuit

C’est pour ça qu’on se réfugie dans nos pensées
Qu’on ferme les yeux très fort jusqu’à voir des couleurs
En attendant que ça passe

Y a que comme ça qu’on peut rêver de caresses au réveil
Et de regards qui veulent dire «T’inquiètes plus, t’inquiètes plus»
De coups de poings dans le cœur
De 40e qui rugissent dans nos poumons à faire sauter les côtes
De torrents dans nos veines
D’une épaule pour pleurer sans honte
Et d’une oreille pour tout dire
Tout dire toujours quoiqu’il arrive
De serments argentés prononcés face au rayon vert
«Est-ce que tu veux m’épouser? Vivre et mourir à mes côtés?»

On rêve de réapprendre à respirer
Que la médiocrité qui nous accable
Aille se faire enfler au Pakistan
On attend désespérément celui ou celle
Qui apaisera d’un doigt nos muscles noués
Et nos encéphales en sous-régime
On attend désespérément celui ou celle
Qui fera battre notre cœur
Plus grand

Est-ce qu’on peut parler deux minutes?
Ce sera pas long je te promets
Après je disparais
Il fallait juste que je te parle de quelque chose
Et je me connais
Si je le fais pas maintenant je vais encore me défiler et m’en vouloir
Voila, j’arrive pas à te sortir de mes pensées
Je peux pas te le dire autrement
En même temps c’est pas très compliqué
Je pense que tu comprends
Je suis désolé si c’est un peu direct mais je me dis qu’on n’a qu’une vie
Qu’elle est trop courte, trop fragile
Et puis vaut mieux avoir des remords que des regrets

Je sais pas d’où ça sort
Je sais pas d’où ça vient
Je pourrais pas te l’expliquer
Et je comprendrais que tu me prennes pour un dingue
Je t’en voudrais pas
C’est juste que quand je te vois
Il y a des flashs dans ma tête
Il y a des images qui se répètent en boucle
Et j’ai besoin d’en avoir le cœur net
Je nous vois danser au ralenti sur du rub a dub
Et toi tu me déposes des mots précieux au creux de l’oreille
On se regarde droit dans les yeux
On veille jusqu’au lever du soleil
Je nous vois sortir marcher boire et partir sans payer
Tirer des plans sur la comète
Et faire l’amour les fenêtres ouvertes
Je vais pas te mentir sur le marché je suis pas forcément ce qu’il y a de meilleur
Parce que je suis bancal menteur pas fiable jamais à l’heure
Mais si tu veux je peux me faire boxeur, voleur, chauffeur, docteur, serviteur, dresseur de lions

Je vais pas te la faire a l'envers, tu pourras forcément trouver mieux
Parce que je suis maladroit, nerveux, égoïste et coléreux
Mais si tu veux je peux être souriant et même heureux, poli, généreux
Écrire des morceaux moins teigneux
Ou même des chansons pour les amoureux
C’est marrant parce que je me sens à la fois un peu ridicule de te balancer tout ça d’un coup
Et en même temps tu sais ça me fait beaucoup de bien
D’abord parce que je peux enfin être fixé sur ce qui se passe de ton côté
Mais aussi parce que je réalise la chance que j’ai
De pouvoir encore avoir des sentiments pour un être-human autre que moi
Ça me change tellement la vie
Tu te rends pas compte je crois
J’ai l’impression de plus être la même personne
C’est comme si d’un coup je me remettais d’une cuite qui avait duré genre deux ans
C’est long deux ans
Je me sens différent
J’ai envie de me lever à l’heure
De me remettre en mouvement
De moins fumer
De moins boire
Et puis, de plus draguer n’importe qui par peur de la solitude

Je sais pas d’où ça sort
Je sais pas d’où ça vient
Je pourrais pas te l’expliquer encore une fois
Ça faisait tellement longtemps que ça m’était pas arrivé
Et là ça me tombe dessus comme ça
Moi jusque-là je faisais un peu n’importe quoi
Je passais d’une personne à une autre sans réussir à m’attacher vraiment
C’était assez glauque mais bon
Je suis comme tout le monde, qu'est-ce que tu veux?
Alors que là je nous vois carrément danser au ralenti sur du rub a dub au corps à corps
On se regarde droit dans les yeux et puis on repart en tirant des bords
Je nous vois courir nager nus rougir transpirer jusqu’à brûler
Tirer des plans sur Jupiter et faire l’amour sous les éclairs
Alors je vais pas te mentir sur le marché je suis pas forcément ce qu’il y a de meilleur
Parce que je suis bancal menteur pas fiable jamais à l’heure
Mais si tu veux je peux me faire boxeur, voleur, chauffeur, docteur, serviteur, dresseur de lions

Et même si je sais
Que je suis loin d’être parfait
Si tu veux qu’on se lance
Qu’on essaie
Moi je pense que ça peut donner quelque chose de beau
Parce qu’après tout on sait jamais
Et même si tu vois
Que je suis pas quelqu’un pour toi
Si le soir quand ça va pas
Que t’es triste
Qu’il y a quoique ce soit
Fais-moi signe
Je serai là
Je te promets

Je voudrais pas que tu te fasses de fausses idées non plus
J’ai pas l’intention de te demander en mariage
Et même si évidemment je peux pas te forcer à me fréquenter
Par contre je peux te demander de me croire quand je te dis tout ce que je te dis ce soir
Je suis pas un énième connard qui veut juste coucher avec toi
Me mets pas dans le même sac
C’est tout ce que je te demande, c’est tout ce que je te demande 
Allez, je vais te laisser tranquille maintenant
Je parle beaucoup, je sais, je suis désolé
Mais t'es pas obliger de me répondre tout suite tu sais

Show what a sad parade we're all confined to staying in 
And bored in the evening slacker complexion playing a choke bore song 
What a sad excuse we have for living slow down slow down you lost me 

You lost me now twenty years and no one to talk to nothing to tell you 
I'll write it all down instead what I'd say if I could argue more 
I try to paint or write or surprise you 
But I got no soul and I've had a life too priceless and sublime slow down you lost me",Slow Down,1999
Favez,"I'm headed for the ocean with everything I have 
I have a bit of what you wanted 
And twenty million eyes connecting on all sides 
I've always had opinions 
I've always made it clear 
That everything I hated is what I have right here 
I've come this far and the place I found is the same one as before 

I'm headed for the ocean, for the good wind and the summer 
From this year on when the stars fall down I'll be laughing all the way 
I bet you think I'm boring but wait 'till I get old 
And all good things have ended like every story told 
You win down here when the faces turn and they all come to your door 
I've come this far and the place I found is the same one as before.",Headed for the Ocean,2000

Spring! Raste aus!
Rollt wie 'ne Dampfwalze los!
Mach kaputt! Ich mach kaputt!

Mach kaputt! Sag: Ich mach alles kaputt!

Habe mich festgekrallt (japp) jetzt am Ball (japp)
Frisches Blut, denn Idole sind fett und alt
Haben nur Sekt geknallt, selber gefeiert
Nun hängt Deutschrap der Welt an den Eiern
Na vielen Dank, Ficker!
Die Fahnen nehmt weg, es Bahnen sich jetzt
In Fahrt und Effekt die wartenden Acts
Den Karren aus dem Dreck!
Kein Ding, ich Box das raus
Rap ist langweiligster Scheiß neben Dr. House
Kopf hinaus!
Fast also nichts mit Clip, dennoch im Blick der Prinz
Vielleicht ein androgyner Typ, doch du disst mich nicht
Weil du unwichtig bist
Scheiße, bringt eh nichts
Du bist wie der zweite beim Marathon - reißt ziemlich wenig.
Ich bleib im der Szene
Der Typ um den sich die Labels reißen
Der, wo, wenn er einen Gig hat, vor der Bühne die Mädels kreischen
Du bist der mit Knebel-Vertrag, den kaum einer kennt
Den jeder nicht mag
(Verpiss dich)

Und die Menge schreit (yes)
Ein schritt nach vorn ,ein weiterer Sampler
Greif ins Lenkrad Geisterfahrt
Es ist Zeit, dass sich die Scheiße ändert
Aufbrausend im Benz gestylt,die Türen gehen auf
Schon brennt die Scheiße
Wir rollen an,schon hängt die Kleine
Hechelnd an der Fensterscheibe
Bring sie her, kostenlos mach ich sie zu Charlotte Roche,
Zum Pavian, die Vagina
Verfärbt sich 2/3 Wochen Rot
Setz mich ein für Menschenfeinde
Vorbildlich und fresh gestylt
Zeig ich mich von der besten Seite
Heb den Krug und ex' die Scheiße
Und wer gerne mitmachen will
Muss sich, wir haben nur ein bisschen drauf stehen
Auszurasten, auszupacken, das und ein gewisses Aussehen
Wenn es klappt hielten sie Händchen
Und schon geht es verdächtig schnell ein Pflock in ihrem Kopf
Zu schieben wie beim Legomännchen
Sie hat mehr fremde Spinner,beherbergt als mein Gästezimmer
Ein paar Bier, 2 Döner nur mit Fleisch: ein perfektes Dinner
Und als Gastgeschenk stürmen vier Leute
Als Straßengang,bewaffnet in dein Haus und feiern Abrissparty

Fay Claassen,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow

In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,2008
Fay Claassen,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2008
Fay Claassen,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get a Kick out of You,2008

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Faya Dem,"Tu connais la chanson, garçon, mauvais garçon,
Noirs et arabes, actions puis arrestations,
Altercations, humiliation, on nous met la pression
On nous dit qu'on est en infraction et direct des explications.
On parle d'immigration et me demande si je vote aux élections
J'ai pas de sélection, je crie tout haut ""Je baise votre nation""
Provocation, et mets en fonction leur écusson
""Suivez-nous les garçons""
Et c'est le début de la détention.
Dans la cellule animation, à 5 pour habitation.
Les keufs viennent nous guetter, tentative d'intimidation.
La cause de l'arrestation, Un joint de ma confection.
Selon la tradition, du popo comme une mission.
12 grammes en ma possession,
Ils commencent les questions.
Citations classiques, poucave, c'est pas ma profession.
Je leur dis que c'est ma conso, direct comparution.
Devant la barre, à mon égard libération.

""Bon on les relâche là,
Mais à la première occase on les épingle, hein""

Après l'excursion on se rafraîchit d'une fraîche boisson
Et comme discussion la police et leurs sanctions.
En voiture à fond, un bon son association,
Les keufs sont au feu rouge, attention, disparition.
Face à la police, me rendre hors de question
L'uniforme bleu, depuis tout petit nous haïssons
Produits stupéfiants et pe-pom comme protection
Faut qu'on se fasse la malle,
On remballe et on leur pète leur fion.

Apparemment y a du bordel là, donc on va régler ça, terminé""

Minuit, les rues sombres sont laissées aux bandits
C'est aussi qu'à cet heure-ci
Que les keufs cherchent les ennuis.
309 bleu nuit, débarquent dans le hall sans faire de bruit,
3 inspecteurs, on est 10, en plus des nazis.
Ils nous ont pas fouillés, c'est bizarre ça sent le roussi.
Commencent à nous parler, son haleine pue le whisky.
Se laisse emporter, se 'plaint que son fils fume du teuschi.
L'un d'entre eux, l'a informé, qu'un dealer vendait ici.
Ça m'étonne pas c'est bien les réactions d'un fils de képi.
En plus on s'en bat les couilles, il a pas de preuve, je serai pas poursuivi.
Je rentre à la baraque, à 4 du mat', terminer ma nuit,
Rêver du dernier, chut que j'ai récemment acquis.
2, 3 heures après, un bruit de fond, j'entends la sonnerie,
Oh merde un troupeau de keufs et je suis même pas sorti de mon lit.
Menottes aux poignets, vu la situation c'est reparti,
Après perquisition, séjour au commissariat de Vitry.

""On a interpellé les suspects c'est bon
On peut les emmener dans les locaux""

La cité une bombe à retardement, je crois ça va tester
Du commissaire au stagiaire: tous détestés!
De Fresnes à la Santé, vrais bonhommes on va résister.
A la moindre occasion, dès que tu le peux, faut les baiser.
Ils veulent stopper les pauvres qui prennent l'oseille des plus aisés.
L'honneur est en jeu, prends tes couilles, faut pas hésiter.

How the world keeps spinning around while you´re not here with me
Didn´t had the chance to make it there
Couldn´t even say good bye, thought it last forever
Keep on praying, keep keep on praying, say we keep on praying for now
Say we keep on praying, keep keep on praying, say we keep on praying for now
And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

Ich blick in den Himmel und rede mit dir
Ich würd‘ es dir geben das Leben von mir
Ich kann‘s nicht verstehen und ich möcht es auch nicht
Dreh dich nicht um, lauf direkt in das Licht
Wir alle waren da, an deinem schneeweißen Sarg
Und trugen dich wirklich zu zehnt an dein Grab
Jeder war da, glaub mir jeder war da
So viele Fotos von dir und die Tränen sie kamen
Ich zählte nicht nach, so viele Kerzen am brennen
Du warst so ein herzlicher Mensch
Egal wo du warst, du hast Freude bereitet
Wolltest dich nie mit den Freunden drum streiten
Ich schreib hier die Zeilen, mit meinem Blut
Wer will mich trösten, nichts mehr ist gut
Nichts mehr wird so sein, wie es einmal war
Bitte bleib doch da

Und all unsere Songs hab‘ ich nie mehr gepumpt
Es zieht mich so runter es bringt mich nur um
Ich würd‘ gern weiterleben, doch find keinen Grund
Mir läuft´s eiskalt gerade den Rücken hinunter
Bald mach ich mir dein Tattoo auf die Schulter
Mit deinem Todestag
Man ich bete millionen Mal für dich, ich sterbe grad ohne Spaß
Wie oft hab‘ ich Gott gefragt und gehofft, dass er antwortet
Schmeiß mir ein Seil in das Loch, ich will raus
Alles erinnert an dich
Denk ich an gute Zeiten, verschlimmert es sich
Es tut weh, ich war für den Scheiß nicht bereit
Ich fahr durch die Nacht, verkneif mir das weinen
Vorbei ist die Zeit, als wir das Leben noch liebten
Ruhe in Frieden

And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

Why you have to go and leave me on my own
In my heart I know, the angels ?

And we will see each other again

Faye L. Reis,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation

Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2007
Faye Montana,"Remember playing in the summer house
Wondering what it is all about
Wondering where the day went
Sleeping in the makeshift tent in the bedroom
Glad that you could stay
I remember coming right to see you
Wishing I could be you
Wishing I was older
Someone should have told her to stop wishing those days away

We were thirteen going on fourteen wishing we were eighteen 
When we're nineteen we'll be famous
And we'll buy some happiness
When we're twenty, we'll have plenty, with no worries
'Cause we'll have money in the bank
And it's all a game of numbers, it's all a game of numbers
It's all a game of numbers, it's all a game of numbers

It's all a game of numbers (it's all a game of numbers)

Remember things getting darker, wishing for some laughter
Fights getting longer, words getting stronger everytime
Can we run from here
Remember tension rising, so it's not surprising
How it all ended, no one could amend it you but then
But I still would pray

We were fifteen going on sixteen wishing we were eighteen 
When we're nineteen we'll be famous
And we'll buy some happiness
When we're twenty, we'll have plenty, with no worries, 
'Cause we'll have money in the bank
And it's all a game of numbers, it's all a game of numbers
(Yeah)

It's all a game of numbers (it's all a game of numbers)
It's all a game of numbers (it's all a game of numbers)

Wish that I could fix this, wish that I can mend this
Try to find a way, pray to God for you to just be happy
The fighting to be over
There must be a way, I've learned the problemsolve, it's only numbers

It's all a game of numbers (it's all a game of numbers)
It's all a game of numbers (it's all a game of numbers)
It's all a game of numbers",Numbers,2017
Faye Simpson,"How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Tell me

Why
Why
I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besides

Why can't you see this boat is sinking
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid

But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out turning inside out
Tell me
Why
Tell me
Why
This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears

The tears we shed
This is the fear
This is the dread
These are the contents of my head
And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel
I don't think you know what I feel
I don't think you know what I feel
You don't know what I feel",Why,2002
Faye Simpson,"Overcast future and the past riding on a dime
 No control ever will hold of my life
 But inside the darkest night is the day
 So listen to the words of life that I heard my father say (he said)
 [Chorus]
 Keep your head up to the sky don't be shy
 Trust in what you know is right and I?ll provide -repeat
 can't find a job for money will rob or do I have to sling (don?t mean a thing)
 Question fate who do I have to hate in order to be great
 But if love is the key what else to I need to be a success (I want to be blessed)
 Believing in the one is how I've begun to be great
 
[Chorus]

 You know in life we go through so much
 Will all get there if we don't give up
 Live life like you won't know tomorrow
 And you might lose all of your pain and sorrow

Maybe yes, maybe no.

With that look on your face.
As if your never hurt.
As if your never down.

Who pinches you softly but sure?

I will know that you are no dreamer.

So let me come to you
Close as I want to be.
Close enough for me
to feel your heart beating fast

FDNY Emerald Society Pipes & Drums,"This morning early I walked on 
While my darling was in a dream 
The last sweet days of summer bloomed 
And dressed the trees in green 
Then soaring high in the gleaming sky 
From far across the bay 
Came a fearsome roar from a distant shore 
At the dawning of the day 

Then I called my men to follow me 
Knowing well that the view was dim 
Though tired and worn, how they fought all morn' 
As time was closing in 
And my heart was sad though sore with pride 
For brave lads all were they 
As the angels fly, how they climbed so high 
On the dawning of the day 

But the edge is moving nearer now 
Inside the fading sun 
And calling, calling out to them 
My brothers, one by one 
But only dust silence sounds 
The ashes float away 
As the twilight ends and the night descends 
'til the dawning of the day 

Forgive me love, I'm going now 
So very far away 
When darkness falls, only think me near 
And do not be afraid 
And please don't grieve when I am gone 
Abide in what remains 
'til the shadows end and we meet again 
On the dawning of the day 

For when shadows end, 
We shall meet again

Burning in my mind, I am not deceived
Judgment into my own mortality

Now that the soul is free
I severed ties of man and machine
Now that the soul is free
I bled my heart of all it can bleed

Lighting the spark, igniting the fuse
Destroyed the lies and saw absolute truth
From out of darkness and into the light
The future is wide open and is on my side

Now that the soul is free
I severed ties of man and machine
Now that the soul is free

Fear of Pop,"I remember the night we met. that night we sat entwined under summer skies. I looked into your eyes, and you looked into mine; you said, ""you're not like the rest."" and I nodded. ""no one understands me,"" you said, and I nodded once again as if to agree that all men are indeed the same. somehow, you said, I was different.
For months on end, I maintained a veneer of sincere interest as if I was listening as you re-lived every page of self help and new age that you had read, and I went in for the kill! I'd read the same books, I learned to ape the motions of a sensitive human being, and we were oh so happy. but you found things to thick, and I knew it was time to move on. 
(In Love, In Love ... )
So now you have me completely figured out! you feel sorry for me! I can't express my feelings! I can't tell the truth! we are all alike. at puberty I was sworn to secrecy by the international brotherhood of lying fickle males. I can't tell you anything, and I can't commit! you're right! I can't commit... to you!
I will always treasure our time together. I don't feel enough of anything to harbor the kind of disdain that you maintain. you painted me into what you wanted to see! and that's fine... 
But you will never know me.

Catches fall, stairs echo
This time she's leaving
Yes, this time she's leaving

Each new day he tries again
Tries to smile but oh, the pain
Wonders if he'll go insane

No one really can
That's the way he likes it
That he understands
'Cause he's a bitter man

Turn new pages
What can she see with the naked eye?
Nothing changes

That if he could, he would have been so fine
As it is they're strangers
It wasn't this that he had in mind
Being a lonesome ranger

Keep stepping outta line now
Get up, get out
Don't leave it to nature
Oh, no

A step in the light now
Get up, get out
Don't leave it to nature
Oh, no

There's a girl, she's gonna take him first
In easy stages
And every time he thinks he could be worse
It grows more contagious

This is a plan of your own contriving
It's a plan to see what you're going through
Couldn't stop your bridges burning
But don't you worry 'cause you're still learning

Feargal Sharkey,"Take the ghost train away from freedom

Guess the change has come
And the worst part about it is
You don't know what you've done

Ghost train, ghost train
You get a one way ticket on a ghost train

It leaves no time to ponder
No time to change your shoes
It's a fast paced game that you're certain to lose

When you hear that whistle blowing
Just stop what you're doing
You gotta get that train on the road to ruin

Ghost train, ghost train
You get a one way ticket on a ghost train

The compartment is so tiny
There's only room for one

I know that real love is hard to find

And a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high, I blame it on my youth
Soon enough I'll learn the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter then boast how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

Well I know 'cause I learn a little every day
I know 'cause I listen when the experts say that

That a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I reflect on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't as foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find

I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know it will be worth it in the end

Sleep walking is all I do
I was no one to nobody
'Til the day that I met you

What good were all my dreams
But endless fantasy?
Just a heart that had no laughter
'Til the day you came to me

Then I looked into your eyes
I knew that love had come to me
So I held out my hand as I opened my heart and said
Darling please

I wanna be
Someone to somebody
And that someone is you
Don't you wanna be
Someone to somebody?
Then be my someone too

Oh, what good was all my freedom
With my heart tied up in chains
Though I claimed free expression
There was no way to explain

That I was filled with feelings
No one to show them to
What I hadn't known was that all along
I had saved my love for you

Now my days are so much warmer
And my nights no longer cold
'Cause you looked at me
And you held my hand and said
Darling, I wanna be

You little savage
You little beauty 
You little whore

Full confession

Well I guess I always knew it
Somewhere deep inside of me
There would come along a stranger

This story I tell
Caught by surprise
Sent right to hell

The more you got lost

No matter the cost
But all this is over
I've thrown off those chains
You're looking at a man
Who's pulled in those reins

My heart attacks and it won't let up
My heart talks back says enough's enough

Why don't you set me free now
Can you just let me be now
Why don't you set me free now
Can you just let me be now

One of these days I'm going to get up early
Start to think it through again one last time

Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la
Dee dah la dee dah la dee dah la

Featbeat,"When I feel you dreaming
I think of sunsets
How high my high gets

I wanna give to you an everlasting love
I fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a satisfying (mystifying) love

Sun breezes, moonlight teases
Friendly invasion
Late night persuasion

I wanna give to you an everlasting love
I fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a satisfying (mystifying) love

Each time you pass me by
You saw me fade away
I'll give you more each day",Everlasting Love,2012

Feather,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Fedde Le Grand,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

E più ne faccio e più al settaccio passo le esperienze
Niente non rimane niente

In me ci sarà sempre un po' di te in me
Ci sarà un po' di me in te
Ma noi non siamo soltanto parole di un’altra canzone d’amore, eh
Ci sono sempre troppe regole, ho visto già tutte le repliche
Perché al mondo in fondo non serve un’altra canzone d’amore

Please, niente canzoni d’amore (niente canzoni d’amore tra me e te)
Niente canzoni d’amore (niente canzoni d’amore tra me e te)

Sai di che sono convinto
Un sacco di gente la fuori sogna cose che non esistono
E ha aspettive altissime
Da cui poi si lanciano e si feriscono
Malattie che è meglio fare da piccolo

Quando siamo lontani penso agli affari
Mi vedo con altre ma sono svaghi
Non farmi drammi
Abbiamo senso a nostro modo
L’amore esiste in natura la coppia è un’invenzione dell’uomo
Diamoci in veleno alle frustrazioni, consolazioni
Perché tanto si soffre comunque soli
Chiunque trovi
Tu che vuoi, tu che puoi realizzarti con le relazioni
E dopo questa penserai che cinico e cattivo
Ma non so dire le bugie soltanto quando scrivo
E sono un figlio di puttana però lascio sempre
Spazio per te solamente

In me ci sarà sempre un po' di te in me
Ci sarà un po' di me in te
Ma noi non siamo soltanto parole di un’altra canzone d’amore
Ci sono sempre troppe regole, ho visto già tutte le repliche
Perché al mondo in fondo non serve un’altra canzone d’amore

Ci sono sempre troppe regole
Ho visto già tutte le repliche

Puntando all'orizzonte che non finisci qui

Una discesa troppo lunga per non trovare una salita
Un sogno troppo bello per durare una vita

E anche con 200 troie non mi basteranno quelle
Forse troppo vecchi per non pensare più alla morte
Ma ancora troppo giovani per un rapporto così forte
Non è la prima strofa che ti scrivo
Ma forse è la prima che faccio veramente con il cuore
E se ti guardo in faccia, ti dico solo amore

Perché mi riesce difficile spiegartelo a parole
E con l'ultimo bacio dato

Presi dai nostri lavori e dalle circostanze
Questa non è per dirti addio, è solo per dirti grazie.

Con cui mi sono aperto, con te gioco allo scoperto
Lo ripeto all'infinito (sei unica al mondo)

E da quel poco che l'ascolto
È già il mio pezzo preferito
Mangio merda da vent'anni
Ma non perdo l'appetito
Poi mi fanno pure fare la scarpetta con il dito
Labbra gusto di fumo
Mischiate col Pampero
Rende la testa pesante
Ma il cuore più leggero
E tu sei il cigno nero
Stanco di seguire il branco
E il cuore grande quanto il sole
Ma freddo come il marmo
Né giovani né grandi
Nel cuore piove grandine
Stasera niente alcol
Voglio bere le mie lacrime
E una crepa sopra il petto
Che diventa una voragine
Al quale non puoi fare le iniezioni di collagene
Io sono senza scrupoli e tu sei senza carattere
Togliamoci i vestiti, ma teniamoci le maschere
Se mi fissi bene non vedrai i miei occhi sbattere
Chi sogna ad occhi aperti perdo l'uso delle palpebre

La lacrima che brucia
Il vento la consuma
Il nero che mi sporca
Tanto poi si lava
E tutto ciò che ho perso
Io lo perdo ancora
Mi tengo dentro il vuoto
Che di te mi resta

E a cosa servirebbe dirci che ci siamo amati
Tanto quando esce il disco ci saremo già lasciati
Godiamoci il momento perché prima o poi finisce
L'amore spesso prende ma poi non restituisce
Io sto ancora aspettando il cuore che gli ho dato in prestito
Se la vita insegna io sono un alunno pessimo
È come se facessimo una gara
È un inizio lungo ma alla fine non è poi così lontana
Già, sei bella e dannata
La metà mancante di una mela avvelenata
E io cerco il sollievo in una dose di veleno
Come chi è stato allattato da chi ha le serpi in seno
Con la consapevolezza che non c'è certezza
Vieni stammi vicina, sì ma a distanza di sicurezza
Io ti ho dato un dito invece tu mi hai preso il cuore
E sono sempre stato incline agli sbalzi d'amore

Riassunto in due parole sono un rapper commerciale
E se non sono due parole non fa niente
Tanto sai che quì l'ascoltatore medio non è molto intelligente
E non mi chiedere perché il tuo commento va in Black List
Se mi scrivi, ""Fedez non sei più quello di Mi Fist""
E mentre scrivi che fa schifo pure 'sto freestyle
C'è un altro che mi chiede, ""Come fai l'effetto col fish eye?""
Mi odi perché faccio soldi facendo ciò che amo
Ma il rap non è una gara a chi piscia più lontano
E se mi sfidi rischi
Come quando inviti Xena in un torneo di freesbee
Io sono fuori luogo, ma tu sei fuori tempo
E vuoi sapere perché secondo me la scena sta morendo?
Per questa strana moda di sputare sul successo altrui 
Per giustificare il proprio triste fallimento

Il mio disco è nei negozi e tu lo stai già scaricando
Il tempo stringe ma sento il mio culo che si sta allargando
E' proprio vero che la crisi un po' ci sta cambiando
""Ma ciao! Come si chiama questa bella bimba? Armando""
L'atteggiamento dei miei fan, giuro che mi sta stressando
Chiederebbero la foto pure mentre sto cagando
E con tutto questo effetto mi sento così commosso
Però fammi andare al cesso che mi sto cagando addosso
Poco importa se i colleghi dicono che io non spacco
A loro brucia il culo, io ho le ortiche sopra il cazzo
Mettiti le scarpe di cemento con il tacco
E va affondo assieme a tutti i tuoi cazzoni dischi pacco
Quando io stavo alle jam tu ti mangiavi la bruschetta
Il tuo dj porta i piatti, tu il coltello e forchetta
E la tua tipa biondo platino avrà pure la frangetta
Ma quando la baci sembra che ti slingui David Guetta

Dai cazzo Federico, ti butti sul sociale
Però quando ti lanci vedi di non farti male

Noi, voi, non ci sarete più

Il mio rap è una carezza con le mani unte
E tra infami con la doppia faccia e troie con le doppie punte
Le tue due copie vendute, non sono pervenute
Se fallisco andiamo a consegnare pizze con lo scooter
Il mio manager non sa che sono un po' in ansia e sudo
Si fa' le canne e poi collassa sul divano dello studio
Ma qui spesso l'apparenza ti nasconde un lato oscuro
Come a volte un brutto naso ti fa perdere un bel culo
Eh scusa, ma è vero che voi rappers, non siete veri artisti?
E che vendete il culo ancora prima di vendere i dischi?
Scrivi testi ma detesti manifesti comunisti
Ma ora Gué ti produce come Eminem con Fifty
""Siete dei fake di merda, sempre a copiare gli americani, cazzo""
E tra Tiziano che era gay e faceva lo sciupafemmine
E chi si è fatto una carriera copiando i testi di Eminem (chi?)
Se cerchi doppie facce qua trovi un terreno fertile
Ti sento moscio come un cazzo in disfunzione erettile

Corri finché puoi sopra dei vetri a piedi scalzi

Dici che sono fake perché giro col tutù
E che il vero hip-hop lo spinge solamente la tua crew
Ma poi vedono uno spicciolo 
E vedi che incominciano a fare tutti il singolo cantato in auto-tune
Come la metti adesso con la tua cultura
Io perlomeno non mi riempio la bocca di spazzatura
Io ho regalato un disco registrato ad alto budget
E tu vendi a cinque euro un mixtape da dieci tracce
Se poi ci mettono in manette per gli album illegali
Dividete i detenuti per generi musicali
Che già andare in galera mi sembra una brutta storia
E sai che sfiga stare in cella insieme ad un fan di Povia

E che sei il gran maestro di una loggia massonica?

Pensa a farti una gran bella scopata fratè

Fede, messa e rock‘n’Rolex

Padre dammi uno yacht
Ed un loft a New York
Il sushi a Saint Tropez
Il bidè di Chanel
Emporio Armani
E per voi mortali
Io sono glamour
Non viaggio in treno
E non so cosa sia Ryanair
Tu con la Panda vai alla Standa
Io c’ho la Limo
E non pago l’IMU
Sono proprio un Cardinal Chic

Quando un prelato passa il piatto a un altro uomo
Molto probabilemnte è il suo maggiordomo
Pensare a queste cose fa un po' riflettere
Che la Chiesa è un lusso che non ti puoi permettere
Vestiti su misura per credenti e non
Stilisti dello IOR don Vuitton
Scarica il rosario dall’Apple Store
Vieni a benedire il tuo smartphone
La speranza è in vacanza come il culo di un politico
Lo Spirito Santo è a Borghetto Santo Spirito
I peccatori sono tutti quanti a Porto Cervo
Dici ora li raggiungo sennò a cosa servo
Prosciutto di Prada e fedeli al lastrico
La ricetta giusta per un patè d’animo
La libertà si guadagna non si compra
Ma i ricchi all’inferno hanno sempre un posto all’ombra

Cardinali con la scorta di Stato
Comuni mortali con la scorta di cibo
Più che il Regno del Cielo questo è il regno del clero
Con i vescovi ai piani alti che al massimo si sbucciano le ginocchia pregando sui diamanti
E i fedeli ai piani bassi che al massimo sbucciano cipolle pregando di fronte a un frigo vuoto
Le madonne inizieranno davvero a piangere sangue
A noi le ostie a voi le ostriche
La vostra eucarestia è la nostra carestia
Aspiranti don Verzè con la faccia come il culto
Ipocrisia incastonata in collane e anelli d'oro pesante
Più che bulli di quartiere siete bulli di Cartier

Fedez,"Cara ansia dove sei non ci sentiamo da due anni
Sei andata via cosi senza nemmeno salutarmi
Può darsi che un giorno passerai a trovarmi
Quante notti insieme svegli fino a notte tardi
Vite appese ad un filo di cashmere
Mi preoccupo perchè non ho più niente di cui preoccuparmi
Si dice che la vita è una tienitela stretta 
E che il successo uccide lentamente ma io non ho fretta
E se mi guardo indietro con dieci anni di distanza 
Ero con le tasche vuote e le palle piene di speranza
È andata come è andata via! ce la siamo giocata
Ora io faccio la differenza e tu fai la differenziata
Dai pezzi dentro disco rigido al primo disco fisico
Uscito con un'ora di ritardo e dieci anni d'anticipo
Dal vuoto del Grand Canyon a vincere il Gran Premio 
Riconosco un uomo disperato a casa anch'io ho uno specchio

Mi odi a priori lo so
Più parlano più penso che sia per sport
Non cambiano
Non sogni tutto quello che io ho
Come no
Come no,come no

L'invidia arriva sempre dal basso verso l'alto
E per ogni passo falso è più sangue di un salasso
Sai perchè si punta in alto e non in largo? 
Perchè gli sputi sono sempre dall'alto verso il basso
Tu lo fai per hobby io lo faccio di mestiere
Infatti tu non odi me ma solo ciò che non puoi avere
Quando sei una stella di mestiere chi non ti può vedere
Esprime un solo desiderio: vederti cadere

Mi odi a priori lo so
Più parlano 
Più penso che sia per sport
Non cambiano
Non sogni tutto quello che io ho
Come no
Come no,come no,come no

Più la gente critica più questo mi gratifica,
Perchè significa che ho il fascino della classifica
Più ci mangi e bevi ti andava bene finchè c'eri
Perchè sputi nel piatto in cui pippavi fino a ieri
Sorrisi artificiosi buoni per gli artificieri
Perchè qua più sono finti più ti dicono di essere veri
Questi parlano alle spalle mentre io sempre di fronte
Infatti loro sono spalle, io invece sono il frontman

Mi odi a priori lo so
Più parlano 
Più penso che sia per sport
Non cambiano
Non sogni tutto quello che io ho
Come no
Come no,come no,come no",Come no,2014
Fedez,"Un italiano du tre vive a casa dei genitori
Il problema è che gli altri due sono i genitori
Con in mano il testamento tipo Nonno quando muori?
Ti trovi a quarant'anni a dire Mamma dormo fuori
E' noto che l'italico soffre di stress post-traumatico da cellulare scarico
Tipo che l'Iphone smette di scrivere e tu smetti di vivere
Pazzo per gli autoscatti? Sei fotosensibile
Su Facebook si è iscritta metà popolazione
L'altra metà ha ancora dei problemi con il modem
I suicidi ormai non fanno più tanto rumore
In tuo onore ci sarà un minuto di silenziatore
Il mio paese chiama Facchinetti figlio d'arte
E' come andare da McDonald's e dire Vado al ristorante
Un vecchio è un pericolo se guida una Mercedes
Figuriamoci quando è alla guida di un paese

C'è Ancora chi crede in un posto migliore
Per questo si fanno le valigie e si parte
C'è ancora chi crede in un mondo migliore
Per questo mandiamo le sonde su Marte
L'Italia è a forma di stivale
Per questo prendiamo calci in culo dalla sera al mattino
Ma in fondo se ci pensi ci è andata pure bene
Pensa se era a forma di preservativo
Ricariche dello stato
Con le tasse che ho pagato compravo mezzo stato
Come si chiama la carica da parte dei polizziotti sui manifestanti?'
Cariche dello stato.
Rinunci alla casa e alla villa con vista
Un italiano su tre rinuncia anche il dentista
Viviamo in condizioni pre-carie
Che molto presto diventeranno carie

Non ci fermiamo alle precedenze
Ma ci fermiamo alle apparenze
Abbiamo più punti interrogativi che punti di riferimento
Guardiamo tutti le stesse cose
Indossiamo gli stessi vestiti
Mettiamo le stesse scarpe
Siamo specchi che non riflettono
Prigionieri del presente in un paese senza futuro
O reagiamo o ci troviamo a cucire l'orlo del baratro
E a quel punto i rimorsi faranno più male dei morsi

Fedez,"Guardo dal telescopio l'universo femminile
Scrivo fine in un secondo se in te c'è un secondo fine
Lo so è brutto da pensare
Mi aspetto che ti piaccia stare
Sotto le coperte e non sopra le copertine
L'amore a prima Visa
È un sentimento splendido
Mi ha detto un indovino che legge le carte di credito
Vomito, amore tossico, per me sei stata il mio primo bacio
Sulla bocca dello stomaco
A volte sembra che mi sfidi ma non mi spaventi
Nella vita hai provato più vestiti che sentimenti
Istruzioni di lavaggio per cuori sintetici
Ti prego dimmi che mi ami
Potrei persino crederci
E tutte le tue amiche fanno un muro da spavento
I miei tatuaggi non sono di loro gradimento
Io sono sporco all'esterno ma giudicare le apparenze
È l'atteggiamento tipico di chi è sporco dentro

Di storie ce ne sono tante
Pensavo fossi l'ultima e invece no
In fondo anche tu
Sei solo un segno in più
Che sulla pelle fa più male
Continuerà a bruciare anche se ora lo so
Che in fondo anche tu
Sei solo un segno in più

A volte è Dio che sbaglia la tua ordinazione
Per questo se chiudi la porta si apre un burrone
Sei il mio punto debole
La mia causa di forza maggiore
Un senso di rivoluzione
Un golpe al cuore
Più truccata di un appalto su uno scorcio suggestivo
Se ti guardo a luci spente sei un tramonto abusivo
Inverti lo schema e cambi anche il teorema
Prima eri un problema di cuore ora sei il cuore del problema
Non ho difficoltà a dirti quel che penso in faccia
Anche se non sembra so bene quello che faccio
La verità è che ho invertito il senso di marcia
Da quando ho avvertito il senso di marcia
Arrivi portando brividi e scappi lasciando i lividi
Gli opposti si attraggono ma amano i propri simili
Sentimenti tossici per loro non c'è cura
Perché l'amore eterni finché dura

Di storie ce ne sono tante
Pensavo fossi l'ultima e invece no
In fondo anche tu
Sei solo un segno in più
Che sulla pelle fa più male
Continuerà a bruciare anche se ora lo so
Che in fondo anche tu 
Sei solo un segno in più

Fermo immagine sembra appartenere ad un'altra vita
Un cielo instabile
Che quasi sembra piangere, piangere
Ed io che torno tardi sola e penso che
Di storie ce ne sono tante
Pensavo fossi l'ultima e invece no, e invece no, e invece no

Fedez,"Per strada ho perso amici come le monete 
Faccio tutto quello che voi mi chiedete 
È bello quando in giro mi riconoscete 
(Ma tu sei Emis Killa? Ehm no) 
Lei si aspetta un addio da film struggente 
Ma perché versare lacrime sul niente 
Nella vita un vaffanculo è più che sufficiente 
Bicchieri mezzi pieni di rimpianti 
E party ai piani alti 
Dove più sei coglione più hai bisogno di farlo sapere agli altri 
E avanti 
La cara vecchia vita scordala 
Uscire sempre con un bodyguard 
Perché per ogni applauso c’è sempre nascosto un vaffanculo dietro 
Le fughe dal retro 
Le mani sul vetro 
E chi se lo ricorda più di come è fatta una metro 
Da quant’è che non ci sentiamo? 
Ti serve un accredito, possibilmente un pass backstage con accesso al palcoscenico

L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu

Ma a quanto pare ho una vita niente male 
Ma per me in Italia niente mare 
In cerca di un bel posto dove posso stare 
(Guardi per lei Timbuctù è perfetta) 
Faccio foto ricordo in giorni da dimenticare 
Ma almeno con gli autografi risparmio sui regali di Natale 
E io che nelle discoteche non ci ho mai messo piede 
Ora son pagato per andare con la maschera di Fedez 
E non sempre è un bene 
La cara vecchia vita scordala 
Uscire sempre con un bodyguard 
Perché per ogni applauso c’è sempre nascosto un vaffanculo dietro 
Le fughe dal retro 
Le mani sul vetro 
E chi se lo ricorda più di come è fatta una metro 
Da quant’è che non ci sentiamo? 
Ti serve un accredito, possibilmente un pass backstage con accesso al palcoscenico

L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu

Una pioggia di lampi colorati incendia il palcoscenico 
Ma la prima cosa a bruciare è il tuo stomaco 
Gli effetti speciali precedono sempre gli effetti collaterali 
La fama è solo il franchising del successo 
Ti fermano per strada perché sei qualcuno 
Ti chiedono le foto perché sei qualcuno 
Ti invitano alle feste perché sei qualcuno 
E quante volte tu più che qualcuno avresti voluto essere qualcun altro 
Nuove amicizie attratte dal soldo 
Rapporti umani costantemente in saldo 
Nessuno al mondo è ricco, ci sono solo poveri e poveri con I soldi 
La differenza tra l’essere in bolletta e il non voler pagare la bolletta, specie quella dei riflettori

Ma è pericoloso spegnere le luci della ribalta se hai paura del buio 
Se gli piaci troppo è perché non ti hanno capito 
Se gli piaci affatto è perché non ti hanno capito 
Essere è non essere compreso 
Il tuo privilegio è l’IVA di un prezzo troppo alto da pagare 
Per quanto potrai guadagnare le tue debolezze resteranno un lusso che non ti potrai mai permettere di ostentare 
Ci sono giorni in cui rinuncerai al successo, ma oramai è successo 
La cara vecchia vita scordala 
Uscire sempre con un bodyguard

Ti porto una spina ma senza la rosa
Tu sei un’aspirina vestita da sposa
Stammi lontana che qua non è cosa
Forse non sai la pazzia è contagiosa
Al distributore senza codice fiscale
Mi sento vuoto come questo pacchetto di Camel
Siamo a fine serata aspettative poche
Tra pacchi di paglie e di redbull vuote
