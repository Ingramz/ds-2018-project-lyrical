Staind,"If ever you had said to me before
That I would live this life that I am
Living now I guess it's all so strange
To feel the way I do inside but
Have so much that I could feel some
Pride for in my life so why is it that
I feel like this

How do I feel? 
I've been here before.
I've felt this.
Retreat to a place, a place within.
I need this. 
Keep it all down, bottled inside
It breaks me to torment again and
Torture me like it used to.

I try and try to break away from all the hate
I'm feeling for every one of you that's ever
Done me wrong. 
I need to justify the reasons
For the way I'm living. 
I guess I can't 'cause
I don't feel like I deserve it

How do I feel? I've been here before.
I've felt this.
Retreat to a place, a place within.
I need this. 
Keep it all down, bottled inside
It breaks me to torment again and
Torture me like it used to.

So now the waves they have subsided
And my soul is bleeding I can't take away
The shame I feel. 
Forgive me.

How do I feel? 
I've been here before.
I've felt this.
Retreat to a place, a place within me.
I need this. 
Keep it all down, bottled inside
It breaks me to torment again and
Torture me like it used to.",Change,2001
Staind,"Your words to me just a whisper
Your face is so unclear
I try to pay attention
Your words just disappear

'Cause it's always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said

So I speak to you in riddles
'Cause my words get in my way
I smoke the whole thing to my head
And feel it wash away
'Cause I can't take anymore of this
I want to come apart
And dig myself a little hole
Inside your precious heart

'Cause it's always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said

I am nothing more than
A little boy inside
That cries out for attention
Yet I always try to hide
'Cause I talk to you like children
Though I don't know how I feel
But I know I'll do the right thing
If the right thing is revealed

'Cause it's always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said",Epiphany,2001
Staind,"I try to breathe
Memories overtaking me
I try to face them but
The thought is too
Much to conceive

I only know that I can change
Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness
That my life became 'cause

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt
I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface
I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

So where were you
When all this I was going through
You never took the time to ask me
Just what you could do",Fade,2001
Staind,"To my mother, to my father
It's your son or
It's your daughter
Are my screams loud enough for
You to hear me, should I turn this up for you

I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

The silence is what kills me
I need someone here to help me
But you don't know
How to listen
And let me make
My decision

I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

All your insults and your curses
Make me feel like I'm not a person
And I feel like I am nothing
But you made me so
Do something

'Cause I'm fucked up
Because you all need attention
Attention you couldn't give

'Cause,

I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast",For You,2001
Staind,"And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I first saw you
And it's been awhile
Since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile
Since I could call you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

And it's been awhile
Since I can say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile
Since I can say I love myself as well
And it's been awhile
Since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do
And it's been awhile
But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day!

And it's been awhile
Since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile
Since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile
Since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile
But I can still remember just the way you taste

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I said I'm sorry",It's Been Awhile,2001
Staind,"As I walk along these streets
I see a man that walks alone
Distant echo of people's feet
He has no place to call his own
A shot rings out from a roof overhead
A crackhead asks for change nearby
An old man lies in an alleyway dead
A little girl lost just stands there and cries 

What would you do, if it was you
Would you take everything
For granted like you do

A boy just thirteen on the corner for sale
Swallows his pride for another hit
Overpopulation there's no room in jail
But most of you don't give a shit
That your daughters are porno stars
And your sons sell death to kids
You're so lost in your little worlds
Your little worlds you'll never fix

You turn away
You turn away
You turn away
You turn away
As I walk along the streets
Soaking up the acid rain
Underneath the taxi cabs
I hear the streets cry out in vain",Open Your Eyes,2001
Staind,"And you
Can bring me to my knees
Again

All the times
That I could beg you please
In vain

All the times
That I felt insecure
For you

And I leave
My burdens at the door

But I'm on the outside
I'm looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly
You're ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you

All the times
That I felt like this won't end
It's for you

And I taste
What I could never have
It was from you

All those times
That I cry my intentions
Full of pride
But I waste
More time than anyone

But I'm on the outside

I can see through you
See your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly
You're ugly like me
I can see through you

All the times
That I've cried
All that's wasted
It's all inside

And I feel all this pain
Stuffed it down
It's back again

And I lie
Here in bed
All alone
I can't mend

But I feel
Tomorrow will be okay

But I'm on the outside

Staind,"I just need this to be alright
I can't feel this another night

I can't take this I come unglued

Necessary to medicate
I'm not sleeping, can't stay awake

Can't see through this
Too much pressure
Drowning in this
Too much pressure

If you need me I'll be here
Half unconscious to escape my fear

The more you see the more you do
The television's feeding you
With what you want to hear

To live another day
Within a world that longs to suffer

No matter how hard I try
To squeeze my eyes shut
So I can't see the pain
In you this pain in me, in me

But everything that I can say to you
Won't help you, everything you need is right in front of you
Just take it

I know that I am really not here
To represent what I am not clear
About in my head sometimes
I feel fucked up just like you do, like you do

But everything that I can say to you
Won't help you, everything you need is right in front of you
Just take it

Try to make it through the daily pain
That you feel, maybe tomorrow won't be so bad.
It know it
Cause I once felt that way
Nothing I could say
Made it go away
I lived through this
I still feel this
I just live for my tomorrow

Staind,"Your mother came up to me,
She wanted answers only she should know,
Only she should know.
It wasn't easy to deal with the tears that rolled down her face.
I had no answers 'cause I didn't even know you.

But these words
They can't replace,
The life you,
The life you waste.

How could you paint this picture?
Was life as bad as it should seem, that there were no more options for you?
I can't explain how I feel.
I've been there many times before.
I've tasted the cold steel of my life crashing down before me.

But these words
They can't replace,
The life you,
The life you waste.

Did daddy not love you?
Or did he love you just too much?
Did he control you?
Did he live through you at your cost?
Did he leave no questions for you to answer on your own?

Well fuck them,
And fuck her,
And fuck him,
And fuck you,
For not having the strength in your heart to pull through.
I've had doubts,
I have failed,
I've fucked up,
I've had plans,
Doesn't mean I should take my life with my own hands.

They can't replace,

Alone, with my insanity 
Alone, no one to blame but me

I stand at the edge staring into my fate

I see through you 
What makes you think that you're god 
Pick up the pieces as I fall apart 
Why must you fuck with me 

Betrayed, you left me here for dead 
Betrayed, by the voices in my head 
Betrayed, left my out in the rain 
Betrayed, nothing left but pain 
I'm sick of the answers 
Your cannibal instincts and false dedications 
You leave me here cold, nothing left but my shell 
To die while I'm living and burn in my hell

I pick you apart little by little 
Till nothing is left but the look on your face

I see myself and look away
The road is showing now on my face
Soon I'll disappear with
I'll disappear without a fucking trace

Faces that I've seen turn old and gray
I've lost too many friends along the way
Memories I never thought would fade
They fade and Blow Away

I wish that I could disappear
Unzip my skin and leave it here
So I could be no one again
And never let nobody
I'd let nobody
I'd never let nobody in

Faces that I've seen turn old and grey
I've lost too many friends along the way
Memories I never thought would fade
They fade and Blow Away

So now the walls are closing in
Because in life you sink or swim
Sometimes these shoes don't feel right in my head

Staind,"If someone else showed you the way
Would you take the wheel and steer?
It hurts me that you're not ashamed
Of what you're doing here
If they jumped off a bridge

That it never made a sound

And learns to walk through life themselves
Not everything in life is, handed on a plate
When people think your words are true
It doesn't matter what you do
I sold my soul to get here
How 'bout you?

So you choose to force your hand
What a strange way to make friends
And you always change the rules
So the drama never ends
And you blindly go through life
Judging only by what its worth
Just try not to forget
That the meek inherit earth

Staind,"I heard today that you were gone
I had to stop and sing along
The song they played to say goodbye
A song that gave
Gave me back life

You'll never fade
The words you gave 
My life you saved
Your name was Layne

And on that day a child was born 
To someone who you helped along
And helped see through his darkest times
Because of you, this child, she is mine 

You'll never fade
The words you gave 
My life you saved
Your name was Layne

The words you said
You made me feel like they were all for me
The words you said
They will always be a part of me
The words you said
You made me feel like I was not alone
The words you said
You gave me all the strength to carry on

So to me you'll never fade
Your life you gave
My life you saved
Your name was Layne",Layne,2003

Taking without giving back 'till the damage can be seen
Can you see? Can you see?

[Chorus]
The more you take, the more you blame
But everything still feels the same
The more you hurt the more you scream
The price you pay to play the game
Then all you see and all you gave
And all you step on will know shame
There are no rules, no one to blame
The price to play the game

Empathy, the chosen way to be
Blindly look the other way
While you waste away with me
Can you see? Can you see?

Staind,"The lights are on but you're not home
You've drifted off somewhere alone
Somewhere that's safe
No questions here
A quiet place
Where you hide from your fears

Sometimes when you're out of rope
The way to climb back up's unclear
The walls you build around yourself
I guess they also keep you here
Are you afraid of what they think?
Whoever ""they"" happen to be
Or are you hiding 
From the scars of your own Reality?

So you sedate and drown in vain
You've got a pill for every day
A suit and tie to mask the truth
Its ugly head is starting to show through

Sometimes when you're out of rope

The walls you build around yourself
I guess they also keep you here
Are you afraid of what they think?
Whoever ""they"" happen to be
Or are you hiding 
From the scars of your own Reality?

The monster you're feeding
Your lack of perception
The things you will do
To fulfill addictions
The light at the end of your tunnel is closing
What is it that you're so afraid of exposing?
You'd give it all up 
For what's there for the taking
Whatever it takes to keep your hands from shaking
The same things you're thinking 
Might make you feel better
The same things that probably got you here

Things I did in the dark, will it ever see the light?

She keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs
I think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fucking feature
I do at least three a week, roll up the fucking reefer
Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas
Ten chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer
Niggas claim that they thugging when they dick-riding
My niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbing
On the block in my all white sneakers
Lord knows that my ten Jesus pieces
Pray for me cause you know a nigga doing wrong
My homie in the cell, so I had to write a poem
Count mills for the times that we had it hard
Asking for a hundred mill as I pray to God

I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the far side
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

Drinking vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn (I miss you Peanut)
Riding real slow on them all golds (we had them nigga)
Shopping for them Os when the mall close
Repping for your homies when they all gone
Get empowered then you put your dog on (Real shit)
All black tees, ten gold chains
At the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game
Ten years strong in the same trap
Ten years blowing on that strong pack
Lord knows that I wanna live right
But Lord knows what that Club Liv like (right)
Forty dollar tab meaning forty grand
Lord ? got it rolled up in a rubber band
Holding on the forty in his other hand
Ten chains on, smoking in the motherland

All these jewels on, all ?
I could see it in the sparkle cause it lacklustre
Black card maxed out, damn black brother
White collar, black minded
Chrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket
Eight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta
Screaming your affiliations, but that don't matter
I'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither
Never blackmail them, motherfucking killer
On trial and they wanna execute me
It's really sad, just the fact they never knew me
True G to the core, feel my texture
A true G keeps it raw in his lecture
Keep it simple, white tee, new sneakers
Dope boy style, ten Jesus pieces

Nas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean
Ye did it fresh, but man Big did it the best
And I was so impressed that I went and got ten
Now I'm stunting on these niggas cause I couldn't back in
Rose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum
And I wear them all at once, I ain't trying to match them
I remember bumping Mac 10 and that deuce in the corner
Scraping up for a sandwich and a soda
Now my strength is up and I'm dangling chains off my shoulders
But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed
For the reason that I rhyme
And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine
Or even put it in a rhyme
It's better things I could talk about or put my money towards
But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss

I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties

Bonnie and Clyde story, Mick and Mallory
A killer in them sheets, they bring that ish up out of me
After that I sit and counting G’s after G
‘Cause it’s right back to these ends
Send her on her way, tell her come back with some friends
We can do it all again, the repetition that I like
The reputation of a pimp
And I do it all on him, peep the way I limp
Pimp walk I been brought my chick, it was money well spent
They say it’s cold-blooded how I talk
I been winning this way for years, so what if I ain’t lost?

Smoke an ounce of the truth: that's my fountain of youth
R.I.P. to Mr. Shakur, this one is for you
Nippsey Hussle and I got my nigga Stalley on it
Double MG burning out in Cali on it

Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental
Keys got me sentimental

These rap books buried in gold
The treasure of a million men, Versace shades trimmed in gold
My life's big like them cameras explode
Capture this rags to riches story that I unfold
The youth fountain for the few counting
Made money, but who's counting?
It's hard stunting living in subsidized housing
Every bag you bring though the door, dude's counting
And every new girl you bring through, dude's hounding
They want your youth, so they watch your moves
From your pinky ring, down to how you lace your shoes
Rope chains with the precious jewels
The dope game had impression rules
What they did with cocaine and a couple spoons
Had the whole hood acting like goons
Trying to be the richest, trying to the be fliest
Claim to be balling, end up like Len Bias
Screaming from the bottom of this fountain here, nothing but silence

Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental
Keys got me sentimental

Laces in my blue Chucks, represent my bros first
Staring at my Rollie bezel as I soul-search
Run this money marathon til my soles hurt
But no materials could measure what my soul's worth
I wanted everything, feel like I had no choice
Young niggas wishing on a star like Rose Royce
Being honest, killing mamas when we sold work
I made a promise, give me options and I cold-turkey
Sick of sitting on the side while it's game point
Recurring dream, tryna scream but ain't had no voice
Crazy lady speaking tongues said it's gon' work
Never vocalize my visions, actions was my spokesperson
Study rich niggas' moves like my homework
Sacrilegious; however, streets was my own church

Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental
Keys got me sentimental",Fountain of Youth,2012
Stalley,"If Michael Jackson came alive right now
He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga

It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked

I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle

May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine

There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas, lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about

Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, where it hurt you
Life in the power circle

Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
It's too late now
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga, ugh!",Power Circle,2012
Stalley,"Boy, I'm shinning on these hoes
Triple gold Daytons when I'm riding on these hoes
Got that leather and wood
You know how that story goes
I'm always on my toes when I ain't pushing a wheel
Tires screech and squeal as I bend it to the top
All these haters sit and watch my climb wishing that it stop
I got a crown on my wrist and a crown on my top
And I got it on alone now they crowding my spot, man
Is this the game that I chose?
Nobody gave me ish so it's nobody I owe
I got that Lee-Roy glow
Soul of an assassin and I'm trying to have me backed in
Off up in that corner but I'm off up in this bitch
Gold dangling all over
This W tat sweater and it's double M G
I ain't gonna be slept on forever
Tell the Sandman to wake em up and help me count this cheddar
Not enough hands on me
Eyes on the sparrow and I'm laid up like a pharaoh
Got a couple grand on me, I'm just living my life
They said I would change, I'm just proving em right
I was broke before, so I'll be broke some more
Man, that don't sound right
But what it sound like is a good year for me
I used to look at the future and I couldn't bear to see
Me, my momma, and my sister was the bears in the tree
Porridge in my bowl, trying to keep hold of my souls
Now I'm the big man to beat
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree
When you start shaking that tree
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree
Look at me

My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

Gold Rollie, most hoes want to know me
Blowing OG, I never socialize with police
Glock 40, never had it, why I'mma need it?
It'll be them niggas that's looking for it mama'll be grieving
I ain't thugging, who the fuck is you mean-mugging?
I seen the meanest and toughest niggas Speedy Gonzales
Don't obsess over money, I'm just eager for comfort
Don't obsess over fame, I just speak to the public
Ain't reached my zenith, but all the people see that I'm buzzing
Shout outs Seattle, but these rappers, they stealing my thunder
Lost a lot of homies, none of 'em even died
I see 'em all the time, but jealousy is sabotage
Riding in another drop, ain't talking Enterprise
They try to see me, get diabetes from humble pie
Yeah, I hate to lose more than they love to win
That's the difference 'tween me and them

My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

I wake up in the morning, roll up my marijuana
Thinking 'bout tomorrow, I don't want to be a martyr
Stress that I be under, blame that on my baby momma
Pills that I be popping, wonder will they take me under?
Rush to Mac 11 for these ho niggas with drama
Success in my possession, had you murdered out of karma
All these niggas snitching, witness perjury, Your Honor
Handle my business, tuition for my kids' college
Dope boy styling, DEA target
One point seven for these VS's on my collar
Born in the projects, now I'm known as the hottest
Lay your whole label down, bitch I came for the dollars

Back when I was ballin', shootin' 3's for a dollar
I was hustlin' niggas back then, buyin' momma scratch and wins
Stackin my ends, tryin' to get that Robinson
Cause pop was robbin', beatin' 'em back then

Dickie pants an suite and tie

In case they trip automatics with grip protect possessions
Don’t condone a weapon but they out to catch us slippin'

Always into something

Impala on eights, dope boys on crates
Swiss movement on watch, 45 on the waist
Got a million dollar hustle, a rich nigga face
White cocaine, rack it up on the plate
Alpina Beamer with the cavalier plates
My niggas dribble down in VA on the run from the DEA
That’s when niggas wore button ups and white ups like
H O V A, and everybody had Ye before 808s & Heartbreak
The streets was a shark tank, put money in the gold link
And loyalty was everything
Your lady held you down, with or without a wedding ring
Selling dope wasn’t settling
If you could smoke it they was selling it
Hard grind peddling
A street nigga pedigree, tryna leave a kingpin legacy
Pockets fat like Ledisi, thank you to the heavenly

Pockets full of stones and an automatic weapon
Teenage outlaws, rebels without cause
Lost in this jungle where everybody is flawed
Middle finger to the law, best friends lay in morgues
And they wonder why our attitude’s raw
A real nigga never take a fall, that’s on god
Or never take on the false façade
Before that happens niggas blocks getting taked off
Appetite for destruction
That’s how we all function, and we get it how we live
Even if it’s gun busting
Number crunching with 8 balls for fiends luncheon
Anything to keep from ribs touching
Rims bumping, I blame it on Cube
He says it gets funky, a subject and a predicate
F the police, that’s a gangster nigga’s etiquette
And this nine filled with cop killers that’s sitting on my hip

Praying in the dark hoping that I see light
Trynna stay sharp with a dark vision
Gotta couple heathens with me trynna bombard the system
My man just went to jail and brought a gun charge with him
On top of that other felonies
I told him hold his head I'll make sure he lives through these melodies
I hate to see him trapped, wish these raps could just set him free
Whoever thought selling heart would get you seventeen, that's seventeen
I mean yesterday was everything if there's no hope for tomorrow
And money ain't everything, I can go broke tomorrow
Sometimes I find happiness in a broke down cigar
In an isolated room on this Navajo wall
Mind drifting, smoke disappearing through the wall
I hear the loud voices, that's my homies calling
Open up the windows, let the angels fall in

As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted
Like Navajo Rugs or woven blankets
As I bob and weave between stars
Learn and dream between Mars
When words are weaved, pictures are painted

Got so much on my mind, all these thoughts weaving in and out created design
So intricate like hand spun rugs
They say they talking outside
But I hear no love
I feel the shots in my back
But there's no slugs
I brush the dirt off my shoulders
Wipe away all the mug that's been slung
They say the sword ain't as mighty as the tongue
The horns get the attention
But the war starts with the drum
808s and low ends beating on my chest like King Kong
Gorilla warfare, the force here
You could feel it in the song
All the warrior in this gone
I sip Indian style wrapped' in blankets
Smokin' on the bong, trynna find my inner peace
Jugglin' stone, never take it for granted, what the struggle is for
Cuz through that dark hole life is beautiful, like emeralds and gold
There's diamonds in the dirt, you just gotta dig through some coal

I woke up among the confused, but yawning
The bloodstream came to collect dues this morning
For all the signs we drop, the parachute supplies
Are limited, coated in images
Yet the code of the streets leaves our thoughts with no access
The revenue of colour, all reduced to a blackness
But aside the thought, I can find the calm
That's why we close our eyes to concentrate
The cons debate, against the pros talking first degree
Murder on the clock, they got time to kill
I'm intricate to be up in it
So I defend every minute, cons hoping for dimes to deal
Perimeters occupied by a few chosen
To take heed to the fact a few in here are posin'
On the laws of lies, attracted to the warm like wool
But don't let it get pulled over your eyes
Oh, lord

Them niggas gon' be mad as fuck when they wake up
How much of our time will it take us?
It's like the '60s all over
Catch a nigga sleeping, Peter Rolla
Hunted like we're animals and shot dead
It's crazy in the hood but I am not scared
It's evident that the evidence
That was captured on the camera was irrelevant
Get the dogs, get the tanks out
Fuck a nigga, blow his goddamn brains out
Same shit, different city
I'm revealing, that the reason that they're fucking with me
Wise up to the plot
They're targeting the youth and just about to wipe our ass out

The law can't save us in our own hood
Walk around hooded down in your own hood
And they run up on you with the pistols out
Should've took a different route, these crackers tryna X us out
But this is home here, we should be able to roam here
With no fear, but it's crazy in the hood
Klan members turn cops, harassing our youth
Got our backs against the wall, hands up, they still shoot
So what we gon' do? Either ride or be quiet
I think there has been peace for too long, let's be violent
Malcolm Stalley mixed with Makaveli in front your precinct 
Middle fingers, Mac-11's pointed at the law
That's what we think, now who's crazy?
And this momma next to me want to know why you shot her baby
Left him cold in the street, not treating him like a human
So ya pigs get the same treatment, every time we see one of y'all
We shooting

I smoke on that gas, I fly from California
Bumpin’ that new Stanley, Ty Dolla I’m on it
Forbes, cash king, real nigga persona, huh
Smokin’ with my niggas, my shawty a roller
Biker gang tatted, really a Tommy Mottola
Niggas losin’ touch but they tweetin’ more
I only feel a rush when we eatin’ more, huh
Hustle hard before my seeds deseed more
Swear to the lord the less, why did I had with three floors?
Roll a blunt with the ladies, playmates of the month
We out the country in Dallas
It’s sad son, I’m what they want
We the money team, Mayweather and Ricky now
No more trickin’ it’s time to put some real pimpin’ down
We the heaviest even if it was featherweight
If it’s on me, it’s deejee K, or it’s tailor made
Cribs in Atlanta, out in Vegas too
Out in Ohio it’s Stanley, Manzelli kept it true
Lebron know the play, get your checks nigga
Busy gettin’ mine, can’t worry ’bout the next nigga

October 27th, Ohio
My nigga Stalley, it’s a long way my nigga
But it feels good to know, dreams come true

I got everything a dope boy ever wanted
’87 monte, with the rallies on it
Ridin’, Iphone 6 fully charged
Aux plug connected bumpin’ Elvis Presley blvd
Couple hard niggas with me playing body guard
So if you reach, get your body scarred, 12 Gauge shotty squad
95 Percent of these niggas ain’t really down to squab
The other 5 percent, playing “god, oh lord”
The games comical, all I can do is laugh now
And all that beefin’ gon’ turn me into a cash cow
And for that money, broad daylight, I’ll pull that mask down
Rozay got me out that basement, for him I’ll lay that ass down
And I ain’t hollerin’, just smooth talk over beat Billi
It’s double m to the grave, free meek Milly
Dreams worth more than money, the album bout nothin’
Bcg this our year, tell em stop frontin’
In the hood billionaire got whatever on it
This the crown in Ohio, I sit on that throne
And welcome back Lebron, but Stalley been home

Yeah, BCG, MMG
Y’all niggas act like I don’t be rappin’
Like I ain’t one of the nicest out here
Like I ain’t got Ohio and the Midwest on my back
Y’all better pay attention

Grape Swisher Sweets and a box of Middletons
I go straight to my connect, I don't need a middle man
A zip of blue dream and platinum cookies

And my jewels give you that 1989 feel

Forgiato grill on my '76 Chevelle

Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck
I got a story to tell, here we go

Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose

Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect caller from Jeff
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the I'll street blues
""The friends will make you, them too can break you
They plan an execution like Fu Manchu""

""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""

""A million and a half or he won't be back""
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke

Stan,"I sit alone and watch the clock
Trying to collect my thoughts
All I think about is you
And so I cry myself to sleep 
And hope the devil I don?t meet
In the dreams that I live through

Believe in me
I know you?ve waited for so long
Believe in me
Sometimes the weak become the strong
Believe in me
This life?s not always what it seems 
Believe in me
Cause I was made for chasing dreams

All the smiles you?ve had to fake 
And all the shit you?ve had to take
Just to lead us here again

I never have the things to say,
To make it all just go away,
To make it all just disappear

Believe in me
I know you?ve waited for so long
Believe in me
Sometimes the weak become the strong
Believe in me
This life?s not always what it seems 
Believe in me
Cause I was made for chasing dreams

Its my life 
Its my choice
Hear my words
Hear my voice
And just believe

I Sit alone and watch the clock
Trying to collect my thoughts
And all I think about is you

If you believe in me
Life?s not always what it seems
Believe in me
Cause I was made for chasing dreams

Believe in me

Believe in me
Sometimes the weak become the strong
Believe in me
This life?s not always what it seems

Stan Andrews,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.

I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

You say love isn't what you needed but I can't stop wanting you

Living in an illusion, never joining any dance

'cause I'm falling, falling from this tower, where I keep my heart a prisoner, I don't wanna feel no pain
Falling, each and every hour of my life passing by
I keep falling

Foolish are the ones, who never dare to dream, thinking that they're living but they don't know what it means
It came to me so strong, a vision in the night
It taught me how to love when all I knew was how to fight
So don't leave me now, it's a long long way down

Stan Chandler,"when i'm walking down the lane all by myself.
in my solitary pain i call to myself..

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
Love's never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise. 

Hey there
You on that high-flying cloud 
Though she won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday she'll come to you. 

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She's got you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care 

Won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things too clear?
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all going in one ear
And out the other?

We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me saying sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired, if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in to deep

I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'

But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holding umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
Crossin' my fingers, and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Got to wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer

Stan Foster,"I heard he was gonna marry some girl from Denver
Then my sister came over, had the Sunday paper with her
There was the girl on the social page
Lookin' in love and all engaged
We decided she don't take a very good picture

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

I drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker
Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seein' her with him tends to enlarge it

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Inside her head may lay all the answers
For curin' diseases from baldness to cancer
Salt of the earth and a real good dancer
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Did I mention I don't particularly care for her?
She makes me sick",I'll Think of a Reason Later,2002

into the lab to have them check on it

[St. George:] Yeah. You were right
[Chief:] I was right
[St. George:] Yeah. It was a gun

Want to ask you a few questions, Ma'am 
I understand you were almost devoured by the dragon, Ma'am

He breathed fire on me 
He burned me already

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams [Live],1954

Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane 
Couldn't compare to you 
You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you 
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share

Stan Getz,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few

In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
That music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Stan Getz,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1990
Stan Getz,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1990
Stan Getz,"A insensatez que você fez
Coração mais sem cuidado
Fez chorar de dor
O seu amor
Um amor tão delicado
Ah, porque você foi fraco assim
Assim tão desalmado
Ah, meu coração que nunca amou
Não merece ser amado

Vai meu coração ouve a razão
Usa só sinceridade
Quem semeia vento, diz a razão
Colhe sempre tempestade
Vai, meu coração pede perdão
Perdão apaixonado
Vai porque quem não
Pede perdão
Não é nunca perdoado",Insensatez (How Insensitive),1990
Stan Getz,"Haja o que houver
Há sempre um homem, para uma mulher
E há de sempre haver para esquecer

Como um perdão
Pra quem chorou",O Grande Amor,1990
Stan Getz,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet
Goodbye",Body and Soul [Excerpt],1991
Stan Getz,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,
I'd say that I had spring fever,
But I know it isn't spring.

I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented,
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever,
When it isn't even spring? 

I keep wishing I were somewhere else,
Walking down a strange new street,
Hearing words I have never never heard,
From a man I've yet to meet.

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,
That it might as well be spring,
It might as well be, might as well be,
It might as well be spring.",It Might as Well Be Spring,1991
Stan Getz,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1991

Would be so cold
I thought I'd need someone to hold

And so I followed the mob

Why should I be standing in line
Just waiting for bread

Made it race against time

Once in khaki suits, gee we looked swell
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dum

Stan Getz,"When I'm called home
I will bring a book
That tells of strange and funny turns
And of the heart it took
To keep on living in a world
That never was my own
A world of haunted memories
Of other worlds unknown.
I'll tell them of the trouble here
When they call me home.
When I'm called home
I will sing a song
And tell them of a beggar's life
Where everything goes wrong
Where everybody's hopes and dreams
Are shattering by the wind.

I'll tell them of a ghostly world
Of us and they and him.
I'll tell them how the shadows fall
When they call me home.
When I'm called home
I will tell the stars
Of the battles that were lost
In a world of wars.
I will tell the rivers
Of the children lost at sea
Of a how a soul is bartered
And what it costs a spirit free.

Stan Getz,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young, and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning 'til
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello?
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go! I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space

And touches with her hand the summer trees,

A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:

On merely this, a look, a kiss

Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

All my faith and trust

Took the time to touch, to share
Worlds apart the night we met

Shared a kiss and shared the dance
Shared the body and bouquet
We'll taste the wine another day
When you and I are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always

Long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and books
But you and I have life to hold

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

Morena uma brasa viva pronta pra queimar
Queimando a gente sem clemência

Na brasa viva do teu amor",Morena Boca de Ouro,2016
Stan Getz,"Quem acreditou
No amor, no sorriso, na flor
Então sonhou, sonhou
E perdeu a paz
O amor, o sorriso e a flor
Se transformam depressa demais
Quem, no coração
Abrigou a tristeza de ver
Tudo isto se perder

E, na solidão
Procurou um caminho e seguiu
Já descrente de um dia feliz
Quem chorou, chorou
E tanto que o seu pranto já secou
Quem depois voltou
Ao amor, ao sorriso e à flor
Então tudo encontrou
Pois a própria dor
Revelou o caminho do amor
E a tristeza acabou",Meditacao [Live],2017

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes

Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,

Hearing words I have never never heard,

I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Stan Getz Quartet,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

And reap together the wild seeds we've sown
Surely they can forgive us and find

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

But no one is waiting any more,

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Joy the day would bring

To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door

Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)

It's not unusual to have fun with anyone,

But when I see you out and about it's just a crime,

It's not unusual, it happens every day,

You'll find it happens all the time 

Love will never do, what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine.

Remind me, Summer has gone

Empty lovers lanes are lonely
Bitter sweet refrains will only
Remind me, Summer has gone

To lovely songs of Springtime
But Autumn comes to steal all the joys away

Crocus buds are closed with frost now
Summer time has loved and lost now
The sweet dreams, faded and gray

Though Autumn's flaming colors may blind you
Tears will fill your eyes to remind you
Love has flown and Summer has gone away

And I've also met a chick or two 
But I still can learn a trick or two

Kind of think I should know much more of it

Stan Kenton,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I played me a waiting game

As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December

September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1990
Stan Kenton,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Stan Kenton,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1993

When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining

When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me

Stan Kenton,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

After it brought my lover near

Stan Kenton,"(Peanut do bop do bop)
(Peanut do bop do bop)
In Cuba each merry maid wakes up with this serenade
Peanuts (they're nice and hot)
Peanuts (he sells a lot)
Peanuts

If you haven't got bananas don't be blue
Peanuts in a little bag are calling you
Don't waste them (no tummy ache)
You'll taste them (when you're awake)
For at the very break of day
The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning the whistle blows
(through every city, town and country lane
You hear him sing his plaintive little strain)
And as he goes by to you he'll say
(Big jumbos) big jumbo ones
(Come buy those) peanuts roasted today
(Come buy those freshly roasted today)

If you're looking for a moral to this song
50 million monkeys can't be wrong
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)

(In Cuba his smiling face is welcome most anyplace)
(Peanuts they hear him cry)
(Peanuts they all reply)
(If you're looking for an early morning treat)
(Get some double jointed peanuts good to eat)
For breakfast (or dinnertime)
For supper (most anytime)
The merry twinkle in his eye
He's got a way that makes you buy
(Each morning) that whistle blows
(Are you more than I sell)

If an apple keeps the doctor from your door
Peanuts ought to keep him from you even more
(Peanuts) we'll meet again
This street again
We'll eat again

Stan Kenton,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new

Stan Kenton,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1994

Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong

More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1995

Made in Idaho
