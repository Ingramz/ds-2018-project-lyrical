Grant Lee Buffalo,"There's one thing I tell you friend
I don't believe in supermen
Who fly through the clouds above the rest
I don't believe in the best

And I never wanted to fight with you
It's just the last thing that I wanna do
But you're so afraid to look at love
Gotta let it all go this cut-above stuff

'Cause this is the hook that drags you
This is the hook in the crook of your neck
It's the hook that snags you
This is the hook

And there's one thing I tell you friend
All of our trials gonna come to an end
And you and I we're gonna fall
Like we never have stood on this little earth at all

'Cause this is the hook that drags you
This is the hook in the crook of your neck
It's the hook that snags you
This is the hook in the crook of your neck
It's hook that drags you
This is the hook",The Hook,1993
Grant Lee Buffalo,"Steel mill streets overrun
The ghost of cars in the yard
Sunflower speaks of a one
Of a one
Engines purr up above
The L train roars like our love
Like our love

I can hide in you
In your chestnut hair
I'll confide in you
Whisper in your ear
When the earth is ripe
All the worms wake up
In their stars and stripes
And their swastikas
There's a cure in sight
Set your soul at ease
For the red and white
And the blue disease

La la la

Grant Lee Buffalo,"We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
(We've only begun)

Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
To start out walking and learn to run
(And yes we've just begun)

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way (oh ah)
Talking it over just the two of us (ah ah ah)
Working together day to day
Together

And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
(And yes we've just begun)

Grant Lee Buffalo,"Shoot that cannonball into my wings
Shoot that cannonball into my wings
Into my wings
Gunpowder stings
You better tell me sweet things

Unload your pretty head into my ear
Unload your pretty head into my ear
Isn't it quaint
Isn't it queer
You gotta drag me back here

Grant Lee Buffalo,"Never mind me ‘cause I've been dead
Out of my body, been out of my head
Never mind the songs they hum
Don't want to sing along with nothin' that I said
Let him bring you happiness, happiness
It's hard to come by, I confess
I'm better at this than happiness,
If you find it, share it with the rest of us

Never mind the words that came
Out of my mouth when all I could feel was pain
The difference in the two of us
Comes down to the way you rise over things I just put down
Let him bring you happiness, happiness
It's hard to come by, I confess
I'm better at this than, happiness
If you find it share it with the rest of us, the rest of us

Never mind me ‘cause I've been dead
Out of my body, been out of my head
Never mind the curse of war
Proud like a badge that just don't shine no more

I'm better at this than happiness,
If you find it, share it with the rest of us",Happiness,1994
Grant Lee Buffalo,"Rock of Ages
I am tumbling down
Where the roots of trees
Embrace you
I do fall upon my knees
And ask you how
You can just sit there and be

Rock of Ages
I am crumbling now
In an avalanche
I'm reaching for the Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages

Father now I have stepped
Beyond my bounds
Now the pack I wear
It weighs a thousand pounds
It drags me down
Makes me think crazy

Oh my Rock of Ages
I have gone astray
I heard my brother call
I turned the other way
Now I'm ashamed
To face him

Oh my Rock of Ages

Reach for the Rock of Ages

Grant Lee Buffalo,"A fear of falling a fear that I could
From a place high above my stars well I would
Be a liar to say I'm not scared anymore
With a fear of falling on down to the floor

To the floor these have-nots
And haves divide for table scraps
And lantern light and on this spot
At last unite side by side by side

A fear of losing this war is enough
That I hold my head some days in my gloves
And I wait for this Stone Age to slow to a stall
But I fear we're nowhere near to a crawl

To a crawl these have-nots
And haves divide for table scraps
And lantern light and on this spot
At last unite side by side by side
By side
Side by side

I gotta tell you there's dissension in the soup lines
For they don't have much to show
And if you don't believe you're standing on a land mine
You'll just have to wait till it blows
You'll just have to wait till it blows
Blows

To the floor these have-nots
And haves divide for table scraps

Grant Lee Buffalo,"There's a room where I can go
And tell my secrets to
In my room, in my room
(In my room)

In this world I lock out all my
Worries and my cares
In my room, in my room
(In my room)

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday

Now it's dark and I'm alone
And I won't be afraid

Grant Lee Buffalo,"Mild amnesia love ya so-so
And such and such
Tom let's take a walk love
Look you squarely in the eye

Two paupers are your friends
Now your rouge is wearing thin
I'm picking out the little pins
You planted in my side

My enemy grows fatter
And I sense a social unaware

Grant Lee Buffalo,"Crossing the bridge where many lean to see
Over the rail to glance the trembling stream
Others stay to the center fearful it might sway
And all those who would choose to turn back the other way

But you and me have own bridge to cross
Weather worn and sea tossed
We've our own bridge to cross let's not
Make any excuses

I came upon someone's used and yellowed paperback
A collection of dreams and their meanings all conveyed
Seems to dream of a bridge denotes a thousand different things
If the planks are secure or the rope is broke or frayed

But you and me have own bridge to cross
Weather worn and sea tossed
We've our own bridge to cross let's not

Grant Lee Buffalo,"Daisies in the chain
Woven in your hair that falls
Into a braid
Woven' round the statue's toes
In the gardens you made

Bells that sing and chime
Little crystal bells that toll
All through the night
Never once did angels break
Away from your side

Won't ya hurry home
Won't ya hurry home
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Won't ya hurry home
Now your seeds are sewn
Hurry down that lone eight mile road

Poppies red and gold
Growin' wild as weeds beside
Yellow Brick Road
Growin' in the ditch where I
Sailed a milk carton boat

But how can you deny
When the spirit wraps in broad
Daylight
And it looks you right between
The eyes

Won't ya hurry home
Won't ya hurry home
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Won't ya hurry home
Now your leaves are strewn
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Ooh

All those talkin' sculls
Ma they don't scare me much
Not anymore
Think I finally got my head
'Round the door

Won't ya hurry home
Won't ya hurry home
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Won't ya hurry home

It may come as some surprise

Grant Lee Buffalo,"Now the troubadours are outside the court
With their gramophones and rifles
And an awful cloud is daring to pour
Such a wild scene a 3-D picture bible story

Still some fences

We may never mend

In our time

Broken hearts

Broken lines

Every now and then

Ya spring ta mind

And we are

Push it away before I let you in

And make the same mistakes twice

Dim the lights

Such is hell

Hey and such is life

And we are always friends

Pray there never comes a second time

Because it?s such a court

Such a crime

Find the strength to leave the past behind

I heard my one beloved moan

What?s the use in all the ache we must endure

I had no good reason why

Grinds so slowly


Not a rail to grasp ahold

Nor a savior there beside

Gone ?fore I ever arrived

Questions that stream through my own Creek blood

The odyssey of your life


A motherless child , you were torn from your home

By decree of the county affairs

Good Christians, they gave you a lily-white dress

And shorn back that Indian hair


Told ya study your Bible, be silent and still

And take to the ways of the whites

Nothin? they offered could break down your will

For you ran for the gates one night

Sussana Little

Gone ?fore I ever arrived

Questions that stream through my own Creek blood

Stories that keep you alive


Your daddy , Joe Little, had woes of his own

Drink was much stronger than greed

But some in the city felt native red hands

Were no place to let rest a deed


Oklahoma was rich with the stench of black oil

And the men who came there to drill

In the sun baked clay of Indian lands

There, in the desolate fields

Gone ?fore I ever arrived

Mysterious crimes, oh they swept through the county

Waving the finger of blame

Eyes turned to Joe Little

A couple too many acres of land to his name


No one would have heard the lone shot in the night

They never posted his bail

Big Joey Little, never walked out

Of Sheriff Stanton?s jail

For all of the lives you had lived this far

No part of you could have known

The evil hearts of the men who would fetch ya

One night by the side of the road


The moon, it grew dark and the frost would form

Before ya finally were found

Chained to a log in a torn white dress

Shakin? wild eyed on the ground

Sussana Little

Gone ?fore I ever arrived

Questions that stream through my own creek blood

Such were the trials of your life...


Yet in the years to come, you took a man

Raised five of your own

And for a spell it was as almost as though

The light of justice had shown


The hand that had written this part but for you

And made it all plenty hard

Gave you a gusher, a well spring of oil

There in your own back yard


So pile them kids in the plush back seat

Ridin? shotgun in the Packard to town

With your man, Tom Fisher, one hand on the wheel

The other on your knee now

Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain

Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside

Cry like a child, though these years make me older
With children my time is so wastefully spent
A burden to keep, though their inner communion
Accept like a curse, an unlucky deal

Played by the gate at the foot of the garden
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
No words could explain, no actions determine
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall

Under pale mauve vests
Shoes like dead pigs' noses
Cornflake packet jacket,

(Intro)
Da da da da da da da, da da da da da da
Da da da da, Come on	

Do you,
Take this man to be you lawfully wedded husband
In sickness and in health
For richer or for poorer
For better or for worse
Til death do you part?  ""I do""

Do you,
Take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife
In sickness and in health
For richer or for poorer
For better or for worse
Til death do you part ?  ""I do""

From the words of a patriot
""I often fear that the sins in my past
Will come back to haunt me
But the consequenses are more than I can bare""
I feel that shit
This piece right here
Is about what comes with fame
And the struggle to keep family within a family
I give you......This Ring

(1st Verse)
This ring
Got me a top notch
Straight hot fox
We sought rocks
And the Ewok Slot
Was caught
Got dropped two
Playing hopscotch
On the block
Ought not twat plot
Yo for hops knot I brought dots

This ring
Helped me remain sane
No dame games
Came from bane
To a changed man
No cane thang
Refrain from gang bang
Slang a praying brain
Reigns family fame
Then came pain

Say hello to TECH N9NE
Everybody want to be down with a nigga
Women get a whiff of the money
Thinking of taking it from me
They get up in the club
Giving the love
Throwin the pussy
Full of liquor and bud
Booty hopping around up in the MO
Get to looking around
Every ho want to lick a nigga low
Infatuated
With niggas with dough
Get 'em in the sack
And try to make 'em let it go

Tech N9ne
Be autographing bitches
In front of rappin niggas
Who think of having figures
They get to grapping triggas
They can't imagine villians
When they come back and get us
We get to whacking niggas
I ain't never wanted no parts of this
I don't ever want to break
Another heart for this
Why the Devil gotta make it
Why the Lord gotta make something that'll kill
Something so marvelous

(Hook)
This ring
Brings demeaning Demons in
G-strings
Songs we sing
Make 'em fiend semen
And green things
Clinging
Dreaming
Thinking of being Miss Thing
With this ring
But if i wasn't Tech N9ne
Bitches wouldn't even want to be with
Tech N9ne
If I did no music
Then would you respect mine
This wedding band and music draws a line
Between
Life and Tech N9ne

(2nd Verse)
This ring
Was supposed to protect a nigga
Best for niggas
Who couldn't stop having sex
With bitches
Bless the Mrs.
Who stress to kiss us
Even though we spend on
Checks with strippers
Obsessed with clitorises

This ring
Made a nigga feel macho
Cry fo
Lie fo
Die fo
My ho
Nigga I go face
Diablo
With a hostile gospel
If I can't have tres or cuatro
Little vatos
Imma let a lot flow
What the sell
Up in Osco
Up a nostril

That sound like Tech N9ne
Nigga where the weed
Where the muthafucking
Blow
And the hoes (yes yes)
Next to me
Is Ectasy
Asking me if i want to roll (yes yes)
Bitches never gave a fuck about a fling
Make's it exciting
When a married nigga
want to fuck around
And a bitch know he down for a fling (yes yes)

I've been tested
And a lot of times
Been invested
Didn't know this Tech shit
Would constantly
Get a nigga molested
Been aproached by some of the best tricks
In the game
And they came strong
But I hanged on
To this ring
And I hope my son don't sing the same song

(Hook Repeat)

(3rd Verse)
Quincy J told me
Super stars are good providers
But
2 times outta 10
When we on tour
Family's not besides us
What
Can a nigga do
When he make ends
Add more to the time they spend
While he make ends
Everything else breaking
And the bond at the house
May end

And your wifey steadily yellin bout quality time
And you think
With all the fame and fortune
Shit outta be fine
But what happens when
The divorce papers just gotta be signed
And you lose half
And your children
'cause you gotta be N9ne

I want to relaxe wit 'em
And spend time to the maximum
But if silence is golden
Then me making noise is platinum
I gotta be Tech
And Daddy and Hubby
But music
Women mixed with family's ugly
I know and you know
That hell will be
Hot for a nigga's infidelity

But until then
God forgive me for any
Promises that I broke
Family
Can I be
Forgiven
For all the
Liquor and weed that I smoked
When I succeed
Will I cope?
Will I still breathe without both?
This ring
Tech N9ne
I dunno
But when I go
I'm leavin out DOPE!

(Hook Repeat)

Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Granville Williams,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

They tried to black my third eye but I still come through
Crushin' the lactose rapper, shoot with accuracy 
Conscious cat that's dapper, yo it has to be me
But enough about myself 'cause situations are real
Too many young cats be doing raw deals, you feel?
Getting caught with the tools of the trade
The plan is laid plus the trap 
Been set, we ain't figured this yet
Still paper chasing ignoring the fight that we facing
No love for the ignorant, it's called playahating
Playas stay hated when they oughta be educated
Ego deflated, leave them lies unstated yo
We descendants of kings and queens
Instead of fodder for the cop scenes, know what I mean?
Can't form teams if we ain't thinkin alike
That's why you can feel my thoughts when I'm gripping this mic
Born to get right, born to be a part of the fight
Crushing negative auras with my positive light
Standing strong like David with his sling and his stone
It's official, the Prodigal Son has come home

Ayo I claim throne like Persian kings
My urban theme is to keep my culture pure 
And untampered like virgin queens
Never splurging cream
When I stack I'm merging dreams
Into one plan, rappers getting this green's an urgent thing
Number one on the list, no need to front on this shit
It's a blessing I don't have to vic with the gun on the hip
Got enough ice in the freezer, don't need none on the wrist
Just trees and more Henny, that's how I come in this bitch
Just like y'all man, I just wanted to flip
And hear myself on the air gettin spun in the mix
See you runnin the risk 
Tryin to challenge J-S-A, N-D-S
Yo Grap, these nigga envious?
I'm like the friendliest
Love and peace to any with
The same back to me, that beef shit is wack to me
Because actually I find out the facts to be
That if you have beef, it's to the death naturally
And don't nobody wanna die over dumb shit
So don't front on me because of who I run with
We gotta teach these kids to say no to beef to live
Not by words, but by actions we can repeat the shit
Our brothas killing brothas
Because it only leads to one dead, one in jail

It goes hip hop, shoo bop doo wop
Put a hook on your mind and check the clock
And just do it, and just do it
And you know you got to just do it

Free your mind and define what is true to you
Hold your plan tight, something like paper to glue
I keep it fool proof, set up a base for my youth
When it's all done, she's flying helly's off of roof
Big plans now, working my product against demand now
Takin breath before I take my steps
Now that I'm ready, I execute with great precision
On mission with Sands makin proper decisions

Political, in all angles we stay pivotal
Original, MC smooth individual

come on in, get a little bit of this stuff
Get a little bit of this”

You walk out, you walk down the street
You go into another door

Its six o'clock in the morning
And it's Sunday morning

If you think you see the devil
Laugh him down

When you think you see the devil now
Laugh him down

Grateful Dead,"You're bringing me down, I'm running aground,
Blind in the lights of the interstate cars,
Passing me by, the busses and the semis,
Plugging like stones from a slingshot from mars.

But I'm here on the road, bound to the load,
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars.
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up,
The highway, the moon, and clouds and the stars.

Black throated wind, keeps on pourin' in,
With it's words of a life where nothing is new,
Ah, mother american night, I pass from the light,
Ah, I'm drownin' in you.

I left st. louie, city of blues,
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget.
I tried to pretend it came to an end,
Cause you weren't the women I once thought I'd met.

But I can't deny, times have gone by,
Well I never had doubts or thoughts of regret,
And I was a man when all this began,
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet.

Black throated wind, whisper in sin,
And speaking on life that passes like dew.
It's forced me to see you've done better by me,
Better by me that I've done by you.

Now what's to be found by racing around,
You carry your pain wherever you go,
Full of blues, and tryin' to lose,
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know.

So I give you my eyes and all of their lies,
Please help them to learn as well as to see.
Capture a glance, and make it dance,
But looking at you is looking at me.

Black throated wind, keeps on pourin' in,
With it's words of a life that could almost be true,
Ah, mother american night, here comes a light.
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do.

Going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do.
Going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
Cause you've done better by me than I've done by you,
I'm drowning in you.
",Black Throated Wind,
Grateful Dead,"As I was walkin' down Grosvenor Square,
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air,
From the other direction she was calling my eye,
Could be an illusion but I might as well try, might as well try.

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes,
And I knew without askin' she was into the blues.
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls,
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls.

In the heat of the evening when the dealin' got rough,
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff.
As I picked up my matches and was closin' the door,
I had one of those flashes, I'd been there before, been there before.

Well I ain't often right but I've never been wrong,
Seldom turns out the way it does in the song.
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right.

Well there ain't nothin' wrong with the way she moves,
All scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues.
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by.

The wind in the willow's playing ""Tea for Two,""
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue,
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand,
Everybody's playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band.",Scarlet Begonia's,
Grateful Dead,"If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air

Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
If your cup is full may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone

Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home",Ripple,
Grateful Dead,"The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded,
Solemnly they stated, ""he has to die, you know he has to die.""
All the children learnin', from books that they were burnin',
Every leaf was turnin'; to watch him die, you know he had to die.

The summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him,
And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter.

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended,
His mind remained unbended, he had to die, you know he had to die.

Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this roes.
It rainbow spirals round and round it trembles and explodes.
It left a smoking crater of my mind i like to blow away.
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day.

[Chorus]
Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around,
Comin', around, in a circle
Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' around, in a circle,
Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' in a circle.

Skippin' through the lily fields i came across an empty space,
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in it's place.
The bus came by and i got on, that's when it all began,
There was cowboy neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land.

[Chorus]

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended,
Their minds remained unbended,
He had to die, oh, you know he had to die.",That's It for the Other One,
Grateful Dead,"Well this job Ive got is just a little too hard,

Papa said ""Son, you'll never get far,
I'll tell you the reason if you want to know,
'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go""

Well baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than most any old thing
Well when I get those jelly roll blues
Why I'd go and get anything in this world for you.

Down to the jewelry store packing a gun,
Says ""Wrap it up. I think I'll take this one""
""A thousand dollars please,"" the jewelry man said
Dupree he said, ""I'll pay this one off to you in lead""

Well you know son you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad -
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

Judge said ""Son, this gonna cost you some time""
Dupree said ""Judge, you know that crossed my mind""
Judge said ""Fact it's gonna cost you your life""
Dupree said ""Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right""

Well baby, baby's gonna lose her sweet man
Dupree come out with a losing hand
Baby's gonna weep it up for awhile
Then go on out and find another sweet man's
Gonna treat her with style

Judge said ""Son, I know your baby well
But that's a secret I can't never tell""
Dupree said ""Judge, well it's well understood,
And you got to admit that that sweet, sweet jelly's so good""

Well you know son you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad,
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

Just to get baby that shiny diamond ring",Dupree's Diamond Blues,1969
Grateful Dead,"Waves of violet go crashing and laughing
The rainbow winged singing birds fly 'round the sun
Sun bells rain down in a liquid profusion
Mermaids on porpoises draw up the dawn
What's become of the baby this cold December morning?

Songbirds frozen in their flight
Drifting to the earth, remnants of forgotten dreaming
Dawning answer comes there none.

Go to sleep you child, dream of never-ending always
Panes of crystal ice sparkle like waterfalls
Lighting the polished ice caverns of the dawn,
But where in the looking-glass fields of illusion
Wandered the child who was perfect as the dawn?
What's become of the baby this cold December morning?
What's become of the baby this cold December morning?

Racing in rhythm of the sun
All the world revolves captured in the eye of woman
Allah, where are you now?

All eyes are blinded by the sparkling waters
Scheherazade gathering stories to tell
But where is the child who played with the sunshine's?
And chased the cloud shape to the regions of mind?
Standing stream cries the south wind
Lost in the regions of
Shadow-like chains of illusion, delusions of living and dead.",What's Become of the Baby,1969
Grateful Dead,"Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion

Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?

Mirror shatters in formless reflections of matter
Glass hand dissolving in ice, petal flowers revolving
Lady in velvet recedes in the nights of good-bye
Shall we go, you and I while we can
Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?",Dark Star [Studio Version][*],1969
Grateful Dead,"In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams; unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

In the book of love's own dreams
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my lights grow old

When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You flew to me

In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me",Attics of My Life,1970
Grateful Dead,"Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or
Rain is falling from a heavy sky,
What do you want me to do,
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon long ago
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way
Like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner
Where it's been waiting to meet you,
What do you want me to do,
To watch for you while you're sleeping?
Well please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming too

Look into any eyes
You find by you, you can see
Clear through to another day
Maybe been seen before
Through other eyes on other days
While going home,
What do you want me to do,
To do for you to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon long ago

Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams
To another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted
With words half spoken
And thoughts unclear
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

Just a box of rain,
Wind and water,
Believe it if you need it,
If you don't just pass it on
Sun and shower,
Wind and rain,
In and out the window
Like a moth before a flame

And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there",Box of Rain,1970
Grateful Dead,"Fare you well my honey
Fare you well my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this broke-down palace
On my hands and my knees I will roll roll roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time, in my time, I will roll roll roll

In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back back home
It's a far gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

Going home, going home
By the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

Going to plant a weeping willow
On the banks green edge it will grow grow grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go, the river roll roll roll

Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul",Brokedown Palace,1970

Grateful Dead,"Truckin' got my chips cashed in. Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line, just keep truckin' on.

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street.
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.

Dallas, got a soft machine; Houston, too close to New Orleans,
New York's got the ways and means; but just won't let you be, oh no.

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love,
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home.
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone.

Truckin', like the do-dah man. Once told me ""You've got to play your hand""
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime, if you don't lay'em down,

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me,
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me what a long, strange trip it's been.

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine,
All a friend can say is ""Ain't it a shame?""

Truckin', up to Buffalo. Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time, you pick a place to go, and just keep truckin' on.

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window.
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel,
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in.

Busted, down on Bourbon Street, set up, like a bowlin' pin.
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin. They just won't let you be, oh no.

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel,
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down.
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin',
Get out of the door and light out and look all around.

Grateful Dead,"In the attics of my life, full of cloudy dreams unreal.
Full of tastes no tongue can know, and lights no eyes can see.
When there was no ear to hear, you sang to me.

I have spent my life seeking all that's still unsung.
Bent my ear to hear the tune, and closed my eyes to see.
When there was no strings to play, you played to me.

In the book of love's own dream, where all the print is blood.
Where all the pages are my days, and all the lights grow old.
When i had no wings to fly, you flew to me, you flew to me.

In the secret space of dreams, where i dreaming lay amazed.
When the secrets all are told, and the petals all unfold.
When there was no dream of mine, you dreamed of me.",Attics of My Life [DVD],1970

All the birds that were singing are flown, except you alone.

Going to leave this brokedown palace,
On my hand and knees, i will roll, roll, roll.
Make myself a bed in the waterside,
In my time, i will roll, roll roll.

In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside i will lay my head.
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

River going to take me, sing sweet and sleepy,
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home.
It's a far gone lullaby, sung many years ago.
Mama, mama many worlds I've come since i first left home.

Goin' home, goin' home, by the riverside i will rest my bones,
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

Going to plant a weeping willow,
On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow.
Sing a lullaby beside the water,
Lovers come and go, the river roll, roll, roll.

Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around.

The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail,

Give me the right area code and the number that i need.

But i just can't remember no number, a number i can use.
Directory don't have it, central done forgot it,
I've gotta find a number to use.

Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better be goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man

She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin see, and cocaine
All a friend can say is, ""Ain't it a shame?""

Truckin', up to Buffalo
I been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time, you pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no

Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down

I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneu from Saint Angel
Say ""the weather down here so fine""

Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand

Fever roll up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

See here how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just like
Any other day
That's ever been
Sun goin up
And then the
Sun it goin down
Shine through my window and
My friends they come around
Come around
Come around

The people may know but
People don't care
That a man could be
As poor as me
Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain

And see

I said my prayers and went to bed, that's the last they saw of me
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me
Please, don't murder me

When I awoke, the Dire Wolf, six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window, all I said was come on in
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me
Please, don't murder me

The Wolf came in, I got my cards, we sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades, but the cards were all the same
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me
Please, don't murder me
Don't murder me

I spent a little time on the hill
I heard some say better run away
Others say better stand still

I don't know, but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead

Who can deny, who can deny
It's not just a change in style
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles

I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Things went down we don't understand
But I think in time we will
Now, I don't know, but I was told
In the heat of the sun a man died of cold

Keep on coming or stand and wait,
With the sun so dark and the hour so late.
You can overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride

It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide

I spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will

Maybe find out before too long

Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go; go Johnny B. Goode.

Grateful Dead,"Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back in the pines among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode

But he could play a guitar like ringin' a bell

Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go; go Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passin' by would stop and say
""My my, but that little country boy can play!""

Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go; go Johnny B. Goode

His mamma told him ""someday you will be a man""
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
And Johnny B. Goode tonight

You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has it's beaches, it's homeland and thoughts of it's own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has it's seasons, it's evenings and songs of it's own

There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone

Bring you a pound and drop the rear

I'm here to drive those blues away

I sent a letter to a man I know
Said, ""One for the money and two for the show""
I wait all summer for his reply
Said, ""Three to get ready and four to fly""

Only two things in the world I love
That's rock 'n' roll and my turtle dove
When I was a young man I needed good luck
But I'm a little bit older now and I know my stuff

Howling at the blood on the moon
Big diesel Mack truck rolling down my way
I can't hit that border too soon

Running hard out of Muskrat Flats

Hail on my back like a shotgun blast
High wind chimes in the night

Oh oh, bitter olives in the sun
Oh oh, I had me some lovin'
And I done some time

Since I came down from Oregon
There's a lesson or two I've learned
By standing in the road alone
Standing watching the fires burn

The northern sky it stinks with greed
You could smell it for miles around
The good ole boys in the Greystone Hotel
Sitting doing that git on down

Oh oh, the pride of Cucamonga
Oh oh, silver apples in the sun
Oh oh, I had me some lovin'
And I done some time

I see your silver shining town
But I know I can't go there
Your streets run deep with poisoned wine
Your doorways crawl with fear

So I think I'll drift for ol' where it's at
Where the weed grows green and fine
And wrap myself around a bush of that bright
Whoa, on Oaxaca vine

Yes, it's me, I'm the pride of Cucamonga
I can see golden forests in the sun

Grateful Dead,"As I was walkin' down Grosvenor Square,
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air,
From the other direction she was calling my eye,
Could be an illusion but I might as well try, might as well try.

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes,
And I knew without askin' she was into the blues.
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls,
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls.

In the heat of the evening when the dealin' got rough,
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff.
As I picked up my matches and was closin' the door,
I had one of those flashes, I'd been there before, been there before.

Well I ain't often right but I've never been wrong,
Seldom turns out the way it does in the song.
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right.

Well there ain't nothin' wrong with the way she moves,
All scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues.
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by.

Looking for familiar faces
In an empty window pane

Listening for the secret
Searching for the sound
But I could only hear the preacher
And the baying of his hounds

Willow sky
Whoa, I walk and wonder why
They say love your brother
But you will catch it when you try

Roll you down the line boy
Drop you for a loss
Ride you out on a cold railroad
And nail you to a cross

November and more
As I wait for the score
They're telling me forgiveness
Is the key to every door

A slow winder day
A night like forever
Sink like a stone
Float like a feather

Lilac rain, unbroken chain
Song of the saw-whet owl
Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane
Listening to the winds howl

Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls
Unbroken chain of sky and sea
Unbroken chain of the western wind
Unbroken chain of you and me

Till the morning came around

In a cave up in the hills

Go on, my friend, do anything you choose

A breath of cologne
Her mirror was a window
She sat quite alone

All around her
The garden grew
Scarlet and purple
And crimson and blue

When the flowers decayed

Since no one may stay",Rosemary,1974

Country garden in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain

Wishing well with a golden bell, bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight, writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer, darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own
Did he doubt or did he try? Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen will remain, all he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam,
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home

Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

Pays my ticket when I speed

And I was a man when all this began

One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the west Texas wind...
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love.

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of rose's I ran, out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one; he looked like he could run,
Up on his back and away I did ride.

Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso,
Out through the badlands of New Mexico.
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
My love is stronger that my fear of death.
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark...
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart.

And as last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
I can see Rosa's Cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward, down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
I've got to make it to rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel 
A deep burning pain in my side. 
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle, 
I'm getting weary, unable to ride. 
But my love for 
Felina is strong and I writhe where I've fallen. 
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest 

I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.
From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina good-bye.",El Paso,1976
Grateful Dead,"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia, California on my mind.
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh, and on across Caroline.

Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill, and we never was a minute late.
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown, rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.

Had motor trouble it turned into a struggle, half way 'cross Alabam,
The 'hound broke down left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham.

Straight off bought me a through train ticket, right across Mississippi clean
And I was on the midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans.

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town.
People are there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down.

Sure as she bore me, she bought me a silk suit, put luggage in my hands,
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land.

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte,
Flying over to the Golden State,
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.

Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone,
Cut your engines, cool your wings,
And let me make it to the telephone.

Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line.

Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rockin' of the boat,
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float.
I won't leave you drifting down, but woh it makes me wild,
With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child.

Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools.

She had good looks - God knows and coal black hair

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please
Then she spoke so kind, she talked so fair
That Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, cleanse my hand
My strength comes as natural as any other man

You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever had lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand were dead

Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he walked up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paw
Samson got hands up round the lion's jaw

Wheat liquor and money, they loaded down,
So soon after payday, no one seemed ashamed,

Hey! A hollow jack and the winner take the hand.

My uncle starts winning, the cowboys got sore,

Accused him of cheatin', oh no it couldn't be,
I know my uncle he's as honest as me,
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.

And I shot him down Lord, He never saw,
Shot me another, Right then he hit the floor,
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,
And we hightailed it down to Mexico.

Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine; Houston, too close to New Orleans,
New York's got the ways and means; but just won't let you be, oh no

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love,
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'

She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine,
All a friend can say is ""Ain't it a shame?""

Takes time, you pick a place to go, and just keep truckin' on

Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel,
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin They just won't let you be, oh no

Reminds me now I'm reaching out to you

Grateful Dead,"Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear.
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of bricks
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye.
With shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.

Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head,
Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door,
Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on channel four.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows,
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose.
Put my arms around you, love you til you cry,
Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you 'til you die.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.",When Push Comes to Shove,1987

Grateful Dead,"Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face
But afraid, we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime falls
And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me, you and me

Click, flash blade in ghetto night
Rudie's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

So the kids they dance, and shake their bones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink, yeah
History's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own. On our own. On our own.

If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shinning ball of blue we can call our home

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians, throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

Shipping powders back and forth
Singing ""black goes south and white comes north""
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours""
And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical he rant and rage
Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Sing ashes to ashes, all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

It's dizzying, the possibilities

But it never comes so easy when you're living by the sword.
It's even harder to be heartless when you look at me that way.
You're as mighty as the flower that will grow the stones away.

Even though I been a stranger, full of irony and spite
Holding little but contempt for all things beautiful and bright,
Something shines around you and it seems, to my delight
To give me just a little sweetness,

Just a little light.

This could be just another highway, coiled up in the night.
You could be just another white-tail, baby, stranded on my brights,

Won't ignite.

This tomcat heart with which I'm blessed
Is destruction lovings twin?
May I chose to lose or win?
Maybe when my turn comes I will have guessed.

Even the purest of romantics compromise.

As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing

In loops around the twisted shafts of lavender,
They're crawling to the sun.
Underfoot the ground is patched
With arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita,
Stark and shiny in the breeze.
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
Droop so hungry neath the sky.
William Tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch
No furthermore and/or it may require a change that hasn't come before.
No more time to tell how, this is the season of what,
Now is the time of returning with our thought
Jewels polished and gleaming.
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein,
Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming.
Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll,
Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow,
Five men writing with fingers of gold,
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale,
Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
Riding in the whale belly, fade away in moonlight,
Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below.",The Eleven,1992

When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd,
Winter morning breaks, you're all alone.

And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud 
This ground on which the seed of love is sown,

Country garden in the wind and the rain,
Wherever he goes the people all complain.

Stephen prospered in his time, well he may and he may decline.
Did it matter, does it now? Stephen would answer if he only knew how.
Wishing well with a golden bell, bucket hanging clear to hell,
Hell halfway twixt now and then,
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again.

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight, writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky.
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer, darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye.

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow,
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned.
Several seasons with their treasons,
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own.
Did he doubt or did he try? Answers aplenty in the bye and bye,
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills,
One man gathers what another man spills.

Seashore washed by the suds and foam,
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home.

'Cause when he's chargin' his chopper
Up and down your carpeted halls
You will think I am dressed up quite proper
Never mind how I stumble and fall.

You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

'Cause you're a sweet little softcore pretender
Somehow, babe, it got as hot as it gets
With her black leather and gold spike suspenders
And your chain, your black whip and pets.

Well we know you're the reincarnation
Of the infamous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love the ovation
And the scene that it seems to create.

You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

You analyze me, tend to despise me
You laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a say when I'll dance on your grave
Unable to dance I'll still crawl across it
Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll crawl.

You must really consider the circus
It just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you.

And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
Well I know you wake up here only
When the snakes come marching in.

You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

I say, come tomorrow, I'll get my pay
And I'm gonna leave this town
Come tomorrow, I'll get my pay
And I'm gonna leave this fucking town

If they never come around, what the hell

Ancient footprints are everywhere

On a cold dark night on the Spanish Stairs

Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
She promised, she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wastin' time
Those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em
Well, it sure has been a long hard climb

The train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, life will be sweet like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

So I left Rome and I landed in Brussels
On a plane so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform, yes and young girl pullin' muscles
Well, it should have been a long hard ride

Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece, that's right

When I paint my masterpiece

And the hot sun chills me to the bone,
When I can't hear the song for the singer,
And I can't tell my pillow from a stone,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own.

When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain,
And the stars start to splatter in the sky,
When the moon hits the southwest horizon,
With the scream of an eagle on the fly,

And listen to the ripples as they moan,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own.

Black muddy river, roll on forever,
I don't care how deep or wide, if you've got another side,
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll.

When it seems like the night will last forever,
And there's nothing left to do but count the years,
When the strings of my heart begin to sever,
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears,
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
And dream me a dream of my own,
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own, sing me a song of my own.",Black Muddy River,1996

The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

Don't murder me, I beg of you
Don't murder me, please, don't murder me

I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whisky
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

Don't murder me, I beg of you
Don't murder me, please, don't murder me

When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, ""Come on in""

But don't murder me, I beg of you
Don't murder me, please, don't murder me

The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the queen of spades
But the cards were all the same

Don't murder me, I beg of you
Don't murder me, please, don't murder me
Don't murder me

You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has it's beaches, it's homeland and thoughts of it's own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has it's seasons, it's evenings and songs of it's own

There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has it's beaches, it's homeland and thoughts of it's own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has it's seasons, it's evenings and songs of it's own

Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

Wear it down between the lines

There was something I had caught inside
Screaming hard to make it known
In time it died alone

It doesn't seem you really have to close your eyes
To see, you have been all you'll be to me
It's just too late and we can't relate at all

It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see, though I know

You must be the angel, I though I might never find
Was it you I heard singing, oh, while I was chasin' dreams
Driven by the wind, like the dust that blows around
And the rain fallin' down but I never know

Got to be heaven 'cause here's where the rainbow ends
If this ain't the real thing, then it's close enough to pretend
When that wind blows when the night's about to fall
You can hear the silence call, it's a certain sort of sound
Like the rain fallin' down

Hole's in what's left of my reason, hole's in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin' but I'll pull through
I never could read no road map, I don't know what the weather might do
But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine
I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose

Never know now, just don't never know, no
Well it's been heaven but even the rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'
And I'm as good as gone again

I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance

Grateful Dead,"Oh, sinning is a gentilized journey
Take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and saintly
Without Him walking by your side

And when you come to make your crossing
At the end of the pilgrim's way
If you ever will meet your Savior
You will surely meet Him on that day

Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at its deep water
Look at that wide river
Oh, heavy mighty billows roll

You better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
Oh, I'm sure without Him
That you never will make it home

That awful day of judgment
Is coming in the by and by
We'll see our Lord descending
In the glory from on high

Oh, let us get in touch with Jesus
And in the special love of God
And maybe ever get ready
When he comes on Jordan's tide

Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at its deep water
Look at that wide river
Oh, heavy mighty billows roll

You better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
Oh, I'm sure without Him that
You never will make it home

Now what you gonna do?
Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, how you gonna feel
When you come to the end of the way?

Grateful Dead,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded
Though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain
Tempting you to defy it

Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off

Just Louise and her lover
So entwined
And these visions of Johanna
That conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the keychain
And the all night girls they whisper of
Escapades out on the ""D"" train

We can hear the night watchman
Click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them
It's insane

Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here

The ghost of electricity
Howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna
Have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost
He takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery
He likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me

He's sure got a lotta gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
While I'm in the hall

Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna
They kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums
Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, 'This is what
Salvation must be like after a while'
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles

See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say
""Jeeze, I can't find my knees""

Oh, jewels and binoculars
Hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna
They make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess
Who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him""

But like Louise always says
""You can't look at much, can you man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him

And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road

He writes every thing's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes

The harmonicas play
The skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna
Are now all that remain

What's wring with me and my baby.
We ain't gettin' down like we used to do,
I mean it's pretty good now, but there was a time,
When it didn't work too well.

I went down to see this Gypsy woman, you understand,
I told her my story, I told her what was goin' on.
And she told me, man she said, all you need, all you need,
She said all you got to have, oh Lord,

And it feels pretty good, yes indeed.",Caution (Do Not Stop on Tracks),1997

The sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated
He has to die
You know he has to die

And all the children learning
From books that they were burning
Every leaf was turning
To watch him die
You know he had to die

The summer sun looked down on him
His mother could but frown on him
And all the others sound on him
But it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die, you know he had to die
You know he had to die

And little wings like a vampire bat,

Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me back home before I die",Sing Me Back Home,1999
Grateful Dead,"Thought I heard a blackbird singing
Up on Bluebird Hill
Call me a whinin' boy if you will
Born where the sun don't shine
And I don't deny my name
Got no place to go, ain't that a shame?

Thought I heard that KC whistle
Moaning sweet and low
Thought I heard that KC when she blow
Down where the sun don't shine
Underneath the Kokomo
Whinin' boy got no place to go

So many roads, I tell you
So many roads I know
So many roads, so many roads
Mountain high, river wide
So many roads to ride
So many roads, so many roads

Thought I heard a jug band playin'
If you don't who else will?
From over on the far side of the hill
All I know the sun don't shine
And the rain refused to fall
And you don't seem to hear me when I call

Wind inside and the wind outside
Tangled in the window blind
Tell me why you treat me so unkind
Down where the sun don't shine
Lonely and I call your name
No place left to go, ain't that a shame?

So many roads, I tell you
New York to San Francisco
So many roads I know
All I want is one to take me home
From the high road to the low
So many roads I know
So many roads, so many roads

From the land of the midnight sun
Where the ice blue roses grow
Along those roads of gold and silver snow
Howlin' wide or moaning low
So many roads I know
So many roads to [unverified] my soul
",So Many Roads,1999
Grateful Dead,"As I was a-goin' over Gilgarra mountains
I met Colonel Pepper and his money he was counting
I drew forth my pistol and I rattled my sabre
Saying ""stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver""

[Chorus]
Musha ringum duram da
Whack-fall the daddy-o
Whack-fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

The shining yellow coins did sure look bright and jolly
I took the money home and I gave it to my Molly
She promised and she vowed that she never would deceive me
But the devil's in the women for they never can be easy

[Chorus]

When I awoke between the hours of six and seven
Guards were standing 'round me in numbers odd and even
I flew to my pistols, but alas I was mistaken
I fired off my pistols and a prisoner was taken

[Chorus]

They put me in jail without a judge or jury
For robbing Colonel Pepper in the morning so early
They didn't take my fist so I knocked down the sentry
And I bid a long farewell to that cold penitentiary

[Chorus]

Some take delight in fishing and bowling
Others take delight in carriage a-rollin'
I take delight in the juice of the barley
Courting pretty women in the morning so early

Peals of fragile thunder keeping time
Recall the days that still are to come some sing blue.
Hang your heart on laughing willow stray
Down to the water, deep sea of love
Beneath the sweet calm face of the sea swift undertow.

Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know,
See how it feels in the end.
May lady lullaby sing plainly for you soft, strong, sweet and true.
Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow tapping at the window, touch your hair
So swift and bright strange figures of light float in air.

Who can stop what must arrive now? something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night you're still by my side shine inside .
Gone are the days we stopped to decide where we should go, we just ride.
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams gone, both dream and lie.

With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine big 707 set to go
But I'm stuck here on the grass where the cold winds they do blow
And where whiskey was and bars and the women they were fine
There she goes my friend, she rolling down at last

Here the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
There the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down it ain't no earthy good to me
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I can be

I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills.

Set out runnin' but i take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If i get home before daylight, i just might get some sleep tonight.

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air.

Set out runnin' but i take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If i get home before daylight, i just might get some sleep tonight.

Got two reasons why i cry away each lonely night,
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my hearts delight.
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail,
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail.

Got a wife in chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me.

Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding under you

All your reindeer armies, are all going home

Has taken all his blankets from the floor

Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you

Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

Grateful Dead,"You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies, are all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, baby blue","It's All Over Now, Baby Blue",2001

Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair,
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair,
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind.
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind.

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee,
Said tell me where your strength lies if you please.
She spoke so kind and she talked so fair,
Well Samson said, Delilah cut off my hair.

You can shave my head, clean as my hand
And my strength will become as natural as any old man.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.

You read about Samson, all from his works,
He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.
One day when Samson was walking along,
Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.

He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,
When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.

Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,
But Samson got his hands around that lion's jaws.

He ripped the beast till he killed him dead.
The bees made honey in the lion's head.

Grateful Dead,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
Nighttime would find me in Rose's Cantina,
Music would play and Felina would whirl.

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina,
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden,
I was in love, but in vain I could tell.

One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the West Texas wind...
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love.

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of Rose's I ran, out where the horses were tied...
I picked a good one; he looked like he could run,
Up on his back and away I did ride.

Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso,
Out through the badlands of New Mexico.
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
My love is stronger that my fear of death.
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark...
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart.

And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
I can see Rose's Cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward, down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
I've got to make it to Rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle.
I'm getting weary, unable to ride.

But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen;
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest.
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina good-bye.",El Paso [Live],2002

I was all night running, running, Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run in, run around and run down
Run around the corner, corner, Lord, run smack in to a tree

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees

Dressed myself in green, I went down unto the sea
Try to see what's goin' down, try to read between the lines

Why don't you arrest me? Throw me in to the jail house

Grateful Dead,"Saint Stephen with a rose, in and out of the garden he goes
Country garden in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain

Stephen prospered in his time, well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now? Stephen would answer if he only knew how
Wishing well with a golden bell, bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight, writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer, darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own
Did he doubt or did he try? Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen will remain, all he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam,
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home

Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman, spinnin' that curious sense of your own
Can you answer, yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?","St. Stephen [2] [Live at Lakeland Civic Center Arena, Lakeland, FL, 5/2",2003

Grateful Dead,"Down in front of Casey's old brown wooden stoop
On a summer's evening we formed a merry group
Boys and girls together we would sing and waltz
While Tony played the organ on the sidewalks of New York

East Side, West Side, all around the town
The tots sang ""ring-a-rosie,"" ""London Bridge is falling down""
Boys and girls together, me and Mamie O'Rourke
Tripped the light fantastic on the sidewalks of New York

That's where Johnny Casey, little Jimmy Crowe
Jakey Krause, the baker, who always had the dough
Pretty Nellie Shannon with a dude as light as cork
She first picked up the waltz step on the sidewalks of New York

Things have changed since those times, some are up in ""G""
Others they are wand'rers but they all feel just like me
They'd part with all they've got, could they once more walk
With their best girl and have a twirl on the sidewalks of New York",Sidewalks of New York,2003

Together, more or less in line, just keep truckin' on.

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street.
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.

Dallas, got a soft machine; Houston, too close to New Orleans,
New York's got the ways and means; but just won't let you be, oh no.

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love,
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home.
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone.

Truckin', like the do-dah man. Once told me ""You've got to play your hand""
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime, if you don't lay'em down,

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me,
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me what a long, strange trip it's been.

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine,
All a friend can say is ""Ain't it a shame?""

Truckin', up to Buffalo. Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time, you pick a place to go, and just keep truckin' on.

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window.
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel,
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in.

Busted, down on Bourbon Street, set up, like a bowlin' pin.
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin. They just won't let you be, oh no.

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel,
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down.
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin',
Get out of the door and light out and look all around.

I went down one day, I went down one day to see a gypsy woman,
Just one old day, yes I did,
I want to find out, I want to find out,
I want to find out, I want to find out now,
What's wrong with me and my baby.
We ain't gettin' down like we used to do,
I mean it's pretty good now, but there was a time,
When it didn't work too well.

I went down to see this gypsy woman, you understand,
I told her my story, I told her what was goin' on.
And she told me, man she said, all you need, all you need,
She said all you got to have, oh lord,
Just a touch of mojo's hand, oh bring it back on,
And it feels pretty good, yes indeed.

On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow.

Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Take me back to another morning
To a time so long ago
When the sweet Magnolia blossomed
Cotton fields as white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo
Who lived and died by the river's bed
Looking back, I still remember
I was proud to be his friend

Mama said, ""Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg
Traded for a chestnut mare
Lord, her never spoke in anger
Though his load was hard to bear

He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.
One day when Samson was walking along,
Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.

He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,
When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.

Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,
But Samson got his hands around that lion's jaws.

He ripped the beast till he killed him dead.
The bees made honey in the lion's head.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.",Samson and Delilah [Live],2004
Grateful Dead,"Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity.
Paint it with a skin of sky, brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me.

A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race.
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face.
But afraid, we may our home to waste.

There's a fear down here we can't forget hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around singing ashes to ashes all fall down.
Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime calls
And again the hunt begins and again the bloodwind calls

By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes.
It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Stalking turf, dividing up meat.

Nightmare spook, piece of heat, you and me, you and me.
Click, flashblade in ghetto night. Rudie's looking for a fight.
Rat cat alley roll them bones. Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politicians throwing stones

Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price.
Money green or proletarian gray, selling guns instead of food today.

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
While the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
Heartless powers try to tell us what to think

If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink.
History's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own.
If the game is lost then we're all the same

No one left to place or take the blame.
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or this shinning ball of blue we can call our home
So the kids they dance, they shake their bones

While the politicians are throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
Shipping powders back and forth
Singing ""black goes south while white comes north""

And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours.""
And the current fashions set the pace.
Lose your step, fall out of grace.

And the radical he rant and rage, Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians are throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
'Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free

It's dizzying, the possibilities. Ashes, Ashes all fall down.",Throwing Stones [Live],2004

And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile,
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet.

And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came.
I guess I came to keep from payin' dues.

And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues. Yeh!

She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold,
All the french perfume you'd care to smell.

""Go on, my friend, do anything you choose.""

Billy Jean was waitin' when he came.
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun,
I'd have no one but myself to blame.

I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind.
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues.

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose

Grateful Dead,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded
Though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain
Tempting you to defy it

Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off

Just Louise and her lover
So entwined
And these visions of Johanna
That conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the keychain
And the all night girls they whisper of
Escapades out on the ""D"" train

We can hear the night watchman
Click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them
It's insane

Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here

The ghost of electricity
Howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna
Have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost
He takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery
He likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me

He's sure got a lotta gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
While I'm in the hall

Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna
They kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums
Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, 'This is what
Salvation must be like after a while'
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles

See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say
""Jeeze, I can't find my knees""

Oh, jewels and binoculars
Hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna
They make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess
Who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him""

But like Louise always says
""You can't look at much, can you man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him

And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road

He writes every thing's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes

The harmonicas play
The skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna
Are now all that remain

gangster of love.

I ride across the border line,

Her pleasant looks-a, her coal black hair
Delilah gained old Samson's mind
A-first saw the woman that looked so fine

A-well went Timnathy, I can't tell
A daughter of Timnathy, a-pleased him well

Samson's mother replied to him
'Can't you find a woman of your kind and kin?'
'Samson, will you please your mother's mind?'
Go'd and married that-a Philistine

Let me tell you what, old Samson

Well, he roared at the lion, the lion run
Samson was the first man the lion attach
He caught the lion and got upon his 'ack
A-written that he killed a man with his
And Sampson had his hand in the lion's jaws

Well, if I had-a, a wicked world
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Sewed me tow knot, an' formed a plot
Not many days 'fore Samson was caught
A-bind this hands whilst a-walkin' along
A-looked on the ground and found a lil' jawbone
He moved his arm ropes, a-pop like thread
Dropped those threads free, three thousand were dead

Lord, If I had my way
Well, if I had a, a wicked world
If I had a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Samson's trick though they never found out
""Till they began to wonder about""
A-'till his wife sat up upon his knee
""A-tell me where your strength lie, if you please?""

Samson's wife she a-talked so fair
Told his wife cut off-a his hair
""Shave my head, clean as your hand""
""Till I become a natural man!""

Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

In the book of love's own dreams
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my lights grow old

When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You flew to me

In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine

The winter was so hard and cold, froze ten feet 'neath the ground.

I sat down to my supper, 'twas a bottle of red whisky,
I said my prayers and went to bed, that's the last they saw of me.
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.

When I awoke, the Dire Wolf, six hundred pounds of sin,
Was grinning at my window, all I said was ""Come on in"".
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.

The Wolf came in, I got my cards, we sat down for a game.
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades, but the cards were all the same.
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.

In the backwash of Fennario, the black and bloody mire,
The Dire Wolf collects his dues, while the boys sing 'round the fire.

In London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter
The truth to you I'll tell
Oh, truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
There was none but Jack the sailor
Her true love e're would be
Oh, her true love e're could be

Now Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

She went into a tailor shop
And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away

Well before you step on board, sir
Your name I'd like to know
She smiled all in her countenance
They call me Jackaroe
Oh, they call me Jackaroe

Your waist is light and slender
Your fingers are neat and small
And your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannon-ball

Well, I know my waist is slender
My fingers are neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

The war soon being over
She hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds
Oh, who quickly healed his wounds

This couple they got married
So well did they agree
This couple they got married
So why not you and me?
Oh, so why not you and me?

Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait,
Wo, oh, what I want to know, where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine and I call it beggar's tomb;
I got me a violin and I beg you call the tune,
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice.
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?

Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside,
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide.

Grateful Dead,"I lit up from Reno
I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night
Till the morning came around

I set out running but I'll take my time
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

I ran into the Devil, babe
He loaned me twenty bills
I spent that night in Utah
In a cave up in the hills

I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee
But the Devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill
And he vanished in the air

I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry
Away each lonely night
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie
And she's my heart's delight
Second one is prison, baby
The sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me
I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe
And one in Cherokee
First one says she's got my child
But it don't look like me

Grateful Dead,"Busted flat in baton rouge, waitin' for a train,
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans,
Bobby flagged a diesel down, just before it rained,
Took us all the way to new Orleans.

I took my harp on out of my dirty red bandanna,
I was blowin' sad while bobby sang the blues,
With them windshield wipers slappin' time, bobby clappin' hands,
We sang every song that driver knew.

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to do.
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free.
Feelin' good was easy lord, when bobby sang the blues.
Feelin' good was good enough for me, good enough for me and Bobby McGee.

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun,
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul,
Standing right beside me, lord, in everything i done,
Bobby's body kept me from the cold.

Then somewhere near Salinas, lord, i let her slip away,
Lookin' for that home, i hope she finds,
And i'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding bobby's body close to mine.

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose.
Nothin' was all she left for me.
Feelin' good was easy lord, when bobby sang the blues.
Feelin' good was good enough for me, good enough for me and Bobby McGee.

If you've got nothing new to say.
If you please, don't back up the track
This train's got to run today.

I spent a little time on the mountain,
I spent a little time on the hill,
I heard some say ""Better run away"",
Others say ""Better stand still"".

Now I don't know, but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold,
Other hand I have heard it said,
It's just as hard with the weight of lead.

Who can deny, who can deny,
It's not just a change in style?
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles.

Things went down we don't understand,
But I think in time we will.
Now, I don't know, but I was told
In the heat of the sun a man died of cold.

Keep on coming or stand and wait,
With the sun so dark and the hour so late.
You can overlook the lack, Jack,
Of any other highway to ride.

It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide.
I spent a little time on the mountain,
I spent a little time on the hill,
I heard some say ""Better run away"",
Others say ""Better stand still"".

Now I don't know, but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold,
Other hand I have heard it said,
It's just as hard with the weight of lead.
I saw things getting out of hand,
I guess they always will.

Now I don't know, but I been told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load.
I don't know whose back's that strong,
Maybe find out before too long.

And there were days
And there were days between
Summer flies and August dies
The world grows dark and mean
Comes the shimmer of the moon
On black infested trees
The singing man is at his song
The holy on their knees
The reckless are out wrecking
The timid plead their pleas
No one knows much more of this
Than anyone can see anyone can see

There were days
And there were days
And there were days besides
When phantom ships with phantom sails 
Set to sea on phantom tides
Comes the lightning of the sun
On bright unfocused eyes
The blue of yet another day
A springtime wet with sighs
A hopeful candle lingers
In the land of lullabies
Where headless horsemen vanish
With wild and lonely cries lonely cries

There were days
And there were days
And there were days I know
When all we ever wanted
Was to learn and love and grow
Once we grew into our shoes
We told them where to go
Walked halfway around the world
On promise of the glow
Stood upon a mountain top
Walked barefoot in the snow
Gave the best we had to give
How much we'll never know we'll never know

There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Polished like a golden bowl
The finest ever seen
Hearts of Summer held in trust
Still tender, young and green

As soft as velveteen
Hoping love would not forsake

We were feeling very fine air was clear and slightly damp
We were riding back to have ourselves a party
To celebrate the robbing of the train

We were talking kind of low and lazy
About not having to go out soon again, oh yeah
You know we hadn't been back home two hours
We heard a hawk cry out in the night
And you know that's a signal from young Billy, who's our sentry

He's saying something here ain't exactly right, oh
So we quick grabbed some of our hardware
Stumbled out of our home
Two minutes flat we had found her an Indian girl all alone

And Eli said, ""Let's take her back to the cabin""
I said, ""You don't know she might be the law, yeah""
He said, smiling kind of nasty
""It ain't too damn likely she'll beat me to the draw"", Oh yeah

We were walking back through the darkness
I heard the Duke, he's our dynamiter, say
He said, ""What's your name, sweet little Indian girl?""
She said, ""Raven"" and she looked away
Right then I didn't trust her, no and I said so, oh no

Now, Eli, he's our fastest gunner
He's kind of mean and young from the South
He said, ""Fat Albert, you're getting kind of old and weird now""
You'd better get your twelve gauge or shut your mouth and ass now?
And I [Incomprehensible]

Now Eli and the Duke they got down to it
They each wanted the Indian girl for their own
But when they finally got around to asking her
You know she said, ?She'd come to take young Billy home?
Eli said, ?He'd kill young Billy he'd kill the Duke
And probably me too, yeah?, the Indian girl said, ""Go ahead now do it""
I said, ""Stop it"", and she bit my thumb nearly clean through

And when they finally started to break down the door
I smeared my face up with blood from my thumb, yeah
I laid down on the floor and played real good possum
You know I'm crazy but I ain't real dumb, oh no

Now I'm dying here in Albuquerque
I must be the sorriest sight you ever saw
You know the reason I'm the only man here to tell it
You know that Indian girl, she wasn't an Indian she was the law, oh

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain, don't carry the world
Upon your shoulders for well, you know
That it's a fool who plays it cool

By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude, begin, you're waiting
For someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you

Hey Jude, you'll do the movement
You need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it

Grateful Dead,"As I was walkin' 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction, she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without askin' she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls

In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before

Well, I ain't always right but I've never been wrong
Seldom turns out the way it does in a song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

Ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
Had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by

Wind in the willow's playin' ""Tea For Two""
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue

Grateful Dead,"Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garden in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain

Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hangin' clear to Hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight
Writing, ""What for?"", across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own

Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty and talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long, he's got to callin' it home

Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman
Spinnin' that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes, I can
What would be the answer to the answer man?

High green chilly winds and windy
Vines and loops around the twining
Shafts of lavender, they're crawling to the sun
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and troop so hungry 'neath the sky, ay

Underfoot the ground is patched
With climbing arms of ivy wrapped around 
The Manzanita, dark and shiny in the breeze

William Tell has stretched the bow 
Till it won't stretch no furthermore
And all that they require in change
That hasn't gone before","St. Stephen [Live at the Fillmore West, San Francisco, CA 2/27/69] [Liv",2017
Grateful Dead,"Look for a while at the China Cat Sunflower
Proud-walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copper-dome Bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy-quilt stargown
Through a dream night wind

Crazy cat peeking through a lace bandana
Like a one-eyed Cheshire
Like a diamond-eye Jack
A leaf of all colors plays
A golden string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

Comic book colors on a violin river
Crying Leonardo words
From out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell
Beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle wing palace
Of the Queen Chinee","China Cat Sunflower [Live at Chateau D' Herouvile, Herovuville, France",2017

Like a steam locomotive, rollin' down the track

Goin' where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
Lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancin'

Come on clap your hands

And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinnin' dizzy

Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand while
The music played the band
Lord they're setting us on fire

Crazy rooster crowin' midnight
Balls of lightin' roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playin' on

Keep on dancin' through the daylight
Greet the mornin' air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they keep on dancin'

And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee,
Said tell me where your strength lies if you please.

Feeding them poison, till they hate each other

Took my mum. You raped. I take your lives now

Too late one will know
Day by day at Arthurs side
Playing his role
Day by day at Arthurs side
Closer to his goal
Warrior with royal blood
Longing for the reign
Descended from a witches breed
Witchcraft in his veins
Leader of the underworld
Ruler of the night
Deceiver of kings
Deceiver of knights
Keeper of the secret reich
Keeper of the light
I am Mordred King of the night
The nephew is a viper
No one realizes
His tongue spares the truth
His eyes hypnotyze
He injects the poison slowly
Starts to mesmerize
Gathering the troops around him
All are magnetized

Love made a fool of me
I am betrayed by love
I let her in my secrets, my heart

I still fall for her beauty
And the smell of her skin
She gave a meaning to everything

There in the woods she taught me how to touch a girl
I taught her to enchant any person in the world

I feel my end is near
I think I have to die
I pay a high price feeling lust between her thighs

I feel my end is near

How could I ever be cast under my own spell

When desire's never stilled

Allah sees equality, follow me

Lost is the ghetto dweller trapped in a cage
There's no way out of the death trap

Chorus: Gatekeeper

You can't come back [back]
no matter what you do when you fall in a death trap
You can't come back [back]
no matter what you do when you fall

Verse One: Gatekeeper

Time and time again life's getting shorter
Fear in the air what appears is the border
A nigga named Stef, was shootin up meth
with some coke, had a stroke, so I chilled for his death
Time has arrived, four-in-one mind
All the sin steppin in on my face there's a grin
Another dumb vic once moved now step
Grabbed em by the wrist, come to the abyss
Meet Katie, abortion was known with this lady
A Ph.D. many degrees had Mercedes car
She took it to a bar got lit
Like a skunk got drunk, danced rather bumped
Boom, she took the car to the nigga's pad
She didn't want to kick it so the bitch got stabbed
Wrong place and wrong time don't exist no more
or for, according to the Gravedigga law
So watch what you do 'fore a fool talks back
and behold, riding on your shoulders a Death Trap

Chorus

Verse Two: Ryzarector

This crab named Black, brother sell up crack
And it's a natural fact, in his pockets he had stacks
Bad ass beemer he drove, cause he sold his soul
to get ahold of the chrome and gold
True, he felt good as he walked his hood
Bein hunted every night, like a bear in the woods
See cops play the role of a fox
if they catch your ass out on the block, ock
it's back to the penalty box
But Black was the type that was like
""Yo fuck the see-cipher
 I got to get papes, every night""
Trailed but you came for kills
See cipher, ain't the only niggaz on the bill
He had like a quarter mil stashed on him
With the click, came through, and he blasted em
So perhaps you're catchin mad snap like that
nigga Black, smack, but you caught by the death trap

Chorus - 2X

Verse Three: Grym Reaper

Bitch she had a body like a Lexus Coupe
Her step-father, was robbin the cradle bangin the boots
her heartbeat increased at night she couldn't sleep
Daddy dearest, was bringin her grief between sheets
Deep scars invaded her soul force and mind
Six years of torture started at age nine
At age sixteen already an old maid
deceived, she was caught like Freddy in a bad dream
Meanwhile her body is being defiled
Tellin her mother, only brought a stage of denial
Moms followed pops on the low-down
led to a showdown, for a week shit slowed down
But one night overcome by lust
Father Dukes tried to score just one more thrust
He should've held back the RZA got an axe
Gave his dick forty whacks and threw his ass in the death....

Gravediggaz,"want to see something that could make ya sick?
Stand in front of jets on the Gaza strip
I used to take puffs from a car, jet in my garage
Then I get blitzed from the charge
I felt my head swayin, my eyes in a daze
Felt and violence and off balance I got drugged for days
A room full of smog, I dipped it in my dart
then I threws it at my dog
I need another hit, Hurry, Quick! Hurry, Quick!
My high's takin signs and the shit's about to kick
I'm gaspin' for air, my vision disappears,
I'm blinkin' and I'm thinkin'--Yeah!
Word, cause that's the shit I was hawkin
So stay the fuck away 'cause I spit when I'm talkin
Stupid, Stupid, Stupid, Stupid Punk--
When I'm trippin'

Some people like cheeba, some like brew,
I get mad lifted off four gallons of glue,
Pretty soon I spin like a top, In the middle of the room
And the shit won't stop!
Now What I see when I triiiiippppp.......
The rats in the basement all start to flip,
All through my building, from door to door,
I swear there's a fire, so I piss on the floor,
Now down the corridor was old fat Ned,
Schemin' on a blowjob from a crackhead,
He was like 'hey want to piece little man?'
I was like 'Yo, I'm better off with my haaaannnndddd!!!!!!!'
Oh shit, reality returns,
I need another hit but the glue won't burn,
I'm cukoo and murderous, Just plain nuts,

(Order in the court, order in the court)
I will make you pay for this you murderers
(Order in the court, order in the court)
(I said order in the court now)

Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendant please, rise and approach the bench
Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh, yeah, don't forget my retained balance

Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity
Claiming demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
Can you please explain to this court
How these so called spirits made you into these raving madmen?

Be a witness, as I excersize my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz, in a head full of dread

I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth the nurses surrounded my with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil

Grew up in Hell, now I dwell, in an Islamic Temple
I'm fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes, you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I'm obsessed

Giving niggaz brain dimples
Dragging they asses on a hook by they temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
'Cause when I kill them, I'm not leavin' one element to autopse

First I'll assassinate 'em
And them I'll cremate them
And take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate 'em

Or creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't trying to hear it
Buck, Buck, Buck, I'll give your ass a Holy Spirit

Stressed full, try to avoid all impure thoughts, I am loosing my mind
Can you please explain to this court when these problems first began?

The year 84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil gen
I realize my ideas has spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears

I saw the torture brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair

I got tackled with handcuffs
And shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a Holy Tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks

And sewed my eye lids open, so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt

And nailed my hands, feet to the form of the cross, ah, I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye, refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my face
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape

Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca, carajo, cono
Calm down people, please, calm down
Let us please, proceed with the defendants explanation

Enta the realms of understanding
And take good heed and you could bleed
While I'm standing, three stages of pure hell
Justifications of red cells, rain drops hits the pelv

Path is dull and narrow
You're stalked by a shadow
I pierced your skull with a fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time

Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose
You better hurry
Don't stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry

On your right side there's fire
On you left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor?
It's a claw, took his fucking ass to the fucking core

Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood

Some more, I give you some more
And watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor
Worms that dig your pores

I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain
You can't stand, you're up to your hands in quick sand

You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matta
Stab you with a dagga of Jacob's Ladder

Thoughts become shattered, confused, and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz
Guilty, next case

Prey upon the weak and strong I'm the sniper
And light that ass like gasoline
I dig through your chest like a jar of vasoline
I leave your brain regurgitating plancid
until your rhymes are exaperated

You have nothing to fear, nothin to fear
Walking in the shadows you realize
That live is nothing but a fog of animated death

Sparks through the dark, I'm diggin in the dirt
Or diggin in your brains or your skirt
Burying the past is a very hard task
I make loot and now everybody's diggin up dirt

Here comes the one, the one wicked sun from the slums
That's how i do when the Gravedigga crew comes for

From here to Nantucket MC's kick the bucket
I'm rugged ruff flow-in up till I bust
While other rappers is flatter than a white girl's butt
I manifest my name and the reason I came in the first place

Had the f***ing nerve to try and enta my grave yard

Commit suicide and I'll bring you back to life
The first was convinced
Stuck a water hose in his mouth at full blast so his head can explode
Second said hmmmm that's good but I can top it

Put an ax up to his head and then he chopped it
Blood shot out in every direction
The rest didn't know what to do, I made suggestions
Put a slug in your mug, overdose on a drug

Wet your hair stick a knife in the plug
Or be like Richard Pryor set your balls on fire
Better yet go hang yourself with a barbed wire
Three and Four fell deep into spell and

Ran to the zoo, locked themselves in a lion's den
Number Five said it ain't worth being alive
Smoked a dust suede, mixed it with cynaide

Dem while eats, I piece a music living epic
Words like proverbs
Blended braided so on like a storm or song of king David
Potentially vital, only as the bible
Camel eyes used to worship the false idols
New form of literature, dance to the fiddler
Don't mean to riddle you God
I'm not The Riddler
On super the moon, no, wait for high noon
I'm the other space Doom I be entombed
I don't squawk like a hawk or stalk like a stork
But walk in New York, stay away from pork
Rhymes are by passion
Don't need the hassle
Swingin everything cause I'm king of the castle
Niggas gettin boggled, it scream and squabble
Gravediggaz got the paperback novel
So line by line you should read
Take heed
Or you'll bleed and bleed and bleed and bleed

Chorus: repeat 2X

Pray for your mommy -- 4X

Chorus to fade",Here Comes the Gravediggaz,1994
Gravediggaz,"Intro:
Yeahhh
This is a story
That there are deep, situations, everybody go through in life
(It's something that we go through)
You know, it's that inside part of you that you don't tell nobody about
YaknowhatI'msayin?
From that inside, that dark space inside you
(It's something that we go through)
From that darker, that inner side of you
It's from the dark side

Verse One: Fruitkwan/Gate Keeper
Blaow blaow! No more knocks at your doors
It's just about to explode, hit the floorrrrrrrr
I come from a triple blood-shedding
Spreading, my heading, straight from Armageddeon
It's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Once you get slapped by the dark side
I was attacked, not clever to react
Small as a peep, I was deep in solar facts
My escapade level swelled
Threw up, fell
I grew up, five blocks from Hell
I'm used to seeing the grass grow black
Medaling pushing pedaling kids that pushed cracks
Murderers leavin they traces
Ya wasted, permitted destroying the human races
Fuckit I'm bringin ruckus
To brothers an APB out on the next Fredrick Douglass
I'm sort of a saint, you think I ain't
With skills to paint, with my third eye
You're tranked...
...from the dark side

Interlude: Prince Rakeem/Ryzarector
We expressing feelings, we expressing our dark feelings
So my feelings may be deeper than his or his feelings may be deeper than mines
But it's all in the expressing of a feeling
(from the dark side)

Chorus: Too Poetic/Grym Reaper
You, are dumb, and deaf, and blind
You, are dumb, and deaf, and blind
You, are dumb, and deaf, and blind
You're dumb AND deaf AND blind

Verse Two: Too Poetic/Grym Reaper
In a time when every preacher large and small shall fool them
Using Revelations, as my crystal ball I see
more hordes of warlords who so hard they forgot
the graveyard TERRAIN, scar tissues of BRAINS
Be all illuminating soon the Illuminati platoons
of Satan lay waitin to slay men
Save your, amens, awaken
The reason that Grym is God
I escape through your synagogues
And gave the EGYPTIANS, ancient INSCRIPTIONS
Leaks into CHRISTIANS, turn all the facts into fictions
Here comes the Reaper with the shot to your system
I chop religions that concoct the vision
Feel the incision of the sword that's piercing your third eye
Coming straight from the dark side
...from the dark side

Chorus
Gravediggaz...
...in the dark side
Coming to take you...
...from the dark side back to the light
...from the dark side
 you're in the dark side (yeah)
 we're in the dark side
 you're in the dark side
 we're in the dark side
 you're in the dark side
 they're in the dark side
 we're all in the dark side

You're dumb and deaf and blind (it's something that we goin through)
(from the dark side)
You're dumb and deaf and blind
You're dumb and deaf and blind
in the dark side
Yeah, Gravediggaz",From the Dark Side,1995

Ay yo I really hate snakes
I feel like bustin' off rounds in they face
But that would be exhibitin' the same weak traits
Shit is deep like bass, enemies get beat, lock breaks
From dusk to dawn I thrust upon the scene
Always conscious I was born supreme
No wonder I run with a hundred twenty three nine hundred and ninety nine
thousand convicts
Wanted by the beast in the hellified streets
With nullified beef and combat swamp rats
And ghetto playgrounds where scenes is tragic
Everyday seein' decayin' brown fabrics (Da Bomb!)

Stabbin' MCs in the abdomen and laughin' at 'em (Hahahahaha!)

I possess intellect to reflect
One of the best flows
Within the metro-politan
Got more styles than a Chinaman
Anywhere ya find the Grym
My mind I bring
Disaster to areas
Faster than spots in Iraq that got blown from aircraft carriers
Carry your whack ass outta my war zone 
Or get slapped in the jaw bone
From the megawatts of the raw pone
Missed the tour rooms through
Cities and stadiums, halls and Paladiums
All over the Mediterranean Seas
I'm terrorizin' MCs like an Iranian
Seizin' a Boeing 747
24/7 we're flowin' professionally
You see spots keep glowin' at the Gravediggaz showin'
We master the art exceptionally

No doubt when I precipitate the walls vibration
Thought skies cover your fake ass lacerations
Check it, forever your rest, black hood the event
Brothers in the New York streets that represent
Squeeze ya coal, 32 below
Send a chill through your bow
Catch your fuckin' nerve like a snow cone
You get stuffed like an envelope, yo
Won't even think twice, I'll slice the fuckin' rope
Save your salvation
Ruin your reputation
Get ready for a brief devastation
Forty clicks up the creek
If I hear a squeek
The nigga Gate Keep never ever retreats
Brooklyn street perpendicular
The order for manslaughter is vehicular
Terrified flashbacks
Gaspin' for your airsac
The mere factor of unleashin' my second chapter

Gravediggaz,"Yo, hah yo, rah, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, I got stress on my brain that causes chest pains
Inside the best frames ghetto blood clots is scored by slug shots
And drug spots, well if you're too poor to move out
Or get a new house, it's like livin' in a war walkin through shootouts
And you doubt God exists, when hard fists
Be poundin' on your head like jackhammers
You're trapped in the black drama, you hear the laughter
Seconds after that you fade out, you're played out, you're laid out
Your heart nearly gave out, you're lucky that you made out
With just a few scars when the beating ends
The streets let ya breathe again
But evil men, will soon be on the receiving end
Of Universal Law, I'm callin on the meek and the poor
To fight back and never forfeit the day you have to go to war
With forces that are armed upon the seven continental borders
A mental fortress is essentials to absorb this
My sword hits the human orb until it orbits
In the art of war kids see Grym Reap be morbid
Since pieces of the lost civilization in the past
Had my photographs etched inside of pyramids
To laugh at this revelation, without 365 days of concentration
And twenty-four hour meditation, would be foolishly pagan
I'm ancient as 'amen', see I stay Grym
Throwi'n fools in in a pit full of pit bulls to be shaken
Or strapped to the crossroads of Hell and inner sin
Which trap the sinners in, to sell such in Sing-Sing
I bring Grym tidings, titled your wave all not exciting
Stop riding the dick, start writin your own shit
'Cause I stick figures that think they fat and can't rap wind blast
I make em Slim Fast, lookin like stick figures
I'm all that, I bag chips at concerts and shows
Get more panties than hoes that boost Victoria Secret clothes
Foes is tagged like ex-foes toes at the coroner's
Kids with cold feet rise and fall like the barometer
Grym will mentally chop your career
See shit is locked down here, like penitentiary blocks in tears
Escape outta your ducts every time you hear my name
You better duck fate, or catch a fuckin face full of duct tape
You get smacked like a trick that sniffed off her money
Then smoked like Rzarector with the blunts dipped in honey

Rotate your head like a gyro, my hair grows in knotty spirals
Feet resembles Christ's description from the Bible
Water-walker, immune to all physical torture
Pull out fast in a Porsche, upon a double-crosser
My penis rise up in the morning like a Phoenix
And blast iron cells into a low blooded 'nemic
The imperial material's venerial
Mc's get murdered in serial, you can't fuck with the material
Unorthodox paradox, my shit is seen wide-screen Magnavox
Grabs thought like Doctor Octopus
Cause war like the grandson of Kush
I'm hangin devil's heads on a evergreen bush
Sugar-frosted sorceresses bitches get exhausted
Pussy lips be drippin', like leaky faucets
Undercover see-Cyphers sprayed up like windshield wipers
While I'm guzzlin Piper's, changin my son's shitty-ass diapers
Dime piece trapped in sync like many time piece
You get stampeded by the wildabeast
A rap dast' plus tracks black like Chow Yun Fat
Oppositional forces get their eardrums flat
Common denominator, I swing the mic saber like Vader
He was fooled by the inter-pre-atation made from a traitor
Mc's get their wigs blown, trounced off my fistbone
Choked from my death, every time they break a wishbone
Eventually, I knew the whole world would mention me
Potentially, I have the key to make G's
Mc's breeze on my tracks, I rock the fruit with the trees
Killa bees spread rapid like diseases
See it's, like the second comin of Jesus, of Nazareth
Be fabulous, raise the dead crowd up like Lazarus
Hazardous vocabulary attacks be beautiful
Acoustical notes we provoke, it comes out musically dope
Niggas realize they just can't cope
The hair, bustin out the head resembles fire and smoke Loc

I blast watts in circuits like General Monk-Monk was Turkish
My science is divided deep into your central nervous
Pervert area codes peep this murder
I'm boxed-in, suckin' hologram tits, inhalin' oxygen
Parallel world of crab niggas and sea shells mix
I pierce my dick and sword right through you pelvics
I'm hell stricken bomb, wrapped in trees of palm
Physical existence is descendants of Allah
I travel at high rates, weaker men are primates
That either migrate or get burnt to the stake
I feed off lyrical light beams of amphetimene
My terminology is panatomic like lobotomy
Crazy el loco, gas niggas like Sunoco
Flush em like Presto, Blast in your chest bone
I raise from the shore, like Sodom and Gomorrah
With traction, flashin a 4-wheel drive Ford Explorer
While mucus lies within the center of the Rubik's
The roots of the wine induced the enzymes inside your nucleus
Turmoil boilin' appointed, niggaz rubbin off my style like a ointment
Lost in the Sahara, From trial and error
Confused with 3 meals for Sister Sara

Due to the rise of spirits or my transparent perseverance

Yo, you can dissect it

I'm cold as a pirate's luger
Choke on my hymic maneuver
I breathe life in the fire
When my designs are tight like pliers
Born in a pillow of barbed wire
Taught by Ebenezer Scrooge in my mom's church choir
The death stalker
New York trendtogrophy
The G-O-D, 120 degree geography
The bomb thick iron skin without a blemish
Black art of war chemist
Carry out the death sentence with deadly vengeance
What I'm seekin is your head on a skillet
Soakin in burgundy liquid
Self inflected wounds fill pounds in Grant's tomb
And more damage than a monsoon

The mighty hunter in the concrete junga
Doper than ganja
Conquer any style you can conjure
Take your momma's breath away like anacondas
Fronters get cast asunder
Lightening fast I bring thunder
Ancient rules blast the mic
Crushin fools paradise leavin you parasites under
Ground, beef is shredded, paramedics'll greet you
I defeat crews with parametric EQ's
All types of anastetics'll be used
My pressure's like the barometric when I squeeze you, hahaha
Removed of this earthly ball of clay
Let the chips fall where they may
I'll be servin you all day everyday
Consider you a serious threat, heh anyway...

Gravediggaz,"This is the story of three little pigs
And the projected damage that they did, pig number one was white
Thought everything he did was right, the pigology of self
Pink skin terror and wealth, just hogging shit up for self

Rolled up on a pig named swine
A brown skinned pig convinced him they was one of a kind
The swine fell for the short tail
But no way in hell was earth that stale

Stone chicken eggs, hit 'em in the mud that they lay
When it hatched, it was chicks of another shade
The stone age, the origin of aids in the bone age
There was a pig, skin was black
He cleaned up the swine and they filthy acts

If not they was be forced to sent back
But trouble come first, stale shit got worse
Consumers of swine are now cursed
The exile meant from 'Bylon, after three on
The shores of north America's hoof
When they celebrated thanksgiving with the wolf

When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray
When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray

There was a rich man, a poor man, a beggar, and a thief
Now each had a different hustle to get food to eat
The rich man was paid, 'cause the poor man was workin'
Like a slave, he only gave him, minimum wage

The poor man endured this, torture for his four sons
His daughter and his wife, 'cause he sought a better life
His boss laid him off on the 4th of December
He sold sweatshirts and boxer shorts, to keep his fort

Now deep in the winter, he got pneumonia, from a cold
This ended all of the little hustles that he controlled
He was troubled in his soul, he couldn't sleep he wouldn't eat
But by his side was a strong woman, not taking defeat

She pleaded and begged the rich man, for the hubby
Who gave fifteen years of his life, for the company
Conversation was brief, with no relief in sight
Then she unleashed her four sons into the night

They robbed that rich man blind
Then fled over the borderline, escaping with all the cream
But still could not restore the mind see
Life is a dangerous game and it seems cash rule eventually
Authored mentally

When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray
When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray

The rich man's soul turned to dust through the lust
To control as much fluff, his cold heart touched
The old fart grew up, with goals to be the fly kid
With the golden midas, touch

Smokin' dutches that he ignited at will
Usin' hundred dollar bills the big will, up until, he collided
With fate, had a stroke while chokin' on some stake
This was fatal as hell was not bein' able to take his pace
Back to the cradle

Jack and Jill ran up the hill
Jack said, ""I never ran, never will, 'cause I'm from Brownsville""
But still, the living provider, the outsider had beef
With Peter Piper 'cause his girl Goldilox put stocks in his viper

On the yellow brick road he lost control
Got charged for runnin' down the scarecrow, on the loose
Runnin' from hot pursuit, lead by Dr. Seuss
Riding hard on his jock, when Pete got blasted by the keystone cops

When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray
When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray

When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray
When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray

To see me represent and excel
But yo the torments of hell lay dormant until

Nearly got killed bein stuck in the fire
Like Jeremiah
I weep for my peeps gettin bucked from the streets to the choir

Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it

[Truemaster]
I'm lettin mines out
I can see through I can see through
Who you want me to believe you are?
Front shine and son knowin you're a fallen star
I see the look in your eyes when I pass you in my car
I been felt the vibe so I played you from afar
Your problem is you think too negative
It perpetuates your condition and cuts short your ambition
You're not a wicked one son
You need development
Don't worry when things are irrelevant
You need to let it out cause it could cause you bad health
Hidin your emotions could rob you from yourself
(Gravediggaz) Hide you from yourself

Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it

Yo
I saw the woman I love colored in blood
War is hell, I cut shells, was then covered in mud
As four ships hovered above, my heart griefs
But at least she didn't take the mark of the beast
Rest in peace boo
If I blessed then I'ma meet you on the other side
But for now I gotta slide
Through physical mindfields
Miserable is how my mind feels knowin it's long time to heal
Shit is real
Another black mold in a hole
God rest your soul as you travel back home
I'll carry your essence in the thoughts I'm manifestin
As pleasent memories outshine my depression
My physical stress says it's time to rest
Bein chased by the devil tryin to take my breath
Ain't a place on the Earth that you can't get touched
If I get bucked let my melanin rust hit the dust

Yo my boo was hard as corn liquor when we met
Livin jet set, everything connect
Fitted like a seam double stitched
If I had a scratch she knew where to find the itch
Many warm hugs and soapy back rubs
Candlelight's held tight at the hips every night
My soul is cold boo, I can't abandon ship
Cause of false reactions, I miss you with a passion
Your new being represents a universal mean
So rise like cream black queen
Unfortunately you died in my arms
From a stray bullet from afar
That ripped through the car
My dreams are intense with very little sense
My pretense cracked to find an honor like a track boo
I want to follow in pursuit
What I got to do, what I got to do

I be the sick lunatic with the devilish poem
From the mists of the darkness I come with this
Hittin straight, to the chest, like a Primatene mist

I'm like a bat, in the night, when it's time to take flight
Here I am, in the flesh, and yes I love sess
I'm obsessed, by the sounds, the track possess

Yo, 1, 2

We come to break ya'll some information and ressurect you
From the mentality of foolishness

Become awake and chop the heads of these snakes
It's better off they dyin' in a pit full of snakes
Mistake inside your self, that be the first head you take

Gold armor, surround my body
I'm reachin a high state of nirvana
But want to chop and imitate
To bite, the livin' spirits
Golden livin tablets
Transmitted by the Abbot
Blood related king to King David's mighty men
I appear in the atmosphere like 
Nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide
Helium, xenon, argon, neon, freon, be gone
I travel beyond
The range where sick sounds grave
You can't respond
Dynamic semantics makes your mind go frantic
Hand picked Gods
Razor sharp be my standard
Breakin' from bondage and white garments
Eye ball as black as onyx
Hair gonna grow as long as a comet's tail
Escape from Hell
Watch the Gods be real
What makes rain and hail, snow and earthquakes?
Goin' through crisis, or mad devices
I thought girls was made of sugar and spices
Always wanted to fuck 'em like Isis
While others bow down, Percival, Cyrus
I'm inside my lab stabbin' rhymes on black papyrus
Your weight couldn't measure a snow flake
How you gonna shine on a God while you rotate
I dislocate your head, your neck, your back, your legs, your kneecap
Back smack your ass bitch
And splatter your gall bladder
My mathematical data
Terror far beyond the stars of William Shatner
The rattler can't deport on my speed of thought
Then escape New York in East London or import

Stronger currents than my brains runnin' rapid
Hereditary practice pierce hoes through metal jackets

Niggas get caught up in the exhaust pipe
Get the frost right or suffer frost bite
Isle of the King
Maniac barbarian, sort of Romanian
Underground, subterranean
Five stepper grandson of Nefar
The rest of ya'll heffers, thimble
Ya'll resembled Uncle Fester
God biding escape
Through telepathic gates
Integrate, causin' one mind to elevate
Stagnate competition, like an earthquake
Causin' the earth to shake
On release day, diggin more graves
Master 4 tay or black cherries block
Freshly picked out the cemetery, bear the plot

Organic, saw panic when I wreck shit and smile
With more props than New York City got blocks
I cripple your whole knot till your air drip of snot
First encounter of Hell, is facin' Grym
Lacin' human shells with radiation until cell mutation
Begins to permeate flesh
Like skins bein' pressed
And barb wire, steel mesh
As 200 nerve endings record the pain
I cut like the Wu-Tang sword hittin' the brain
The main issue for invasion of your brain tissue
Is your dismissal, nigga I reign official
I lack fear like a black bear
Slash your chest area open 
And have the whole world soakin within your hemoglobin
Then blast, your lyrics be on face and astrophysics
You couldn't be doper if you were Noriega's chemist
Twistin' the mic like Brooklyn fire hydrants in the summer
Bangin' like a Forerunner
Lyrically my formula is see-4 to the third power
Of ice, fire, and water
This equation 'causes manslaughter
Torture upon the microphone

The strikes like a poem with a baseball bat

Gravediggaz,"Yo, there's still time

As the door close, the cold wind blows
Down America like the Wall of Jericho
Some will walk the sheet close
Many are called but few are chose

Who knows until the day they be exposed
UFO's surround the globe
The world is prepared to explode
So I grab hold of the North Pole

Not tryin' to meet the lost soul, at the crossroad
We're bein' sucked up into the black hole
Young becomes old, mighty clouds roll
Unfold the scrolls that were foretold, by the forefathers

The end of the world saga, streets flooded with lava
Mommas and papas, toddlers, hip-hoppers, and rastas
Rock stars and mobsters, above streets in helicopter
Filled with doctors readin' the death roster

Guts spillin' out like pasta, sky, misty, often tipsy
From off the whiskey, the gypsy, told me, my chances, were risky
Cops, pull up and frisk me but never could they get me, too shifty
I will go, into my dungeon, and summon up the second comin'

People started runnin', aliens with hair like Rastafarians
Captured, placed inside of aquariums, studied by scientists
This is it, 'The Apocalypse', I see the mother ship above the cliff
Over Egypt, it made me sea sick, I see the eclipse
And the abyss, the night shifts

It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

The archangel imprison my soul into a prism
Usin' cell division and molecular collision within me
He listen and analyze the heartbeat and rhythms
Of children livin' brutalized

My ears became used to the vibes of ruined lives
Sounds in the chamber I was hidden in
Was so spine-tinglin' I was tremblin'
Envisionin' the fear, here within a new millennium

Where rain became toxic, the air's stale and noxious
Comets hit co-ops with force that made blocks split
Flocks tried to escape a fate that made even hard rocks slide
As nuclear dropped out of the sky, causin' burns too severe

For hydro peroxide and sodium oxide, deep down outta basements
Fish turned lopsided and upside down from atomic face lifts
Through the blackness I saw John the Baptist, on the atlas
Holdin' the masters to my Psalm under his arm

But long before I even wrote 'em
23 elders each wrote me a Psalm
And placed them within my motor neurons
It contained the approximate date of, 'The Apocalypse'

Deposited in scripts of the 20th century prophets
The clock ticks, tick, tick, tick upon the land borders
I count down the manslaughter
Military camcorders under ocean waters

Red October causin' fish to grow arms, legs, tits
And double heads, mutating the eggs as the radiation spreads
Over the water beds, I watch Mother Nature as she bled
Grym, was placed in skin casing to begin lacing hymns

Through the basement, won't be no escapin'
From the South to the North
Where you run ten paces and your face is fallin' off

It's repentance day
It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Raised in Hell, waitin' for angels like Rafael
Comin' from space to trace, they race
Thrown in jail cells I had a purpose since
The sperm cell, to bail out and get braille

For the blinded children in Israel
Kids kill forget the bill
For, dollar bills and drug deals by the mayor
Controls the people livin' legal

Sit back and chill, until time will reveal
Two thousand and one holy men with force fields
Levitatin' space ships, earthquake hits, United States splits
Projects turn to snake pits

Secrets of the Masons came to revelations
Babylon destroyed by the nations aggravations
Riots in the train stations, criminals grabbin' cops
Snakes rattlin', angels draggin'

Seven head dragons out the Roman empire
Surrounded with fire, liars in the Pentagon
Drop their nuclear bombs, ran, panic
But still, was trapped on the planet

Died before the mother ship landed
Only the chosen ones understand it, some can't
'Cause of TV brain damage, no time to be romantic
This day your independence and repentance, pentance, pentance

""Now I see the light, my whole life is moving in one direction
I see that now, there never has been any choice for me""

Repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Did you repent today?
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

As long as you got mentally dead people
Who are living in a mental death
Meaning living in a mental grave
you need somebody to dig that grave up and bring them back to life
There's no chance for a physical dead
but there's chance for the mentally dead
(Yo, one two one two two)
So we gonna come and resurrect them
That's why they call me the Ryzarector
I'm out to resurrect the mental dead, by diggin up they graves
Bringin em back to the surface

Niggaz is caught up in the midst of six
You better grab ahold of your crucifix
And this is it, the black God exists
Can you understand this?  Let me teach you a lesson, yo
The pre-existence of the mathematical biochemical equations
The manifestations of God, Earth Air Fire and Water
which are in it's basic formation, solid liquid and gases
that caused the land masses, and the space catalyst
and all matter that exists and is dense
Third dimension, that must be observed through physical comprehension
It takes a nerve to be struck, wisdom is the wise
poet spoken to wake up, the dumb who've been sleeping
The fourth dimension is time, it goes inside the mind
Run the channels energized up through the back of your spine
So observe as my G energy strikes a vital nerve
One swerve of the tongue it pierces like a sword through the lung
Have you not heard, that words kill as fast as bullets
when you load negative thoughts, to the chamber of your brain
And your mouth pulls the trigger that propels
wickedness straight from Hell
From the pits of your stomach where negativity dwell
I searched the East coast and West coast down and most found
the small towns is like ghost towns, everybody moves slowed down
From Uptown to Bucktown give a fuck now Shaolin gots the crown
And cops'll still serve you from Jamaica Ave. to Myrtle
And cats carry more shells than turtles
Brooklyn Down Park Hill pussies unfertile
Buy wholesale never retail get females in deep spells
If you eat well, you sleep well
Send enemies to Hell
What makes hair skin epidermis fingernail
Regenerate, when everything else disintegrate
A teflon vest so bullets can't penetrate
On the corner of my block there stood this old man
A black immigrant from the land of Sudan
Who used to tell stories to the children in the building
But never had a dollar to keep his pocket filled in
He bombed he knew Deuteronomy the science of Astronomy
But didn't know the basic principles of economy
I say the wise man don't play the role of a fool
The first thing a man must obtain is Twelve Jewelz
Knowledge Wisdom Understanding to help you achieve
Freedom, Justice Equality Food Clothing and Shelter
After this, Love Peace and Happiness
He had the nappiest head, I told him total satisfaction
is to achieve one goal in the scheme of things
He who works like a slave, eats like a king",Twelve Jewelz [RZA Solo],1997

Yo
If you could soar the sky like a bird
Would you be disturbed to see brothers on the curb smokin herb
And cops from the third precinct rush in
Like a herd
Chargin up the league with possession
Freeze em and arrest em
Strip search em then undress em
Make the youngsters come and then sign a confession
Or would you watch the cop in the chopper
With the high powered binocular cameras
Attached the bottom of his aircraft
Takin photographs of your lab
Pointin a 50 millimeter 500 shot magazine full clip gat at your back
Hoverin the projects, spotlight shinin bright
On movin targets
Infrared light at night on dark objects
Harassin citizens who hasn't been charged yet
Would you order a flock of pelicans to jam their propellers
On top see forfeit the death system failure
Take these devils off, I witness Tom broke off
Mentally fry his brain and blow the smoke off
Killa Bee, presidential suite, Bill and Hillary
Bow and kiss my feet
Auxillary security retreat
Heavy artillery sun heat
Meet the agony defeats the cavalry
Six-pack battery back, anti-gravity raps
Snaps your head inside the bear trap
You can't adapt to the habitat
The biggest jigsaw puzzle be the world map
Niggas think that they own things and man sit high upon thrones
When you die tell me what the fuck you own
When your skin flesh and bones find a permanent home
As food for worms or fossils trapped in stone

Half deceased enemies are buried alive at the Wu mount enterprise

I want a queen on every continent
So I can escape the government
Flee my residence, settle in
I'm militant minded, brilliant rhyme whiz
The time is now for me to shine, kids are innocent
Blinded, society got to be reminded of my diary
Cause tragically I carry thee
Misery of centuries that's sent to me
Not coincidentally intentionally cause mentally I represent the key
But it's a double-edged sword see
Tryin to be godly is hard
Especially in poverty's backyard
Where violence has taken over
Free enterprise and lies is idolized
Cause it's deep inside with Allah, God or Jehovah
To guide the lost tribe
You're forced to reside on the north side
Babylon is never penalized
For bein offsides, so many lost lives
I wonder how long before the herd dies
Today I heard the earth cry for the first time
It was the worst time
It was the worst time
The way I heard the earth cry

I came to the shores of America disguised as a pillar
The alpha and omega and the home of the beggars, the black sellers
Who been beaten, raped, lynched, robbed and stoned
And caused to roam the earth in service cause they couldn't maintain at 
home
This dates back to 1555
When they captured the first tribe of men
And piled them in a pen
Fifty feet high
They took em all on a 9000 mile ride
And landed on the shore of a place they never seen before
But read about this inside the ancient books of war
Bonded in stainless steel, stripped of their language
Still survived the anguish of slavery but still remained nameless
Separated to portions and tricked by John Haughty Hawkins
And sold on the auction, taught birth control and abortion
Rulers of the first part became slaves of the worst part
The devils cursed God and reversed God
And turned God into dog and made people search hard
No relief came to the prophet of W.D. Feraud
To a trauma, dropped our mommas off in Bahamas and Barbados
Tobagos, separated us from slave boats
Made our own brothers hate us
From Virgin Isle to Jamaica
Trinidad, Honduras, Haiti, Grenada
Bermuda to Cayman, mental enslavement
You black gods become awaken

At night time you can hear the earth cry
How many more black gods got to die
Before we realize there's no God in the sky
The devil tricked us, that's the worst lie
At night time I can hear the earth cry
How many more black gods got to die
You realize there's no God in the sky
The devils tricked us, that's the worst lie

Peace god for real, not a spook nor a ghost
Not unseen but seen and heard most of all

Science, huh my rhyme's underrated
Pyramids built accordin to how we made it to be
Many shall come few shall be chosen
32 degrees below zero and you're frozen
Power of refinement my rhyme's assignment
Is to crush negative bullshit in a line
With the fusion
Cause that which is beyond 360 degrees is an illusion
Either you're deaf, dumb or blind
Stupid hypocritical, dumb 85 yo it's time
See I without me don't exist
God cypher love devine is what I miss
Check it like a visual reflection, sorta supernatural
Your know your mind detects as bein natural
Ultra gammer, the hammer's my energy
Compressed to a form of a threat toward my enemy
Cypher's a circle that consists of a whole
No beginning no ends no sides it's just a hole
Like in an event I'm a percent
Dealt out a hundred I'm 5, my degree is a black belt
Real genuine not authentic
Older than the sun moon and stars unprecedented
In North America success can be won as a game
And knowledge and understanding still one and the same
Greatest reward known to mankind
That winners never quit and quitters never win in the mind
But in time my degrees are gettin deeper
Thicker in the subconscious state of the sleeper

At night time I can hear the earth cry
Wonder how many black gods got to die
At night time I can hear the earth cry
I wonder how many black gods must die
At night time I can hear the earth cry
I wonder how many black gods must die

I was cursed by sin
A mammal of the sea
Pops named John Samuel Berkeley, out of his nuts came me
True indeed I had soul, even as a tadpole
Grab hold of an egg, just to have a mole
Grew up surrounded by darkness and blood
Swimmin' in the cut like Noah in the flood
Eh ah ah ah ah! Drama! Devils attack me inside my momma!
This caused trauma
While I was growin' up she was throwin' up
It got worse, it's how I met the doc and the nurse
They took an X-ray, kept it to the next day
To figure out the best way to possess me
Trapped in a pool of impurity

Tossin' turnin', fightin' to awake
I woke up with a scream, strapped to the stake
Blood drippin' like rain, excruciatin' pain
Loosin' my grip, episode of ""Tales From the Crypt""
Seein' faces of death had me shortness of breath
Fallin' through the rabbit hole that collapsed my chest
Blood spillin', inside survive like a villain
Killin' life, torturous as Vincent Prince
Tried to run got caught then I lost my tongue
Barrels of dead corpse beatin' my head like a drum
Summoned to scotch your head, let's figure
They guided my light, I came back a grave digga
The prophet, enhanced by these deadly concoctions
Killin' evil that lurk in the dirt, is our only option
Four hundred years in the pits we dwell
And for every drop of blood you will burn in hell, devil

Deranged cancer cell begin to damage my shell
Tissues begin to swell
A human pin-cushion needles begin pushin'
Through my, melanin color, blood begins gushin'
Hunger, pain is, fed through my veins
Tryin' to maintain body and brain under strain
Belly bein' drained from my nose through a catheter
To maintain my stamina, game is high caliber
Flashback my dossier file before the hospital
Lots'll pay a pile of cheddar to see me rock my style
Got lots of smiles from man woman and child
A grave digga here runnin' wild like the Nile
Ghetto, X-File, the horoscope bringers
City morgue singers, new rap era beginners
Four years out of seven I remember tourin'
And this year I'm measurin' my urine

I don't think there'll ever be a remedy for my disease
As tears proceed bleed from eyes of those
Who scream as they desperately search for peace
A life of misery, all you've ever givin' me
I've tried to pray, but my faith won't let me go no further
If I got to die for something, it'll be my freedom
This ain't no physical war, it's all mental
Livin' in a final era
Of the very last pages of the Holy Bible
It's almost time to go
As judgement day awaits our mortal souls

Sound off: one, two
Sound off: three, four

[Tombstone]
This is world we live in
Truly devoted, frustrations gettin' out
This splurge of mental traffic can drive you crazy
More than enough problems we're facin'
That's why Stone keep his mind in a zone, huh
Real with ourselves
We way off in the wasteland, nobody want to die
No, nobody really give a damn, strugglin's a mother
Gotta play it out, can't unroll your cover
On the down low hustle, trustin' in God
Lettin' Him provide, we strivin' survivors
Ain't about what it was, what it is
The deal, real gorillas in the midst

High tech weapons everywhere
We roll in the jungle
In the middle of the field, they tumble
Somebody gon' crumble after the rumble

Graveyard Shift,"(Intro Repeated-Sin of Graveyard Shift)
Silence is necessary, don't tell them who you are

(Verse 1-Sin of Graveyard Shift)
Formulate a different tactic, let's sing anthems
No sterotypical categorizing, rising above all make shift realities
Fantasies misconstrued the thoughts of wicked men
They cough as lungs inhale, exhale poisonous gases
Oh well, I guess I'll just protect myself in good help
Done played out the wickedest hand man has ever dealt
I felt like dying just the other day 'cause Satan was trying
Walking too close by my side
Stay still, please don't move your soul you could lose
No crying, where's my blood?
You'll find out soon enough
Alright I'll ride, in due time we'll get our chance to die
Hold on to my mind
No use for guns or drugs, need mo' love
But yet and still, slugs get fired off constantly
Immorally, destroying my holy oracle
But I just ignore it though
Keep a steady pace just movin slow...slow, just movin slow

(Chorus-Sin of Graveyard Shift)
Silence...silence...silence...silence

(Verse 2-Krayzie Bone)
As I sit in my livin room, chillin in my thug mood
I begin to hear noises comin from the other room
So I pause my Nintendo, then I walk over to the window
Is it paranoia from the indo?
Then goes a thought, then another thought
Run and get the pump, 'who goes there?
What the fuck you want?'
'cause I'm gone off that blunt and I will buck a motha fucka down
You on my grounds
Hope they got enough of the rounds
All of a sudden I heard a crash
My first instinct was to blast, but the Mauseburg didn't last
So I had to dash, ran upstairs I was franic in panic
But I managed to make it to the top, to my artillery shop
I was runnin, but I could hear the souljah's comin
I don't they must think I have some money
AK-47 and a Mack-11
Jettin to the bedroom locked myself in, the clip is in
Teach 'em a lesson it ain't healthy to rob
They fit to slip on the job, soon as they twist on the knob
Just like I figured when they twisted it, the AK-47 was hot
I had to drop it but I emptied it
The Mack-11 would hit, hit the niggaz up from head to toe
Had to escape and I was out the window
Here I do, I hit the ground, uhh
Then I looked around, shook the fall
Hopped in the Benz and hauled
Callin my niggaz let's get ready for war
I think I killed 'em all but I know that they'll be sendin some more
So when they come back around, I say we show 'em rappin don't mean a thang
And this is a gun, and this is a grave
Rest in peace you're not feelin me
Truly Mr. Leatherface, I dedicate thiiis.....

(Chorus-Sin of Graveyard Shift)
Silence...silence...silence...silence

(Verse 3-Tombstone of Graveyard Shift)
Fight, movin in the night
Daylight, takin slow paces might outrun the race
Never want to rely on murda, enter my life
But life's so strange and hectic all backwards and shelled
The killin factor in jail
The streets is hell, you can tell by the smell
Off with his head oh well
You know they don't give a damn if that make the weak mind feel the same
It's a shame how they watch you, stalk you
Pinnin every step I make, Knowin every breath I take
Makin it easy for the next man to get his hands on a .38
They be buckin on niggaz in these last days
But thanks for the fun
Can't stay focused, causin ruckus
The devil done play with the Earth like a puppet
Now we all in fucked shit
That's why silence is necessary don't tell 'em who you are by far
Don't you tell them...who you are

If you made an offer I would strip you to the skin
Are you trying to forget?
I'm still making love to it
Are you having some regret?
I don't even want to know

You're selling me, you're selling me, you're selling me
Disinegrating
Into the light
Disinegrating
I'm counting your lies
Manipulated
Cast me aside
Disinegrating
I'm losing myself this time
All you little playthings so hard to understand
Send me to the test tube where your innocence began
So be careful when you pray
Chasing every word you say
Do you really want to know
All is here to beg and borrow
Chorus
Feeling so infected by everything you do
Looking unaffected, nothing I can do for you
Do you really think I care
That you sit around and stare?
Have you anything to do?
Does everything cave in around you?

Hold my head down under
Wading
You touch what you can't feel
You ought to break my silence
You know you have too much to loose
You think that you're so homely
You think your breaking me in two

In misery

Your still here
Am I still here?

Gray Matter,"Self denial fall apart
Follow mind follow heart
When I talk I wanna scream
All I know and all I've seen

Self contains, so tightly packed
Once it’s loose no holding back
All I need is in my mind
And the walls will fall in time

After months of senseless sleeping
Things were moving I was creeping
And it felt like time was ending
All the staircases descending

Like a broken mirror image
Wondering what I have a heart for
Still waiting for departure
And the world just keeps a-moving

And they all juts keep a-marching
On the way towards there solution
On a walk without confusion
Just avoiding stalled existence

And I looked up then to deceit

And flickers like a candle

Forever stays the same

In a life not long ago

To a girl I loved
And rooms I remember
Just like a ghost who is lost
I'm wandering through

With a thousand joys and sorrows

In the darkness, ever softly
She slipped on by
Down in the field
At the four roads crossing
I watched the flashing
Last blue stars of the fireflies
I stood there on the ground
Where my ancestors lay sleeping
In this land
They lived and loved
Now they dream in the rain
Life comes and goes
And flickers like a candle
Still the spirit of love
Forever stays the same
Oh Lord, yes it does
Forever stays the same",North Ohio,2010

I'm goin' down east
I'm goin' under
Gonna fill my boots
With the rain & thunder
From Ammonoosuc
Down to Chicopee
I'm gonna ride this river

Y'see, my grandpa
He's a half Pequot
Scrapin' a livin'
From a lobster pot
He was raised
By the mooncussers
Methodist deacons
Them turkey buzzards
Grew a family
Of his own
Put down roots
In a field of stone

It's been hardscrabble
Since the mill shut down
But I'm a barnacle
On the edge of town

Grayson Sanders,"We can feel it, when we wake up 
We're all traveling,
'Cause tonight we're sitting around the table 
The holiday when we're able 
To raise a Coke in celebration 
Telling stories of the days when these friends were all that we could see 
And now our faces gather once again to light the tree
'Cause we know this Christmas

It's something in the air, something in the air 
Something that keeps us together 
Stronger as we share, we came from everywhere 
But tonight we all come together
Music, familiar face 
We can't stop the love that keeps us in one place 
There's something in the air, something in the air 
It's Christmas in the air that keeps us together

We moved off to different places 
To the west and to the east but 
It's funny how things they never change 
We can go a hundred different ways and stay the same

It's Christmas, our vacation 
Made a wish, crossed a nation 
Now we are reunited, we can act young
Singing songs we always sung

It's something in the air, something in the air 
Something that keeps us together 
Stronger as we share, we came from everywhere 
But tonight we all come together
Music, familiar face 
We can't stop the love that keeps us in one place 
There's something in the air, something in the air 
It's Christmas in the air that keeps us together

We just remembered all the reasons 
To keep connected through the seasons 
We got the power of the North Pole 
Building bigger hearts and bigger souls

Something in the air, something in the air 
Something that keeps us together 
Stronger as we share, we came from everywhere 
But tonight we all come together 
Music, familiar face 
We can't stop the love that keeps us in one place 
There's something in the air, something in the air 
It's Christmas in the air that keeps us together
Keeps us together
It's Christmas in the air that keeps us together",Something in the Air (Coca-Cola Christmas Anthem),2012
Grazia Di Michele,"Sono gli amori insensati
A dare un senso alla vita
A questa musica fragile
Tra le tue dita

A queste dolci oscenità
In una notte che ci somiglia
A questo cercare rime
Rubarle tra le tue ciglia
Tra le tue ciglia

Sono gli amori insondabili
A rivelarci la vita
Questo cercarsi per sempre
Questa sorpresa infinita
Le tue lame di verità
E il manto gelido d'inverno
Che ti porti sulle spalle
E che ti fa scappare
Da un sogno così bello

Sono gli amori diversi
Quelli che restano dentro
E che vorresti cullare
Sentirli cantare
E fermarli nel tempo

Sono gli amori più intensi
Quelli che restano dentro
E non riesci a scordare
E che fanno più male
Gli amori come te

Sono gli amori improvvisi
Ad indicarci la strada
In quella buia tempesta
Di desiderio e di attesa
A farci brillare gli occhi
Di quella luce così vera
E a sussurrare parole
Al fuoco dell'intesa
Al fuoco dell'intesa

Sono gli amori diversi
Quelli che restano dentro
E che vorresti cullare
Sentirli cantare
E fermarli nel tempo
Sono gli amori più intensi
Quelli che restano dentro
E non riesci a scordare
E che fanno più male
Gli amori come te

Grease,"Summer loving had me a blast
Summer loving happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy cute as can be
Summer days drifting away to oh oh the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far
Tell me more, tell me more
Like does he have a car

She swam by me she got a cramp
He swam by me got my suit damp
I saved her life she nearly drown
He showed off splashing around
Summer sun something's begun but oh oh the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?

Took her bowling in the arcade
We went strolling drank lemonade
We made out under the dock
We stayed out till ten o'clock
Summer fling don't mean a thing but oh oh the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more
Cause he sounds like a drag

He got friendly holding my hand
She got friendly down in the sand
He was sweet just turned eightteen
Well she was good you know what I mean
Summer heat boy and girl meet but oh oh the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?

It turned colder that's where it ends
So I told her we'd still be friends
Then we made our true love vow
Wonder what she's doing now

My papa said everything's alright

With her stomach bouncing all around

When I was three I pushed a plow
While chopping wood I moved my legs
I started dancing when I gathered eggs
