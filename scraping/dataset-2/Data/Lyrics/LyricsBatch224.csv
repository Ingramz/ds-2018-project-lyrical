Alex Hoyer,"Te vi con tus chicas caminando en la calle
Nuestros ojos se chocaron, no existía nadie
Dime si soy yo o sientes magia en el aire
Pásame tu número y te llamo más tarde

Y viéndote en la calle ese día así
Quién sabía que te movías así
Perdona que me acerque tanto así
Échamelo aquí

Y viéndote en la calle ese día así
Quién sabía que te movías así
Perdona que me acerque tanto así
Échamelo aquí

Ella es como nadie de aquí
Ella quema cuando toca
Ella tiene fire, fuego
Ella es una bomba

Ella es como el sol de Madrid
Ella arde y provoca
Ella tiene fire, fuego
Ella es una bomba (bomba)

Normalmente no caigo por una pícara sonrisa
Tienes algo más que una cara muy bonita
Todo el mundo admira tu figura linda
Pero creo que tú puedes ser la que cambie mi vida

Y viéndote en la calle ese día así
Quién sabía que te movías así
Perdona que me acerque tanto así
Échamelo aquí

Alex Hoyer,"Hey tú dime como estas
Han sido varios meses ya
Flotando en esta obscuridad

Ya no puedo mas
Pensé que me ibas a llamar
Fui un tonto no debí esperar
Mi orgullo se hizo soledad

Todo sale mal
Extraño recorrer lo mas oculto de tu piel
Tus labios al amanecer ya no están
Extraño poder sentir

Cada lunar pintado en ti
Tus ojos hoy en mi ya no están
Miente
Dime que me quieres

Que sin mi no puedes
Dar un paso mas
Miente
Finge que te duele

Que sin mi te mueres
Y no hay nadie mas
Miénteme deja me creer
Miénteme a un que estas en él
Miénteme por ultima ves

Aposté y perdí todo tu amor
No se si él jugo termino
Atándome a la ilusion
Me dejo llevar

Extraño recorrer lo mas oculto de tu piel
Tus labios al amanecer ya no están
Extraño poder sentir cada lunar pintado en ti
Tus ojos hoy en mi ya no están

Miente
Dime que me quieres
Que sin mi no puedes
Dar un paso mas

Miente finge que te duele
Que sin mi te mueres
Y no hay nadie mas
Miénteme

Déjame creer
Miénteme
Aún que estés con el
Miénteme por ultima vez c'mon

Miente dime que me quieres
Que sin mi no puedes
Dar un paso mas

Alex John,"All this time I’m running
Search to find your loving
What’s life without that something
In my mind it feels like nothing

What’s its take to find, a love inside my mind
What it takes to hold, a heart worth more than gold.

(Cus I know) I know you feel the pain
(When I go) and leave in pouring rain
(You scream) cus u know that I’m the same
(And I know) its just electric pain.
(Cus I know), I know you feel the insane
(When I go) and leave in pouring rain
(You scream) cus u know that I’m the same
(And i know) its just electric pain

I’m searching for a soul,
In a world where maps aren’t sold.
Trying to find a day,
where life will show the way.
cus I don’t know 

What’s it takes to find, a love inside my mind
What’s it takes to hold, a heart worth more than gold.

(Cus I know,) I know you feel the pain
(When I go) and leave in pouring rain
(You scream) cause u know that I’m the same
(And i know) its just electric pain
(Cus I know), I know you feel the insane
(When I go) and leave in pouring rain
(You scream) cause u know that I’m the same
(And i know) its just electric pain

Electric pain

(Cus I know;) I know you feel the pain

Alex John,"Inside me i stayed trying, Hurts to say I’m dying 
Tears if I was crying At first it was a phase 
 I hate to see you go I never want to know 
Why you left me burned, At first it was phase

Up and walked away Like I made you stay
Inside I cared for you, Outside ur nothing new 
First it was phase, up and walked away 
Now you are no more, Nothing but the door 

I feel the sky is turning round 
I feel my world flipped upside down
I see you here then your over there
You say its true then you never cared 
the sky its falling down 
The sky its falling down
Every time you’re not around 
The sky its falling down

I hate to see you go Its like you’ve never showed 
Never cared to grow ,at first it was phase
Turned your back on me Love after a week
then decide to leave, I know its not a phase

Up and walked away Like I made you stay
Inside I cared for you, Outside ur nothing new 
First it was phase, up and walked away 
Now you are no more, Nothing but the door 

I feel the sky is turning round 
I feel my world flipped upside down
I see you here then your over there
You say its true then you never cared 
the sky its falling down 
The sky its falling down
Every time you’re not around 
The sky its falling down


If it really was just in the sky, 
Would you tell the truth or would you lie.
Could you be in love and then not deny.
Teach the world what it takes to fly.

Alex Kallao,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,
Alex Kallao,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1956
Alex Kallao,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1956
Alex Kapranos,"Where's the love
Where's the love
Where's the love

'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

Hey look kids you need to change your tune
That avenue you traveling unraveling soon
You'll be battling doom but does it matter to you
Worried 'bout who was laughing at you
Your appearance is more important than what's really real
'Cause here it is situation's bad not meaning good
A lot be in the hood that got me with
Nowhere to put my trust in no discussion
Spontaneous combustion
Lust and greed if you ain't up to speed
You's a duck in need
Cats ain't got enough to eat
So there's bluffs and beef
Chicks up the street
That tricks come to see
Guns under the sheets
Shells pummel your meat
Forgetting former, still
Dude you're sorta chill sitting on bout forty mill
But his whole quart'll get spilled
Over those sort of deals
That get you sorta killed or up in court looking for appeals

'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

So down I want to go
So cold I have to go
So down I need to go
So cold as I go

Yo what up fam
You don't know who I am
Last week you was acting like you was my man
But you wasn't hey
Served you're purpose dog
At the end of the day
Is it worth it all
Immersed in all the worth the world got to offer
But perpetrating proper like nothing can stop ya
Can't even trust my doctor she in it for profit
And everybody looking for some kind of profit
Situation mad toxic my man got hit
'Cause the bird he was with wouldn't stop squawking
She juggling five cats and they all lost in
The illusion of love that she used for profit
The usual topic chickens and benjamins
You supposed to be my kin Mexican or Asian European or Korean or Jamaican
Makes no difference
Our existence is still shared between us in essence

Yes the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

Show some love for your brothers and sisters
Show some love for the whole wide world
Show some love for your enemies and frenemies
Show some love for the rejects on the street
Show some love for the whole wide world

'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

If the world is bad refer to your dad
And his before four score what's the reason he saw for
Karma is real part of the deal when's how you started the deal
'Cause everything is 360
It will start the cartwheel
And snowballs so don't forget now cause I told y'all
Dead the 'cause all it do is hold y'all captive
All in the world you're trapped in
Relaxing you can't feel what's happening
I deal with facts man
I was at the crossroads dealing with lost souls that couldn't cross though
Lost hope off dope
Out to jostle
Any unweary traveler that would fall the talk show
It's foul how they play it
But you can't stray to show love take
Courage and strength and realize we ain't sure as we think you know

The world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
Yes the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

So down I want to go
So cold I have to go
So down I need to go
So cold as I go

'Cause the world's gone crazy
Even though love no more
Show love, show love, show show love
Show love, show love, show love

Catch the skulls of a children, frozen and dismal
Coming with me
Creature, kill in name of Hell
The black mess is started, life's will terminate
With the wrath of the demons started the genocide

It's a good thing or it's bad,

That saved a wretch like me

How precious did that grace appear

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home,

Time to close your eyes.
And save these questions for another day.
I think I know what you've been asking me.
I think you know what I've been trying to say.
I promise I would never leave you.
And you should always know, I never will be far away.

Goodnight my angel, now it's time to sleep.
And still so many things I want to say.
Remember all the songs you sang for me.
When we went sailing on a emerald bay.
And like a boat out on the ocean.
I'm rocking you to sleep.

The water is dark and deep inside this mother's heart.
You'll always be a part of me.
Goodnight my angel, now it's time to dream.
And dream how wonder your life will be.
Some day a child may cry and if you sing this lullaby.
Then in your heart there will always be a part of me.",You'll Be In My Heart,2010
Alex Leonard,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

And people declare ""You're through!"",

I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

You can start today

Reaching out tonight
It's the mode and mould were breaking

",Stand Down,2005
Alex Lloyd,"I got pictures of you that I'm still looking through
I got no place to be, if you still needing me

I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you
I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you

Do you find it too hard
Is it just way too scarred
Are we still looking through
To the life we once knew

I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you
I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you


I'm still feeling the same
I'm still playing your game

I got pictures of you, that I'm still looking through

I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you
I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting for you

I'm still feeling the same
I'm still playing the game
I'm still waiting for you
When they whispered your name
All the pleasure and pain
I'm still waiting for you

",Still Waiting,2005
Alex Lloyd,"Falling on your, broken bones 
Hitch a ride to, get you home 
Stormy road and rocky path 
Every step we, take a chance 

Cause in your heart and in your mind 
Sometimes lost now sometimes blind 
Well it's sometimes blind 

See the wonder of it all 
Take a breath before it falls 
The wonder, the wonder of it all 
The wonder of it all 

Innocence wasn't meant to fail 
Stretched it out on a bed of nails 
All your rights and all your wrongs 
What it meant now to belong 

Cause in your heart and in your mind 
Sometimes lost now sometimes blind 
Well it's sometimes blind 

See the wonder of it all 
What we had and lost before 
The wonder, the wonder of it all the wonder of it all 

Did you see the wonder like a crash of thunder 
It's the spell we're under now 
The wonder the wonder of it all 

See the wonder of it all 
What we had and lost before, 
See the wonder of it all

I keep on bring me down
Thinking of the way you used to feel
Dreaming about your face
Thinking of another place

I'm still thinking about you

A cold wave was coming
Time to run now or never more

So come out of the storm why don't you babe
Tell me that you love me that your love won't' change
'Cause the winds blowing now gonna turn into a hurricane

So come into my heart why don't you babe
Show me what you got if you need me today
'Cause the winds coming now gonna blow into a hurricane

In an old broken down forgotten place
Up on high ground where
The flood wouldn't drown us

On your shoulder out the storm I rode
We were waiting for morning
To make our getaway...

In time, then I'd rearrange just a day or two;

Alex Mills,"Back in the day when I was a teenager,
Me jet n joe used to play with danger
I remember when danny mo'catee was a stranger
Boiz in bitteez used to shot with a pager
Gods gift was pepsi and milk were'nt major
I was on front line before I used the big razor
I was a raver cocky little fader
Now I feel blue lights solid gone savour
I got fun, feelings good and bad memories
Times moved on but I got the same enemies
Goin' all out to a snitch ad 2 tell a me
That was in the past now I spit like venomy
Change what ya like but the bad name stays
Lifes to short to be setting your ways
Whatever happened to the good old days?
Those care free days I remember the days!

[Chorus]
I remember when we were young
Your askin to touch you nooooo you nooooo
Memories in life in time my life was on the line
Iv grown I grown ... yeeeee ye yeee

I remember the days I used to be on the street
And no, we can't still survive on the street
You wanted to no, so I'm telling you that life on the
Street can be an eye-opener, I'm watching doors
Open up. Before none of this seemd possible everything
Was impossible didn't stop I was flexible with the hours
And now I'm flexible with the powers I'm strong minded
Some are empty minded troops get divided
They started off as friends and then they collided
I started off at home but now we're separated you see
The loving that we both appreciated it. Before I
Remember when I couldnt leave this chick, I used
To cheat n ting, make hesky beat n ting,
Go home n ave a arguement creating heat n ting!
And then I'm off again I'm tryin'a leave the past behind
Me, I want to live in a place where nobody can find
Me!

[Chorus]

I remember dem dayz when I was coming up
Little kid on the rise with the heiness in d eyez
No surprise dat us kids were searchin for sutin more
The different music dat we be sellin' in every store
Back den the days were different the blocks were dark
And evil! Ma line ejak the sequal but das d uk
Version! Hargon was needed to survive on the streetz!
Ya had 2 stay above the water 2 be	 runnin wit ya lete!
School told me to hustle n hustle dat was the code!
The education and stuff had to be put on hold!
You could find me in the smokers corner flippin some coins
Or find me in the cafeteria gettin' double serloins!
I was a little balla balla shud've gone all the way!
Wasn't dedicated, loose canon led me astray!
In ma first move from a little mini coopey
No lay lay coming bak yer bak in the day!

Oh! why must my heart keep on singing it?

You're lost in time
As I start to fly now
Your soul is mine
I'll be just fine

I soared up
Got swallowed out of touch

You're out of reach
My darling
You're safe in sleep
Could I leave you
Step by step?
You're out my reach
I felt pain once
Put you out of touch
Put you out of touch

I apologize
Feel tears, no surprise

You're out of reach

Alex Parks,"It's too easy 
To say that nothing feels right
I can make some lame excuse 
Say I'll be better tonight
I can let you go on thinking 
That it's something you've done
But it's nothing between us
There's no guilty one

[Chorus]
But there are sometimes
There's no way to explain
And there's no rhyme or reason
For the way that I'm feeling this pain 
I just get so emotional
So emotional
When there's no way off the floor
And there's no one else's door
To lay the blame

Keep my eyes close
My tears weren't meant to be seen
I'm fragile like a small bird
Caught in the wind

And I can't bear to pretend
Anymore to anyone
It's just one of those days
And there's no guilty one

You laid it bold, I am told of you
You show me, I want you

My body weeps for you
Sweeter and sweeter
Trembling but still I stole my breath and you

I fell with ease onto
Your floor, you're there
Embrace me
Its like you knew

[Chorus]

I listen hard, we'd be the same
I realize the point of my life

So close I won't let go, I don't want to

Alex Rostotsky,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2000
Alex Rostotsky,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2000

Of angriness and greed
Of dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen
My dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
Now I spend my time
Looking all around
For a man that's nowhere
To be found,
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
Gonna travel round

Cos I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeh I'm a wrathchild

Some say it shouldn't matter
Ain't nothing gonna alter
The course of my destination
But I know I've gotta find
Some seriaus peace of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy

Alex Skolnick Trio,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

But I just handed my pinball crown to him.

About old Lost John
Lost John was a boy that got loose
From a chain gang down in Louisiana

About sixteen bloodhound, took in after him
Sheriffs, deputies
And everybody else in the county
Chasin' him all across the swamp

Lost John outrun the bloodhounds there
All night long, it was long towards mornin'
He looked up to the tree there
And seen the lights from a house

He didn't know whether the people inside
Was friends or were enemies
So he wanted to go up to the house
So, and asked if he could stay there
To get away from the bloodhounds

He was afraid if he did go up there
That the people might set their dogs
Barking at him or shoot him down
With a Winchester riffle

And brother, let us throw our lot out upon the sea

Then you can miss me when I'm gone

She wanted to be my bride
She said, settle on down, traveling man
You can stay right by my side
I tried so hard to please her
But I couldn't hold out too long
'Cause one Saturday night I was laying in bed
And I heard that highway song

Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again

Now one of these days that highway song will lose its appeal to me
I'm gonna settle on down like a natural born man
I'm gonna live my life naturally (Free and easy)
Until that day the thunder's gonna roll
And I notice there's a sign of rain
So I grab my bags and I pack my clothes

And I will have a game on the coconut shy
And win a prize even if it's rigged
I won't know when to stop
And you can leave off my lid, and I won't even lose my fizz
I'll be the polka dots type

I'll probably swim through a few lagoons
I'll have a spring in my step
And I'll get there soon
To sing you a happy tune, tomorrow

And you better bring a change of clothes
So we can sail our laughing pianos along a beam of light
But I'm quite alright

Alex Turner,"It's like you're trying to get to heaven in a hurry,
And the queue was shorter than you thought it would be,
And the doorman says,
You need to get a wristband.

You got a lift between the pitfalls,
But you're looking like your low on energy,
Did you get out and walk,
To ensure you'd miss the quicksand?

Looking for a new place to begin,
Feeling like it's hard to understand,
But as long as you still keep peppering the pill,
You'll find a way to spit it out again.

And even when you know the way it's gonna blow,
It's hard to get around the wind.

Stretching out the neck on your evening,
Trying to even out some deficits,
But it's sabertooth multi-ball confusion.

And you can shriek until you're hollow,
Or whisper it the other way,
Trying to save the youth without putting your shoes on.

Looking for a new place to begin,
Feeling like it's hard to understand,
But as long as you still keep peppering the pill,
You'll find a way to spit it out again.

And even when you know the way it's gonna blow,
It's hard to get around the wind.

I can hear you through my window,
But I'm never quite sure who is who,
But they want the world on a dessert spoon.

It always sounds like they're fighting,
Or if that's what they are about to do,
It might not hurt now but it's gonna hurt soon.",It's Hard to Get Around the Wind,2011
Alex Turner,"I etched the face of a stopwatch
On the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

I heard an unhappy ending
It sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning

You look like you've been for breakfast at the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Mysteries flashing amber go green
When you answer but the red on the rest
Of the questionnaire never changes

I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz

Who's gonna sit and sing to you
About stars, girl

But last night I looked up into
The dark half of the blue
And they'd gone backwards

Something in your magnetism
Must have pissed them off
Forcing them to get an early night

I have been searching from
The bottom to the top
For such a sight
As the one I caught when I saw your

Fingers dimming in the lights
Like you're used to being told that you're trouble
And I spent all night
Stuck on the puzzle

Nobody I asked
Knew how he came to be the one
To whom you surrendered

Any man who wasn't led away
Into the other room
Stood pretending

That something in your magnetism
Hadn't just made him drop
Whoever's hand it was that he was holding

Isn't it time we hit the road?
Oh, you want me, that's all you need to know
Wish you were mine, I got to go

Isn't it finer in mono?
Oh you feel me, I rim from head to toe.
You say goodbye I say hello.

Oh you know, that's how it goes
Oh you know, that vertigo

Get your loving on the low
Don't you know ya give me that vertigo

Strictly stick shift witchcraft
She's miss been there, did that.
Bought the cat suit
I'm not used to raising the roof then telling the truth
I thought I wasn't but I was losing my mind
When she showed me how the night was supposed to sound
I realized that then whenever I shut my eyes

Well there she offered, looking like a million dollars
In a briefcase or a duffle bag by high noon tomorrow
Just make sure you're not followed
And since you're such a stunner
Send her something sunset coloured
Let's make love to one another
Run for Cover.

Oh you know, that's how it goes
Oh you know, that vertigo
Oh you know, honey
Get your loving on the low
Don't you know ya give me that vertigo

Oh you need me, a cancer from the sky
Burning up life, too cool to die.
Oh you move me, crescendos cuff the link
She is on the verge, I'm on the brink.

What's the line, where's your mind, what's it for?
What's the time, did you find what you're dying for?
What's the night, where's the light from the door?
What's the life, where's the knife you keep hiding for?
Where's the rhyme from the lines on before?
Was it mine, just the kind you've been fighting for?

Some RX, are you next, are you more?
Where's my mind, what's that knock on the door?

Oh you know, that's your M.O.

Oh you know, honey, get your loving on the low

Que nos quieran abatir sembrar en tus ojos mi mirada

Lo que la vida no nos da en su realidad
Salgo de casa, busco algo nuevo

Que no soy yo, me siento mas, why puedo volar
Why no encontraré nada similar un dia normal, oh, no
Que no soy yo, me siento mas, why puedo volar
Why no encontraré nada similar un dia normal, oh, no

Conseguiria ahogar mis penas en el mar

Why no saben todavia por donde van a empezar

Limpia un poco su fracaso, y sus ganas de llorar

“…si supieras, vida mía, el día que nos espera”
Y en su realidad verá crecer la ciudad
Y sus gentes en sus mundos irán y vendrán
Mientras ella, en su papel, seguirá viendo pasar
Otro día menos en su vida, otro día más

A mirar el corazón, y jamás mirar a tras
Pero a veces la injusticia se hace con todo el control

Una madrugada, cielo de cristal
Alguien me enseñó la realidad
Un mundo que escapa para no reventar

Somos como barcos de papel mojado
Navegando en medio de un amanecer nublado
Esperando que la luna nos rescate
Fabricando una atmósfera de aire

Voy a construir una ciudad
Para que podamos escapar
De esta niebla gris que viene detrás
Antes de que sea tarde
Antes de que sea tarde

Cuando me largué escuche una voz
Un pájaro sin alas me decía adiós
Yo me pregunte si en el guión
Alguien nos depara un futuro mejor

Somos como aviones de cristal de murano
Que se rompen al aterrizar, en mil pedazos
Esperando que la luna nos rescate

Me iluminó tu amor inmenso fuera y dentro

Créeme y verás
No acabará, más

Tengo un deseo escrito en alto que vuela ya
Mi pensamiento no depende de mi cuerpo

Créeme esta vez
Créeme porque
Me harí­a daño ahora, ya lo sé

Hay gran espacio y tú y yo
Cielo abierto que ya
No se cierra a los dos
Pues sabemos lo que es necesidad

Ví­veme sin miedo ahora
Que sea una vida o sea una hora
No me dejes libre aquí­ desnudo
Mi nuevo espacio que ahora es tuyo, te ruego
Ví­veme sin más vergüenza
Aunque esté todo el mundo en contra
Deja la apariencia y toma el sentido
Y siente lo que llevo dentro

Y te transformas en un cuadro dentro de mí­
Que cubre mis paredes blancas y cansadas

Créeme esta vez
Créeme porque
Me harí­a daño una y otra vez

Sí­, entre mi realidad
Hoy yo tengo algo más
Que jamás tuve ayer
Necesitas vivirme un poco más

No me dejes libre aquí­ desnudo

Es tu guión

En la penumbra de un jardín tan extraño
Cae la tarde why me olvidé otra vez
De tomar una determinación
Esperando un eclipse
Me quedaré
Persiguiendo un enigma
Al compás de las horas
Dibujando una elipse
Me quedaré
Entre el sol why mi corazón
Junto al estanque me atrapó la ilusión
Escuchando el lenguaje de las plantas
Why he aprendido a esperar sin razón
Soy metálico en el Jardín Botánico
Con mi pensamiento sigo el movimiento
De los peces en el agua

En la penumbra de un jardín tan extraño

El tesoro que tanto busqué 
Ya no me asusta pensar 
En lo que pueda pasar 
Nunca deje de creer en tu amor

Llevo en la memoria aquel momento especial

Alex Ubago,"Intento adivinar como seras 
Si tendrán tus ojos la intensidad 
De los de mama 
Tengo una sensación que no puedo explicar 
Se queda pequeño llamarlo felicidad 

Y te esperare con la puerta abierta 
Para que tu puedas pasar y sentirte 
Uno mas de esta fiesta y 
Al fin llegaras rompiendo el silencio 
Cruzando a la vida traerás un sol 
Diferente a este invierno 

Llena mi corazon de esto que es mas que amor 
Y que provoca en mi las ganas de vivir 
Llena cada rincón de nuestra habitación 
Con ese aroma a ti para aprenderte y aprender 
A ser feliz 

Quien sabe si seré tu ejemplo mejor 
Es un tanto extraño ver en el espejo que me 
Hice mayor 

Y te esperare con la puerta abierta para que tu puedas pasar y
Sentirte uno mas de esta fiesta 
Y al fin llegaras borrando mis miedos 
Cruzando a la vida seras el ángel que cumpla mis sueños

Y que provoca en mi las ganas de vivir 
Llena cada rincón de nuestra habitación 
Con ese aroma a ti 
Para aprenderte y aprender a ser feliz

Y tu darás un nuevo sentido a mi vida 
Cerrando así viejas heridas 
Y poniendo el futuro a mis pies",Para Aprenderte,2012
Alex Ubago,"Hay veces que miro el camino que he dejado atrás
Hay veces que toca pensar si seguir o parar
Hay días de lluvia y de sol, hay días que falta el amor
Se lo saca

Hay veces que rompe mi calma la inseguridad
Hay veces que no se muy bien si decir o callar
Hay días de frío y calor, hay días que falta valor
Se lo saca, se lo saca

Pero puedes ser tú, puedes ser tú
Pueden ser tantas cosas
Puede que sea mejor no pensar 
Y solo seguir soñando

Puede ser una cruz
O puede ser una gota en el mar
Pero de todas las gotas del mar
Puedes ser tú

Hay tantas primeras semanas que he visto pasar
Y tantos finales felices que acaban un mal
Y quiero que me hagas sufrir, y un poco yo hacértelo a ti

Cierro los ojos y veo tus labios, tus labios diciendo que sí
Sin darnos cuenta pasaban las horas y nadie miraba el reloj
Y fue el amanecer, el que nos sorprendió
Besándonos

Pero el tiempo es un tren que persigue un destino y el nuestro llego a su estación
Soy un pasajero sangrando su historia en los versos de esta canción
Ya no me importa quien tuvo la culpa el dolor que yo siento es igual
Sin una explicación, dejaste de respirar
El aire de mis sueños

Y ahora que aprendo a convivir con el silencio
Que vuelvo a ser feliz con lo que tengo
Ahora es cuando quieres regresar
Recuerda te fuiste y me dejaste sin tus besos
Olvidas que yo soy de carne y hueso
Y que para mí no es fácil olvidar

Y es cierto que a veces algun sentimiento aún me pregunta por ti
Y cada noche tu aroma en la almohada le digo que ya te perdí
Y es que me siento cansado del juego, ese juego de nunca saber
Y dejo tras de mi huellas de un día más
En esta soledad

Y ahora que aprendo convivir con el silencio
Que vuelvo a ser feliz con lo que tengo
Ahora es cuando quieres regresar
Recuerda te fuiste y me dejaste sin tus besos
Olvidas que yo soy de carne y hueso
Y que para mí no es fácil olvidar

De una vez mi corazón dice que no me voy a arrepentir

Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner,1972

So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours

Asking me for money, I'm a blow it like I'm Hootie
Buffalo, where you find me, throwing Bills like I'm Flutie
She a product of the nineties, I'm a show her like I'm Truman, ooh
'Fore the night is over, she will beso me, muah
Got your girlfriend so obsessed with me, that Cecily strong
Making all of these bangers for girls who look like Topanga
Who grew up in Staten Island, banging 36 Chambers
Ya listening to history in the making now
Trying to retire at thirty with a vacation house
That money funny like Jefferson on a twenty
Ivy League like I'm hangin' out with Beyoncé and Jeezy now
Swaggin', I can see you impress
She on her knees and she ain't trying to confess
Save me the stress, ya girl already say I'm the best
She came to my show just to get my name on her chest

She call 9-1-1
Tell the operator she ain't lookin' for a player
We can have some fun
We could be together from now until whenever
Just call me up
And I'll put out the fire that be burning inside
We can roll in my ride and make the sirens go off
She make the sirens go ff

Okay, working 'cause I love it, do it for my people
Words are like my ammo, bang, bang, reload
Watch me as I freak flows, ball hard on these beats though
Used to take the bus, now I whip it like I'm Devo
Nowadays we sittin' court side at every Knicks game
Close enough to go and hand Carmelo my mixtape
Models in my phone book, bout to make a mistake
Tell'em spread the love like we living in the sixties
My friends say that my life is like a movie dog
I'm bangin' actress after actress like they groupies dog
She think I'm James Bond, you just an afterthought
These rappers beggin' for any song in my catalog
Working nine-to-five, but the opposite
Killing it so much, they bout to build me a monument
Tell her ""we can do it in the dorm room of your colleges
And she can rock my mothafucking world or earn an scholarship

Sippin' in a text, I got your bitch in it, don't mention it
Those who want the D and I appreciate the sentiment
Can't afford to own it, I'm just leasing it and renting it
'Cause I am not cuffing shit, I am not no odd boy
I'm more like a hot boy, Gucci leather socks boy
Fin dripping in the kitchen whippin' up the box toy
I get it for the low, I bet you get it for a lot boy
Last night at the Trump towers taking drunk showers
At the airport, they went through my bag and found a bunch of weed that was not ours
If it's not reeking than it's not sour
Smoke in her face, you don't need a vase for these bouquet, then buy flowers

Carry a cane around, and wear a grey wig.

And talk about the little ones.

One by one the neighbors' lights come on.
Our October day is almost gone.

I know the border lines we drew between us
Keep the weapons down,
Keep the wounded safe,
I know our antebellum innocence
Was never meant to see the light of our armistice day.

In the spring,
We climbed the rolling hills
And talked about our budding plans.
And we smiled,
Our faces like a mirror
Showing us our secret sides.
But then the fights
The sharp words splintering the night,
How I couldn't be what you'd need
But oh how I could make you bleed

I know the border lines we drew between us
Keep the weapons down,
Keep the wounded safe
I know our antebellum innocence
Was never meant to see the light of our armistice.
But how much would I give to have it back again?
How much did we lose
To live this way?

As all the walls come tumbling down

Alex Woodard,"Highway One, late July, you took a picture beneath that auburn sky.
And I've been wondering why that summer's end always meant goodbye.
I never thought about it. I worked my way around it.
But tucked away one December day

I found a black and White photograph.
I am smiling in the summer sun.
Life was turning around so fast.
I found a black and white.

Now I ain't seen you in years.
But I'd be first in line to dry your tears, if you needed a friend.
Theres only one love left in the end.
Sometimes I think about it.
I always live without it.
I want the days I can't relive.

On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.

Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing",Good King Wenceslas,1993

Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign.

But his mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.

Bref, l’on y part, un jour de cafard…

Au milieu des gueus’s, des proscrits,
Des émigrants aux cœurs meurtris ;

Mon tabac et mon bistro du coin ?

Où sont-ils les amis, les copains ?
Où sont-ils tous mes vieux bals musette ?
Leur javas au son d’l’accordéon ?
Où sont-ils tous mes r’pas sans galette ?

Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar

With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
Stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

'Cause I knew it's goin' to be a long day
Fired my truck up, grabbed my coffee
Kissed my baby, got on my way

That's the only way to make an honest day's pay
So I'm workin' even when it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's wage

Yeah, I'm up early with the birdies, ready to get dirty
This ain't a song for you if you asleep at 7:30
I rise like the sun; I'm the bag of the pounds
A full throttle in the bottle like that home-made shine

I'm just tryin' to make a livin', boss man trippin'
My overtime's strong; I don't pay him no attention
Money in the mason jar, country boy pension
No lady, three kids, take a lot to fill the kitchen

Fingernails dirty, my back stay hurtin'
You can bet I got to play for every penny that I'm earnin'
I ain't askin' for a raise, but I know the boss heard me
Nobody on this job site's workin' like I'm workin'

Thirty below to a hundred degrees
You ain't pushin' hard enough if your hands don't bleed
I'm the first to clock in and the last to leave

So I'm workin' even when it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's wage

I'm out the door by the sun up, focused on the come-up
We never sleep in, that ain't how we was brought up
I push it to the limit when the money gets low
And been known to work past when the plant whistle blows

Pay check feelin' like a lottery ticket
I might save a couple bucks if my kids don't spend it
It don't matter cause I love it every day of my life
Spent more time on the clock than I do with my wife

State to state, never late, puttin' miles on the road
Drop it off, fill it up, get me to my next load
Call my old lady, let her know I'll be late
And I ain't worry cause I know that she goin' to save me a plate

I told you
Thirty below to a hundred degrees
You ain't pushin' hard enough if your hands don't bleed

Of a wintry fairy land.

And comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be,
Let's take that road before us,
And sing a chorus or two,

For a sleigh ride together with you.

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray,
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day,
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop,
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop; Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in this world can buy,
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie,
It'll nearly be like a picture print

We remember all through our lives!

Let's go, let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up,
It's grand, just holding your hand,
We're riding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy,
And comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be,
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two,
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride,1988

And when I'm wit cha it's like I don't want to leave again
Without you listen I don't want to breathe again
You give me a lot and everyday you giving more
So there's no need to tell you who or what I'm living for
I miss ya very much shit I miss ya every touch
And I know you'd come through for me in the clutch
I'm on the road with my peeps and I know I'm moving
But yet the time we spend together that's so soothing
Love it how we do shit I pour a drink for ya
You pour a drink for me and always think of me
I call you when you when I'm home I know you bored and all alone
I want to come and scope you up and place you in the zone

I made a change, my love to you I'm giving all of mine
Send you cards in the mail to show you that I care
Shit a life without you is the only thing I fear
So I'm a make sure a nigga hold it down for

But you know the drama gotta keep a nigga running
I bugged out with the crew it's only you I'm wanting
Call you on the horn to hear you on the other end

This one's personal so keep it close to you
Be there for each other that's what we supposed to do
And anything you want I make sure you get it
And anything you into babygirl you know I'm wit it
Holla when you ready for me...

And we can go and paint the town or we can stay home
It don't matter what we do as long as I'm wit you
Spend some time wit you, you know what I'm a do
Get it on wit you just like the first time

Without a doubt I'm going all out for wit ya

Un garçon chic et distingué 
Mais je suis chipé pour la pomme 
D'un vrai tordu mal balancé 
Ce n'est pas un Apollon, mon Jules 
Il n'est pas taillé comme un Hercule 
Et même s'il est plein de défauts 
C'est lui que j'ai dans la peau 

Tel qu'il est, il me plaît
Il me fait de l'effet
Et je l'aime

C'est un vrai gringalet
Aussi laid qu'un basset
Mais je l'aime 
Il est bancal
Du coté cérébral 
Mais ça m'est bien égal

S'il a l'air anormal
C'est complet, il est muet
Ses quinquets sont en biais
C'est un fait, tel qu'il est
Il me plaît! 

Il est carré mais ses épaules
Par du carton, sont rembourrées 
Quand il est tout nu ça fait drôle
On n'en voit plus que la moitié
Il n'a pas un seul poil sur la tête
Mais il en a plein sur les gambettes
Et celui qu'il a dans la main
C'est pas du poil c'est du crin

I kinda liked
A girl I knew

I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
Cause I don't care if
I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

We started fighting
Every night
We fell in love
No one else
Could make me sadder
But no one else
Could lift me high above

But suddenly we fell apart

I cannot find her

Alexander Rybak,"13 horses swimming in the sea
Waiting for someone to find them
Their ship is gone
And now they are alone
With water everywhere around them
The men were saved
From the sinking ship
Right before it started to burn
And while they're safe
Their loyal friends need help
Patiently waiting for their turn

13 horses swimming in the sea
They don't even know it's pointless
Their pride remains
But this time it won't help
They used to be so tall
And suddenly they're small
There's a couple waiting far behind
So they will be out of sight
But then who cares?
They're dying anyway
All of them are doomed this night

11 horses swimming in the sea
The sea they fought was just a river
They're used to this
It's probably just a race
That helps to ease their minds
But where's the finish line
The night grows dark
The body wants to rest
It hurts to breathe
And still they do their best
They want to live
No matter for how long
Their thoughts all disappeared
'Cause now they're really scared

7 horses struggling in the sea
Waiting for someone to find them
They don't look back
'cause what's the point of that
There is only death behind them
They cry for help
But help will never come
They don't now where to swim
Or what they're swimming from
They try to swim some more
When panic starts to spread
They're swimming in to shore
But only in their heads

The 3 last horses
Dying in the sea
Shouting out their cries but no one
They're born to win
They're screaming in their hearts
The strength of thousand men
They're fighting to the end

The sun is out
Birds are everywhere
They're flying high
Surfing in the air
It's nice to live
When life is such a blast
One horse that swims
It seems to be the last

The thirteenth horse
Has always been the best
His honour will be proud
But now he wants to rest
He's longing for his home
The girl will give him food
Good boy, she'll say
Together they will play

13 horses swimming in the sea
Soon they will be gone forever
And while they swim,
One thing still remains
And that's the hope that never dies
It never dies
It never dies",13 Horses,2009

I try to lose my faith in you
Saying to myself
You can't be the right one for me

And now that you're gone
I finally get a taste of freedom
Only problem is I don't really want
To be free

I don't wanna be abandoned
I don't want to curse your name
I don't wanna feel the sadness
Pretending that I'm still the same
I don't want to burn your letters
I don't want to face the truth
I don't wanna be abandoned
I don't wanna waste my youth

You try to suffocate with your pretends
And I believe in the shallow romance
I ran for cover but I couldnt hide
And still you try to get me to abide

You scratched me like a perfume and
Erasing all the feelings that I had
And all the time you faked this loneliness
Cause you wouldn't see my twisted mess

I don't wanna be abandoned
I don't want to curse your name

The purpose in me
Sadly I don't know

But I know a magic dolphin
Swimming above the world

No one to lose

Will I ever change

Happiness is free for all
Just treat it like it's keen.

Mature to go wrong.

As she waves so long.

Then mama's words come true
Crying with a broken heart
I was left all blue.

Don't kiss and tell!

Don't kiss and tell!

Love is always for sale

Someone's willing to pay.

Bring me pine logs hither

And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how,
I can go no longer.""

Tread thou in them boldly

Freeze thy blood less coldly.""

Alexander von Schlippenbach,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face

And I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me
An overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones

Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy
She said

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I thought to myself what could that mean
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream
Now, wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one more time:

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl",Spill the Wine,2004

Fue imposible olvidar que algún día yo te quise.

Tanto tiempo pasó desde el día que te fuiste
Ahí yo supe que las despedidas son muy tristes.
Nunca me imagine que un tren se llevara en su viaje
Aquellas ilusiones que de niños nos juramos
Todos tus sentimientos los guardaste en tu equipaje
Quisiste consolarme y me dijiste yo te amo

Desde entonces no supe que sería de tu vida
Desde entonces no supe si algún día regresabas
Los amigos del pueblo preguntaban si volvías
Llorando dí la espalda y no les pude decir nada

Ayer que regresé a mi pueblo,
Alguien me dijo que ya te casaste
Mírame y dime si ya me olvidaste
Me marcharé con los ojos aguados

Después le pregunté a la luna,
Me dio la espalda e intentó ocultarse,
Hasta la luna sabe que me amaste,
Hasta la luna sabe que aun me amas.

Y vuela vuela por otro rumbo
Ve y sueña sueña que el mundo es tuyo

Tu ya no puedes volar conmigo
Aunque mis sueños se irán contigo

Es tan triste tener que decirte que me olvides
Otro amor ha llegado a mi vida y no te quiero

Es muy tarde no puedo negarte que me muero
Pero no callarán mis palabras pa' decirte
Que soñaré contigo siempre que cierre mis ojos
Que entonaré por ti mis cantos tristes noche a noche
Que lloraré sin ti cuando recuerde que estoy solo
Y al recordar que duermes en los brazos de otro hombre.

Me pregunto si aun reflejas algo de mi vida
Si en tu memoria vive aquel amor de tantos años
Aquel hombre que siempre te ha querido desde niña
Que llora porque el amor de su vida se ha casado.

Es triste ver que un tren se aleja
Y en él se va lo mejor de tu vida
Dime el motivo de tu despedida
Por qué te fuiste dejando mil penas?

Un día recibí tu carta
Quise leerla y era una hoja en blanco
Pues de tu vida nunca supe nada
Como preguntas que si es que aún te amo.

You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

Tu manera de hacerme el amor al cielo me haré subir

Alexandra,"Ich wollt dich längst schon wieder sehen
Mein alter Freund aus Kindertagen
Ich hatte manches dir zu sagen
Und wusste du wirst mich verstehen

Als kleines Mädchen kam ich schon
Zu dir mit all den Kindersorgen
Ich fühlte mich bei dir geborgen
Und aller Kummer flog davon
Hab ich in deinem Arm geweint
Strichst du mir mit deinen Blättern
Mir übers Haar mein alter Freund

Mein Freund der Baum 
Ist tot
Er fiel im frühen Morgenrot

Du fielst heut früh, ich kam zu spät
Du wirst dich nie im Wind mehr wiegen
Du musst gefällt am Wege liegen
Und mancher, der vorüber geht
Der achtet nicht den Rest von Leben 
Und reißt an Deinen grünen Zweigen
Die sterbend sich zur Erde neigen
Wer wird mir nun die Ruhe geben
Die ich in Deinem Schatten fand? 
Mein bester Freund ist mir verloren
Der mit der Kindheit mich verband

Mein Freund der Baum 
Ist tot
Er fiel im frühen Morgenrot

Bald wächst ein Haus aus Glas und Stein
Dort wo man ihn hat abgeschlagen
Bald werden graue Mauern ragen
Dort wo er liegt im Sonnenschein
Vielleicht wird es ein Wunder geben 
Ich werde heimlich darauf warten
Vielleicht blüht vor dem Haus ein Garten
Und er erwacht zu neuem Leben
Doch ist er dann noch schwach und klein
Und wenn auch viele Jahre gehen
Er wird nie mehr derselbe sein

On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing",Good King Wenceslas,1993

Alexandra Sasha Samsonova,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,

Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,2008

But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Do they droop when they are wet?
Do they stiffen when they're dry?
Can you wave them at your neighbor
With an element of flavor?
Do your ears stand high?

Can you use them as a mop?
Are they stringy at the bottom?
Are they curly at the top?
Can you use them for a swatter?
Can you use them for a blotter?

Do your ears stick out?
Can you waggle them about?
Can you flap them up and down
As you fly around the town?
Can you shut them up for sure
When you hear an awful bore?
Do your ears stick out?

Do your ears give snacks?
Are they all filled up with wax?
Do you eat it in the morning
Do you eat it in the bath?
Do you eat it with a scone
Or do you eat it on its own?
Do your ears give snacks?",Choir Boys Farewell (To The Puppets),2010

Why es esa magia de tenerte cerca
Cuando me respiras...

Tu cuerpo why mi cuerpo, así entrelazados
En un boca boca; no queda un espacio
Mientras me cuelgo a tu cintura
Why voy llegando justo a la locura...

Coro:
Quitémonos la ropa, que nos viene bien
Recórreme despacio por toda la piel
Why bésame, why bésame,
Comámonos a besos,
Ven, devórame why bésame
Why dime de tus labios que quieres volver,
Abrázame why bésame
Amémonos despacio why luego quédate...

Te juro que te siento
Auque no digas nada
Que son nuestras caricias el perfecto idioma
Con que tu me hablas
Why qué mejor que ahora, que estás a mi lado
Que ya no tengo excusas para para no creer
Q ya no tengo miedo al saber que te amo
Why que me quedaré...

Alexandre Pires,"Se busca una mujer
Que se ha robado mis ganas
Why mis sueños
Se busca una mujer

Que se metio en lo mas
Profundo de mis huesos
Se busca una mujer a quien
Le hice el mas sagrado juramento

De adorarla si por siempre why no
Apartarla de mi mente
Ando en busca del pasado
Que se fue

Yo no se si ella me supo amar
Yo no se si la podre encontrar
Yo se si es suficiente
Vivir eternamente aferrado

A su forma de amar
Es difícil proseguir asi
Navegando en el mar del sufrir
Ya no quedan ilusiones

Mis locas emociones se fueron con el sol de abril
Se busca una mujer
Que desperto mis emociones en un beso
Se busca una mujer

Que de su calma why de su carne
Me hizo preso
Se busca una mujer
A quien le hice el mas sagrado juramento

De adorarla si por siempre why no
Apartarla de mi mente
Ando en busca del pasado
Que se fue

Yo no se eh eh, rara, Rara
Ya no quedan emociones
Mis locas emociones se fueron
Con el sol de abril

Yo no se si ella me supo amar
Yo no se si la podre encontrar

Es difícil para mi seguir
Navegando en el mar del sufrir

Alexandre Pires,"O que é que eu vou fazer com essa tal liberdade
Se estou na solidão pensando em você?
Eu nunca imaginei sentir tanta saudade

Eu andei errado, eu pisei na bola
Troquei quem mais amava por uma ilusão
Mas a gente aprende, a vida é uma escola
Não é assim que acaba uma grande paixão

Não sei se fico aqui ou mudo de cidade
Sinceramente, amor, não sei o que fazer

Eu andei errado, eu pisei na bola
Achei que era melhor cantar outra canção

Te procura
Não fica em paz
Certas horas, certos dias
Eu me sinto assim

É que a luz do seu olhar
Já não brilha mais em mim

Que me mata
E procuro na lembrança
Uma gota de esperança
Um motivo que me faça
Entender essa distância

Ai coração como se atreve
Você resiste
A tanto tempo
E não deleta do meu pensamento

Ai coração pega mais leve

Ai coração devolve a minha vida

É difícil aceitar
Essa falta de você
Não tem jeito nem maneira
Não te esqueço
E na música que toca
Eu te sinto em cada nota
Fecho os olhos e te vejo
E sinto o gosto do seu beijo

Você possa voltar

Alexandre Pires,"Tudo começou lá nas bandas de Minas Gerais
Veja que garoto iluminado do que foi capaz
Na barriga da mama, já bailava no palco
E nasceu em Janeiro, no Triângulo Mineiro
Enquanto mãe cantava, papai acompanhava
Até de madrugada, ele nunca chorava
Enquanto o som rolava, ele lá no meio daquela zoeira
E só reclamava quando era hora de tomar mamadeira
E assim ele cresceu e hoje é parte de uma raça brasileira
Cantando pelo mundo inteiro levantando a nossa bandeira
Neguinho danado! Na ponta do pé ele sempre sambou
Atualizado! Se mudar o ritmo ele dá o show
Não dorme no ponto! O trem passou ele pegou
Ele tem a música na veia que herdou dos seus pais
Olha que garoto estudioso responsável demais
Acordava bem cedo, a Deus agradecia
E a Nossa Senhora, sua Mãe Abadia
Ele foi carpinteiro, e também jornaleiro e na lavanderia
Engraxava sapato, um bico de pedreiro
E quando pegava no cavaco não era de brincadeira
O Brasil cantou se apaixonou
Fez o nosso se realizar
Quem já não ouviu uma canção de amor
Do Só Pra Contrariar, Só Pra Contrariar
Com muitas feras ele já cantou
Dentre elas Fabio Jr, Leonardo, Jamelão
Ben Jor, a marrom Alcione, Caetano Veloso que figura!
E o Gilberto Gil, nosso ministro da cultura
Quanta emoção com o Rei Roberto Carlos dividiu uma canção
Olha que Legal; até com gente internacional
Rosário, Glória Estefan, Alejandro Sanz
E até fora do Brasil o mineirinho já tem fãs",Neguinho Danado,2003

Teríamos que nascer de novo
E de novo nos olharmos
E de novo nos amarmos

Para viver aquilo que vivemos outro dia
Sob a sua mão inquieta, meu desejo se perdia
No silêncio dos seus beijos, meu corpo estremecia
Para viver tudo de novo, até Deus do céu duvida

É difícil acontecer duas vezes numa vida
Para viver aquilo que vivemos outro dia
Reinventar um mundo, reinventar a vida
Para viver aquilo que vivemos outro dia

É tentar te entender e não ser entendida
É ficar com você

É tentar desculpar o que não tem desculpa
É fazer dos teus erros
Num motivo qualquer a razão da minha culpa

Minha estranha loucura
É correr pros teus braços quando acaba uma briga
Te dar sempre razão
E assumir o papel de culpada, bandida
Ver você me humilhar
E eu num canto qualquer, dependente total do teu jeito de ser
Minha estranha loucura
É tentar descobrir que o melhor é você

E eu te juro amor eterno
Nesse instante

Que mágica tem os seus beijos

Seu jeito de fazer amor
Que é sempre tão suave

E tudo o que preciso

Entende e sente

É por amor que eu estou
Contigo e vivo cada instante

Você me faz sorrir do mundo
E das dificuldades
É o meu porto mais seguro
Em minhas tempestades
E quando de loucura e medo
Eu fico sem saída
Você me acalma e
Ilumina a minha vida

Quando o amor toma conta da gente
Quando o amor é verdade
Quando o amor é total
Quando o amor dorme e acorda contigo
Quando é seu companheiro e amigo
É verdade
É total

Nada más amargo, que saber que te perdí
