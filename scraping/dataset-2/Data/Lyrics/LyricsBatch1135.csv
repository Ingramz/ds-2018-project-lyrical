Billie Holiday,"So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels, goody goody!
Well you gave her your heart too, just as I gave mine to you
And she broke it in little pieces, now how do you do?

So you lie awake just singing the blues all night, goody goody!
And you found that loves a barrell of dynamite!
Hurray and halleluyah, you had it comin to ya
Goody goody for you! goody goody for me! ya I hope you`re 
Satisfied you rascal you!

Do you remember me sittin` all alone waitin` for the tinkle of the telephone? 
Now the action jackson`s turned right around, goody goody!

Yes you remember me, I was all for you, sittin` waitin` hoping like you told me 
Too. Now the action jackson`s turned right around

So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels, 
Hurray and halleluyah, you had it comin to ya.
Goody goody for her. Goody goody for me. And I hope she tans your hide you 
Rascal, I hope your satisfied you rascal. So goody good good for me you rascal 
You!",My Man (Mon Homme) [Single Version],1999
Billie Holiday,"I look at you and suddenly something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and your glance make this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazing their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide on a magic carpet ride

Full of butterflies inside
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1999
Billie Holiday,"There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, ""seek and ye shall find""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,1999
Billie Holiday,"The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me

No, they can't 
Take that away from me",Stairway to the Stars,1999
Billie Holiday,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",There Is No Greater Love [Single Version],1999
Billie Holiday,"They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi ho, alas, and also lackaday
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi ho, alas, and also lackaday
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me",You Can't Lose a Broken Heart [Single Version],1999
Billie Holiday,"I love my man
On my life I say I don't

I love my man
On my life I say I don't

But I'll quit my man
On my life I say I won't
I've been your slave baby
Ever since I've been your way
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your faith
But before I be your dog
I'll see you in your grave

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Squacked about my supper
Then he put me outdoors
Heaven erred to late
A matchbox on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long long ways to go

I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curls 
I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curls

But my mother she give me something
It's going to carry me through this world
Some man like me 'cause I'm happy
Some 'cause I'm snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I've got money
Some say Billie
Baby you're built for speed
Now if you put that altogether
Makes me everything a good man needs",I Love My Man,1999
Billie Holiday,"If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, do, do!

If I go to church on Sunday,
Then just shimmy down on Monday,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, if I do!

If my friend ain't got no money,
And I say, ""Take all mine, honey"",
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, do, do do!

If I give him my lasy nickel,
And it leaves me in a pickle,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, if I do!

There, I'd rather my man was hittin' me,
Than to jump right up and quittin' me,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, do, do do!

I swear I won't call no copper
If I'm beat up by my papa,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, if I do!",Ain't Nobody Business,2000
Billie Holiday,"The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is!
The Good Book says ""Go seek and ye shall find
""Well, I have sought and my what a climb it is!
My life is just like the weatherIt changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;in emotion
Like the ocean it's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like I love him
Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good
Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Tho folks with good intentions ell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him
Lord above me make him love me the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
",I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,2000
Billie Holiday,"Oh, sweet Dardanella
I love your harem eyes
I'm a lucky fellow to capture such a prize
Oh, Allah knows my love for you
And he tells you to be true, Dardanella
Oh, hear my sigh, my Oriental
Oh, sweet Dardanella, prepare the wedding wine
There'll be one girl in my harem when you're mine
We'll build a tent
Just like the children of the Orient

Oh, sweet Dardanella
My star of love divine
Down beside the Dardanella Bay
Where Oriental breezes play
There lives a lonesome maid Armenian
By the Dardanelles with glowing eyes
She looks across the seas and sighs
And weaves her love spell so sirenian
Soon I shall return to Turkestan
I will ask for her heart and hand

Oh, sweet Dardanella
I love your harem eyes
I'm a lucky fellow to capture such a prize
Oh, Allah knows my love for you
And he tells you to be true, Dardanella

Billie Holiday,"Papa, papa, just look at this
Out in the backyard, shakin' like this
Doin' that Georgia Grind
That old Georgia Grind

Now everybody's ravin' 'bout that old Georgia Grind

I can shake it East
And I can shake it West
But way down South I can shake it best
Doin' the Georgia Grind
I's just doin' the Georgia Grind

Everybody's talkin' 'bout that old Georgia Grind

Come in here, gal; come in here right now
I see you're tryin' to be bad, but if you don't know how
You do the Georgia Grind
Oh, the Georgia Grind

Everybody's tryin'
To do the Georgia Grind

Well, old Miss Jones was in second place
She did the Georgia Grind through a stick of waste
She did the Georgia Grind
She went crazy 'bout that Georgia Grind

Now everybody's ravin' 'bout that old Georgia Grind",Georgia Grind,2000
Billie Holiday,"I had a woman
Livin' way back o' town
Yeah she treated me right
Never let me down
But I wasn't satisfied
I had to run around

Now she's gone and left me
I'm worried as can be
Oh I've searched this world all over
Wonderin' where she could be
I would ask that she forgive me
And maybe she'll come back to me

But I doubt it

I'm lonesome an blue
And I've learned a thing or two
Oh fellas here's a tip
I'm gonna pass on down to you
Never mistreat your woman
Cause it's gonna bounce right back on you
",Lonesome Blues,2000
Billie Holiday,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while",Once in a While,2000
Billie Holiday,"Let him put you down, if he dares
I'll pick you up by myself just as soon
I don't care, you never rest on the shelf

I've been looking for a girl like you so long
A girl so nice and gentle with a love that's strong
I'll make life for you, one grand sweet song
Oh, give me a break, sweet mama and you can't go wrong

I for you, you for me
That's the only way two loving hearts should be
So just be glad when he puts you down
I'll pick you up all myself

",Put 'Em Down Blues,2000
Billie Holiday,"I hate to see de ev'nin' sun go down

Pulls dat man 'roun' by her apron strings
'Twant for powder an' for store bought hair

Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, doggone it
I loves day man lak a schoolboy loves his pie
Lak a Kentucky Col'nel loves his mint an' rye
I'll love ma baby till the day ah die

Been to de gypsy to get ma fortune tole
To de gypsy, done got ma fortune tole
'Cause I'm most wile 'bout ma Jelly Roll
Gypsy done tole me, don't you wear no black
Yes, she done told me, don't you wear no black

Go to Saint Louis, you can win him back
Help me to Cairo, make Saint Louis by maself
Git to Cairo, find ma old friend Jeff
Gwine to pin maself close to his side
If ah flag his train, I sho' can ride
Got de Saint Louis Blues jes as blue as ah can be
Dat man got a heart lak a rock cast in the sea

Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, doggone it
I loves day man lak a schoolboy loves his pie
Lak a Kentucky Col'nel loves his mint an' rye
I'll love ma baby till the day ah die

You ought to see dat stovepipe brown of mine
Lak he owns de Dimon' Joseph line
He'd make a cross eyed O'man go stone blin'
Blacker than midnight, teeth lak flags of truce
Blackest man in de whole of Saint Louis
Blacker de berry, sweeter am de juice

About a crap game, he knows a pow'ful lot
But when work time comes, he's on de dot
Gwine to ask him for a cold ten spot
What it takes to git it, he's cert'nly got
Got de Saint Louis Blues jes as blue as ah can be
Dat man got a heart lak a rock cast in the sea

Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, doggone it
I loves day man lak a schoolboy loves his pie
Lak a Kentucky Col'nel loves his mint an' rye
I'll love ma baby till the day ah die

A black headed gal makes a freight train jump the track, said
A black headed gal makes a freight train jump the track
But a long tall gal makes a preacher ball the jack

Lawd, a blonde headed woman makes a good man leave the town
I said, ""Blonde headed woman makes a good man leave the town
But a red headed woman makes a boy slap his papa down""

Oh, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I said, ""Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
If my blues don't get you, my jazzing must""

And when I climb these rocky mountains
There'll be no more crying over you

And you promised to be true
Well, I took you for my lover
And you broke my heart in two

You broke a promise
Each kiss you gave was lie
But I'll climb these rocky mountains
If I don't I hope to die

Someday you'll be sad and lonely
And you'll want to come to me
Yes, some day you'd be lonely
And you'll want to come to me
I'll be hide on these mountains

You'll rock all the way
But if I leave and nothing happens
I reach the tops on sunny day

Tell me more and more and then some
The way that you feel and then
When you've told that old sweet story
And you're through, start right in again

I've made that old mistake
Know the awful ache
Of a heart that's double crossed
The waitin's been so long

Hard to believing
If I've missed my guess, happiness is lost

Tell me more and more and then some
You know how I love that stuff
Whisper on from now

Big John was feeling blue
Ain't he didn't seem right
So he didn't know just what to do

I said do please tell me
Ain't you satisfied?

Were declaring love's old story
In the shade of the old apple tree

With silver threads among the gold

For you I cry, for you dear only

I'm wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it

It's hard to conceive it
That you'd throw away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear

My life a hell you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you body and soul

A winter that's gray and cold

I'm out of my mind

I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it is't so

And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say

You're trowing your life away""

I may pretend

Love just goes so far
No more

I didn't care for you no more
No how

You're down to my size
It's over and done

That look in your eyes

Not now
Here's the day

Yes everybody's laughing

They're laughing at me loudly.

So they can point a finger
And tear apart a gal whose heart
Was taken through the wringer

Times when I know you'll be sad

Some way
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not goodbye
We'll be together again.

Don't even try to date her on the phone!
'Cause she's my baby, she's Goin' Steady with me.
 
Well, now, sweet baby, that we're Goin' Steady,
I'll pull up and ask your daddy 
What he thinks, if you and I are wed.
'Cause I love you and you love me,
We're both as happy as we can be, 
And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me.
We'll get the ring, then be on our way
To see the preacher man,
And when I say: ""I do, sweetheart!""
I'll slip the ring on your lovin' hand
Ev'ry thing's gonna turn out fine,
I'll be yours and you'll be mine,
'Cause you're my baby, you're Goin' Steady with me.

Billie Jo Spears,"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
 
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light

Help me make it through the night
 
I don't care who's right or wrong

And it's sad to be alone",Help Me Make It Through the Night,1972
Billie Jo Spears,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird,1972

Billie Jo Spears,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to carry on
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed my stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
You think I'd crumble
You think I'd lay down and die
Oh no, not I
I will survive
As long as I know how to love
I know I will stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive

It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
Now I hold my head up high
And you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free

And you know I’m gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, Julie baby, you’re my flame

Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I’m afire
Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy-o don’t you dare

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I’m his Missus,
Oh daddy, won’t you treat him right

Now you’ve listened to my story
Here’s the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever,1998

Turns the flicker to a flame
I think of things we used to do
Then my whole world turns misty blue

Billie Jo Spears,"It was the third of June another sleepy dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was a bailin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked out to the house to eat
And mama hollered of the back door, ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
Then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today Billie Joe Macallister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty that I've got to plow""
And Mama said, ""It was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe Mac Allister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Mama said to me, ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
Said, he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said, he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge

A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last spring
Now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe,1999

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

Maybe I didn't hold you

How come your daddy run away your mama never did know
All you remember is becoming a step son to your mama's new man
And you got acquainted with the back of his hand
Stepchild you say the man had a son
The son called him daddy but he told you to call him John
You say the legs on the breast of the chicken was gone
When the platter come around your way
And you had to chop cotton while your step brother played
Stepchild when you were born
Your right foot was turned left with your left
And mercy had a way of taking off and leaving you by yourself
Stepchild muddy water got in your well

Stepchild how come your laughing that way
After doing the deed that you've done you better learn how to pray

Take her out and show her off fill her tall glass with wine

Your rose colored world is a long way from mine
I'm just a teardrop from a breakdown and so all alone

Folks ever have found

Make love and take up
Somewhere where we left off
Somewhere where we've been

Billie Joe Armstrong,"T'was in the merry month of May
When flowers were a-bloomin'
Sweet Willie on his deathbed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen

He sent his servant to the town
The town where she did dwell in
Saying ""Master dear has sent me here
If your name be Barbara Allen""

Then slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she went to him
And all she said when she got there
""Young man, I think you're dying""

""Oh don't you remember the other day
When we were in the tavern?
You drank your health to the ladies there
And you slighted Barbara Allen""

He turned his face unto the wall
He turned his back upon her
""So long, farewell to all my friends
Be kind to Barbara Allen""

She looked to the east, she looked to the west
She saw his corpse a-comin'
""Oh sit him down for me"" she cried
""That I may gaze upon him""

The more she looked the more she grieved
She bursted out a-cryin'
Sayin' ""Pick me up and carry me home
For I feel like I am dyin'""

They buried Willie in the old churchyard
And Barbara in the new one
From Willie's grave there grew a rose
From Barbara's a green briar

They grew and grew to the old church wall
And could not grow no higher
And there they died in a true love-knot
The rosebush and the briar",Barbara Allen,2013
Billie Joe Armstrong,"Down in the Willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we sat a-courtin'
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of Burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below

I drew a sabre through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sign
My father often told me
That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connolly

My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high

Oh warden,
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail""

""I tried to raise my baby right
I have prayed both day and night
That he wouldn't follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide
And I feared that he had died
But at last I've found my baby here in jail
Oh warden,
At last I've found my baby here in jail""

""It was just five years today
When his daddy passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
T’was then I bowed to take his ring
And his gold watch and his chain
Then the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden,
The county laid his daddy in the grave""

""I will pawn you his watch
I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes warden,
If that will get my baby out of jail""

Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old and gray:
""I'll go bring your darling baby to your side""
Two iron gates swung wide apart
She held her darling to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
But smiling,
She kissed her baby boy and then she died

Had started out on its way
All of the passengers that were on board
Seemed to be happy and gay

But one little boy who sat by himself
Was reading a letter he had
You could plainly tell by the look on his face
That the contents of it made him sad

The stern old conductor then started his round
Taking tickets from everyone there
And finally reaching the side of the boy
He gruffly demanded his fare

""I have no ticket"" the boy then replied
""But I'll pay you back someday""
""Then I'll put you off at the next stop we make""
But he stopped when he heard the boy say

""Please Mr. Conductor
Don't put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir
Is waiting for me in pain
Expecting to die any moment sir
And may not live through the day
I wanna reach home and kiss mother goodbye
Before God takes her away""

A girl sitting near was heard to exclaim
""If you put him off, it's a shame""
Taking his hand, a collection she made
The boy's way was paid on the train

""I'm obliged to you miss for your kindness to me""
""You're welcome,"" she said, never fear
Each time the conductor would pass through the car
The boy's words would ring in his ear

I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who should care
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

Her hands were all callused and wrinkled and old
A life of hard work was the story they told
And I thought of angels as I saw her there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

Bless her old heart, do you think she'd complain
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry that cross that is more than her share
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

It wouldn't take much just to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

I look at her and I think ""What a shame""

Billie Joe Armstrong,"I am a roving gambler I gambled all around
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money down

I had not been in Washington many more weeks than three
I met up with a pretty little girl
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me, fell in love with me

She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with a fan
She whispered low in her mother's ears
I love that gambling man
Love that gambling man, love that gambling man

Oh daughter oh dear daughter how can you treat me so?
Leave your dear old mother
And with that gambler go
With that gambler go, with that gambler go

My mother, oh dear mother you can not understand
If you ever see me coming back
I'll be with a gambling man
With that gambling man, with that gambling man

I left her in El Paso and I wound up in Maine
I met up with a gambling man
Got in a poker game
Got in a poker game, got in a poker game

We put our money in the pot and dealt the cards around
I saw him deal from the bottom of the deck
Shot that gambler down
Shot that gambler down, shot that gambler down

Well, now I'm in the jailhouse got a number for my name
The Warden said as he locked the door
You've gambled your last game
Gambled your last game, gambled your last game

I am a roving gambler I gambled all around
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money down",Roving Gambler,2013

Bravely fighting the battle of time
Is a dear one who's weathered my sorrows

If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

To repay for those sorrows and cares
Though dear mother is waiting in heaven

Billie Joe Armstrong,"Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of New York
Good morning, it's been brought to my attention that many rap artists
Claim that they run New York, but this is not the case
In fact, I wrote my own song about what it's really like
Please excuse the profanity in advance, hit it

I run New York!
New York, big city of dreams
And you know that I run this town
(I run it!)

King of the streets, ? concretes
Skyscrapers on my crown
So if you want this big apple
Come try to take a bite
Cause I run this motherfucking city and
I won't give it up without a fight

Yo, I run New York, it's a pain in the ass!
The city's crowded as fuck, and it's covered in trash
And the sanitation chief just shoved his shit in my face
Another transit strike? oh fucking great!

I can't wait
To have another meeting with the labor union
So the mob can bend me over
And then shove their fucking shoe in

But I do it so you can sip your pumpkin latté
I literally run New York, and it's exhausting

I run New York, it's a fucking headache
It really wears you down
In this lake of bureaucratic bullshit
It's a miracle I don't drown

I *double* literally run New York
I run the marathon
Plus I organized it
So I double-run the marathon

But no one seems to give a fuck that I'm a paragon
Instead they Photoshop me so
It's looking like I wear a thong
And laugh at it in my own office when I'm gone

I went to the Knicks game, and
They booed me on the jumbotron!
Excuse me for trying to help you
They won't be satisfied until I'm
Locked up in Bellevue
I guess they don't tell you this job sucks dick
I run New York and it feels like shit

The chief of police is a major bully
He laughs at my ideas (he's a jerk!)
He made fun of my tie last week
And I had to fight back tears

Now on the surface, it probably seems like I should quit
Cause I spend every day getting punched in the dick
But at night I travel down into the subway
Wearing chain mail, locked and loaded for gun play
And battle the gigantic fire-breathing mutant rats
If I fucking quit, who the fuck would do that?
I'll give you a hint: the answer is no one
That's why I'm in the sewer dressed up like a shogun
Because on the equinox, a hell gate springs
Releasing hounds wreathed in the blood of kings
And no one even knows! they just think I'm a dork
But I still kill those fucking dogs, because
I run New York

I run New York, it's a shitty gig
There's no overtime in my pay (bullshit!)
I asked this city for a fucking bonus
And they said ""no fucking way!""
So rotten is this big apple
It's crawling with worms inside
But I run this motherfucking shit hole city
And it makes me wanna die

I run New York!

Thank you",I Run NY,2013
Billie Lee,"Perhaps I had a wicked childhood
Perhaps I had a miserable youth
But somewhere in my wicked, miserable past
There must have been a moment of truth

For here you are, standing there, loving me
Whether or not you should
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

For here you are, standing there, loving me

Under the liquid sky where they lived 
They were legends to behold
Fate distracted by their simple charm
Left them there to love alone
Now the angels wait patiently
For the shadows down below
They stop and smile because
It's the shark and the mermaid

Everybody looked, and everybody laughed
But the mermaid and the shark
They just slipped away
Nothing stopped them

Instead i'll make the same mistakes. pretend for me, dont prove me wrong
I broke my legs fallings, so now i'm standing still when this pain don't hurt, i'll stop holding on
I'll hit and run, pouring diamond clouds and cobwebs reign the sky, in spite of that i'll stay dry

You give pride while I take the fall,
You never thought to warn me did you,
Just sit back and watch it all,
You straight jacket my dreams,
And chainsaw my intentions,
I hate to shatter your illusions,

And this is all the will I have,
Excuse me whilst I dig it up dig it up,

Things they advise, I should let go
They're calling you ice, then I see you glow
You're making me crazy, what can I say
I'd do anything to take the pain away

When you gonna realize that you're lonely
I can see it in your eyes, you don't have to be
When you gonna realize I'm the remedy

You'll be safe with me

I'm not just talking 'bout being your girl
The things I want us to do
Get into me like I'm into you

Walking in the park, watching leaves fall
Lovers in the dark, counting every star
Finally when your trust is in me
I'll give you my love, real, slow and tender

When you gonna realize that you're lonely
I can see it in your eyes, you don't have to be
When you gonna realize, I'm the remedy
Won't you give my love a try?
You'll be safe with me

When you gonna realize that you're lonely
I can see it in your eyes, you don't have to be
When you gonna realize I'm the remedy
Won't you give my love a try?
You'll be safe with me

You're here in my arms and that's how I want it, boy
When the morning comes you'll know what I feel, so real
Dream of your smile, night after night
The one that you hide from the daylight

Stop all those tears, doubt in your mind
Leave all your fears way behind

When you gonna realize that you're lonely
I can see it in your eyes, you don't have to be
When you gonna realize I'm the remedy
Won't you give my love a try?
You'll be safe with me

When you gonna realize that you're lonely
(I know you know that)
I can see it in your eyes, you don't have to be
(You gonna be)

When you gonna realize I'm the remedy
(Safe with me, yeah)
Won't you give my love a try?
You'll be safe with me
(You'll be safe with me)

When you gonna realize that you're lonely
I can see it in your eyes, you don't have to be

You'll be safe with me

You're blowing hot

Hoping we can work it out
What game is this that I'm learning

When you go from my house
Creeping quiet as a mouse
What game is this

How wrong is that

And I'm alone again
There's nothing new in that oh no
How lost I feel
Somehow I carry on
Battle my role
Like a bird in a storm

I never know what you're saying
Put me through all the doubt
Hoping we can work it out
What game is this that I'm learning
I never knew such a burning
When you go from my house
Creeping quiet as a mouse
Have you got something to hide
Have we got anything left to save
I feel so frightened inside
I can't keep acting so brave
What game is this
What game is this
Can anybody play
Did you think you could deny
All the telltale signs the lipstick on your shirt
You said was wine
The crumpled letters in your jeans
The late night calls and angry scenes
What d'you take me for
I know the score
Repeat chorus to fade

But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

Billie Worth,"I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day father started digging in a field
Hoping to find some soil

He dug and he dug and what do you think?
Oil, oil, oil
The money rolled in and I rolled out with a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now who am I?

I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em jell

And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
They could go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind

They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes 'round

If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes, indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you all you need

Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

Entertaining vodka drinkers
Is a job they give to me
Making nice guys out of stinkers
Seems to be my cup of tea

What they really need behind the iron wall
Is the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
There's a book of regulations
As to who sits next to who

But there might be complications
When the blue blood's not so blue
So the priestess with the leastes' protocol
Is the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

An Ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves

He can come and let his hair down
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife

But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
For the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

I've been highly complimented
And I thank you what is more
You'll be damned well represented
By your new ambassador

For my one ambition is to make them fall
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
In the handbag that I'll carry
There's a precious little note

To their highnesses from Harry
Introducing me he wrote:
""I'll appreciate a favor large or small
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball""

There'll be no mistakes, I've got what it takes
To make friends across the sea
I'll make being smart an important part
Of my foreign policy

I'll cement our good relations
When I give my first affair
There'll be special invitations
To the Duke and Duchess there

Ten generations of Constantins
Lived very comf'table lives
They were contented to live in style
Supported by their wives
Daughters of men who were wealthy
Fitted them like a glove
They all married for money
I mean to marry for love

[Refrain:]
It's an old-fashioned idea, marrying for love
And that old-fashioned idea's what I'm thinking of
Where there's love, poets have said
Two can live as one
That's an old-fashioned idea
But it's being done
When I find the man that I'm crazy about
There's much that I could do without
But I couldn't do without love
Just an old-fashioned romance with a moon above
A romance, one that will end marrying for love
That's the kind of love
That I'm thinking of

When I'm coming back for more
Appealed by your tasteless dirty charm,
I'm coming back for more
Just by being here I'm careless,
When I watch you fall asleep

And I guess that I'd be better off, jerking off, than to let 
Her steal my heart kept memories",Tenderless,2002

And step up to you respectfully

I don't intend to offend you
I only intend to befriend you
But you're willing me, thrilling me, killing me

A little hotter in the bottom mama that's all that I'm wanting
No frontin' if it is illegal for you to be that fine
I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime
Literally, first it'll be dancing with me
Then it'll be dinner with me
Then it'll be back to my crib
Hold up, I'm about to get ahead of myself
And I'm playing myself
The type of brother that when I'm thinking of stuff
I'm saying the stuff
My bad, back it up let's start with a dance
On good behavior, maybe later
Maybe your apartment, your pad

The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest
The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise
The other night I seen her dancing
Duty was over
She did a split into a spin
And put her leg on his shoulder
And he was over
If that was me and I was he
We'd probably still be dancing

It's automatic that I look in your eyes to help fantasize

Closer to me, come on close as you can be

Come on mama cut me no slack

Come on mama forward and back

To the cold lashing at her bones
She packs up
So the police will leave her alone
She looks down
For the change that's been dropped on the ground
She cheers up
One small smile for every dime she's found

And you tell me your life is so hard
You've overcharged your credit card
You tell me you can't take this stress
Stock market's in a mess

You wake up
To the comfort of your heated home
You take up
All the resources you think you own
Off to work
To exploit your workers aren't you nice
You walk by
A dozen starving kids and don't think twice

And you tell me your life is so hard
You've overcharged your credit card
You tell me you can't take this stress
Stock market's in a mess

She walks on
Scouting out for food along the way
She's aware
That this life could kill her any day
She remains
Another starving child without a voice
She goes on
Living this as if she had a choice

And you tell me your life is so hard
You've overcharged your credit card
You tell me you can't take this stress

Billy 13,"Und ich wär' was, hät' ich mich in der Klasse nur benommen,
Und vielleicht wär' alles anders, hät' ich Taschengeld bekommen.
Warum bin ich der, der sich die Wodka kippt?
Und warum zieht der Teufel mehr Menschen als Gott an sich?
Sag, wieso weckt mich keiner aus diesem Traum?
Ja wieso kann ich bis heute keinen Frauen vertrauen?
Wieso schaff' ich es am Tag, nicht einmal zu beten?
Und woher kommt dieser Hass? Ich kann keinem vergeben.
Warum rap ich weiter, wenn ich gar kein Geld verdien'?
Wieso war ich nie der Typ, der die Schellen kriegt?
Warum bin ich ohne Vater aufgewachsen?
Sag, wieso pack' ich mir das Bare aus der Kasse?
Warum hab ich kein Bruder und bin auf mich gestellt?
Ich hab meine Familie, wofür brauch' ich das Geld?
Das ist meine Welt, hier werden keine Wünsche wahr,
Denn meine Antwort bekomme ich am jüngsten Tag.

Ab heute könnt ihr sehen,
Wie wir aufstehen, ausgehen,
Den ganzen Tag nur Tracks aufnehmen,
Den Dreck niemals aufgeben.
Wir müssen stark sein,
Einfach nur stark bleiben.
Auch an unserem schlimmsten Tag,
Vor Gott an unserem jüngsten Tag.

Wieso wuchs ich im Ghetto auf und nicht in einer reichen Gegend?
Sag, wieso musst' ich als kleiner Junge so viel Scheiße sehen?
Warum kam ich zur Schule immer als letzter rein?
Und wieso ließen sich damals nur meine Eltern scheiden?
Sag, wieso lass' ich mein Hass raus, indem ich andere schlage?
Warum bin ich vor Gericht immer dieser Angeklagte?
Wieso hat der Junge seine Schule nicht geschafft?
Bitte Gott, sag warum war meine Jugend so verkackt?
Ich hab die Schule geschmissen und fing an Drogen zu dealen,
Wieso wollt' ich damals schon immer ganz oben mitspielen?
Ich wollte Titten, warum hab ich mein Schulabschluss nie nachgeholt?
Der Teufel gab mir Geld und ich fühlt' mich auf der Strasse wohl.
Wieso sind Leute nett zu dir, immer wenn du Geld hast?
Wieso nennt man uns beide, den Abschaum der Gesellschaft?
Al-Gear, mich machten die Sünden stark,
Und meine Antwort bekomme ich am jüngsten Tag.

Ab heute könnt ihr sehen,

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street

That you could ever care for me

That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

Little handsome piggy wigs
For the big, bad the very big, very bad wolf
They did not give three figs

Number one was very gay
And he built his house with hay
With a hey hey toot he blew on his flute
And he played around all day

Now number two was fond of jigs
And so he built his house with twigs
Hey, diddle diddle he played on his fiddle
And danced with lady pigs

I shall build my house with bricks""

By the hair of your chinny chin I'll blow you in
And the twig house answered yes

So when they knocked, he fast unlocked

When I work twice as hard to defeat myself

At least it’s a contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
[?] can’t feel us, Medicare can’t heal us
And the mamas can’t stop us
And these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried

Billy Bob Thornton,"There's a screened-in porch in the front but not the back
The back's just got a door and a crepe myrtle bush
And a little ole dried up garden and some woods way on the back
There's a hickory nut tree that covers the whole roof

Sounds like hand grenades hittin' the tin roof all the time
There's an old wood floor that's bowed up just about everywhere
It's got a thin coat of white stuff on it even though
It's a dark wood floor

There's a washing machine right outside the back door
It's a ringer washer, the kind they don't make anymore
I got my hand caught in it several times
And usually got my ass whipped for it

Even though I's the one that got hurt
There's a snake stick, that's what they called it anyway
By the back door because if you
Wanted to go outside you'd usually need it

Everything's green most of the time except in winter
When you could see the highway, it's not a leaf on the trees
There's an old rock, well, where we clean the squirrels
I used to sit out by that and watch the Carbor girl come down the road

She didn't have but one dress and that's all she needed
It was kinda red and kinda gray and kinda tore up and kinda perfect
She's built like a brick shit-house
She had polish on her toenails that only went about halfway down

?Cause they was always tore up
She used to walk across the side yard, right by the well
And go stand by the crepe myrtle bush
And look in the screen door

She'd usually stand there for about ten minutes
And back then I wasn't sure what she wanted
These days I understand, if I'd a known then what I know now
Well, my life might well have been pretty different

Well, she was about eight or nine years older than I was when I first
Started school I knew there was somethin'
There was somethin' about the south and the air was a lot heavier
And it seems like the women sweat even when they're not

I don't know if you've ever heard rain on a tin roof or not
But it's kinda tailor made for love
And day I was in the house and I was lookin' back
Toward the back screen door and there she was

Standin' there for ten minutes
The only thing different on this day is
That my daddy went back there and talked to her
And told her she looked pretty

I thought the same thing but there was somethin' 'bout the look
In his eye was a little different than the one I'd had in mine
And he walked outside and they went past the crepe myrtle bush
And past the well and out into the green

And I walked to the back door and I watched for a long time
And all I could see was trees after a time, I really couldn't see
They came back out and my daddy was walkin' way ahead of her
And she was kinda following, almost runnin'

He acted like he didn't want to have anything to do with her
And I was wondering why, why would you be so happy going in
And so down coming out, I don't know

That's what I thought then
He didn't act like she's so pretty anymore
Now I think I get it
I think I've got it several times

And a womans lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went straight

Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray

And squeeze my body tight
And forgive me of my sins

And I know I'm not insane
If I am, I'm not to blame

Like a drug inside my veins

And I've sown just what I've reaped
And my thoughts are mine to keep
And through my chilly bones they creep
And they whisper me to sleep

And put myself back on

We went to the sto' and sold bottles fo' a nickel 
To feast upon a big bag of Cheetos and a pickle 
You could get a soda foe less than quarter  and 
People used to speak even if they didn't know ya 
We fought in the streets like little black soldiers 
Shake hands, and still be friends when it was over 
We used to play tag and, hide and go seek, or 
Hide and go get it if we had a few freaks, but 
Now thangs changed, kids ain't the same 
They bang, and slang, and blow out brains 
I wish I could go back but, wishin is for suckers

Forced to live a life that I didn't know 
Wore the wrong colors cause I didn't know the facts 
Call her bitch, caught a case, caught a slug in my back

Billy Boyd,"I saw the light fade from the sky
On the wind I heard a sigh
As the snowflakes cover my fallen brothers
I will say this last goodbye

Night is now falling
So ends this day
The road is now calling
And I must away
Over hill and under tree
Through lands where never light has shone
By silver streams that run down to the sea

Under cloud, beneath the stars
Over snow one winter's morn
I turn at last to paths that lead home
And though where the road then takes me
I cannot tell
We came all this way
But now comes the day
To bid you farewell

Many places I have been
Many sorrows I have seen
But I don't regret
Nor will I forget
All who took the road with me

Night is now falling
So ends this day
The road is now calling
And I must away
Over hill and under tree
Through lands where never light has shone
By silver streams that run down to the sea

To these memories I will hold
With your blessing I will go
To turn at last to paths that lead home
And though where the road then takes me
I cannot tell
We came all this way
But now comes the day
To bid you farewell

I bid you all a very fond farewell",The Last Goodbye,2014

And we've hit an iceberg,
But I don't care what the people think,
I will drink and drink till the damn ship sinks

Who think their face is their fortune,
But under their skin their ugly as sin.

There right down to their hips,
There're lots of pretty girls with suntans

I looked to the government to help the working man
And they brought prosperity down at the armory
We're arming for peace, me boys

Not for the iron fist but for the helping hand
For theirs is a land with a wall around it
And mine is a faith in my fellow man

Mine is the green field and the factory floor
Theirs are the skies all dark with bombers
And mine is the peace we know

So I could wish for the weekend to come

Wondering what was on jack ruby's mind
And time is all I have without you here

On Wednesday when you hung up
It was as much as I could do
To stop from wishing Thursday
Would pass so quickly too

I want to come home to you

Its later than I think
And its time to put on these stinking clothes
And get out there and stink

To be seen in the letters you send
On Saturday I wished it was Sunday

To find that we have outlived the myth of trust
You woke up this morning
To the fact we've lost the things
We took for granted between us
And I grew up in awe of the girl next door
And the boy that never cried

And I was dreaming of those Elizabethan girls
While you were working in the market
To earn ourselves

And when you found out what happened yesterday
While you were away in this land of Cain
We were upstairs in the bedroom
Dancing disgusting

And flushing our babies down the drain
And the apple that don't want to get eaten
Will still fall off the tree

When you're in as deep as we are honey
It's so easy to get washed out to sea

That September morning was clear and fresh
The way she spoke and laughed at my jokes
And the way she rubbed herself
Against the edge of my desk
She became a magic mystery to me
And we'd sit together in double
History twice a week

And some days we'd walk the same way home
And it's surprising how quick
A little rain can clear the streets
We dreamed of her and compared our dreams
But that was all that I ever tasted
She lied to me with her body you see
I lied to myself 'bout the chances I'd wasted

The times we were close
Were far and few between
In the darkness at the dances in the school canteen
Did she close her eyes like I did
As we held each other tight
And la la la la la la la la means I love you

She danced with me and I still hold that memory
Soft and sweet
And I stare up at her window
As I walk down her street
But I never made the first team,
I just made the first team laugh
And she never came to the phone
She was always in the bath
I had to look in the dictionary
To find out the meaning of unrequited
While she was giving herself for free
At a party to which I was never invited 

I never understood my failings then
And I hide my humble hopes now
Thinking back she made us want her
A girl not old enough to shave her legs",The Saturday Boy,1987
Billy Bragg,"Thinking back now,
I suppose you were just stating your views
What was it all for
For the weather or the Battle of Agincourt
And the times that we all hoped would last
Like a train they have gone by so fast
And though we stood together
At the edge of the platform
We were not moved by them

With my own hands
When I make love to your memory
It's not the same
I miss the thunder
I miss the rain
And the fact that you don't understand
Casts a shadow over this land
But the sun still shines from behind it.

Thanks all the same,
But I just can't bring myself to answer your letters
It's not your fault
But your honesty touches me like a fire

One minute she says
She's gone to get the cat in

The next thing I know
She's mumbling in Latin
She cut the stars out of the sky
And baked them in a pie

She stole the scene and scenery

Billy Bragg,"Between Marx and marzipan in the dictionary there was Mary
Between the Deep Blue Sea and the Devil that was me
If ever anyone could help me with my obsession with
The young Suzannah York
It was Mary

In my pink pajamas she asked me for something
I gave her the short answer
She read our stars out loud
And I knew then that we should have gone sailing
But we stayed home instead
Fighting on the water bed
Like the honeymoon couple on drugs
Me and Mary

What happened in the past
Remained a mystery of natural history
She should have been the last
But she was just the latest
If she wanted to be a farmer's wife
I would endure that muddy life
I would dig for victory

And the sound of happy couples
Coupling happily in the dark
While you and I sat down to tea
I remember you said to me
That no amount of poetry
Would mend this broken heart
But you can put the Hoover round
If you want to make a start

And how did they conceive of me
Tell my Mary

The boys who came to the shop
Always made her laugh much more than I did
When I told her this must stop
She didn't bat an eyelid
She said you know honey it's such a shame
You'll never be any good at this game
You bruise too easily
So said Mary

Her two brothers took me out
Of circulation for the duration
So we went our separate ways but does she still love me
She still has my door key

Billy Bragg,"What will you do when the war is over, tender comrade
When we lay down our weary guns
When we return home to our wives and families
And look into the eyes of our sons
What will you say of the bond we had, tender comrade
Will you say that we were brave
As the shells fell all around us
Or that we wept and cried for our mothers
And cursed our fathers
For forgetting that all men are brothers

Will you say that we were heroes
Or that fear of dying among strangers
Tore our innocence and false shame away
And from that moment on deep in my heart I knew
That I would only give my life for love

Brothers in arms in each other arms
Was the only time that I was not afraid
What will you do when the war is over, tender comrade
When we cast off these khaki clothes
And go our separate ways
What will you say of the bond we had
Tender comrade",Tender Comrade,1988
Billy Bragg,"It may have been Camelot for Jack and Jacqueline
But on the Che Guevara highway filling up with gasoline
Fidel Castro's brother spies a rich lady who's crying
Over luxury's disappointment
So he walks over and he's trying
To sympathize with her but he thinks that he should warn her
That the Third World is just around the corner 
In the Soviet Union a scientist is blinded
By the resumption of nuclear testing and he is reminded
That Dr. Robert Oppenheimer's optimism fell
At the first hurdle
In the Cheese Pavilion and the only noise I hear
Is the sound of someone stacking chairs
And mopping up spilt beer
And someone asking questions and basking in the light
Of the fifteen fame filled minutes of the fanzine writer
Mixing pop and politics he asks me what the use is
I offer him embarrassment and my usual excuses
While looking down the corridor
Out to where the van is waiting
I'm looking for the great leap forwards
Jumble sales are organized
And pamphlets have been posted
Even after closing time there's still parties to be hosted
You can be active with the activists
Or sleep in with the sleepers
While you're waiting for the great leap forwards 
One leap forward, two leaps back
Will politics get me the sack?
Here comes the future and you can't run from it
If you've got a blacklist I want to be on it
It's a mighty long way down rock 'n roll
From Top of the Pops to drawing the dole
If no one seems to understand
Start your own revolution and cut out the middleman
In a perfect world we'd all sing in tune
But this is reality so give me some room
So join the struggle while you may
The revolution is just a tee shirt away

Billy Bragg,"Joe Hill come over from Sweden shores
Looking for some work to do
And the Statue of Liberty waved him by
As Joe come a sailing through, Joe Hill
As Joe come a sailing through.

Oh his clothes were coarse and his hopes were high
As he headed for the promised land
And it took a few weeks on the out-of-work streets
Before he began to understand
Before he began to understand

And Joe got hired by a bowery bar
sweeping up the saloon
As his rag would sail over the bar room rail
Sounded like he whistled on a tune
You could almost hear him whistling on a tune
And Joe rolled on from job to job
From the docks to the railroad line
And no matter how hungry the hand that wrote
In his letters he was always doing fine
In his letters he was always doing fine
Oh, the years went by like the sun goin' down

slowly turn the page
And when Joe looked back at the sweat upon his tracks
He had nothing to show but his age
He had nothing to show but his age
So he headed out for the California shore

There things were just as bad
So he joined the industrial workers of the world
'Cause, The union was the only friend he had
'Cause, The union was the only friend he had
Now the strikes were bloody and the strikes were black

as hard as they were long
In the dark of night Joe would stay awake and write 
In the morning he would raise them with a song
In the morning he would raise them with a song
And he wrote his words to the tunes of the day

To be passed along the union vine
And the strikes were led and the songs were spread
And Joe Hill was always on the line
Yes Joe Hill was always on the line
Now in Salt Lake City a murder was made

There was hardly a clue to find
Oh, the proof was poor, but the sheriff was sure
Joe was the killer of the crime
That Joe was the killer of the crime
Joe raised his hands but they shot him down
he had nothing but guilt to give
It's a doctor I need and they left him to bleed
He made it 'cause he had the will to live
Yes, He made it 'cause he had the will to live
Then the trial was held in a building of wood
And there the killer would be named
And the days weighed more than the cold copper ore
Cause he feared that he was being framed
Cause he found out that he was being framed
Oh, strange are the ways of western law
Strange are the ways of fate

For the government crawled to the mine owner's call
That the judge was appointed by the state
Yes, The judge was appointed by the state
Oh, Utah justice can be had
But not for a union man

And Joe was warned by summer early morn
That there'd be one less singer in the land
There'd be one less singer in the land
Now William Spry was Governor Spry
And a life was his to hold

On the last appeal, fell a governor's tear
May the lord have mercy on your soul
May the lord have mercy on your soul
Even President Wilson held up the day
But even he would fail

For nobody heard the soul searching words
Of the soul in the Salt Lake City jail
Of the soul in the Salt Lake City jail
For 36 years he lived out his days
And he more than played his part

For his songs that he made, he was carefully paid
With a rifle bullet buried in his heart
With a rifle bullet buried in his heart
Yes, they lined Joe Hill up against the wall
Blindfold over his eyes

It's the life of a rebel that he chose to live
It's the death of a rebel that he died
It's the death of a rebel that he died
Now some say Joe was guilty as charged
And some say he wasn't even there
And I guess nobody will ever know

'Cause the court records all disappeared
'Cause the court records all disappeared
Say wherever you go in this fair land
In every union hall

In the dusty dark these words are marked
In between all the cracks upon the wall
In between all the cracks upon the wall
It's the very last line that Joe Will wrote
When he knew that his days were through
Boys, this is my last and final will
Good luck to all of you
Good luck to all of you",Joe Hill,1990
Billy Bragg,"When I was a boy, I thought a thousand times I'd be a man
I'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in a can
In my lonely room, I'd set my mind on an ice cream cone
You can throw me if you wanna cause I'm a bone and I'll go
Boom, bang, bang, boom, bang, bang, yeah

If I don't start cryin', its because that I have got no eyes
My bum's in the fireplace, my dog lies hypnotized
Through the crack of light, I was unable to find my way
Trapped inside a night but I'm a day and I go
Boom, bang, bang, boom, bang, bang, yeah",Seven and Seven Is,1990
Billy Bragg,"And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy lamb of god
On England's pleasant pastures seen?

And did the countenance divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem built here
Amongst these dark satanic mills?

Bring me my bow of burning gold
Bring me my arrows of desire
Bring me my spear, o clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire.

I will not cease from mental fight
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land.",Blake's Jerusalem,1990
Billy Bragg,"I dreamed I saw Phil Ochs last night
Alive as you and me
Says I to Phil ""you're ten years dead""
""I never died"" says he
""I never died"" says he

The music business killed you Phil
They ignored the things you said
And cast you out when fashions changed
Says Phil, ""But I ain't dead""
Says Phil, ""But I ain't dead""

The FBI harassed you Phil
They smeared you with their lies
Says he, ""But they could never kill what they could not compromise""
""I never compromised""

""Though fashions changed and critics sneered""
""The songs that I have sung""
""Are just as true tonight as then""
""The struggle caries on""
""Our struggle caries on""

From valleys and from hills
Where people stand up for their rights

Phil Ochs inspires us still",I Dreamed I Saw Phil Ochs Last Night,1990
Billy Bragg,"Stand up all victims of oppression
For the tyrants fear your might
Don't cling so hard to your possessions
For you have nothing if you have no rights
Let racist ignorance be ended
For respect makes the empires fall
Freedom is merely privilege extended
Unless enjoyed by one and all

[Chorus]
So come brothers and sisters
For the struggle carries on
The internationale
Unites the world in song
So comrades come rally
For this is the time and place
The international ideal
Unites the human race

Let no one build walls to divide us
Walls of hatred nor walls of stone
Come greet the dawn and stand beside us
We'll live together or we'll die alone
In our world poisoned by exploitation
Those who have taken now they must give
And end the vanity of nations
We've but one earth on which to live

And so begins the final drama
In the streets and in the fields
We stand unbowed before their armor
We defy their guns and shields
When we fight provoked by their aggression
Let us be inspired by like and love
For though they offer us concessions
Change will not come from above",The Internationale,1990

The gates of hell stand open wide, but the path of glory you walk single

You know when we sat out on the fire escape talking
Shirley,
What did you say about running before we were walking

It's like we're in a dream
How can you lie there and think of england
When you don't even know who's in the team

We are joined in the ideological cuddle

I'm celebrating my love for you
With a pint of beer and a new tattoo
And if you haven't noticed yet
I'm more impressionable when my cement is wet

Politics and pregnancy
Are debated as we empty our glasses
And how i love those evening classes

Shirley,
You really know how to make a young man angry
Shirley,
Can we get through the night without mentioning family

The people from your church agree
It's not much of a career
Trying the handles of parked cars
Whoops, there goes another year
Whoops, there goes another pint of beer

Living on icecream and chocolate kisses
Would the leaves fall from the trees

She bought herself a mobile home
So at least she could get some enjoyment
Out of being alone
No one could say that she was left up on the shelf
It's you and me against the World kid she mumbled to herself

When the world falls apart some things stay in place
Levi Stubbs' tears run down his face

She ran away from home on her mother's best coat
She was married before she was even entitled to vote
And her husband was one of those blokes
The sort that only laughs at his own jokes
The sort a war takes away
And when there wasn't a war he left anyway

Are here to make everything right that's wrong
Holland and Holland and Lamont Dozier too
Are here to make it all okay with you

And put a hole in her body where no hole should be
It hurt her more to see him walking out the door
And though they stitched her back together they left her heart in pieces on the floor

She takes off the Four Tops tape and puts it back in its case

Billy Bragg,"You and I are victims of a love
That lost a lot in the translation
When I think of all the time that I spent
Sitting on the edge of your bed in anticipation
Of you giving in and us living in sin

A hot day, the smell of hairspray
And the sound of a shower running softly
It's things like this that remind me of how I felt
The first time you came back for coffee
The way you took it amazed me

Walking in the park, kissing in the dark
And my head against your pillow
Late at night a lover sings
Adam and Eve are finding out all about love
I say Adam and Eve are finding out all about love

There is no real substitute
For a ball struck squarely and firmly
And you're the kind of girl who wants to
Open up the bottle of pop
Too early in the journey
Our love went flat just like that

It doesn't matter the color of the car
But what goes on beneath the bonnet
Is there a flag that flies above your heart
And is my name writ there upon it
Wedding cake and toothache
Equals love and pain

Walking in the park, kissing on the carpet
And your tights around your ankles
Late at night a lover thinks of these things
Adam and Eve are finding out all about love
I say Adam and Eve are finding out all about love

He said that all revolutions are not the same
They are as different as the cultures

Can solve every problem on earth

In some prophesied political fashion

If this is rain let it fall on me and drown me
If these are tears let them fall

Must I paint you a picture
About the way that I feel
You know my love for you is strong, girl
You know my love for you is real

It took a short walk and a talk
To change the rules of engagement
While you searched frantically for reverse and them claiming
That virtue never tested is no virtue at all
And so I lost my ignorance
And now the bells across the river chime out your name
I look across to them again

It will never fly

We threw it all away

Did it rain or did sunshine attend out first meeting?
What words were said? what weight given to that first greeting?

I don't even mention your name until that summer
When bloomed the
Seed sown on the first day that we met

Gain perspective on their wilder days

Sometimes I think to myself
Should I vote red for my class
Or green for our children
But whatever choice I make I will not forsake

So you bought it all
The best your money could buy
And I watched you sell your soul
For the bright shining light

Where are the principles
Of the friend I thought I knew
I guess you let them fade from red to blue
I hate the compromises
That life forces us to make

Billy Bragg,"He's got the bonhomie
Of a game show host
And his handshake is so limp it's like meeting a ghost

His apologies are tired 'cause he uses them a lot
His excuses are so lame if they were horses they'd be shot
He lies through his teeth with impeccable grammar
In the game of life he's just a dreadful goalhanger

He's keeping all his options open
'Til the very last minute
Checking every situation
Tryin' to work out what's in it

Tryin' to pin him down's like nailing water to a wall
He's incapable of making a commitment at all
Like trying to knock in a nail with an inflatable hammer
In the game of life he's just a dreadful goalhanger

Yesterday upon the stair
I met a man who's never there
He won't be there again today
Well that's what he told me to say

He's got the natural arrogance
Of an exclamation mark
And he wishes that his bite was as big as his bark
He's appealing to the referee at every single stage
He's a buzzy little bundle of impotent rage
Where he ought to have patience he only has anger
In the game of life he's just a dreadful goalhanger

He has a lack of humility
That defies imagination
And he hangs 'round like a farting Russian space station
He doesn't even notice as he sells you down the river
'Cause he's one of life's taker and he's looking for a giver
Shrugs, drops his shoulders as he drops another clanger
In the game of life he's just a dreadful goalhanger",Goalhanger,1996

He no longer believed in
She said ""I'm a teacher here
I teach the children""
And he wondered to himself
There and then all the things he could learn from her
The great mighty wonder

Think of the names you once
Called me in anger
Remember the sadness In Florence Ballard's eyes
Imagine all the melancholy you could find
In the arms of a stranger
Bred, bread of heaven

Seems like nothing goes right
In the world that we were born in
But the horizon is bright
Yonder comes the morning

Upstairs they're buying
A stairway to heaven
Down in the garden
They're changing sticks into snakes
And the jangle of religious medals would put the fear of God into an angel
Come, come all ye faithful

Their baby came home to them
An unmarried mother
They wished she would turn to a pillar of salt
But in the end compassion has to be the greatest family value
Hope, hope of the helpless

Looks like a drift to the right
For the world we were born in
But the horizon is bright
Yonder comes the morning",King James Version,1996
Billy Bragg,"It's just a northern industrial town
The front doors of the houses open into the street
There's no room for front gardens
Just a two-up, two-down
In a northern industrial town

And you can see the green hills 'cross the rooftops
And a fresher wind blows past the end of our block
In the evenings the mist comes rolling on down
Into a northern industrial town

And there's only two teams in this town
And you must follow one or the other
Let us win, let them lose
Not the other way round
In a northern industrial town

And the streetlights look pretty and bright
From the tops of the hills that rise dark in the night
If it weren't for the rain, you might never come down
To your northern industrial town

And on payday they tear the place down
With a pint in your hand and a bash 'em out band
Sure they'd dance to the rhythm of the rain falling down
In a northern industrial town

And there's plenty of artists around
Painters, steal cars, poets, nicked guitars

Billy Bragg,"Rome never looks where she treads
Always her heavy hooves fall
On our stomachs, our hearts, or our heads
And Rome never heeds when we call

Her sentries pass on ""that is all""
And we gather behind them in hordes
And plot to reconquer their wall
With only our tongues for our swords

For we are the little folk, we!
Too little to love or to hate
Leave us alone and you'll see
How we can drag down the state

Mistletoe killing, an oak
Rats gnawing cables in two
Moths making holes in our coats
How they must love what they do

Yes and we little folk too
We are as busy as they
Working our works out of view
Watch and you'll see it someday

For we are the little folk we
Too little to love or to hate
Leave us alone and you'll see
How we can drag down the state

Yes it is true we are not strong
But we know of Peoples that are
Yes and we'll guide them along
To smash and destroy you in war

We should be slaves just the same
Yes we have always been slaves
But you, you will die of the shame
And then we shall dance on your graves

Billy Bragg,"When I was young I told my mum
I'm going to walk on the Moon someday
Armstrong and Aldrin spoke to me
From Houston and Cape Kennedy
And I watched the Eagle landing
On a night when the Moon was full
And as it tugged at the tides, I knew deep inside
I too could feel its pull

I lay in my bed and dreamed I walked
On the Sea of Tranquility
I knew that someday soon we'd all sail to the moon
On the high tide of technology
But the dreams have all been taken
And the window seats taken too
And 2001 has almost come and gone
What am I supposed to do?

Now that the space race is over
It's been and it's gone and I'll never get to the moon
Because the space race is over
And I can't help but feel we've all grown up too soon

Now my dreams have all been shattered
And my wings are tattered too
And I can still fly but not half as high
As once I wanted to

Now that the space race is over
It's been and it's gone and I'll never get to the moon
Because the space race is over
And I can't help but feel we've all grown up too soon

My son and I stand beneath the great night sky
And gaze up in wonder
I tell him the tale of Apollo And he says
""Why did they ever go?""
It may look like some empty gesture
To go all that way just to come back
But don't offer me a place out in cyberspace
'cause where in the hell's that at?

Now that the space race is over
It's been and it's gone and I'll never get out of my room
Because the space race is over
And I can't help but feel we're all just going nowhere",The Space Race Is Over,1996
Billy Bragg,"Sugardaddy took me to wonderland
Gave me so many presents I could not stand
To see you
I really couldn't stand to see you
Sugardaddy took me far away
On a holiday, I didn't have to pay
Just be there
All I had to do was be there
Sugardaddy comes with his pockets full of fun
Sugardaddy's blowing kisses from his gun
What will he do and where will he run
When the real world comes to town
Sugardaddy took all my pain away
Now I have to say
I'd let him get away with murder
I'd let him get away with murder
He drives a car that doesn't have a roof
He dares the big ol' world to tell him the truth
By buying silence
He buys you silence
Silence, so you'll never ask him why
Silence, so you'll never say he makes you cry
Silence, so you'll never look him in the eye
And say you want his time 'cause time is money
Sugardaddy can't help but overfill my cup
Sugardaddy always rides heavy on his luck
What will he do when his baby grows up
And doesn't want the toys that he's provided?

Way up on the hillside
I'm goin' higher

That's where you'll find me
Over the horizon
Wading in the river

Up on Primrose Hill

About all I'd seen and heard

Billy Bragg,"I wish that I could remember the first moment that we met
If only I could remember that sweet moment when we met
If I knew then that I
Would spend the rest of my life with you
I imagine I would have held your gaze a little longer
When first our eyes met

Did it rain or did sunshine attend out first meeting?
What words were said? what weight given to that first greeting?
My diary doesn't help
I don't even mention your name until that summer
When bloomed the
Seed sown on the first day that we met

I know the date, I know the place where in happened
Yet in my mind the scene I recall is imagined
As we grow old I'm sure
There will be moments that we will not forget
But I would
Remember something of the moment that we met",The Fourteeth of February,1996
Billy Bragg,"Strange as it may seem, I once had my football dreams
But I was always the last one, the last to get chosen
When my classmates picked their teams
I guess that was the way it stayed in every game I played
Life just tripped me and clattered and kicked me
Till you picked me from the parade
Now I feel like I've won the cup every time that we
Make love
Forty-five minutes each way, at halftime I hear a brass
Band play
The boy done good, the girl done better
The seasons turn and we're still together
The sky is still blue and tomorrow is another day
You weren't that kind of a girl who likes her studs to
Be covered in mud
Taking you to the pictures was a regular fixture
For one of life's eternal subs
I tried hard acting tough, but I just can't stand the
Taste of that stuff
Like some macho park player I got in the way of
In some grudge match against his club
But I'm happier how I am today now I've put my
Boots away
I guess I'll never get picked to play my song on match
Of the day",The Boy Done Good,1997

I've led lots of girls since then to stray 
Saying ain't nobody that can sing like me 
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

Billy Bragg,"I was twenty one years when I wrote this song
I'm twenty two now, but I won't be for long
People ask when will you grow up to be a man
But all the girls I loved at school
Are already pushing prams

I loved you then as I love you still
Though I put you on a pedestal,
They put you on the pill
I don't feel bad about letting you go
I just feel sad about letting you know

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl
I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl

I loved the words you wrote to me
But that was bloody yesterday
I can't survive on what you send
Every time you need a friend

I saw two shooting stars last night
I wished on them but they were only satellites
It's wrong to wish on space hardware
I wish, I wish, I wish you'd care

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl

Billy Bragg,"Sailors and soldiers
uniformed shoulders
they're growing older
over the sea

The troops they are leaving
firmly believing
no reason for greiving

Far from the banners,
Far from the glamour,
Far from the planners,
Who sent them to die

herded like cattle
they head for the battle
their rifles will rattle
over the sea

Too young to be shaving
yet the flags they are waving
for the fury they are braving
over the sea

proudly parading
with their medals they are
but their glory is fading
over the sea

Billy Bragg,"The party that became so powerful by sinking
Foreign boats
Is dreaming up new promises because promises
Win votes
And being resolute in conference with the
Ad man's expertise
The majority by their silence shall pay for days like these

The right to build communities is back behind
Closed doors
'tween government and people stands the right arm
Of the law
And shame upon the patriot when the mark of the
Bulldog breed
Is a family without a home and a pensioner in need

Those whose lives are ruled by dogma are waiting
For a sign
The better dead than red brigade are listening on the line
And the liberal, with a small l cries in front of the TV
And another demonstration passes on to history
Peace, bread, work, and freedom is the best we
Can achieve
And wearing badges is not enough in days like these",Days Like These [UK Version],1999
Billy Bragg,"What was that bang
It was the next big thing
Exploding over our heads
And soon the next generation
Will emerge from behind the bike sheds
What are we going to offer 'em
The exact same thing as before
But a different way to wear it
And the promise of a whole lot more

Oh pity the pressures at the top
The tantrums and the tears
And the sound of platinum cash deals 
Ringin' in their ears

Money maketh man a Tory
Don't fire that assumption at me
I like toast as much as anyone
But not for breakfast dinner and tea

So don't saddle me with your ideals
And spare me all your guilt
For a poet with all the answers
Has never yet been built

I see no shame in putting my name
To socialism's cause
Nor seeking some more relevance
Than spotlight and applause
Neither in the name of conscience
Nor the name of charity
Money is put where mouths are
In the name of solidarity

We sing of freedom
And we speak of liberation
But such chances come
But once a generation
So I'll ignore what I am sure
Were the best of your intentions
You were judged by your actions
And not by your pretensions

There's drudgery in social change
And glory for the few
And if you don't tell me what not to say
I won't tell you what not to do",I Don't Need This Pressure Ron,1999
Billy Bragg,"Scholarship is the enemy of romance
Where does that leave me? alone in the rain again
What happened to the weekend I planned with you?
We didn't even get upstairs this time

I never missed that end-of-term kiss
But where did it go, miss? I don't know, miss

Take me to the fair and hold me close as we fly
Through the air
Then suddenly on Sunday, it all just melted away
And when it had gone, between patches of yellowing grass
I found a coin and lost what I was looking for

I never took the advice in that book
Oh you should look, sir, you might learn, sir,
You might learn, sir",Scholarship Is the Enemy of Romance,1999
Billy Bragg,"Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more

She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the back door key
Stepping outside she is free

She
(We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving
(Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home
(We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone for
(Bye bye)
So many years

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs

She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?

She
(We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving
(Never a thought for ourselves)
Home
(We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone for
(Bye bye)
So many years

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She
(What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having
(We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun
(Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied for
(Bye bye)
So many years

She's leaving home
(Bye bye)

It's quite exciting to be sleeping here in this new room
Shirley
You're my reason to get out of bed before noon
Shirley
You know when we sat out on the fire escape talking
Shirley
What did you say about running before we were walking?

Sometimes when we're as close as this
It's like we're in a dream
How can you lie there and think of England
When you don't even know who's in the team

Shirley
Your sexual politics have left me all of a muddle
Shirley
We are joined in the ideological cuddle

I'm celebrating my love for you
With a pint of beer and a new tattoo
And if you haven't noticed yet
I'm more impressionable when my cement is wet

Politics and pregnancy
Are debated as we empty our glasses
And how I love those evening classes

Shirley
You really know how to make a young man angry
Shirley
Can we get through the night without mentioning family?

The people from your church agree
It's not much of a career
Trying the handles of parked cars
Whoops, there goes another year
Whoops, there goes another pint of beer

Here we are in our summer years
Living on ice cream and chocolate kisses
And would the leaves fall from the trees
If I was your old man and you were my misses?

Billy Bragg,"She said it was just a figment of speech
And I said, ""You mean figure?""
And she said, ""No, figment""
Because she could never imagine it happening
But it did.

When we first met I played the shy boy
And when she spoke to me for the first time
My nose began to bleed
She guessed the rest

The next day we went on a bus ride to the ferry
And when nobody came to collect our fares
Well, I knew then this was something special
I couldnâ??t stop thinking about her
And every time I switched on the radio
There was somebody else singing a song about the two of us

It was just like being on a fast ride at the funfair
The sort you wanna get off because itâ??s scary
And then as soon as youâ??re off
You wanna get straight back on again

But our love is strange
And you have to take the crunchy with the smooth I s'pose
She began going out with Mr Potato Head
It was when I saw her in the car park
With his coat around her shoulders that I realized
I went home and thought about the two of them together
Until the bath water went cold around me

I thought about her eyes and the curve of her breasts
And about the point where their bodies met
I confronted her about it.
I said, ""Iâ??m the most illegible bachelor in town.""
And she said, ""Yea, that's why I can never understand
Any of those silly letters you send me.""

And then one day it happened
She cut 'er hair and I stopped lovin' 'er",Walk Away Renee [Version],1999
Billy Bragg,"On Monday I wished it was Tuesday night
So I could wish for the weekend to come
On Tuesday I wished that the night would pass
So I could call you on the phone
Now a man can spend a lot of time
Wondering what was on jack ruby's mind
And time is all I have without you here

On Wednesday when you hung up
It was as much as I could do
To stop from wishing Thursday
Would pass so quickly too
They're out there making history
In the lenin shipyards today
And here I am in the Hammersmith hotel
Wishing the days away

There's always room for one more soul
Down in the human zoo
I don't want you to come here though
I want to come home to you
Somebody's knocking at the door
Its later than I think
And its time to put on these stinking clothes
And get out there and stink

On Friday I wished there was something more
To be seen in the letters you send
On Saturday I wished it was Sunday
Oh will this torment ever end
Sometimes I get a notion to put a torch
To the tools of my trade
Here I am in the Hammersmith hotel

Gobs of spit and condom rubbers on the windows, walls, and doors
