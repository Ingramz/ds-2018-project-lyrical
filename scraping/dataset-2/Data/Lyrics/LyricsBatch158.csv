Nah man I'm not Blood deep or Crip deep or 6 deep or clip deep
How deep? This deep, nine millie clip deep
With this heat, a body builder turn into a pipsqueak
They turn to vegetarians, they don't wanna end up mince meat
You'll see, where the mortuary was at, I know you miss me
Snatch the gat, brrr-at! And lyrically wreck that ass officially
I see you live in fairytales, niggas better switch beefs
I had a tooth fairy choke his ass up outa his sleep
Problem with Chamillionaire? Do they mention any names?
Hell no! You scared crow? Try your best to be brave
Got a Smith & Wesson bro, we know that you gon' behave
Safety, your locksmith, like you could get a key made
You all up on the thang like little girls turning teenage
You really a bunch of hoes like 6th street at Texas relays
Ohio to Chicago, I got niggas in them PJ's
Bully, skinny, but the arms strong like you was BJ's
I hear these rapping niggas but believe I'm not a fan of it
I'm here to rid the rap game of all its contaminants
I'm better than the average, I want her, I can have the chick
Doing the same pose as Paris Hilton in them camera flicks (haha)
The mathematics get big cause I'm demanding it
Raping the rap game while these other suckers is romancing it
They worried about its feelings, they don't wanna take a chance with it
Kissing up to the game with rose petals and a candle lit haha

(""I'm a hustler, I'm a, I'm a hustler"")

Aay
I'm a southern boy, therefore I stunt
Y'all city slickers, we call it country dump
And I'm chilling like a villain off a killing
Looking at the ceilings like I'm a get in for realer
I'm a get it regardless, hard as it is
Who wants to be a millionaire? Know how I'm a get a million
And I'm in the pavilion
Chilling with my girl but I don't speak Sicilian
But we both count the same as
Long as when I say I'm with it, it come out the same as
If I wanna win with it but I'm out the game
Y'all boys trynna get me killed,  huh
You know the Feds are my biggest fans
I got to watch what the little one's saying, man
They see my momma and they wanna pull her over
Cause she ain't got no number on the back of the Rover
And yep, I'm locing
There's cooler ways to die but I'm smoking
There's cooler ways to ride but I'm soaring
Might do the young G5 or G4
Ay, you never know, when your boy might touring
Just trynna get me some air on Mike Jordan
Of this whole thing right here, I'm staring
Y'all boys just appear, I'm here, the Tardis
So applaud him, yeah
Chinky eyes, keep faring
Look like Keith Moorer, street aura, uh
Still I hustled in the street like he poorer
Run up on him you sleep and eat aura
Decent Christians, he owes momma, those
Gucci seatbelts will look better with the barker
Sit up in my office, you need to rebound
You got a box out, get up put a baller on
I'm right back with ya, never leave ya lonely
Forget about Frank momma, I can be your Tony
Weezy F. Baby man",I'm a Hustla,2005
DJ Smallz,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most
(Your heart's beatin')
And the friends that pretend to be your folks
(Your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name
(You're not breathin')
That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

DJ Smallz,"Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My homie Marley used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lotta flirtin involved, but dawg
Fuck all that flirtin, I'm tryna get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

What it do? I'm posted up in the parkin lot, my trunk wavin
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin', you see them screens fallin
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin
I'm leanin on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin somethin candy coated, crawlin like a caterpillar
I'm tippin on them four's, I'm jammin on that Screw
I'm lookin for them hoes baby what it do, drive slow homie

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (Drive slow homie)
If you ridin around the city with nowhere to go (Drive slow homie)
Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know

You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live

And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby it's evident
You see a player flickin, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, ""Just a Lil' Bit"" (just a lil' bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin, through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie drive slow

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie",Drive Slow,2006
DJ Smallz,"We sell, crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk at the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through ""epidodes ii,"" like ""attack of the clones""
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you eagles spread rumors
We survivalists, turned to consumers
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Ask him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like norman mailer
Me and willa raised three daughters all by herself, with no help
I think about a struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words, melt in my mouth
They hot, like the jail cell in the south
Before my nigga core bailed me out
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like bed-stuy through the red sky
With the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some g. rap shit, ""livin' to let die""

This morning, I woke up
Feeling brand new and I jumped up
Feeling my highs, and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin, and stop drinkin
And I've been thinkin, I've got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)

Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by by by by by by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by by by by by by)

We keeping it gangster say ""fo shizzle"", ""fo sheezy"" and ""stayin crunk""
Its easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stay drunk
Yo, I activism attackin the system, the blacks and latins in prison
Numbers of prison they victim black in the vision
Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to
I let them know we missin you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin you
Now, why would I lie? just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The tv got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between venus and mars, the ones that be readin for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the father
They need somethin to rely on, we get high on all types of drug
When, all you really need is love
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like john lennon, ""imagine all the people watch""
We rock like paul mccartney from now until the last beatle drop

This morning, I woke up
Feeling brand new and I jumped up
Feeling my high's, and my low's
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking, and stop drinking
And I've been thinking, I've got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)

Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly

When, the people decide, to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs

Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly",Get By,2006
DJ Smallz,"Yo once a pimp gets threats
That's right, that's the, the that's, that's threats them
And I'm serious about mine, I'm so sincere
And I, nigga I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up
Put ya inside the mattress like drug money nigga

Yeah, I done told you niggas
9 or 10 times stop fucking with me
I done told you niggas
9 albums, stop fucking with me
I done told you niggas
The 9 on me, stop fucking with me
You niggas must got 9 lives
9th wonder

Put that knife in ya, take a little bit of life from ya
Am I frightening ya? Shall I continue?
I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song
I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along
Now it's a duet, and you wet, when you check out
The technique from the 2 tecs and I don't need two lips
To blow this like a trumpet you dumb shit
This is a unusual musical I conducting
You looking at the black Warren Buffett so all critics can duck sic
I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it
Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only ryling me up
For three years, they had me peeing out of a cup
Now they bout to free me up, what you think I'm goin' be, what?
Rehabilitated, man I still feel hatred
I'm young black and rich so they want to strip me naked, but
You never had me like Christina Aguiler-why
But catch me down the Westside, driving like Halle Berry
Or the FDR, in the seat of my car
Screaming out the sunroof death to y'all
You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars
I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head
The whole hood'll want ya, you starting to look like bread
I send them boys at ya, I ain't talking bout Feds
Nigga them body-snatchers, nigga you heard what I said

[Chorus]
I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin
Put your smarts on the side of your garment
Nigga stop fuckin with me
R.I.P.

That's right there nigga, nigga I'm wild
Nigga I keep trash bags with me
Never know when you gotta dump a nigga out
This sincere, this some sincere shit right here!

Grown man I put hands on you
I dig a hole in the desert, they build The Sands on you
Lay out blueprint plans on you
We Rat Pack niggas, let Sam tap dance on you
Then, I Sinatra shot ya God damn you
I put the boy in the box like David Blaine
Let the audience watch, it ain't a thing
Y'all wish I was fronting, I George Bush the button
Front of all you in your car lift up your hood nigga run it
Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it
Your boy got the goods y'all don't want nothing of it
Like, Castor oil, I Castor Troy you
Change your face or the bullets change all that for you
Y'all niggas is targets
Y'all garages for bullets, please don't make me park it
In your upper level, valet a couple strays
From the 38 special, nigga, God bless you

[Chorus]

Yeah I'm threatening ya, YEAH I'm threatening ya!
Who you thank you dealing with?
They call me Chris, nigga I been making threats
Since I been in kindergarten nigga!
Huh, ask about me, see if you ain't heard

When the gun is tucked, untucked, nigga you dies
Like nunchucks held by the Jet L-I
I'm the one, thus meaning no one must try
No two, no three, no four, know why?
Because one's four-five might blow yo' high
You ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God
It's a match made in heaven when I 'splay the 7
Put you on the nigga news, UPN at 11
Where you been, you ain't heard, got the word that I'm
That I'm so sincere?
I'm especially Joe Pesci with a grin
I will kill you, commit suicide, and kill you again
That's right

Uh, what (hehe)
Smoke somethin', bitch
Smoke somethin'

[Pimp C]
I'm up early 'cause my nigga
Don't sell dope after night time.
Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch, holla at yo' bitch,
Now yo' bitch on my team;
Got her buyin' us sticky green
Lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch,
You lookin' at a candy boy.
I done came down Main and popped trunk,
Hit the switch on my candy toy.
We all young ghetto boys,
That's why we act this way.
Tryin' to see a million dollars,
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today.

[Bun B:]
Pro smoke, pro choke,
Anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin'
In criminal court, it's civil.
In the middle of re-al-it-y
Unsolved mys-ter-ies riddle,
Knockin' over fat cats,
And gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles.
On note pads I scribble,
Write rippers that'll make you think.
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity,
Fuck it, take it, trick,
I fake it...blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's

They tellin' me, ""Bun don't go there""
But, man, I just gots to bring it.
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas,
But scared to sing it.
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout
Or smokin' that joint 'bout.
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em
Or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain,
And leavin' stains on cerebellums.
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em
From P.A. to Deep Ellum.
Tell 'em I tol' 'em
Wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em
To hell to heaven.

On a brand new Eldo-reeze,

Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke
When my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch
'Cause I fell in love with my chrome-plated woman.
I love my wood wheel Grant,
'84 Cadillacs that slant,
Slowed-down Screw tapes that knock,
Blowin' on Green private stock.
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks,
Try 20-ounce Angus beef.
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas,
'N got big-ass diamonds off in they teeth.

Sip syrup like it's Lemonade

That's the game we came to play,
It don't change, ain't a thing to say.

It's goin' down in the H-Town,
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound,
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ain't got no time to play, girl;
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk.
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was,
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow.
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go.

Late-night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers,
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee.
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones, guerilla pimpin' at its finest.
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us

Touched like Midas, these bitch-ass niggas they study and bite us.
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show,
And bitch niggas try to fight us.
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch-ass niggas ain't got no cheese?

DJ Smallz,"Go by the name of Weezie F.
An fuck 'em out the belly store with ten bags?
Fly as a muthafucka girly on my staple
'Cause her friends say I'm a tummy sucker
Don't go below the navel
I'm up in Lil' Hatti
I'm blowin' on Jamaica
I'm in the pimper beemer
I'm with a salt shaker
Now I'm in Dade County
I see some thick bitches
I try to holla at 'em
But they all trick bitches
I think Trina sexy
Mama ya wine fine
And on the hush hush
We need some quiet time
Yea I'm a ridah ma
The Birdman's boy
He own cash money
I pre-own cash money
Yea and I put her on cash money
She start wobblin' that ass for me
She start modelin'
She see the models in the Maybach
She call me Weezie F. Baby
And she make sure she say that

See a fly nigga baby, yeah I don't trip
Just give em lil' thigh
Mama give em lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
Give em lil' die
Mama give em lil' hip
Then you give 'em lil' wind up
Give em a lil' dip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Now I'm the daughter of a madam
Inside of a pink phantom
If ya man got that cash
Then best believe I met him
'Cause I'm sharp as a machete
And I cuss like Freddie
Niggas call me Betty Crocker
'Cause my cakes stay plenty
Got stacks on top of stacks
Cup in the meal ticket
No matter the consequence
My emphasis is to get it
It's Trina Weezie F. Baby
Mannie handle the scripts
It's all reminiscent to
Gladys Knight and the Pips
All my niggas jump around
Girls jump on that dick
It ain't gonna be no standin' around
Now lets get crunk in this bitch
And ladies
Show em yo shit
A lil' hip a lil' thigh
More pressure for the eye
And the more a nigga try
You can find me stretched out
In my 850i
Or my big 600
Believe Trina done it
Believe them diamonds studded
Stay flooded like a damn
Chase grams cause I am what I am
Don't give a damn
Go

See a fly nigga baby, yeah I don't trip
Just give em lil' thigh
Mama give em lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
Give em lil' die
Mama give em lil' hip
Then you give 'em lil' wind up
Give em a lil' dip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Back to the lesson at hand
Stick to my plan
When it comes to seein' man after man
Don't give a damn about his car or his friends
Wh Wh Wh Wh What
Cause I'm gonna make my on ends
That's Wh What's up
Ladies lets say you want a man
But don't know how to do it
Dirty dance with em
Put a lil' back into it
Look at yo wall shorty
End up at the mall sporty
Try to dog waddy?
Make em spend it all on ya
Yep and make that nigga ball for ya
Then have him beggin' for that kitty cat
Wining and dining for that ass
Give him none of that
Just let him know
Say make a bitch rich
Cause the badest bitch taught you that

See a fly nigga baby, yeah I don't trip
Just give em lil' thigh
Mama give em lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
Give em lil' die
Mama give em lil' hip
Then you give 'em lil' wind up

DJ Smallz,"Once again up in that south from my motherfucking mouth
And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

[Chorus]
(What, What)
Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

[Chorus]

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

Now right now I want all my hard niggas to follow me, follow me

It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show
It's just a touch, been cool to be friends

I know jealousy is wrong, but the feeling's too strong
And it takes me too long to believe it's not real
So if it's innocent, don't push me into it

And I'll be the friend, hold you together
I'll be forever, will you be mine?

So let me redefine you
And you can see the tide move
Just like tears in the eyes do
And when you're feeling alone
Oh, baby, I'll be right here
Between the sea and silence
So breathe easy my dear
You can find sunshine in the rain

I will come running when you call my name
Even a broken heart can beat again
Forget about the one who caused you pain
I swear I'll love you in a different way

I swear I'll love you in a different way

DJ Snake,"Lover of mine, how have you been?
'Cause it's been a while since the summer began
Where did it go? Gone in a flash
Something on my mind keeps on bringing me back
To us, back to us
'Cause I feel like someone else all by myself, all by myself

Pulling on my sweatshirt, looking at your picture
'Cause that broken summer's hanging over me
Drowning in the sunshine, and I spend a long time
Thinking, girl, you got the best of me
Hopping on a flight, then make it back to Austin
Finding I get lost in all them Autumn leaves
I just walk around now, stranger in my hometown
Broken summer's hanging over me

Broken summer, broken summer
Broken summer, broken summer

Lover of mine, what would it take?
Could I walk the miles off of all our mistakes?
I'm getting tired, too far away
Though I keep on trying, it keeps taking me back
To us, back to us
'Cause I feel like someone else, all by myself, all by myself

Let it be soon, don't hesitate, make love, don't wait.
Open your heart and let my love come in.
I want the moment to start when I can fill your heart 
with more love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy.
Oh honey now, my love will be so sound, 
gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down, 
wear it down, tear it down.
 
This is no fiction, this no act,
This is real, it's a fact.
I'll always belong only to you.
And each day I'll be living to 
Make sure I'm giving you more love and more joy 
than age or time could ever destroy.
Oh honey now, my love will be so sound, 
gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down, 
wear it down, tear it down.
 
As we grow older, no need to fear,
'Cause when you need me I'll be here.
I'll be beside you every step of the way.
A heart that's truthful, and is keeping it youthful 
With more love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy.

You might break a hip
To the sound that`s legit
I`ve come to make a hit

I usually bust scratches with my man, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide
You`re going on a ride
I know the weather`s nice

There`s no need to play the outside
Guess who`s on the flyer
The man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire

Beats are rough and rugged
Pete Rock is the creator
Now I`m busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada

Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up
I save this subject for later
But, it`s time to catch wreck with the creator

I`m addicted like a stoag
Not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there`s a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold `cause I`m busy kickin` rhymes to the rhythm

Fortified with soul `cause that`s what I give `em
Honeys form a line form a line `cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture
Rhymes made of rapture

Far from illiterate
Always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this
Don`t even consider it

Skins when I want `em
But, only when I eat `em
To set the record straight, I`ll be damned if eat `em
Call me Pete Rock

I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow
Because you know I`m good to go

As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator
Just a crowd motivator
But, it`s time to get wreck with the creator

Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this

Now, I`m`a take a try
And get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec
To get some wreck

Never filled with anger
A good body banger
If you try to step to this you`ll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye

Suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can`t see this
My word is beneficial
Pete Rock is the issue

And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch
(Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse

(No question)
Either one, I can`t be seen
Honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around

I`ll show you what I mean
Not an imitator
Just a crowd motivator
But, it`s time to get wreck with the creator

On the streets of the Bronx where my fa mi ly roam 
Hoe damn it  we home  Peter got a nine millimeter 
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater 
I never really liked to play a fool like that 
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat... 
Splat, like Deja Vu 
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew 
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al 
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt 
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged 
Anything less than that, you keep the change 
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke 
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope 
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife 
'Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife 
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her 
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her 
And beat her, niggaz in the Bronx call me Lex 
'Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex 
And I lounge on Lex', and I love sex 
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex

I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments 

On them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us 

I'm comfortable like Ri-carro, two quarters of my life 

Walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by 

Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper 

Than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow

With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo

From, Dusk Til Dawn and it's on, no doubt 

Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about 

And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth

I never let the mic magnatize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line,
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
My rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So eric b, make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric b easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cuz to me, mc means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Saying indeed that I precede cuz my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
If they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
Because I'm better then the rest of them
Eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm,
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

Sort of like like the game show
""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?""
But my name ain't Regis
Nas the one they call
When they want there thing beat up
Honeys' with bodies
With Bravehearts guns in the party
Waves, braids, baldies
Trademarks to army
Is that Horse it must be
I heard he husky
Yeah, there go Jungle eyes red
Looking for trouble
And that's Nas dancing with dimes
But who's his manage
The imperial thug
Is cold deep grand wiz
We taking honeys' to the crib tonight
Guarantee we gon' get up in they rib tonight
Check the new slang
It's changed the braveheart gang bang
When you see me pass
Holla oochie bang bang

[Chorus]

Yeah what up ma
Take a look, you hypnotized
On how my long dick stretch your insides
For real ma, with your thick lips and thick thighs
Stoke both holes, pass it to Nas
Or pass it to Naish, or pass it to Jung
Or pass it to Horse, then that ass gettin tossed
Fuck a hustler book, penthouse or blacktale
I got bitches sendin my niggas flicks in jail
I fuck a bitch face more than her waist for real
And ain't no pussy like new pussy thats how a nigga feel
Bust three times throw her the peace sign
She sleep then my dick sleek and I ain't gotta call her for weeks
Long leg hoes, mo'head hoes, married bitches
Me and my dog, fuckin them both they got us switchin
Is the nigga gangsta? Yeah, that's how I'm livin
That's how I'm playin, I got these freak fuckin hoes singin

[Chorus]

Little young thing go around my dick with your tongue ring
Deep throat my nine inch, gut from the front and
Grind from the side and, fuck from behind and
Grab her hair slap her ass, she screamin' like she dyin'
Make her come four times without even tryin
I'll beat that pussy up there's no denyin
Hit her where she doodie at, make that booty fat
Little cutie rat, walking by with the doobie wrap
Tight blue jeans, air max
Small gucci bag
No loot and no job
Stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho
Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do
You got that good pussy I can share with my peoples
Be a brave girl, do your thang
Let them tities hang, I'll have all the bitches sayin

[Chorus]

When it comes to sex I'm similar to the thriller in manilla
Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleepin in my bedroom
When henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, Caesar gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sippin Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

You don't like how this cat treats you
But still you choose to follow
Right down the path your heart is unwilling to go, baby
Deep inside you know he's not matching
Your heart, your passion, and time invested in him
'Cause it seems he's so hard to find lately

You want something more
But still you ignore
The reasons for love
The reasons that we're here for

What is it you feel you are chasing?
Are you just racing against time?
Why don't you just slow down?
Make sure that your steps are in line, baby

You wonder why his love
Is not stronger as it was
But don't stop your heart
Don't stay just because, lady

I know that you want something special
Why not be careful with your soul?
You keep jumping in and falling in love
Instead of letting it grow-ow-ow-ow

DJ Sploo,"I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind

DJ Spooky,"Make his fight on the hills in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun on they run through the endless gray
On they fight for their right, yes, but who's to say?

For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
? wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain and they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry

Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be blinded eyes to see

DJ Spooky,"We livin' in a mean time and an aggressive time
A painful time, a time where cynicism rots to the vine
In a time where violence blocks the summer shine
Lifetimes, go by in a flash
In search for love, in search for cash
Everybody want to be some fat tycoon
Everybody want to be on a tropic honeymoon
Nobody want to sing a little bit out of tune
Or be the backbone of a rebel platoon
It's too soon to step out of line
You might get laughed at you might get fined
But do you feel me when I say I feel pain everyday
When I see the way my friends gotta slave
And never get ahead of bills they gotta pay
No way no way!
Some make a living doing killing Colombian penicillin
Some are willing to play the villain they just chillin'
To pass the time, pass the information
Or pass the wine
Pass the buck or pass the baton
But you can't pass the police or the pentagon
The I.R.S. or the upper echelon
I think it's time to make a move on the contradiction 

[Chorus]
Bom-Bom, rock the nation
Take over television and radio station

Bom-Bom the truth shall come
Give the corporation some complication! 

This is the dawning of our time I say it one more time
To emphasize the meaning of my rhyme
To rise above all the dirt and grime
Add the right spice at the right time
Fuck the constitution
Are we part of the solution or are we part of the pollution
Sittin' by and wonderin' why,
Things ain't the way we like to find them to be, to be
For you and for me the people over there and the ones in between
Check our habitation are we a peace lovin' nation
Peace lovin' nation
I have a reasonable doubt I think I'll just spell it out
There's no need to scream or to shout
The N.R.A. just bought a man's soul
Then he jumps up and shouts gun control
The government says that killing's a sin
Unless you kill a murderer with a lethal syringe
So I ask again ""are we peace lover's then""
Some of them slang guns when they six years old
Some of them end up in some six foot hole
This whole damn place seems to, lost control
So I raise my voice before I lose my soul

[Chorus]

This is the way I'll express my feelings
Vibe revealed and revolved spinning on a record y'all
Try to confiscate take what I communicate with
It's ancient gift of the lip steady creating
Activating passing vocal vibrations to the blind plus the seeing
Human doesn't mean just being
Be coming don't believe it just belife it
Belongings or beloved rehearse it or recite it
While shining drop your guns and move your tongues
Battle motivation in no time lyrics come
Sometimes fun others run their mouth or away
My mind co beaming like an early sun ray
One day we'll get the picture and all combine
Less the talking bout mines is mine and become one mind
Every piece of the puzzle has its place
To build the piece of the puzzle called the human race 

Taking it long enough we crush the formal journalistic
Dyslexic critters talk backwards to rap words
I'm sure raising my hands with questions and demands
Statements and a plan with a map of the land

Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride

DJ Stein,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most
(Your heart's beatin')
And the friends that pretend to be your folks
(Your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name
(You're not breathin')
That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side
Chamillitary Mayne
And now for The Sound of Revenge

Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

DJ Storm,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Well, what you just do is.

Stop, hatin' on a nigga

I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem,
I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me

And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm a need cheese if I'm bakin' a ziti

Mit blabla noch geiler
Rap ich dir zu weit, bleib' unerreicht für meine Biter
Denn die versuchen mich zu toppen oder stoppen, floppen

Aus dem Schatten will, ans Sonnenlicht
Ein neues Raplabel über Tracks, wie Trips so dope wie Cannabis
Frisch geworfen, weil mein Hirn ständig schwanger ist
High Quality gibt es gegen Party auf Chris

Das ist mein Geschäft
Ich bin mein eigener Chef
Und pass' in kein Passepartout
Ich bin ich du bist du

Mein Lebenslauf lang, seh nicht anders als die anderen aus
Dein ärgster Traum bleib wach bis du liebst was er hat

Erst Spaß, dann Vergnügen, auf den Tod wart' ich echt nich'
Das derbste aus dem Untergrund, mein Lebensstil ungesund
Unbrauchbar für den Zivildienst, untauglich für'n Bund
Der Grund ist einfach, Freaks folgen wie Tiere ihrem Instinkt
Asis lügen derbe wenn die Wahrheit nix mehr einbringt
Bin ich 'n Arsch, XXLarge, so fett wie der Sound klingt

DJ Sven,"We celebrate seven weeks Miker G and Sven
We took a holiday with all our friends
It was a time to relax and let your worries behind
Exactly seven weeks or something crossed my mind
It was the shine of the time we never forget
One morning our parents kicked us out of our beds
We told them it was stupid, don't play the fool
But the answer was short you gotta go to school

G's running up and down and everybody know
Rappin', rockin', poppin' in the street-kid-show
Miker G rocks the house and you know what I'm saying
Now when he's on the mic there will be no delaying
So you better run to see him in your neighborhood
He's rappin', rockin' all the way to Hollywood
Hey, check it out, these are the words we say
Yo, scream with us: we need a holiday

We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Miker G and Sven are here to stay)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Hey, check out the new style we just play)
We are going on a summer holiday
If you want to go, yo, Sven
We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (right)

We are going on a summer holiday
If you want to go, yo, Sven
We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (right)

I wanna holiday, I screamed a lot
Your only thing, school's the only thing I've got
Sven's parents told me I better go
'Cause Sven's hangin' on the street in the street-kid show
In the bar Rox what happened to you?
I told him it's my life and I know what I'm doin'
I saw the school I thought I'd never stay
Give me seven weeks again, I need my holiday

Well, this is my partner with the number one jam
Famous in the Boogie Bronx and Amsterdam
He's the fastest rapper, yo, his name is Miker G
His rap is stronger than the sucker MC's
Well, let me show you what my man can do
Rappin', rockin', poppin' and the boogaloo too
But anyway, no more delay
Just listen to the beat-box he will play

My name is MC Sven, and also deejay
I didn't like the schools, So I took another way
You like the Miker G, I use my voice
And soon I bought a big Rolls Royce

That's right, my name is Miker G
I use the holiday with the M.I.C
On the street was a party bigger than Hollywood
I grew up in this world, started in the neighborhood

We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)

Bite is the thing most rappers do
But I can write my own thing too
I can understand things most rappers say
Cause rappin' is my thing and I do it every day
I'm the number one rapper, yo, my name is Sven
I can rap more raps than a superman can
So I'm the guy on your radio
Also rockin' to the rhythm in stere-ereo

And you don't stop that body rock
And you won't stop that body rock
Yo, spell my name right, I'm Miker G
M-I-K-E-R and ""G, you see
Yo, M is microphone and G's genius
Miker G in the house, that's serious
And you know that, and you show that

DJ Swamp,"I got a little bit of hope
Like a soap on a rope 
Sweeter than sour 
Gettin' thinner by the hour 
Fallin' fast and I'm runnin' out of gas 
Noggin' on your sister smart as Bobby Fisher 
Still I couldn't get arrested 
Though I got more hooks 
Than Madonna got looks 
Just like that AC/DC song, 
C'mon baby, shake me all night long

All I want to do 
Is get up early in the morning 
(Oh I love you baby) 
And all I gotta say to you 
Is your love's extra ordinary 
You're extra ordinary baby 

Somebody pushed me through the door 
I've been sleepin' on the floor 
Thirty one flavors listen to 
The neighbors through the wall 
And a deputant ball 
Use a lot on Visa got a Mona Lisa 
So much for the late brand 
'Cause your money's spent 
And it's cold inside 
Just like that Barenaked Ladies song 
I'm hot like a wasabe when I'm next to your body

All I want to do 
Is get up early in the morning 
(Oh I love you baby) 
And all I gotta say to you 
Is your love's extra ordinary 
You're extra ordinary baby 

(Your love's such a sweet thing 
Your love's such a sweet thing) 

All I want to do 
Is get up early in the morning 
(Oh I love you baby) 
And all I gotta say to you 
Is your love's extra ordinary 
You're extra ordinary baby

Is your love's extra ordinary

DJ Swamp,"First thing I remember was lying in the sand
When a plague of seven horsemen
Came across the desert land
They had one good eye between them
They were burning up the sky
When I asked why they had come for me
The ugly one replied
He told me

Ah, you better recognize
Aw, you better recognize, son

Next thing I recall well
I was hanging from a cliff
When an angel came to rescue
Me and held me in her grip
She said, ""Everyone who's ever loved you
Gets hurt in the end.""
Then she smiled and said, ""Forgive me.""
As she let go of my hand
She told me

(You been living out of pocket, out of your socket)
Ah, you better recognize.
(You been leaning like a Pisa, a moaning Lisa)
Ah, you better recognize, son
(Hip hip for all the busted, we are entrusted)
Ah, you better recognize
(You come a pleading, but it's too late
We can't hear you're on the list now!)
And let your dim light shine

Always darkest before the morning light,
Lord knows you ain't that bright
Better let your dim light shine

Just before I hit the ground
I woke up in my bed
I was dazed and I was weary
And my heart was full of dread
When I looked at my reflection
I was horrified to find
There were seven horsemen next to me
The angel close behind
They told me

(You been living out of pocket, out of the socket)
Ah, you better recognize
(You been leaning like a Pisa, a moaning Lisa)
Ah, you better recognize, son
(Hip hip for all the busted, we are entrusted)
Ah, you better recognize
(You come a pleading, but it's too late
We can't hear you're on the list now!)

DJ Swamp,"Self abuse help produce black magic 
Deeply depressed I'm the best that's tragic
You don't really wanna get me all fired up

It goes: red bull and vodka
I'm a psycho like chopper
Glorify the gangster whether handcuffed or locked up
Drink pepsi-cola same friends still rolling
Still swollen, only difference is the heat that I'm holding
You don't really wanna get me all fired up
You'll be the one that ends up with his mouth wired shut
High voltage cause power outages
Set a bad example for the youth
How bout it kids
Madchild's starting an army who wanna join it
Warriors raise your fists if you enjoying it
Soldiers of fortune, chainsaw massacre
Brain react fast when a maniacs after you
Guilt stirs in the silence of my room
Cant hold back with god, still sin follows through
Black jack, fire arms, foreign cars, trying hard
Forest fires, horrified, war cries, iron bars

Black magic, spit life with every breath,
Not likely to forget, its like we never left
Black magic, the worlds screaming for change
Who's feeling this pain, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, you feeling the same pain
Cant fear what we don't understand
Gone back down beneath, heads high, upperhand
Black magic

The dark arts, incantations and spell craft
Circles and stars the same fury that hell hath

De humani corporis fabrica
The structure of the human body, welcome to gattaca
Twin girls in the hallway, elevators of blood
Spin words like spider's silk burn when the fires built
Doves fly, straight from the hands of a replicant
Run the blade futuristic cities of the heaven sent
I'm home melted chrome and twisted metal
Surrealist literature from the seamless vessel
The dark arts incantations and spell craft circles and stars
The same fury that hell hath
Feathers of an osprey, leather glove of the falconeer
Treasure chests of gold, tales told then you all come near
Photons and gammas, rays and beams
Sailed with jason and the argonauts in ancient leagues
The lords of the hidden world seance and candlelight
Connections to spirits that dance in the afterlife

Black magic, spit life with every breath,
Not likely to forget, its like we never left
Black magic, the worlds screaming for change
Who's feeling this pain, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, you feeling the same pain
Cant fear what we don't understand
Gone back down beneath, heads high, upperhand
Black magic

Shane's brain a hurricane, it's a death march
Never let your dream die, that's the best part
Stormrider man I snap like a pit
Axe murderer, get hacked up to bits
Muscle car, hardbar, heineken, pornstars, tourbus
Truck stop, iron horse, motor cross
Mad paints a poetic self portrait
Warlock that rocks still locked in fortress

Contortionists, swallowers of knives and fire-eaters
Nonconformist performers that wont change
And I wont either
I can see the future like nostradamus
A bridge over troubled waters
Something wicked this way comes
The scythe and the hour glass in a capsule of morphine
Drag chains around the castle grounds
Dressed in darker clothing
Pit and the pendulum, serpent and the rainbow
My lineage the arrow, my bloodline the crossbow

Black magic, spit life with every breath,
Not likely to forget, its like we never left
Black magic, the worlds screaming for change
Who's feeling this pain, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, you feeling the same pain
Cant fear what we don't understand
Gone back down beneath, heads high, upperhand

You caught me smilin' again

Hangin' loose 'cause you ain't used

You caught me smilin' again

I'll be gone and it won't take you long
To climb a tree about me

You caught me smilin' again

I spent all my love for you
It's all used up.
You took all with you
There's nothing left.
Everywhere I go I think of you
No matter what I do
You're always on my mind.

Walking down these empty streets
Where are you and now I'm feeling down
'Cause half of me has gone.
I'm feeling all these tears from you
Now that I am alone they're streaming out
How can I go on?

Finally I realize
You won't come back to me
What can I do?
When everything reminds me of you.

Everything I gave to you
You have taken it all
Oh everything I gave to you
You have taken it all.

Innocent of all, the world that's so bad
It`s no wonder that it's so wrong
When they are alone in truth they aren't that strong

Children, children, expectations great and small
From afar, we see them fall
Children, sweet children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through?

Where have all of the children gone?
Thought to be a ware of dangers out there
In the streets and in the schools
In a world so cruel who keeps changing all the rules

Children, children, expectations great and small
From afar, we see them fall
Children, sweet children, who'll be watching out for you
Who'll be there to guide you through?

Where are all of our children now?
Some hungry abused neglected confused
Hey little girl is your mama home
No I'm all alone, these are the words that say it all

For the lyrical Jason of rap i'ma keep comin' back

Motherfuckers actin' like they don't know me
But they know just who I am, I'm a motherfuckin' killa gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand
'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murda, the realest nigga that you ever heard of
Motherfuckers actin' like don't the deal
But they know just what to do
Everybody talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you
I'm a killer, a mass murda, the realest nigga that you ever heard of

The lyrical assassin the pocket I got in
I be attackin' the track
And I got a package of the good
See a legendary representa for the city
'Cause I put it down ever since I been rappin' in the hood
17 years of goin' and flowin'
And showin' these niggas when it come to beatin' me nobody could
I was spittin' venom ever sense the days U-G-K been rappin'
And talkin' about puttin' diamonds on the wood

Pullin up in a old Cadillac before I got some thangs
And I got that gwap and the numba one spot now I ride a range
And because I spit that crack is the reason we got some change
And if we ain't makin' money off rap then we got them thangs

Got the 8 dollar hollas two for 15's
A 4 and a split a nine piece so you can hit the whole brick
How I win it by makin' a 100 every summer
Pullin' up in the hummer can make a nigga so sick
How we constantly come up with hits and steady be gettin' fans
Is only because a nigga flows sick
Showin' no debate everybody know I'm great
Any muthafuckers that hate can suck my dick

Motherfuckers actin' like they don't know me
But they know just who I am, I'm a motherfuckin' killa gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand
'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murda, the realest nigga that you ever heard of
Motherfuckers actin' like don't the deal

Bizzy Bone, you know what it is baby
After Platinum Records
Let's get this money '07 style

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Mon-eyyyyyyyyyy, mon-eyyyyyyyyyy, mon-eyyyyyyyyyy
Gotta get that money money, gotta get that money money money money
Mon-eyyyyyyyyyy, mon-eyyyyyyyyyy, mon-eyyyyyyyyyy
Gotta get that money money, gotta get that money money money money money

[Bizzy Bone]
I don't give a fuck what they sayin!
Buck buck buck buuuuuuck!

I'm ridin a Caddy and daddy I'm rollin it sadly, but I don't mind
If they laughin at me the movie I hardly think that they be singin singin
I never gave up on my lady, but she still ain't listenin to me
Gotta let them 24's spin, chins ain't chippin or flippin
And let me get another victim again, gain-gain-gain-gain
Whether they don't gimme any Henn' or befriend them, when they say I was
But I been right here 'cause, you know what it is, you know what it was
So they wanna move dude, what'chu gotta do, who? Not me
I said I'm glossin, and who you thought of flossin baby
Baby I'm not 'Pac though, and I'm not God, no!
But I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Mo' money money money money money money, in the face of the crowd
Plottin now, I don't need no pride to hide, oh wow, oh wow
Mo' money money, in the face of the crowd
Plottin now, I don't need no pride to hide, oh wow
But baby I'm not 'Pac, no! (buck buck buck buck buuuuuuck!)

[Chorus]

[Twista]
You knocked out by the Windy City southpaw
No cookin in the kitchen homie we put out raw
Midwest outlaw, fuck with it? I doubt y'all
Somewhere between Chi-Town and Cleveland is where they found y'all
Rollin through the alley in a Caddy
Blowin Cali to the haters, oh what a pity
When they hit a nigga, Twista rockin city after city
They gon' ask, ""Is he doin it with Bizzy?""
And you know why they done that (why?)
Because we two of the coldest motherfuckers
To spit these fast lyrics on one track
Buck 'em with a lyrical bullet in the body
Because I gotta get the fire know the shit don't stop
Pull up in a Lamborghini or the Ferrari
I know I gotta get the props, cause I gotta get the drop
Gotta get the dough and get the money money
I could really feel it when I hear they comin for me
Try to get it if you think you feelin kinda lucky
Twin glocks so you know you better bring a buddy
And I got the ammunition for anybody
That wanna go against the Midwest Militia
A whole clip at the competition for Bizzy
A whole clip at the competition for Twista
A whole clip at the world, because it's us against
And then this shit about to get ugly
For static, I'ma hit 'em with an automatic
Run and do murder after murder, but I'm a baller so I gotta get

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Buck buck buck buuuuuuck!

Me and my brother Twista gettin it crunk
And drinkin that Goosey, with 'em a brew
Doin whatever we wanna do, get to the club, ain't nobody knew
Thought that we beefin they try to divide the truth
Talk about who really started the style
How 'bout everyone livin in harmony, look at the army now
General 7, the belly is purest and we gonna get it at heaven
We dancin our way to the gates, if you comin with me we'll need every Muslim
We human, we're all in the brethren
Veteran deep in the city I pity the fool who jump out of this fake
What do I look like massagin the thought
When they come with the matrix and say that we 'fraid
We'll never break, 'member that conny and Twista
We're gonna go through the fire
Never expire, give it the way that they want it
They'll front on you if you tired (what about)
Money you tell me what's money to you, pay for the rappers and corporates
The office that burn wood, but the burn good and the brain wave
Puts the energy certainly, I don't have time for emergencies
Baby the word and we walk with the covenant
Party and poppin the melody baby, I know that the ladies be lovin it
Brush the dust, enemies way, get 'em a drink, we look too lovely
The spirit is present and never be hesitant
Twista and Bizzy, we gettin this money nucca

Bing bang, I saw the whole gang dancin' on my livin' room rug (yeah)
Flip flop, they were doin' the bop, all the teens had the dancin' bug
There was Lollipop with Peggy Sue

To run away

Destination far off and foreign

Take a souvenir to remind me of
The ones that love

Running out of time with each tick tock

Burn me a fire
Rest something in my empty hands
Fill it with light
Fill me tonight

Up until dawn
Sweat on your palms
Feeling you poor me in out in
Under again
Under my skin
Guiding me through this hall of fears

Sweet things build on these
Sweet things build on me
Sweet things build on these
Sweet things bring to me

Sing in my head
Omnipotent
Circling momentum round and round
Quenching my thirst
First for my thought
Second to fill my silent mouth

Release the energy and take it for a ride
Make it to a run speed, pushing it to the edge
I am supernova and tonight I wanna forget!

Wanna fall off and do it

Take my thoughts with you and when you look behind
You will surely see, a face that you recognise

I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind, surely its plain to see
Your not alone
I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely its time to be with me

It is the distance that makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close now so many miles apart
I will not falter though, I hold on to your hope
Safely back where you belong
And see how our love has grown

I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh

Filled the car 'till it couldn't take it

Reached for my wallet, uh-oh, a bolo

Seeing high hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is her reputation
If school is sex, she's the graduation

Touching, holding, heavy breathing
I knew I'd get her, she's mad about teasing
Left on the light so I could see reaction
Amy's a freak, guaranteed satisfaction

She's as soft as a bubble bath
I'm as hard as Chinese math
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out the packet, got my protection

Rolled it up in one hard stroke
It was my last thing, yes, it broke (ah)

Let me be your own, I'm on the microphone
There's a lot of people tryin' to be a Flava clone

Sein erster Reim gab ihm den Kick
Der Groschen fiel es machte „klick“
Ja, in diesem Augenblick war klar wo seine Zukunft liegt
Er musste auf die Bretter, die die Welt bedeuten
Wollte rocken wie die anderen Rapper vor ganz vielen Leuten
Jahre ist es her, der Anfang der ist immer schwer
Wie Schönheitschirurgie und Cher, das Mic und er, es wurden mehr
Immer immer mehr, die zu seinen Shows kamen
Immer immer mehr, die danach geflasht warn

Wenn er in die Menge schaut mit Funkeln in den Augen

Hang on
Holding on to your pride

But it won't get you what you want

Life will bring you up 
Life will put you down
Life will build you up
And then burn you down

I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground

There's no need to be unhappy

Young man, there's a place you can go
I said, young man, when you're short on your dough
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find 
Many ways to have a good time

Young man, I was once in your shoes
I said, I was down and out with the blues
I felt no man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so tight 

That's when someone came up to me
And said, young man, take a walk up the street
There's a place there called the YMCA
They can start you back on your way

Movin On-Movin On-Movin On
I'm Movin On-Movin On-Movin On

(DJ you-NEEK)
I escape from outta state I gotta date with big scrilla
the top billa, lampin rockin mansion and a villa
punany killa o' mighty dealer with mean stacks and green backs
lampin with a team of phat cats
but them dirty rats sceemin tryin to snatch up the capital
mad cause they know I'm stackin doe international
it's untouchable so they besta be jetti
cause a nigga don't play when your messin with my fetti
I'm ready, to do this my way, hit the highway
crusin with control, let the AC blow
it's all about the doe and nothin less for sho
and when my pockets get low I'm on a quest for mo
cause yo, life ain't the same without the ends
cause money buys friends and a hole lot of skins 

Chorus:
(NYT OWL)
Cause everybody's lookin for somethin
Some of them want to use you, (I'm movin on)
Some of them want to be used by you, (movin on)
Some of them want to abuse you, (I'm movin on)
Some of them want to be a-bused, (Oh......)

(DJ you-NEEK)
Hoes be layin on their backs just to stack a phat purse
but what's worse than your fella curse by the versa tella
a soul sella, hangin out for the clout, 
probably blow my brains out and hopes them chains fall out
I wouldn't doubt it, bye
niggas be actin shady 
so I pack a 380, yo black, don't try to play me,
its crazy, to see your homie flip on some bogus shit
only stick around cause this shorties on my dick,
so take a lick sis your on your knees already
they thinkin petty, hypnotized by the fetti,
with your eyes steady, locked on what I got
tellin the block that I changed cause I came up on a ????
they must forgot when I rose sellin smoke
tryin to make an end we wasn't hangin tight then

Chorus
(DJ you-NEEK)
Money bless, but money ain't the key to success
the only thing that changed was my name and address
now I dress to impress, the ladies I caress
fuck the stress I got to live life at it's best
but nevertheless, snakes want to put me to the test
cause they depress, broken smokin to much cess
so they manifest, jealousy and envy
and that will be the cause of another felony
see friends turn to foes, and foes is enemies,
and enemies is fleas so they got the tendencies
to try to seize, all your geez and assets
but I smash threats like a blast for the tec
so show respect, and get respect in return
it ain't hard to earn, but some niggas will never learn

Chorus
Everybodies lookin for somethin, said ya gonna be used, they want to be 
abused, I just want to keep on movin, movin, movin, movin, Oh, movin on, 
Oh..., I'm movin on, movin on, movin on, I said movin, I'm movin on, 
movin, movin, movin on, movin on, I'm movin on, Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohoh Yeah, 
I'm movin on, movin on, I just got to keep on movin, I just got to keep 
on movin........

DJ U-Neek,"What nigga drop that shit
Soldier, say K-L
These fake ass rap niggaz thought I lost it yet
I'm bout to let these old bitch ass niggaz know I got a game in my vein

[Verse 1:  Mac]
Murda murda I wrote it in braile
Uncut, lyrical dope, certified by my scale
The homicide rapper, there'll never be another after
The Mac's rapture, I represent, that's what I'm on the map for
Who the fuck gonna fuck with the scandalous
1-8-7 on these mothafuckin amateurs of rap
Feel the wrath of a nigga who bust
Makin my clique the shit, bitches want to discuss
?Platonic?, the lyrical killins don't got no motives
In this, in my vein, ain't no way I can control it
When this inside of me is as deadly as them niggas
You know the ones who killed them boys and dumped the body in the river
I enter the place, ski mask covered my face
If they pass me the mic, I'm gonna catch a case
In this mothafucka ya heard of me
T-T and herb hit the spot?
All the niggas I know is Shell Shocked

[Chorus:  Mac]
I got the game in my vein
Won't change
I got the game in my vein
Won't change
I got the game in my vein
Won't change
I got it, I got it

Verse 2:  Mac
I was born in it and represented
The sinister words of murder was the sons of bitches who was wit it
Never die, my motto, fatigue my sheet
Big Wise that's my nigga, Psycho Ward is my clique
Affiliated with cash, got my foot on the gas
Tailgatin real fast, through my sun roof my verbal gun shoot
Them scriptures, paint the pictures
We believe was cops tryin to catch me like receivers
Scream my name, to all these bitches who be hard to tame
Momma said it's a shame, poppa gave me the game
Experience a soldier, my heart pumps battle fluid
You want to go to war let's get to it
Mac-a-don, put you on teflon style of murder
Deadly as the killer kyle in your hamburger
Till they bury me black, wrapped up in street camo
I rock the microphone strapped off with street ammo

[Chorus:  Mac]
I got the game in my vein
Won't change
I got the game in my vein
Won't change
I got the game in my vein
Won't change
I got the game in my vein
Won't change

[Verse 3:  Mac]
I'm the bad nigga from the bricks
Blood on my kicks
Camoflauged niggas never die, we drop hits
I spit the gospel, to all of my mothafuckin apostles
Mac as potent as the coke snortin in your nostrils
I minister, words of a mothafuckin sinister
Transform into Liu Kang and finish ya
Nigga put me in the game I'ma show you my sports
Witness the street level on the be	-ball court
Bitch I'ma die wit it, cause it's a part of my vein
Hear that word camoflauge when you hear my name
So tell them niggas I'm back affiliated, enemy lines are penetrated
My niggas wit me
You cook me up, put me in the pipe, hit me
Spread me in every ghetto, every city, I get busy
And buck, my name Mac remember that, I drop rhymes
Nigga it's Mac as if you missed it the first time nigga

DJ U-Neek,"Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong
Doctor, doctor, I'm out of time
And I keep looking for a sign
I keep getting closer, closer, closer to the other side
I think I'm running out of time, running out of time
Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on

Can you me where I'm going
Am I going down
What am I supposed to feel
Am I having doubts
Life is not always showing
Am I safe and sound
The truth and what is really real
See I'm living all alone
Playing solitaire 
But it's kinda hard
When all the cards ain't there
And I'm starting to dig
All the voices inside my head
Yeah

Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong
Doctor, doctor, I'm out of time
And I keep looking for a sign
I keep getting closer, closer, closer to the other side
I think I'm running out of time, running out of time
Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on

Seems I am always thinking 
Of many things
Of how my life used to be
I'm doubting me
Before my world started sinking
I don't wanna drown
I used to feel so free
But now my back's against the wall
Can't see light at all
Every time I try and play pool
It takes my ball
And I don't care about nothing at all
Yeah

Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong
Doctor, doctor, I'm out of time
And I keep looking for a sign
I keep getting closer, closer, closer to the other side
I think I'm running out of time, running out of time
Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on

Bizzy Bone:

And you're losing your mind 
Trying find out what's going on
Whole wide world
Baby get up 
But she's hurt all over
And you're losing your mind 
Trying find out what's going on
Whole wide world
Baby get up 
But she's hurt all over

But I'm still fly, love four by fours
Cause they ride like a toy, steady jumpin the curb
Pedestrians like ""oh boy"" I can sing, rap DJ
Work the instant replay
""Even though I'm slurrin my voice"" like I was Freeway
Get it right 'cause-o, I keep the rhymes runnin
Kind of terror FBI don't even see comin, motherfuckers

Ashes is ashes and dust to dust

Rampage nigga, I'm a sick man
Chop you in your face, cut off both of your hands
Wrap your body up, put it in a sedan
Drop yo' ass in a river, this is how I deliver
Got the maggots just eatin your liver, untold mystery
Your name is Swany River, you not a legend
Youse one dead nigga, six feet under
Never comin back, one year later
This is real facts (yeah) tell the feds

Keep eatin donuts and drinkin that coffee

Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs

Not happen between these thighs
Not happen between these thighs
The real revolution ain't about booty size
The Versaces you buys, or the Lexus you drives
And though we've lost Biggie Smalls
Baby your notorious revolution
Will never allow you to lace no lyrical douche, in my bush
Your revolution will not be killing me softly, with Fugees
Your revolution ain't gonna knock me up without no ring
And produce little future emcees
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not find me in the backseat of a jeep
With LL, hard as hell, you know doin it and doin it and doin it well
Doin it and doin it and doin it well, nah come on now
Your revolution will not be you smacking it up, flipping it, or rubbing it down
Nor will it take you downtown or humpin around
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not have me singing, ain't no nigga like the one I got
And your revolution will not be sending me for no drip, drip VD shot
And your revolution will not involve me, feelin your nature rise
Or helping you fantasize
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
No no, not between these thighs
Oh, my Jamican brother, your revolution will not make you feel bombastic
And really fantastic
And have you groping in the dark for that rubber wrapped in plastic
You will not be touching your lips to my triple dip of french vanilla, 
Butter pecan, chocolate delux
Or having Akinyele's dream, m-hmm a 6-foot blowjob machine m-hmm
You want to subjugate your queen? uh-huh
Think I'm a put it in my mouth, just 'cause you made a few bucks?
Please brother please
Your revolution will not be me tossing my weave
And making me believe I'm some caviar-eating ghetto mafia clown
Or me giving up my behind, just so I can get signed
And maybe having somebody else write my rhymes
I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown
You know I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown
Your revolution makes me wonder, where could we go
If we could drop the empty pursuit of props and ego
We'd revolt back to our Roots, use a little Common Sense
On a quest to make love De La Soul, no pretense
But your revolution will not be you flexing your little sex and status
To express what you feel
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Will not happen between these thighs
Will not be you shaking and me *yawn* faking
Between these thighs
Because the real revolution, that's right I said the real revolution
You know I'm talking about the revolution

Or me giving up my behind, just so I can get signed
And maybe having somebody else write my rhymes
I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown

You know I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown
Your revolution makes me wonder, where could we go
If we could drop the empty pursuit of props and ego
We'd revolt back to our Roots, use a little Common Sense
On a quest to make love De La Soul, no pretense

But your revolution will not be you flexing your little sex and status
To express what you feel
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Will not happen between these thighs
Will not be you shaking and me *yawn* faking

Between these thighs
Because the real revolution, that's right I said the real revolution
You know I'm talking about the revolution
When it comes, it's gonna be real
It's gonna be real

It's gonna be real
When it finally comes
When it finally comes
It's gonna be real, yeah yeah",Your Revolution [DJ Nappa Remix],2000

Puffed any green seteva I can hit and dough the chocolate
Sat with wise mentor sit and talk a bit of the apocalypse
And how to make this world that's about to end a bit more positive
The first, his voice was rough and needed some throat lozenges
He offered his opinion, youthful with expression, talkative
The second one had more method with; he moved and plodded with
He said the world has cheated karma and must be now audited
The third one seemed a bit more centred as he led us on a ship
He said something's just can't be and found we exist as onuses

How the hell did you get over as an emcee
Now the dialogue injectors they simply
And I respect those that hold it against me

Stayed cool amongst tools and fake fools
Gave jewels to use from cradle to grade school
To the grave and still wade through the pools of

Nothing can fuck w/ the way it goes around

First off focus, figure out why you wrote it
What's the motive, what you use to grow it
Do the people want it, do they need it
Or would they rather that you keep it
Is the party not poppin', or at least a couple of heads noddin'
Does the pass or fail depend on whether or not a check's gotten
Is it the laughter, the love, the hope
Is it the aspiration to make other rappers think you're dope
Is it the fans, the adoration of devils and angels
The hunger, you want more than left over eggroll
Shit, I made a video, I ain't even got cable
So if you ain't down w/ what we do you better lay low
My future's made of play dough, past is made of stone

And it lead me to believe the 3d that I breathe
Through the TV and the CD be the need to grit the teeth

Spread the wingspan, staring at the ocean like it was a woman
Hoping that she'll let me run my toes through her pink sand

Just another baggy pants sweat shirted misfit

DJ Vadim,"I'm vexed and perplexed like Malcolm X
On stage with chains around their necks
From the thread of the governments evil flex
I'm taking steps against the kind of lies they try to bring me
As a ? soldier with ?
Daily papers they're just propaganda scriptures from the government
It's not the daily news, it's the daily satanical supplement
Cause they don't deal with holy testaments just war and pestilence
Can I get a witness I don't need one in fact there's too much evidence
Spying on the people lying evil little devils
They're recruiting demon soldiers while they execute our rebels
CCTV cameras set up on no man's borders
They're not for law and order, they're Lucifer's camcorders
Politicians they're not concord borders they're using flying saucers
Decide to take to the sky or travel underwater
Chameleon type reptilians moving they're tongues like geckos
And they're trying to turn our ghettos into over sized death rows
You want heroin there's tons of that, guns and crack
But who's got the funds and cash the same people who supply guns to Iraq
They're pimping the public like rent boys prostitutes and hookers
Bringing strain to the brain as you remain in this giant pressure cooker
Behind your back trying to took your promise the world and overlook us
Spreading the evil love of Beelzebub, these human race butchers
Mankind destroyers, life I'm chasing those Freemasons
Chasing 'em back to the place of birth to reverse all of their creations
Scientists give us fabrication of mathematical equations
But the square root of my truth will cause the devil devastation

Well listen I'm more than vexed
I live in a time where I can't afford to flex
The police are stopping and searching just like some illegal border checks
You better beware we're living inside of lucifers era
My cypher's been scientifically sent back in time to prepare ya
So start stoning the Babylonians to show you're controlling then
Cause this Babylon been fueling my anger just like petroleum
I'm scolding them with the hard rhymes from a scarred mind
From living amongst the hard times
Where people just working through all of the serpentine
The devils disciple that stifle our plans for freedom
If wee keep conforming to all these laws set by the demons
They're thinking they're intellects
By plugging the whole world with the internet
If they thinking they got me they're information be incorrect
I'm using my third eye to guide I through the wilderness
Cause the system in Babylon's bad and there's enough people that's skilled in this
I'm vexed with the devils descendents with paganist pendants
For having the lack of faith and a disregard for repentance
My lyrical sentence is longer than people that's charged for child sex
Cause all the disordered leaders are into having a wild flex
I'm vexed with the government sects for giving this minimum wage
And working this nine 'til five bringing heat to my simmering rage
I spit this lyrical wisdom to charge down the Babylon systems
The rebellious Rastafarian that's flinging his fist to the system

Listen Atti if the devil tries to take Selassie
Put some you lose more blood than the face of Arturo Gati
I'm a raw rhyming anti smoking idol keeping it tribal
While reading pages of the bible to gain vision as a disciple
Studying at rasta night school while using my tongue as a rifle
Sniping you worse than the bible cause life I'm all about survival
I spitting my violent recitals so bright that they melt your eyeballs
Turning the Anti-Christ suicidal wrestle the devil like Shawn Michaels
The clash of the titans will over crush the devil and take his title
Phi-Life will remain his messengers cause a rasta revival
No time to idle the rastas are rising black we come to wipe out crack
Paint the Whitehouse black and speak real fast to the children
Expose our government foes who know the truth will never be told
They teach the people the root of all evil while they're stashing all of the gold
Attacking their souls and spirits until your life is finished
Phi-Life I spit the righteous lyrics
Chained the minds of the cynics held the blind endemic
Cause when I talk my vocal is blessed with holy powers
Making the devils cower while shaking the foundations of the Babylon tower
I terminate them like T2 when I spit my scriptures in Hebrew
A politicians not an honest man like a hologram he be see-through
Trying to deceive you lead you up the path so that they can feed you
Phi-Life I'm a friend of races representing the rasta nation
So when we flex on a rhythm we draw on the powers of the law of exorcism
Inject the rhythm of the holy serum purify all the fat cats
Who experiment on innocent lives of people like they were monkeys or lab rats

My sound tear the transponders out of your pounds
And explode Babylon satellites that scanning down to the ground
With the type of coast to reveal we're living under a microscope
My cipher be strangling Babylonians with the tightest rope
I'm fringing the violence you can fuck with living with silence
Cause before long they be forcing us into buying a breathing license
I'm dissing authority with my forces of purity
I piss in the parliament and I fart on the face of conformity
I never fill in the government census they cunningly sent us
It's asking me information like what I ate for my breakfast
Cause we the Messiah that's bringing more fire to the empire
With the type of tribal recitals that's setting Satan on fire
We're culling the paganist shaman the Phi-Life Cypher will slay them
Reveal the seventh seal to start the freemason complaining
With positive action infiltrates into paganist factions
I smashing your PlayStation and all these tools of distraction
With adequate satisfaction I smashing Babylon's walls

submerged in the word like Atlantis to plant this seed, we feeding of the Root of David
and finally freed from enslavement see this is where the pavement
meets the path and the power principles of purity are unmasked at last our direction is that of the outcast
out lasting temptation like the thirty day fast redeemed from the past renamed in the present
i sing to the King Who came as a Peasant offering that pleasant state of humility
the light of the world with the strength and the ability to transform norm to extraordinary
making prophets out of prosecutors if necessary and rags to revolution poetry from pollution
felon to family man problem to solution and the solution is clear
the revolution is near no more confusing people with fear the constitution appears to make freedom a right
but you know its only found in the sun light i say you know its only found in the Son right
i got one aim One Love and one mic...come on

Hook
at a lost for words i heard something in my mind sing (lala..lala..la.la)
without a care in the world i stand firm on a cloud singing (lala..la..la.la.la) waking up at the dawn i had a song in my heart it goes (la..la..la..la.la.la)
i found peace in a vision of love and yo it

Rez
is it deliberate intention to rush to our destruction
is self hate the face that need's not introduction
is what we're fighting for just what we're wring for
these notes i write are more just line me behind a metaphor
scripting with a purpose the fire that's burning
yearning to show us the light in times that's uncertain
the struggles so fragile being reduced to gravel the built back again
a breathe of live refreshing a dead mannequin a new man
begins a new champion claims the win for the team
well versed in the lessons of hurt it's extreme insecurities
we have are written right on our sleeve like…
tabs of acid name brands and badges and birth control
give in medicinal patches addiction is fashioned acceptable
actions from sociable addict
living this sickly image in this modern day Rome we murder our own
die by the cell phone and yet we can't can not connect that buying gem stones
does not reflect or make a good home
government judging the world by the way that we live and yet our parents are afraid of our kids
teachers would rather suspend in stead of listen to 'em

song to sing to put my mind at ease ",Simple Song,2006

Beginning, today

World has turned over many times
And it transformed the history of men
In the will or the skill to fight
We're ready to take part
But now further direction is required
Tonight a battle has been join
We will not fail
Regrettably, we know believe that only force will make them live.

I just wanna say this right now
That regardless of what they say about it
There's nothing new, only different!
Never forget this, the future is to those who take it
All I say is that noting is easy, and the best things are the hardest.

That isn't enough, it is madness!

I dream things that never were and say why not.

DJ Vance Wright,"Here we go
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good
There lived a lil' boy who was misled
By anotha lil' boy and this is what he said
""Me, Ya, Ty, we gonna make sum cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why did ya hit me ?""
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigga""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radioes it to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked around good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova (?)
Raced up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead""
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
He dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path,
Straight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast(?)

It is with outstanding pleasure
that we are here to present tonight,
Slick Rick, the Ruler!  And MC Ricky D!
Doing their smash hit, ""Mona Lisa,""
you know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out
to bow before his divine majesty

Oh your majesty
Hmm?
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hm
(kisses his hand loudly)
Enough!
Come your highness, they await you

Well, it was one of those days, not much to do
I was chillin' downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store, to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona, what?
Mona Lisa (what?) Mona Lisa, so men made you..
You know what I'm sayin?  So I said, ""Excuse me, dear
my gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money
I'll buy that slice!""
She said, ""Thanks, I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you""
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (ping!) I almost blinded her
She said, ""Great Scott!  Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth""
Ha-ha, hah!  Had to find that funny
So I said, ""No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief?  Please!  Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet""
She almost got cut short, you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect who?!  The Grand Wizard
Me!  ""Well what's your name, son?""
""MC Ricky D,"" but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
""I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past""
She said, ""Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin""
A virgin?!  Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin, with her yea wide gap
I said, ""It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky,
R, ravishing
I, impress
C, Courageous; so careless
K, for the Kangols which I've got
that I wear everyday and
Y, why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm
quite polite like Walter Cronkite""
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, ""Hey Rick, don't you know playin' with these snakes is a sin?!?""
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, ""I don't want to see you playin' with these lowlifes no more!
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of her friends""
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!
And as we were leavin' and drivin' along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song

""If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry, each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye,
You walked on by..""",Mona Lisa,2001

And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all

when the love is making you high 
outta sight outta mind
high 

you're afraid of what I'll do to you
recall the taste of something sweet
between a thousand sheets of memory 
I cannot be blamed because you're weak
hey boy come sleep
I will turn the ocean into sky how do you keep?

Des morceaux d'MC dans mon congélateur

Faut qu'la monnaie rentre, c'est tout c'qui me tient à cœur
Est-ce que ces négros s'habituent d'user la spatule?
Quand fumant est le pot
Et même s'ils le savent, est-ce qu'ils mériteraient une statue?
J'étais là bien avant eux, les pauvres
Je trappe et je trappe, je sais couper le crack
Et les plaquettes de frappe, même assis dans les halls
Remplis le sac comme je remplis leurs fiacres

Sortez en boîte, juste eau de vie (on boit)
On vie très jeune, on meurt pas vieux
Tu crèveras seul et pas à deux
J'parle tout seul, j'parle pas à Dieu (lalala)
J'vais t'faire voir c'est quoi la souye (c'est quoi la souye?)
Avant qu'tes potes te mettent des douilles
Et forcement qu'ça part en couille
Dès qu'on parle, on parle embrouille
À coté d'ça, j'dois faire l'andouille

Faut pas faire l'chaudard devant les chtars
Mais d'vant ma face, ils prennent son flash et son pétard (ah montrez vos papiers)

Les gens s'fument pour des bâtiments
Les craquements des murs en ciment
Un claquement, tu meurs un instant
Vide ton sac, fait pas de sentiment (vide-le)
J'fais du rap, j'ai pas trop d'bon plan, j'ai déjà les deux pieds d'vant

J'suis ivre, j'm'en branle de c'qui m'arrive
J'm'en branle des p'tits Nazis, j'vous tire dans l'cul
J'prends du recul, tu prends des coups, tu perds tes burnes
Hey, sur merde de facéties 
J'crois plus aux prophéties
J'entends plus tous vos récits, toutes vos boutades
J'fais d'la pêche à la grenade, sirop grenaille 
Ça fait mal, même mal au crâne
J'deviens pâle quand j'vois les chtars ou les gendarmes

Et t'as beau faire semblant de t'en sortir
On va tous se voir mourir
Ailleurs y a toujours pire ouais, ailleurs y a toujours pire
J'vois pas plus loin qu'mon bourrelet
Ma cons' est toujours lège, la phrase est toujours bête
Sans cesse bloqué dans ma tête
Obligé d'fumer des pères, des tas de pets
Ça fait des pertes neuronales
Ça m'fait perdre beaucoup de maille
Mais ça fédère ceux qui divaguent
Ça m'plaît comme un gros bout d'viande
Toujours posté avec mon gang
J'fume de l'herbe dans un gros bong
Si tu préfères qu'on sorte ensemble
J'espère qu't'es prête à vivre en bande

Plutôt long à la détente
Chérie j'essaie d'te détendre, comme ton gynécologue

Dans ma ville, tout le monde se balade
J'profite d'un brin de soleil pour partir en promenade
Au Mésopot' j'mange un kébab avec deux ou trois fromages
J'profite du temps qu'on me donne
Je m'adonne à la souye puis je m'abonne à mes couilles
Elles postent deux selfies par jour
C'est suffisant pour ma part
Ça suffit j'fais plus de blague
À ta femme j'offre ma bague
J'espère qu'tu m'rendras hommage, c'est dommage
Si tu m'oublies avec l'âge, c'est pas grave (c'est pas grave)

Sur l'canap' j'en mène pas large
J'regarde la 4 y a que d'la merde

J'suis le plus gras de la France, j'suis l'rappeur le plus intense

Bâton d'encens dans le uc, va-t'en sucer pour un sac
J'ai pas l'temps pour qu'on s'attrape
Tout le monde parle sur les réseaux
Vos soi-disant d'libido, j'ai ma face sur le dildo
Comme ça j'vous baise à chaque morceau
À chaque propos, ça va toujours plus loin

Petit enfant prend photo dans la rue puis auto dans la face
Sans cesse dans l'abus comme quand j'ai bu la tasse
Comme quand j'ai vu ta tass
Suce mon pénis avant qu'il refroidisse
Pénicilline pour pouvoir m'endormir
Sans fentanyl y aurait toujours Lil Peep
Trop de codéine dans les cups de mes potes
Faudrait stopper la drogue avant qu'elle nous emporte
Keufs à la porte, faut qu'je paye mes impôts
Faites de la place parce que j'deviens très gros
Vise bien ta race et check bien les propos
C'est parti de r et ça r'part à zéro
Rap-Si mon frère j'suis prêt pour la guerre et j'suis prêt pour la souye
Tous les Roucool moi j'les fume comme des boses
Desperados, piments rehaussent toutes les saveurs de France
J'suis là c'est intense, quand t'es là les gens dansent
Moi c'est la guerre on s'en fout d'c'que tu penses
On s'en branle de ta vie, ta fille branle mon ami
T'es fébrile mon ami, t'as besoin qu'j'te ressuscite
Cite mes récits ou bien touche mon esprit
Fumer sur l'shit, tu vas sucer ma bite

Good morning doctor carter (hey sweetie)
Looks like its going to be a long day. (another one what we got?)
Your first patient (yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-huh)
Originality (ugh)
His flow is weak (another one)
And he has no style (ugh)
What'cha got for um?

OK, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.
Dr.carter to the rescue. 
Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief it takes time to be this great
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace,
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.
One, uno, ace and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break. 
Where is your originality?
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.
Capture what I say. 
All I need is one mic. 
All I need is one take.
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.
Watch the gun-play like.
No kidding, no kids in the way,
But the kids do watch. 
Gotta watch what we say. 
Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k.
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei.
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait
Think I think I lost 'em

Good afternoon doctor carter
Nurse
I don't know about this one 
His confidence is down 
Vocab and metaphors needs work 
And he lost respect for the game
Ah let me see
Think you can save him?

OK.
Respect is in the heart.
So that's where I'm a start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
Now hey kid
Plural I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or re-reciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it.
Some say its biting
But I say its enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.
Arthritis in my hand from writing.
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.
So I stop writing.
Now I'm like lighting.
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans.
Fast and exciting.
My passion is frighting.
Now let me put some more vocab in your i.v.
Here take this Vicodin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget 
So pay me no mind 
I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running 
I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit
God damn it I've lost another one

Good evening doctor carter its been a long day 
But this one looks much better then the others 
His respect is back up 
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement 
All he needs now is some swagger
OK let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.
Fly go hard like geese erection.
Fashion patrol police detection.
I stay tight like Chinese connection.
I stay tight like p**** at night.
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that p**** right.
But I'm too wrong to write.
Too fresh to fight.
Too paid to freestyle.
Too paid to freestyle.
I had to say it twice
Swagger so nice.
And don't ask me s*** unless it concern a price.
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.
I can only see flow.
His blood starting to flow.
His lungs starting to grow.
This one starting to show.
Strong signs of life.
Wheres the stitches here's the knife.
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night.
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life.

He looks good
His vitals are up
He's looking good
He's looking good
I think we got one
Doctor carter I think we got one
Yup we got one
We saved him 
He's good
He's good
We got one
He's good
He's good 
We got 'em
He's a go

You can't understand how I get my dough

[Eminem]
Here we go now 
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone

But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12

Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and

Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line

But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX 
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?

Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group

Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to 
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya

Killin' you faster 
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it 
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it

But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog

How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow

Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

[Chorus: x2]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me

You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja, you... stuart little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol

I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights (?)
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe

Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame

You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do
I'm serious and focused to you, know I am over do
The first nigga to park a Rolls Royce in the bricks
While I fly private jet out of town by a bitch

Long as I breathe ain't nothin in this world that they can't be

Started tweakin and broke in them people house next do'
Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip, 
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?
Huh, y'all don't understand you shoulda seen my plate
Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it
Be serious about your money and right now I'm tryin to get it

Stay G'd up from my head to my feet

Saw death and crime for the first same time
Them rims don't shine just a vision of mine
Put this shit back together cause I stay on the grind
Nigga know I gets me I stunt all the time
For the dead and the gone, the young and the grown
O.G. mother fuckers who be getting it on
Niggaz stunting and they shining bling blingin all the timin
I hold my hood down for the shit that I'm driving
Nigga thug to death, remember the projects

Where niggaz claim to done, where they from and who run shit
I bang it to the tip-top
Can't stop, won't stop, droppin gangbang hit rocks
To the last drip-drop
To the, tick tock to the blocks niggaz rip glocks
I'm knowin that this shit hot
This your first introduction to this motherfuckin crip hop

It's time to research the documents and pull some files
And put it down with this gangsta style
'Cause I be seein niggaz bein more aggressive now
After peace treaty meetings and the weapons down

Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals
To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless
To manage this dramaticness I call my rep
Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check

Certified murder guide through the streets of death
Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met
From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash
niggas have done did when the steel'll blast

Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag
Lookin' rough in a bucket, tuckin' tens and Macs
Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock
Lick shots and the cops and control your block

Keep it true with the crew from the old to new
Ride providin' 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do
Notice who, participatin' all the activity
That's how we livin' G, strictly killer tendencies

Lay ya ass on a stretcher, betcha, getcha, ass out the hood

Nigga now gotta let me break it down for you how it's gon' be
You don't wanna fuck with Snoop cause then you gotta fuck with me

Watch how niggaz get to duckin when I get to bustin
It's nothin, I'll touch him for talkin too much I'll cut him
Push my knife in then fuck him
Man, pussy niggaz don't deserve to breathe
The strong survive, the bitches perish nigga you'll see

Ain't nothin like the smell of gun powder, the shells hittin the pavement
Even the paramedics couldn't save him
I gave him one to the chest, and sixteen to the face
Got knocked then call Cochran to get me off the case
We on deadly grounds, I done been to hell and back
I had to stand out in the rain just to sell my pack
Hangin outta the back of the black Cadillac window
Adrenaline pumpin, the infra-red on his temple

I'm 'bout my paper nigga, your words won't make or break a nigga
I'll put yo' bitch on a track, make her break a nigga
Got rings like a Los Angeles Laker, nigga!
We smoke more than you can handle
So on my regular day I burn longer than a Rest In Peace candle
And my neck piece is a anchor
A G-Unit gorilla's equivalent to a Dogg Pound Gangsta

DJ Whoo Kid,"Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin razors on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama, busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Brothers we better get hip""

My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggas rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin that he tellin get to me, no surprise, nigga

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Brothers we better get hip""

""And come off this trip""

Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
Enemies in my family extortin schemin and scammin me (pop pop)
I'm like Bruce Nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me
I'm battered and bruised, and madder havin to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin I'm talkin cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin back
From him scrappin when niggas was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""

DJ Whoo Kid,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

You hit the ground, bang bang
That aweful sound, bang bang
I used to shoot you down

Don't nobody want to die, but everybody want to ball
Somebody gotta go, when them killa's call
You know it's in us all, you just gotta find it and use it
You can get away with it, if you don't abuse it
The streets talk, the beats mark, 'cause that heat comin'
And if they know that you did it, you better keep runnin'
I think I see sumthin, there go my enemy
Only lord knows where this nigga f'nd to be
Tennakee, still the price is as real if you look it
Might give it to you for 5, depend on if I took it
Nigga anything goes, my shop never close
From the nickels and the dimes to the whole kilo
The real niggas feel me, the haters want to kill me
But I'm holdin' down my city, me and this 9 milli
While your throwin' bricks, and hidin' ya heads

Lord, forgive me
But he tried to kill me
Somebody out there gotta feel me

Just think if I ain't empty the clip, and he killed me
Would I still be livin'?, would my homeboy's miss me?
How many niggas bust they gun when they have to?
Don't need no ski mask when it's time to get at you
I'm glad you done seen what it look like when we left
Brain fragments from shot-gun blasts'll take a nigga breathe
It's death before dishonesty, dope deals and robbery
Poppa wasn't around, but that shit didn't bother me
I'd probably be in the penitentary
But I played the cards, the dead lord sent to me
The whole truth, I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas
Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers
Before I let this police kid harass me
This rookie ass cop gon' have to blast me
He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed
He made a move and I heard a blast
That's what you get, bitch

Bang bang
I shot you down, bang bang
You hit the ground, bang bang

It's goin down around here nigga
Get ya muthafuckin head bust
Them muthafuckin street lights go out
And them real niggas come out
All the bitch niggas go in the house
Just not a game, man
Don't fuck around and lose your brain
And hey, all my real niggas pray

Fin to put it all in why'all face

I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk

S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car

I'ma stay down, you see me on them corners G
At your local liquor store, getting some optimums
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
A-humph, yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats
On the real no, the streets'll have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see you gradually grow
And when you walking on my side I think you all need to know

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
On the 110 Freeway flo', back to the block
In the seven deuce Coupe, hopping hipping the hop
Sipping on some Henn with my nephew Infrared
Young pimp on the grind trying to line up some head
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young
Seesaw we raw like oh-la-la
Fuck the law we don't get caught we just do
Yeah nigga we shaking the cops
You niggas out there just be making it hot
But don't trip if you faking a lot
I'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot
Because if you think that you gonna slip through California
Without getting banged on, brother you're wrong

A nigga earn like David Stern
Mixed with Big Worm when he off that sherm

We on that ace, 
Whole club full off dimes 
So unscrew up your face 
And get off that, that, that 
Cause we off that 
Key the same shape as the car 
Tell 'em to toss that

Hit a pothole, just image we riding horseback 
On the coast Patrick Swayze 
Baby we getting ghost, can I tap that maybe 
We can pull up then hop out and walk in and roll up 
Now hold up say my name before I pull out

And he got his own, lane

I'm talking black cards and swagger is a art 
Let's see if you're still holding when I play this ""King Of Hearts""",Intro,2007
DJ Whoo Kid,"[Verse One]
Guess who's the man this winter, straight out the land of sinners
The Range is tan with spinners, check out the white mirrors
Blow with the damn winners while you and your man's finished
Two in your Rams fitteds, turn off your lightswitch
Holdin my torch down, even when the force 'round
You let your wife roam, she want a divorce now
You niggaz ain't this gully, play it I paint your skully
You never take this from me the riders and all the gangsters love me
You shouldn't be a problem, I ain't be a problem
See you later I'll red your head, you'll be a Rodman
I know your type, hoppin all over beat screamin
You call it hypin yourself up, I call it street dreamin
I do it for all the haters, the players roll with the gators
They lookin forward to favors, gossip is all they gave us
You niggaz wasn't quiet, meet the whales and the fishes
You leak the precinct up, play tattletale with the snitches
Even my momma knows, I got all kind of hoes
They wait outside of shows strict after the diner close
I'll get designer clothes, without the wine or rose
Take off my baby blue mink, and Carolina vogues
come here, take a look inside a entertainer's closet
I never trust a bitch, I blame Lorena Bobbitt
Niggaz stay in pocket, I know you're mad at me
But shit ain't all peaches and cream, and I ain't Sara Lee
Bitch!

[Chorus]
Don't ice me, you starin at the wrong one
It's a lot of girls here, go and get a grown one
We at the bar poppin bottles 'til they all gone
If you ain't leavin here with us, you can walk home
Cause someone else will, they know how we ride
If you a playboy, you got one on the Eastside
Keep your mouth closed, we don't let the beef ride

.. (what) right .. (what) right .. (what) right .. (right, damn!)
(Let's go)

[Verse Two]
I do this for the hood, niggaz stuck in the slammer
I smile cause I'm good, you act tough for the camera
Run from the lil' kids, they fuckin with Santa
Cause they like 2Pac more - word?  Word to my grandma
I figure I might as well leave here with my glock drawn
Cause they'll take to jail, even when you're not wrong
Dawg you're not this flashy, jux you got to blast me
Every rock is classy nobody on your block can match me
You shouldn't want a fight, unless you want to fight
for your life in the hospital a hundred nights
I know your type, run behind your girl rushin
You call it quality time, I call it handcuffin
I'm on a beach in Miami, so you ain't reachin my family
All weekend with panties from Puetro Rican Cammie
You niggaz wasn't tough, I shoulda snapped two flicks
You wore your pants tight, played pitty-pat with the chicks
Even my father knows, where the revolver goes
I bring the beef to your front door like dominoes
And my diamonds froze, that mean my time is froze
Me in the club from when it's poppin 'til the time it close
Half of these so-called real niggaz'll probably sing
Nah I ain't pullin over, learned that from Rodney King
So tell your homey chill, you know I hold the steel
Everything be jabs and hooks, and you ain't Holyfield
Nigga!

[Chorus]

Everybody on the left get yo' hands up
Everybody on the right get yo' hands up
Everybody up front get yo' hands up
And everybody out back get yo' hands up
And if you in here with a strap get yo' hands up
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)

DJ Whoo Kid,"Man I'm gonna do my thang, get up!
It's crazy in the club when I'm in there man, get up!
Trust me homie I'm not playin', get up!
Now get on the dance floor off the chain
I say get up!

I came to bring you that California love
And a lil' New York hatin' it's all of the above
I'm not playin' I'm sayin' I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow the instructions
I said get up!

I ball till I fall
I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor
Not the used car lot
You buy a bottle
I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras

When I get in to it
I get in to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, rain
Till the sun come out
A nigga playin', playin'
We make the guns come out

Now, my question is
Who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain

I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah it's just music, man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said get up!

Girl, you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When I'm inside

I'ma take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn

While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see
What that bitch bout

I found out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up' get cha some
I know how to get you sprung
Tune you up' use your tongue
Under the hood it's so good
She said it's so good
Goddamn I'm so hood
Nigga wattup?

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands in the air
I said get up!

And get into it
You are now rocking with the Unit
I said get up!
And get into it
We gonna show you just how we do it

Yeah...
Chamillionaire..Mixtape Messiah baby
Always want to know something bout me man
want to know somethin bout me?
Don't judge me..don't judge me by my music
And don't judge me bout what you heard about me either
Chamillionaire..listen

Ay, My father was Muslim my momma's a Christian
I couldn't even look surprised when they said they was splittin'
Wasn't no bacon or grits in, off in the kitchen
It was missin', plate was full of non-nutrition
I was born skinny the hunger was forced in me
To get angry at my lifestyle, no smile wasn't born friendly
Born with a thorn in me, I'm scorned so I'm pourin' Remi
I'm thinkin' that's boys feel me, but boys is avoidin' me
Oh, got to excuse me for givin' you the truth
And being the type to give proof that you givin' an excuse
You gotta excuse me for gettin' in the booth,
and keepin' it real about life while you livin' in the poof...
fantasy, damnit he, isn't as big a man as me
If I tell him the truth he need to hear then he gettin' mad at me
The truth could hit ya as hard as assault & battery,
and make people that used to run with me switch up and challenge me
But ain't we family? y'all forgettin' what y'all were
Forget what ya boy heard, 'cause this is 'bout more words
It's all 'bout communication but niggas ignore verbs
If ya boy shouted I'm hatin', then that got ya boy served
Don't deny it if you a man, so you should be man enough
I'm far from feminine we take pisses while standin' up                                                                                                            They smokin' on cannibus while they tell us they jammin' us
Look a fan in the face and ask em' ""Are you a true fan or what""?
""Are you really a fan of us""? or are you type to switch
and get pissed and bootleg the disc 'cause I'm not, droppin' em' quick
They love ya and then they diss, they hug ya and then they hiss
They happy when you arrive and go right back to being pissed
Honestly man, I don't really even give a damn
Instead of being who you want me to be I be who I'am
I'm livin' life of my family and live life of Cham'
I don't live life for my fans
And don't, switch up my words just let me explain my thought
I appreciate ya support, I appreciate if ya bought,
my cd's with all ya heart but this music is just an art
But it's not as precious as life in the middle is where I'm caught
Lookin' out for my people, my motive is never evil
My motive was never see-through, my motive was always equal
Outsiders would lie and try to promote it they out (to) decieve you
They give a notice to you, but don't give a notice to me too
Ya, that's somethin' I call divide and conquer
They try to get inside the monster to divide the monster
So they can become the monster, then they'll try to stomp ya
Inside the circle of friends is where you'll find imposters
To hell with y'all niggas

You see the big picture?
China's ditched from a shake on the Richter
Mother earth strucks and we all get evicted
This some sick shit
Slightly twisted
Information from our nations capital
Capital is all the captain calls for
They just want more (and more)
And more (and more)
And more (and more)
And more (and more)
And more (and more)

[Chorus]
Take me away
Take me away from here
Take me away
I don't here you

My people crying, and be dining, 
They be dining in the hours, 
Drinking wine with their wives like everything is fine
Denying that they fighting for the their lives, 
Every night to survive since the beginning of time
Cant believe the evil that feeds off this so called American dream
Lies in the seat make all the Americans seem like blood-sucking money hungry fiends
But money doesn't mean
A damn thing to me
I just want to be
I want to be free
But unfortunately a fortune is what you need
Cause the fortune 500s run the country
Its one company
If your not a company
Would you mind grabbing me a cup of tea?
If we go hungry, in our own country
I wonder whats its like living in Hungry
Yeah, it isn't funny, but its coming
Its about to get ugly
Streets turn to a game of rugby

[Chorus]

We're buying bubbly and making rate 100s
Is it just me or is that some dumb shit
Yo what the fuck
Hoe comes
Little dumb shit
Lets go
(I know you can think of something)
Donate your dollars
Raise a dollar
Help a mother
Save a father
Cause poverty is probably our biggest problem
And it ain't gonna stop with Obama
To save the world we must start at the bottom

[Chorus]",Sour Patch Kids,2010
DJ X,"I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
I came back to ley you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
And they may never find what they dream of
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everthing 
But you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

I can't believe the things I do for you

Her body's feelin freaky
She calls me when she needs me
She can't wait to please me
I don't need you to believe me
I'm not her man or lover
We understand each other
It's somethin bout the cover
We always usin rubber
She loves to go down
I never return the favor
That's why she so down
Creepin so much
You would think we neighbors
She loves to keep it deep inside her
I would say a definite rider
And just because of the player she chose
It doesn't mean I'ma give her the go

She won't roll with a player like you
She want to roll with a player like me
She callin me 'cause she's in the need
Of a player like me that's stackin G's
Better bring it back, pull it back
Don't be mad 'cause your girl keep callin
23's coop, she's callin me 'cause your boy is ballin
I know that she's gotta man
With a game plan, with the weddin plan
But, I'm not the man, we're not holdin hands
But, whatchu have, your man don't understand

That's what's up, when she leaves the club
Had too much she want to cut, that's what's up

No time for any teasin

Never trick my dawg
Never fuck 'em low
Ya'll already know what player she chose

Chop the block and at quarter to 8
Get cha hot 'cause I know you can't wait

'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast

To the haters that hate you the most

And the friends that pretend to be your folks

(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here

Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

That the use and abuse of drugs -- will what?

Now check out the dance that I display

A new thing, on the dancefloor
First you move, then you stop
Combine the hustle, foxtrot, pop and lock
Put em all together why because
It's called the pause

Pause, the people are jammin
Stop again, back to the groove

Hippie to the hippie,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet.
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,
The purple and yellow.  But first, I gotta
Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
Let's rock, you don't stop,
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank, sing that song!

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why.
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously.
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac.
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a color TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball.  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again.  Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'cause I'm a get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ.  
Everybody go ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.
Master Gee!  My mellow!
It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee.
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be.
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair.
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same.
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere.
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind.  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old.
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat.
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat.
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak.
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight.
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman.""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it.
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on

Thought I was sleeping, it was just a dream

When the morning comes I will be alright 

When I leave I try not to wake her
We had a toast to yesterday's capers

And this is how the story goes

Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept

And at the sight of a 4-5th, i guess you just might
want to do a dance or two
'cause they could maybe bust you for self or wit a crew

He could pop you in check without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy

So he thinks he got a little fame
From the stick-up game

He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain
That the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring

They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck

Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""

And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head

Today we're gonna teach you some
Fun facts about salmon and a brand new dance

Let me introduce to you a brand new dance
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance
It's not complicated, it's not too hard
You don't even have to be a hip hop star

See, anyone can do it, all you need is style
Listen up, people gang, I'm a show you how
Your hands to the side as silly as it seems
Shake your body like a salmon floating upstream

You know how we do it
You know how we do it again

All my peeps spend part of their life
In fresh water and part of their life in salt water
Wow, very interesting
They change round a couple of days after spawning then we die

When I first did the salmon all the people just laughed
They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud
""What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing the snap""

But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, ""Yo, that nigga's killing it""
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating upstream

DJ Z-Trip,"It was so beautiful
Remember how in love we were?
So in love.
So in love.
Once.
So in love.
Once.

She was a young girl
I was a young man
And I knew they would get her when I let go her hand
And then I let go
The inevitable
So beautiful
And susceptible
So wonderful
And so innocent
And after this neither one of us would benefit
Yeah, I was a dropout
She was a graduate
She said I?ll never be nothing she wasn?t having it
Yeah, I tried to break her down
I tried to reason it
She said I wasn?t nobody to be believing in
Yeah, what a waste of time
What a waste of mind
Your place of mind was a part of the design
Yeah, I used to call her up
She never called back
When she called that said I wasn?t all that
Yeah, I know that times change
And people change, too
I was a fool just to think that I could change you

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

And if I had a chance to do it all over I?d do it exactly the same

I was a be-boy
She was a good girl
Turned hot girl
Had to be a hood girl
Never did she notice she would end up in a shook world
I was like look girl it?s all in the book
Yeah, I used to tell her jokes
I used to make her laugh
And if I had a whole dollar I would give her half
So delicate
And so intelligent
And then she trying to play me out just for the hell of it
Back when she was 19 not even 21
Used to do a thing getting somebody anyone
Thought that she was naive
Or was it really me
I do believe
She was the one that was fulfulling me
So we broke up at a barbecue
Drove home thinking never will I bother you
Yeah, I just didn?t know
What it was hidden for
She had me sitting low
But she was bullshitting, though

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

So I just kept rhyming
I caught her eye again
Next thing you know she was hollering let?s try again
But I wasn?t buying in
Didn?t want to lie again
Love was in the frying pan
Baby, it?s done
But she started hanging out
And started being seen
Seeing things different
Said she wasn?t being mean
Yeah, if I let her in
Then I let her win
But I?m a veteran what?s better than a friend
Maybe she was an angel
But she?s in disguise
And I just didn?t see the God-light in her eyes
Or maybe I should I walk away
And cut all the ties
Stay on the rise
Leave love left where love dies
We were youngsters
But we?re older now
But the world is a little more colder now
And I?m just trying to get it all off my shoulder now
Baby, you can hold it down
I?ll see you in the wind

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

That?s right, baby

Yeah, ain?t that what they say?

a grinning empty eyesocket moon hoists itself up into the pale evening sky 
and hangs there like a day old suicide

a stickey shower of radioactive moonbeams 
cascades from the tops of nearby urban structures
causing indescriminate loss of limb to several innocent passers by
as well as general madness all around
 
sample: ""hey"" 
I survey the damage from a blind alley doorway
to which i have been glued for most of the day
having been inadvertantly papered over by a bleary eyed bill poster
sometime before dawn

eventually i muster the energy to extricate myself from my predicament 
as it is time for me to make my apoiinted rounds 
of all the nearby potential sources of aluminum cans
it is my sworn duty to collect all the cans in the area
and convert them into us currency at a secret government installation
whose location is known only to me

later, having acquired enough money to keep myself in the lifestyle to which i am accustomed
i find myself back on the street 
i scan the crowds until i see someone who is obviously insane
and then i follow that person until they go into a building or get into a car
in order to make sure that they don't do anything crazy

while i am engaged in this pursuit 
a nonstop stream of firetrucks and police cars
race up and down the boulevard 
sirens blaring looking for
invisible emergencies no one seems to notice

after a while i move on to the rest of my agenda for the evening
scheduled activities inlcude a short but passionate affair with
a curvaceous bottle of my favorite alcoholic beverage

presently i find myself holding court from a bus stop on 
the corner of Commerce and Pearl
from whence i regale the passing crowds 
with my perceptive insights into the nature of reality 
an appreciative throng hangs on my every word

it begins to rain
but everyone is concentrating so intently on me 
that they are oblivious to the downpour

the water makes me light
i begin to levitate
i float up off the sidewalk and past the top of the telephone pole
a thousand eyes follow me upward
a big black cloud opens up 
and i zip through it at full tilt 
going faster all the time

look at me 
I'm above the clouds
the moon is laughing at me
look at me
the earth is getting smaller
look at me
I'm out in space
look at me

i know all your twisted thoughts 
because i can read your little mind

you're a perverted evil menace to society
that's why the world is so lucky to have people like me

i'll be tiptoeing right along about three steps behind

you won't see me 
you won't hear me
you won't know that i'm there

i disappear into thin air

where i glide like a cat across your bedroom floor

the knife comes to rest up under your chin
where it gently careeses the tender skin

it ain't like your stupid car because it don't come from korea
i won't charge you for this tip but you can take it to the bank
and when your whole life starts to turn around, you'll know who to thank

thank god for mc nine oh oh, will be the first thing you say
when you are jumping out of bed, at the start of every day
dropping on your knees while you are calling out my name 
saying thank you thank you thank you 
and you'll bless the day i came into your life

which up to this point had been a big fat joke
that you were playing on yourself but now its time you awoke 
from this dream you've been having and confront reality 
so shut your mouth for one minute and play attention to me

so now you can share in my continued happiness
you will know the blissful peace of all the masters of old

why don't he stop beating around the bush

i hear what you're saying, mc 900ft jesus exactly how 
did you come to the conclusion that truth is out of style?

well i was on my way to work one day when i spied a rocket ship
some aliens abducted me and took me on a trip
to a previous existence on another astral plane
i met a real nice lady there name shirley maclaine

the truth is not an obstacle for someone such as me, she said
because you see we all create our own reality
and if a problem should arise
the best thing you can say is
don't worry, be happy, and have a nice day

well i thanked her very kindly for the excellent advice
she said she'd bill me later at a reasonable price
then the aliens brought me back and beamed me down into this bar
but i could not go to work because bigfoot stole my car

sample: ""i know a mother fucking bigfoot when i see one""
truth is out of style (out of style)
truth is out of style (out of style)

yet it has been proven.

Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

DJ's Choice,"Motel, sitting in the dark, empty rooms like an empty heart
Lovers stop but they never stay,
Don't look back as they drive away 
Maybe I should fix this broken neon light 
Fill the cracks and paint it bright
Then maybe love will stop here tonight 

If she knocks on my door, I'll give her the key
Just one look in her eyes and I know I'll be
Everything she sees in me 
More than I ever thought that I could be 
These are the days 
When all I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever 
Livin' in the in between
I'm stuck here in a place without love 
And I just can't let it play this way 
But for now I'm gonna have to face it
These are the days 

Gotta to use these lonely time 
Change the picture in my frame of mind
Outside the window there's a sunny day
I wanna feel it on my face 
You and I, we're out here looking for the same thing
And end to all the wondering
Waitin' for someone to share this feelin'

If she knocks on my door, I'll give her the key
Just one look in her eyes and I know I'll be
Everything she sees in me 
More than I ever thought that I could be 
These are the days 
When all I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever 
Livin' in the in between
I'm stuck here in a place without love 
And I just can't let it play this way 
But for now I'm gonna have to face it
These are the days 
These are the days between the hopes and fears 
These are the moments that are still unclear
When it's still uncertain if she will appear 
I'm here, even I like it or not, this is what I got

DJ's Choice,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2003

You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel

You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch!
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul
Mr. Grinch!
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch!
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile

I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch!
You're a nasty, wasty skunk!
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk

The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote
""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch!
You're the king of sinful sots!
Your heart's a dead tomato
Splotched with moldy, purple spots

Your soul is an apalling dump-heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful 
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled-up in tangled-up knots!

With a nauseous super naus!

And you drive a crooked hoss

Whatever shall I do?
Hallelujah,
The question is peculiar
I'd give a lot of dough
If only I could know
The answer to my question
Is it yes or is it no?

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Here comes a blushing bride
The groom is by her side
Up to the altar,
Just as steady as Gibraltar
The groom has got the ring
And it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger
The choir begins to sing:

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Now the nation rise as one
To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent
The bonny burning question,
What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?
Boom boom

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?

On the bedpost overnight
Hello there,
I love you and
The one who holds you tight!
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Sat'day night

DJ's Choice,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

She was a red hot hoochie coocher,
She was the roughest, toughest frail,
but Minnie had a heart as big as a whale.

he took her down to Chinatown
and he showed her how to kick the gong around.

She had a dream about the King of Sweden,
He gave her things that she was needin',
He gave her a home built of gold and steel,
a diamond car with the platinum wheel.

Hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey

He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses,
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses,
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes,
She sat around and counted them all a million times.
