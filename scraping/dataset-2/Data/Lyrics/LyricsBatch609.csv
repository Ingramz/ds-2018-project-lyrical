Little Village,"Now, there's a jumpin' little place I go
Called The Action
It's just about a mile or so
Down the street
And there's a part goin' on in there
Down a lot of funky stairs
And everything will be rare
Till the break of dawn

Now, you don't want to walk on down
To The Action
'Cause once you get in there
You're gonna want to use your feet
And when the music starts a gettin' hot
There's gonna burn up everything you got
And you ain't gonna want to stop
Till the break of dawn

They're doin' the pony
Watch 'em do the jerk
Then they get down on the floor
And they go to work
Sister's doin' the alligator
Up on the table top
Lot of Farfisa racket
Don't never stop

We're goin' down to Santa Ana
Way down to Eagle Rock
Way out in Montebello
And down in Huntington Park
Out in El Sereno
Better show 'em what you got
Out on Whittier Boulevard
The action never stops

Down at The Action
Meet you down at The Action
Don't want to end up in traction
Meet you down at the action",The Action,1992
Little Village,"Don't go away mad
'Cause that'd really make me sad
I know you're burnin'
Burnin' like a cigarette
I know we're learnin'
But maybe we ain't learned nothin' yet
Something's burning
Don't go away mad
It can't be so bad
You know what to do
I'm leavin' it up to you
Don't go away mad
That'd really make me sad
Smoke is clearing
If you just ride with me a while
There's no fearing
We can work it out in family style
If you're willing
Don't go away mad
It can't be so bad
Don't hold your breath
You're scaring me half to death
Don't go away mad
You're the best I ever had
What can I do more of
To make a little bit of peace and love
Don't go away mad
'Cause that'd really make me sad",Don't Go Away Mad,1992
Little Village,"Cool breezes from the mountains blow
As I wake up and dress to go
On the island, dawn is breaking
In the harbor, tanker's waiting

From the land of the rising sun
They bring their old plutonium
And we unload it in the bay
For two dollars forty cents a day

Do you want my
Do you want my
Do you want my
Do you want my job

I hump the stuff, I take the cash
So my kids can wear Adidas
And if you live here, home, you know
We ain't got no place else to go

I remember when the air was sweet
And I brought home the fish to eat
Now we buy Spam from the grocery store
'Cause you can't eat the fish no more.

Do you want my
Do you want my

Bitch look up in the sky it's the bird fucking man
Junior daddy shitting on the game
You probably see me sitting on the Range
I'm hustling look up in the sky it's a bird of some cain
Aye, I flip it twice and I serve in the game
Shout it Ride fly, 20 birds on that thing
I say shout it Ride high dro burn my brain
Gotta let a boy I re-earn my thing
And my five pound germ might sing
A song, if you want to sing say Bling
And if you ever see my pa say King
And if you ever see his son say Weezy baby!
New prints of the Big Easy baby
Y'all niggas can't see me, but I see you lil Pha Pha baby
Ya dude can't lose I'ma spread my wings and fly away

[Chorus]
Know why I stay so fucking fly
Stay dipped in every kind of ice
Big rims on every ride
Cause I got to, I got to nigga

Live life you ain't gone live it twice
Pop cris, smoke dro, and get that white
Don't worry bout the price
Cause I got you, I got to nigga

[Baby]
It's the king of the flyer
That ride skinny tires
I'm so so high and I'm so so higher
Its me and Jr. that's so so fly
Fuck them other niggas cause they need to retire
We pluck polar bear winter on my side
Sitting on the swine alligator punch-line
Super stitch in my leather pockets full of cheddar
Smoke sticky, icky, icky, icky
We drank absolute cristal for breakfast
New whips come out I puts it together
Tell you how I do it I change my leather
No stock Blackwood with the foreign feathers
And German eyes with them Gucci sweaters
Bought mami the matching shit and plucked her feathers
I wipe it down bitch bird lady forever
Birdman switch from Rees to leather

[Chorus]

[Baby]
She was a raggedy bitch, switched her up, cleaned her life
You no longer a scrub you the Birdman's wife
So don't you think twice about this mink and leather shit
You drive by the hood and bird shit on a bitch
Drive anything you want cause you the Birdman's bitch
Get anything you need and you roll with the clique
Go to the club and get a front row seat
Pop mo Don P just shit on a bitch
See your fly now mami used to be a dirty bitch
Got all these hoes trying to ride your dick
You maintain mami you never just wild out
That's why Stunna put you in that big ass house
With the German floors with the wood grain side
Mink on the door with the foreign G ride
Bird berry Gucci be a surprise
No cost too high for my bitch to stay fly

And if you're talkin' about a poor man's friend
Grant will get you out of whatever you're in

I met a woman, we started talking
I took her home, to get a few nips
But all I had was a mint julep

I stole a kiss, and then another
I didn't mean to take it further
One mint julep was the cause of it all

The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""
I didn't know just what I was doing
I had to marry of face ruin

Little Wings,"Boom 
My voice says make room
May the hand combat the gloom
When the ant comes creeping up
I spread my arms so I'd assume
My vest starts to bloom
With the breath that I consume
And I grow like grass on the hillside
It's the way I leave my tomb
Was it dark in there at all?
It was dark I must admit
Was it you that I heard call?
It was me from yonder pit
Was it what you thought was you?
It was me and someone else
I was crying out for you
In high and girly swell
Is the gleam you thought was gone
Beginning to return?
When you lay down on the lawn
Can't you feel its fiery burn
See the rooftops in the sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone
Hear the dooby doo
Boom

May the hand combat the gloom
When the dark slips in 
I spread my arms so why did I consume
The depth of its doom
With the brightness I resume
And I grow green leaves on my branches 
Its the way my blossoms bloom
Wasn't I the wind that blew?
Here is that what you allowed
To come wildly rushing through
You became a gambit howl
Was it finally coming true
It had never ceased to be
Wasn't I the light that grew
Wasn't that light born in me
Here is that what you have touched
When you weren't trying to
It was how you made so much
By forgetting what was you
See the rooftops in the sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone
Hear the dooby doo

This time, they tried to fill my pocket full of loot

Next time, they'll start to weep while I'm bailing
Next time, I'll have to wait through their wailing
Last time, they had to hang me like a poster
This time, they rode me like a rollercoaster,

Next time, they'll have to find if they wanna try
Next time, they'll have a long time to wonder why

I make believe my shoelace came untied

Pull power from the sky
Look at what the light does when we're in it

So I wonder why, I stop to wonder why
Last time, they spread me shallow like the gravel
This time, they struck me twice like a gavel
Order in the court!

What court? is the question
Give no retort, leave everybody guessing
Last time, they bent me over like a rainbow
This time, they step through me like a tango

Next time, I'll abbreviate it so they won't lose their breath every time they say it
Oh I'll keep a song inside their head and bloom
Feed it sweet light, fertilize it with some tune
If words are the wrist then music's the perfume

Oh song from the mouth of friend or stranger
Dangerous bird or bird of danger
If you can keep up, well why won't you?
Songs everywhere, so I sing it, don't you?

Little Wings,"Then, (Ida?) break the spell of change,
And so to duly rearrange,
The faces that you've seen before.
And, let the will of absence pour.

The gravity will keep you near,
Inside its arms that are so clear that
You may never even see them, but
Realize everything could be them.

Up and down your chest will rise.
There's no invisible disguise.
Your face is open sky sometimes.
Your chest a forest grown inside.

Feed it, let it grow, and replicate.
The universe, you know it has no weight.
It waits for magnets, waits for gravity.
So I know everything I have was sent for me.

Unwrap it all and skin me.
Climb on all the branches in me.
Look through light and see me in it.
Name the game so we can win it.

And, everything, oh everything,
In your cloaks you go,
Disguising what you work through,
Talking to me as I go.

And, become my life, become my time.
Become that year that's never mine.
Let that come through, let glory shine.
Grow up and feel the change inside.

Expand, expand like land horizon.
Sponge and water soak the skies.
Intake through what brought you by breathing
Life into the life you're leading.

First came dust and light,
So it's late at night,
And I can see the first thing in your
Headlights while we drive.

And we pull over.
I am sober.
My face looks older.
You touch my shoulder.

Now you've seen me.
Now I've seen you.
Now we try somehow to share the time
That we've been through.

And, I could feel the brains were born anew,
Anew by light of morning, walking
In the skin that grew.
It grew me and I grew it too.

It knew me and I knew it too.
And no one feels the day go through
Exactly in the way I do.
That's what makes me, me, and you, you.

And I can be what makes me.
And you won't be what breaks me.
And I can wait for all that wakes me,
In the way I've always done.

I'm finding out what chose me,
How to use the hand that rose me,
How to sing the word that woes me.
In a way I've just begun.

In a way I've just begun unravelling
This costume at the seams that I design.
I know it inside out.
I know that you attend may bring.

But whenever I am here,
I am aware of everything.

I'm something I can understand.
I am the sky, I am the land.
I am the foot, I am the hand.
I am the wave headed for sand.
I am the cattle and the brand.
I am the souvenir stand.
I am the hometown, local band.

After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was hardly nothing left
But a bare and sore ground
Lite a stripped and dried out soul
Without body and skin
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
Reminding them of how old they are
Suddenly a force from above
Silenced the elegy
It was at the end of the day
It was at the end of the day
Although the beginning of a new and bright tomorrow
Deus ex machina...
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was a last sudden gust of wind
Before the life and freshness again
Touched every heart, mind and soul
And the comfortable summer breeze
Played with the green leaves of the hazel trees
Reminding them of how young
And beautiful they are
Echoing a sorrowless future to come
They thought about their lives
How satisfying they were
And they spoke with happy childlike voices
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters

Of her days and forever
Her heart is yours

One love she won't forget
She longs to give
Forever live
Her soul has such desire
She needs to love, admire
A tide to the shore
Searching for more
No vale of tears
No hauting fears
Another birth
She's joy on earth
Dancing like a child
So pure and wild
A virgin rose
She longs to be close

Stormy times will we behold ?
Do we still care
What future holds
So many words been said undone
The waves of green
They will flow on
Heal me, free me - dawning is near
Where is the saviour - for us to believe
As I sit here - on Norge's shores
Cries of the unheard - will they be heard
The waves of green - whispering my name

When the times got hard and some lost hold
I knew you'd never let go

Now we're here today in the best of ways
Together as one, strong and true

We celebrate our love for rock and metal
We raise our heads as we salute
Tonight we share our love for rock and metal
There's nothing more we wanna do

Through the ups and downs we always stayed
'Cause the best of sounds always led the way
It was shining through, what it meant to you
Always stayed so real, that's how we feel

Now we're here today in the best of ways
Together as one, strong and true as steel

We celebrate our love for rock and metal
We raise our heads as we salute
Tonight we share our love for rock and metal
There's nothing more we wanna do

Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide

I dream of Vegas and the transcendental wildcard
A place where no one waits to die before they go into the light
And just the blind have sight

I follow nothing but the compass of my instinct
No matter where it leads, I know it will take me to the brink
And leave me there by myself and all alone with my dreams
Can you hear my scream?

Strugglin', jugglin', got it to the black man
Eatin' the scams like I was motherfuckin' Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the roughneck niggas with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin' for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin' streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, 'cause either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin' up spots and jumpin' in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin'
And always keep a hand on the gat
'Cause a niggas straight strugglin'

I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin'
I thought about bumpin', but mother-fuck jugglin'
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun 'cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
'cause of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin'
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac 'cause the dogg got it goin' on
If you come up steppin' you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, 'cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin' house, I'm strugglin'
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
'Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin' in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
'Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin'

Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin' changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggas on they back
Till I call back, niggas runnin' free better fall back
I'm fifty niggas deep beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin' and strivin', that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin' on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin' motherfuckers to the moon
Niggas need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin'
See me on the block, strugglin'

Liverpool Express,"Once upon a time, there was a girl
She lived in the land of never-never
Where everything real is unreal
And only fairy tales come true
Something like me and you

But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real
So she strived on to make it come true
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her
Never giving up the hope within her

She carried on and on, because she believed
That once, once in a time in her lifetime
The things so unreal would be real

And in the morning, one day when she awoke
To find herself surrounded by the same old room
She was disappointed

So she dreamed and she dreamed
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed
And she said that fairy tales do come true
'Cause I believe, I believe

And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting
Till one day she met a man who held her tight
And she fell in love

Once upon a time, in the land of never-never
Where all things real are unreal
There lived a girl who believed
That all things could be possible

And one day she did awake
And found herself somewhere else
Beside her a brand new face
Of someone that she loved",Once Upon a Time,2003

Put off, laziness
Wake up, wake up
Awaken from sleep,
Open your eyes, receive
Healed of crippling lethargy
Our spirits no longer
Reek of sleep
Through prayer we've entered

The vision is tainted red
Consumed by anger, provoked bye words
That should never been said
Now all this mind seems to harbor are misplaces aggressions
Once released, they will seek
Reaping the sadistic intentions
In this time and age that maintains no aspect of order
Hard to see are these lines in which many souls border
Visual assistance show life as a harsh reality
The bitter effect produced not approved by society

Read the words, hear Christ speak
Refrain from anger, revert the cheek
Withheld in compassion, not signs of the weak
Seek humility for blessed are the meek

With all she could carry
In a plain cloth sack
Heading for the promised land
Never coming back

And all those nights
She spent thinking of
Her city lights

Spreading out like Christmas lights
Under California skies
When the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's got those city lights
To help her find her way

Times were hard and the jobs were few
City lights were so brand new
Down in the barrio
Good times were hard to find
So Rosie packs her cares
And up the hill she climbs
To see those

City lights shining in her eyes
Spreading out like Christmas lights
Under California skies
When the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's got those city lights
To help her find her way

Those dreams to fade away
Never wants to let the rain
Spoil a sunny day

Until one day he found
That cheatin' folks was easier
Than plowin' his daddy's ground

Bound for Chicago town
He crossed Big Jim and turned his back
A bullet laid him down

And as he lay there dying
He begged, ""Will I see my Ohio?""
In my reply, I lied a bit
And said I did not know

Jim McCall was meek and small
And to become a man
He'd have to build himself up tall
With fancy folks and land

He threw some stones at honest friends
And got himself these things
His children left him and he sneered
""That's what my kindness brings""

And in the South End he got lost
And asked me where to go

Helllll Nawwww!
No, no, no... no, no.. that's right
Don't even trip.. here's the song

Everybody want to live lavish
But it's not possible unless you really got cabbage
Me, I'm a savage, so I'm gonna have it
Everybody wants V.I.P. wit the baggage
Me, plus one (No!) me, plus two (No!)
Me, plus three, can you get us in the door? (No!)

Some of why'all just can't ride wit me
Don't even trip when we hit the do'

They don't even check to see if there's a weapon on my waist
And remember.. I'm doin' what I told you before
Man, I ain't waitin' in this line, I'm bout to go through the door
Now, I don't mind sippin' Mo, but I love the 'Yac
Mami, the line here is long and the club is packed
I'm breakin' the dress code while sippin' the X-O
Now I'm ready to unload, come on, ma, let's go, whoa

Chicken heads see me, actin' like I'm Jay-Z
Change the game, say my name, platinum chain
Can't wait in line, plus you know it's bout to rain
Ask the man at the door, is it cool?
And if not, slide him this, you know just what to do
But uh, I don't trip, it ain't all about me
'Cause not everyone can be V.I.P

Spendin' they rent dough, just to match my cheese

I'm Playa Lo, baby, and that's the gang
I'm V.I.P. status just because of my name
I steps right in wit a devilish grin
I told you cats last time I like to stay on cloud ten
Sippin' bumpy face water, at the club freakin' ya daughter
If she takes one mo' drink, sorry, man, I got her
I'm wearin' Prada, sike, nigga, I ain't
But the clothes that I wear just might make ya faint
I'm iced out, rollin' candy paint
Hey, put me on the list, dog! Naw, dog, I ain't!
Paid him a couple dollars and getcho ass in
If you ain't got no gold, there goes ya girlfriend, I'm a playa!

I came to get a hoe, I rock that big ice
My name is Livio, I got to live life
I got this thick chain, I kick that sick game
I make my own ends, I ride on chrome rims
A bunch of chicken heads outside kickin' eggs
My dogs is feelin' hungry, that's why we gettin' fed
Believe it, I run this, you cannot be by me
And don't even bump this if ya not V.I.P., woo

So many chicken heads, we can't get you in, we can't get you in

Ogni lampione riflette ogni mia ombra di dubbio
Trappo che inizia lo show
Devo andare ti giuro però
Aspettami ritornerò
E abbasso la testa sull'iPhone
Guardo adesso quanti like ho
Vedo una figa e la liko
Presto saremo dei cyborg
No, raccontami qualcosa tu
Una storia non bella, di più
Non farmi dire ""stasera cosa c'è in tv?""

Ho sette vizi capitali
Due legali straordinari
So che questa storia che Giulio è fuori di testa è un po' come una calamita per le troiette banali
Dai dimmi che mi ami e della fama te ne fotti
Sposiamoci e sequestra mia figlia come a De Rossi
Verrò a cantarti Serenata Rap di Jovanotti
Con una cazzo di seconda voce per farmi i raddoppi
Noi due lividi e morsi
Brividi e rimorsi
Puoi contare le mie barre scandite dai tuoi singhiozzi
Laura viene e poi mi supplica ""baby voglio che mi strozzi""
Ho una bibbia aperta in stanza, specchi rotti e un flute di Cristal
Questo è il nuovo LowLow, bitch, adesso sono un solista
Denim giapponese il mio Eastpack
Quattro mogli come insegna l'Islam
Per me sei un fantasma da quando usciamo dal letto 
E il cuore freddo come gli occhi azzurri di un capo nazista

E ho tutte le mani su di me

Liyana,"Verse 1
If I die tonight
What would I do
On my last day
I know I'd wake early
In the morn' for crack
Of dawn's last pray
Then prolly go for breakfast
Like I used to do
Fried kuey teow FAM
And roti canai at Raju's
With my boo
And friends from way back
Neighborhood homies
Extended fam
They only know me
As that same cat
With that shaved head
Rocking Cross Colors
Sneaks to school
Writin' rhymes at the back of class
Playing tricks on fools
Then I'd come back to the crib
Tidy up a bit
Y'all know my room's messy
Though classy
Start arrange my ish
Line up my shoes one by one
Start with Jordans
And end with them Air Force Ones
Put a Post-it on the tongue
Of each one
With the name of each dun
I think I know my homies
And who would want which one
Get on the phone
And holla' at everybody
It's nearly noon
Gots to have lunch
With the family
Then spend the last day
I don't know
Try do a million other things
Hoping somehow
Time will slow
I guess what
I'm trying to say is
Take everyday
Like it was your last
Work towards your dreams
Before you pass
And have a blast
While you at it
'Cause we don't know
When we go go
So make the best of it
Just keep it real to yourself
And to all people
If y'all lost somebody before
Remember there'll be a sequel


Chorus (2x)
If I die tonight
You know it'll be alright
Just smile for me
Reminisce the fond memories


Verse 2
Well if I die tonight
I wonder
Where I'll be tomorrow
Nobody cry please
Push away the sorrow
'Cause I ain't been
The best of men
The best of friends
The best of mom
And daddy's last son
The best of anything
Tell Joe here's a last one
If I die tonight
Would I be forgiven
By all the people
I been slackin' with
When I was livin'?
Those who I hurt their hearts
Took advantage of
And even lied to
Hug you one last time
For forgiveness
Yeah I would like to
If I die tonight
Would you feel the loss?
Tomorrow would you dial
My number by accident
Then suddenly... pause?
If I die tonight
I wonder who would get
To keep my caps and shoes
Jerseys, even my little
Stuffed crocodile Coco too
Get my cell phone
Message everyone from A to Z
Tell 'em this ain't Malique
He passed away last night
And pray he rest in peace
If I die tonight
Would you think of my room
When you see blue
Wanted to clean it up this morning
But then I never knew
If I die tonight
What would happen to Tim
How long would it take
Before she kissed another man?...
God damn...
At fast food joints
Would she still order
The same combo meal for two?
Things I wish I knew...


Chorus (2X)
If I die tonight
You know it'll be alright
Just smile for me
Reminisce the fond memories

To many eyes
To me you were simply
A beautiful thing
I tell no lies
We went from
Mere invisible friends
To pals real tight
Rendezvous up on the net
To chitty chat all night
I used to pick you up
Until you got your own ride
A slammin' two door whip
A grey 36-72
Lookin' all slick
Remember when I asked why this
You said because it's real fast
So you can rush
To see your boy after class
The last time
We met was '01 September
You left feelin' upset over... something
I can't remember...
I never apologized
Till January 10th 2003
When I heard you passed away
When I was deep in my sleep
Your loss taught me
Not to take my friends for granted
Misunderstandings
Gotta slam it quick
Death you never plan it
You're sorely missed down here Wawyn
Rest in peace
This too shall pass
But our true friendship will never cease...
Love...


Chorus (till end)
If I die tonight
You know it'll be alright
Just smile for me
Reminisce the fond memories


*Dedicated to the loving memory of Zehan Azureen 1982-2003*

And my walls are paper thin
I want to let you color me in

Feel like I’m drowning from the sound
Of all the silence all around
My thoughts are gone
I’m going down
I’m turning inside out

This time I finally need a light, a light
Tired of seeing in black and white, white

Having flashes in my mind
Can’t take the ticking of time
The time that’s passing by

There's the wife's side the husband's and my side too
What's the difference who's to blame everybody suffers the same
Oh the game of triangles is a heart breaking game

I tried to be a good wife and keep a nice home
On my job I had to travel I was always alone
It's because I was so lonely that I asked her for a date
When I found out he was married it was already much too late

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better

'Till her boyfriend kicked her out in one of those crushing scenes.
What was she to do? 
Where was she to go? 
She was out on her fanny.

So over the bridge from Flushing to the Sheffield's door.
She was there to sell make-up, 
But the father saw more.
She had style! 
She had flair! 
She was there.
That's how she became the Nanny!

Was just exactly what the doctor prescribed? 
Now the father finds her beguiling

He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""

Liz Callaway,"In a perfect world
One we've never known
We would never need
To face the world alone
They can have their world
We'll create our own
I may not be brave or strong or smart
But somewhere in my secret heart

I know love will find a way, anywhere I go
I'm home if you are there beside me
Like dark, turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

I was so afraid
Now I realize
Love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes
And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you

They'd know love will find a way
Anywhere we go
We're home if we are there together
Like dark, turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

Ah look at all the lonely people

Where do they all belong?

Liz Callaway,"There's a place where the crazy moon
Makes the monkeys sing and the baboons swoon
And the sultry scent of the lotus bloom
Will carry you away

Where the hippos swing from the jungle vines
And the rhino rumba in a conga line
And the pink flamingos are intertwined
As the stars come out to play

In Upendi
Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine
That you lose your mind
As it sweeps you off your feet
In Upendi
Without a worry or a care
It just takes two
To make it true
Your heart will lead you there

In Upendi
In Upendi

You better watch your step 'cause the path is steep
Better hold your breath cause the water's deep
It's a long way down over Lovers' Leap
But falling's half the fun!

In Upendi
Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine
That you lose your mind
As it sweeps you off your feet
In Upendi
Without a worry or a care
It just takes two
To make it true
Your heart will take you there

You can beat the bush like there's no tomorrow
From Tanganyika to Kilimanjaro
But you'll find Upendi wherever you are
Oh, underneath the sun

In Upendi
Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine
That you lose your mind
As it sweeps you off your feet

Without a worry or a care
It just takes two
To make it true

We'll take you there

I hear you say forever more

It's a new game to play
Then we tell our first lie
And see our love go away

And we find, we're alone

We rush on, you and I
We don't need love at all
We need thrills, we need speed
Then we stumble and fall

And we find, we're alone

We're loyal, you and I
To flowers that are dead
We forget how to cry
We save photos instead

And we find, we're alone

We hear guns, you and I
We ask what is that
Then we open the Times
We're informed where it's at

And we find, we're alone

We're moral, you and I
We stand for what's right
We slaughter all evil
By dawn's early light

And we find, we're alone

We're lucky, you and I
We're alive and secure
But in the bank and the church
We can never feel sure

And we find, we're alone

We've made it, you and I
We have glory and fame
Yet we never know why
We feel so ashamed

And we find, we're alone

We have power, you and I
But what good is that now
We would build a new world
If we only knew how

And we find, we're alone

We are old, you and I
We beg warmth from the sun
In the dreams that we dream
We ask what have we done

And we find, we're alone

Liz Larsen,"Stories of passion
Stories of friendship
And tales of how romance survives
I have so many songs

Stories of yeses
Of frogs making messes
And poor unsuccessful and fat people's lives

Stories of living
Stories of dying
And ways we can deal with our fear

Stories of horses, parental divorces
And how rich or poor, it's a very small sphere
Where we appear

But you gotta have heart and music
You gotta have heart and music
Heart and music, get along

You gotta have heart and music
You gotta have heart and music
Heart and music, make a song

If I only had the time
What I would write for your delight

Stories of illness
Songs of improving
And everyone talks about change
I have so many songs

Stories of stillness
Of people not moving
And throwing out books when things turn out too strange
We rearrange

You gotta have heart and music

You gotta have heart and music

So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay

Softly, as I leave you there

Liz Phair,"I bet you fall in bed too easily
With the beautiful girls who are shyly brave
And you sell yourself as a man to save
But all the money in the world is not enough

I bet you've long since passed understanding
What it takes to be satisfied
You're like a vine that keeps climbing higher
But all the money in the world is not enough
And all the bridges blown away keep floating up

It's cold
And rough

And I kept standing six-feet-one
Instead of five-feet-two
And I loved my life
And I hated you

Liz Phair,"I love my bionic eyes
I love my crystal vision
If there's anybody out there
Baby I'm not gonna miss 'em

I watch the years go by
These are the same old guys I never had any use for
Beyond the feeling of pleasure
Or the thrill of the fight

I scored again last night
I said thanks for the drinks, nice party
Then I turned out the light

I've got timing and attitude
That can get to the baddest dude
That's when I hypnotize them
With my bionic eyes

As I got older I had to step out of the lines
And make up my own mind
As I got light as a feather they got stiff as a board
I can't feel any more, but I can fake it forever

It's easy in the beginning
When I can dazzle them
All night
Make 'em do what you wan' 'em to
Get 'em running after you
It's just the same old guys
Wearing the same old ties

As I got older I had to step out of the lines
And make up my own mind
As I got light as a feather they got stiff as a board
I can't feel any more, but I can fake it forever

I love my bionic eyes
I love my bionic eyes
I love my bionic eyes

And I'm a secret weapon
Show me a man you cannot break
And I will show you heaven

""Kids are different today"", I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill, there's a little yellow pill
She goes running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day

""Things are different today"", I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake and she burns her frozen steak
And goes running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And to help her on her way, get her through her busy day

Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

""Men just aren't the same today"", I hear every mother say
They just don't appreciate that you get tired
They're so hard to satisfy, you can tranquilize your mind
So go running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight

Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

""Life's just much too hard today"", I hear every mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore

I want to bring down all those demons who drank with me
Feasting bleed through me
On my desperation

I hide all the bottles in places
They find and confront me with pain in their eyes
And I promise that I'll make some changes

I can tell you I don't know myself
It's amazingly dishonest
But I'd have to recognize it
As part of myself

Straighten up
Why can't you straighten up
I've heard you tell me this
So many times
It doesn't even stick

I get it all the time
I get it all the time
You know I love to make
A joke of it

And if you ask me why I hurt you
I don't understand it
I can't help myself
Its a special combination
Of preditory instinct
And simple ill will

I would give some thought to it
If I thought that it might do me
Some good
Some good

Straighten up
Why can't you straighten up
You always say I'll lose
Control of it
And thirty is not too old

Well momma I would give some thought to it
If I thought that it might do me
Some good

Liz Phair,"You lose your way
You've gotta land
You've gotta make another plan
But sometimes I am too tired

You've gotta smile
You've gotta play
You've gotta work another day
But sometimes I am too tired

You've gotta raise your hand and say
I don't understand
But there are days when I'm to tired
There are days when I'm just too tired
And the wind that I'm in
Screams on me
Howls around me

And I feel like I am a naked man
I've got nothing and no one in a stranger's land
And the wind will do me in

Everyday
You've gotta run
You've got a job
You get it done
But sometimes I am too tired

You wanna roll in the grass
Kick your shoes off
Have a laugh
But sometimes I am too tired

I wanna raise my hand and say
I don't understand
But there are days when I'm to tired
There are days when I'm just too tired
And the wind kicks in again and says
Lean on me
Rise above me
And it says
Sailor don't leave the channel now
Deep blue rollers are breaking across your bow
And the wind will guide you in

So I went up the mountain
But all I saw was another mountain
So I came down the mountain
And I said, ""leave me here lord""
So I went up the mountain
And all I saw was another mountain
So I came down the mountain
And I said, leave me here lord
Leave me in the valley
Let me rest my weary head
Give peace to your survivor
Put all my fears to bed

You lose your way
You've gotta land
You've gotta make another plan
But sometimes I am inspired

You're gonna sing another song
You're gonna right another wrong
And sometimes I am inspired

You're gonna raise your hand and say
I don't understand
There are days when you get an answer
There are days when you find your answer.",Wind and the Mountain,2005

Ding dong, the witch is dead
Come out of your house, uncover your head
Dang dong, this crooked soul
Hanged himself on rock 'n roll

I mean, what kind of a kid were you when you were a kid
What kind of man would do what you did
What kind of life did you think you were gonna live
When everyone in town put a price on your head

And the torch flames swung
Up to light the way ahead
He fled in the darkness and dread
And the tower it bled 'til it trembled and swayed
And he fell straight to Hell, and there he stayed
He fell straight to hell, and there he stayed

Liz Phair,"The trick to happiness is to ignore anything negative you might
Feel about yourself
That people don't really like you that much
That you got fat because you are lonely
Or that your parents are going to die

I like to get my coffee with all the little frothy things on the side
And I like to put in those little sticks

The trick to freedom is to deny your past regrets
Questionable lovers, lies, drunken weekends

I just like to have a lot of energy
My life demands it
Everything's up, all the time
Up, up, up!

People like positive people
Positivity makes good things happen

My husband doesn't let me buy those tabloid magazines
'Cause he says that it makes me fight with him more

Pills that you mix with wine
That your husband and you aren't having sex anymore
That you got married for the money
It's been positively proved that most top 40 hits have a BPM
Of one twenty or more

I definitely like the gin-song
And the ginko bal-boa?

[Chorus]

Sometime you picture yourself getting impaled
On an imaginary spike sticking out from over your bed
When you keep forgetting to call somebody back
But the more time goes by, the less you feel like calling
Because you're embarrassed

'Cause it kind makes you freaky
And you don't want people to think you're freaky
Even though you are kind of freaky
But only in the bedroom
L-O-L

My mom says I'm really hard on my kids
I don't want them growing up thinking
That everything's just going to be handed to them
They're going to have to work their asses off, just like I did!
You know, we get them up at six in the morning
We're like 'come on! get up! get outta bed!'
'It's gonna be a great day C'mon! up, up, up!'

He had a job for me, and check it, with a four-letter company

Get it on

How 'bout you let me keep my profits as a scorer
Record sales are shrinking, I'm gettin' poorer
I got a kid to feed, how about you cut a deal with me

Ha! Hey look, Liz we see you as a commodity
We've been with you since Day One and that's an oddity

And after a series of phone calls
To the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor,
I reached my representative, who pulled out the contract
From the File Cabinet
On microfiche
In the form of Tablets
Made of stone
Then he said

Oh shit, you're twenty years older
Still hot, but getting a lot colder

Ayo, a better platform for all to listen to me
We out in DC deep, ain't got no sleep
The ride bumpy, who jetted out the country to buy D
Came back, large par, ain't nothin' sweet
My dome is yellin', ""Go home!"" but I ain't through
So many years in my career, it's a long route
Thinkin' when Cap skinned his face on the plaster
We was dusted back then, I smoked the last of it
And jumped into the Acura, sleepin' in Sibble's, what it do?
Stew, beef, chicken, where my boo?
Had a quarrel with a hood rockstar, I broke his arm off
'Cause he was pointin' his fingers at Ivanne's daughter
What's next? Dreads want a piece of my spot
This my crib, I pay here to live, fuck you, pop

He probably do mine, when nobody's there
'Cause the only way to score, leave no witness
A thug on my shit list, pay him with slugs back
The slickness and remember that I built two graves
I wasn't stupid, I was ruthless
Check the bazooka crew, they bookoos
Broke the glass slammin' my rings down
That's doofus, don't mess up, you got the longest clip, use it
Yo you see 'em in the lobby, they right there
Head shots only, kill him, he right there

I better be getting on now this is rugged and I'll
Need a second just to set the record up on a cloud lifeless
Looking up to Leanne's likeness
I see my mom's mom looking down on us like this
And wonder if my own godless beliefs
Are somehow damaging the ones close to my license
Might get sticky but the facts remain
We gotta stay and keep it moving or collapse in pain
I'mma craft the game back up relax and claim
The new day for the people who can actually say

Liza Lee,"Baltimore Oriole
Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho-down Louisiana
Where a two-tiin' Jaybird
Met the divine Miss O

I'd like to ruffle his plumage
That Baltimore Oriole
Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgivin' is easy-it's a woman like, now and then

Would it be, would it be too late

Set me free, babe
Set me free
Set me free, babe

I need someone to hold me
Wrap their arms and embrace the air I need
'Cause you were my shelter
Now the heart you hold is somebody else's, baby
Now I can't make you love, baby, if you don't

And raised in the trees 
Of western Kentucky
On wobbly knees
With mama beside you 
To help you along 
You'll soon be growing up strong
 
All the long, lazy mornings 
In pastures of green 
The sun on your withers 
The wind in your mane 
Could never prepare you
For what  lies ahead 
The run for the roses so red
 
And it's run for the roses 
As fast as you can 
You fate is delivered 
Your moment's at hand 
It's the chance of a lifetime 
In a lifetime of chance 
And it's high time you joined
In the dance 
It's high time you joined 
In the dance 
 
From sire to sire 
It's born in the blood
The fire of a mare 
And the strength of a stud 
It's breeding and it's training
And it's something unknown
That drives you 
And carries you home 
 
And it's run for the roses 
As fast as you can 
Your fate is delivered 
Your moment's at hand 
It's the chance of a lifetime 
In a lifetime of chance 
And it's high time you joined

Liza Minnelli,"Sing me a happy song about robins in spring
Sing me a happy song with a happy ending
Some cheerful roundelay about catching the ring
Sing happy

Sing me a sonnet all about rolling in gold
Some peppy melody about rainbows blending
Nothing with phrases saying you're out in the cold
Sing happy

Tell me tomorrow's gonna be peaches and cream
Assure me clouds are lined with a silver lining
Say how you've realized an impossible dream
Sing me a happy song

Play me a madrigal about trips to the moon
Or some old ballad about two eyes shining
It can't be loud enough or a moment too soon
Sing happy

No need reminding me that it all fell apart
I need no lyrics singing of stormy weather
There's quite enough around me that's breaking my heart
Sing happy

Give me a Hallelujah and get up and shout
Tell me the sun is shining around the corner
Whoever's interested helping me out
Please keep it happy

I'm only in the market for long, loud laughter
I'll let you serenade me till dawn comes along
Just make it a happy
Keep it a happy song

And so she sat and she thought, she thought for hours on end, And said I'll go to Chase, Manhattan, where I got me a friend

And so she borrowed a thou' and called TWA, And told her mother and dad that she was up and away
I'm gonna travel the continent, a month, maybe two, And haul me home a hus' if it's the last thing I do

Liza Minnelli,"""It's Liza with a Z, not Lisa with a S,
'cause Lisa with a S goes S, not Z, huh
It's Liza with a Z, not Lisa with a S,
'cause Lisa with a S goes S, not Z, huh""
All God's children needs travelling shoes
Drive your problems from here
All good people read good books
Now your conscience is clear
Now your conscience is clear
In the morning, when I wipe my brow
Wipe the miles away
I like to think that I can be so willed
And never do what you say
And never do what you say
Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
In my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
We just poked a little empty pie
For the fun that people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
The timid smile, and pause to free
I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll
Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
In my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
Half the people read the papers
Read them good and well
Pretty people, nervous people
People have got to sell
News you have to sell
Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
In my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
In my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety

Liza Minnelli,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,1992
Liza Minnelli,"Did you say, I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

Liza Minnelli,"There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling
When you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men becau-ause
The butcher, the baker, the grocer and the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye
For anything theatrical and why, why-y?

There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
You get word before the show has started
That your father died inside of dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted
You're broken-hearted, but you go on

There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Yesterday they told you you would not go far
That night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room
They've hung a star
Let's go, on with the show",There's No Business Like Show Business,1992
Liza Minnelli,"Hey! old friend
What'd'ya say, old friend
Are you okay, old friend
Are we, uh, are we unique

Time goes by
Everything else keeps changing
You and I 
We can conintue next week, yeah

Most friends fade
Or they don't make the grade
New ones are quickly made
And in a pinch
Sure, they'll do

But us, old friend
What's to discuss, old friend
Here's to us, who's like us
Damn few

Liza Minnelli,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too? 
Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

Liza Minnelli,"Hello Dolly, I said hello Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where, you belong
Ah you're looking swell Dolly, we can tell Dolly
You're still glowing, you're still growing, you're going strong

So take her wrap, fellas, find her an empty lap, fellas

Liza Minnelli,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Liza Minnelli,"A clown with his pants falling down
Or the dance that's a dream of romance
Or the scene where the villain is mean.
That's entertainment!
The lights on the lady in tights
Or he bride with the guy by her side
Or the ball where she gives it her all.
That's entertainment!
The plot can be hot, simply teeming with sex
A gay divorcee who is after her ex
It could be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his father and causes lots of bother.
The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for a loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt
The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!
It might be a fight like you see on the screen
A swain getting slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene
Where a ghost and a prince meet, and everyone ends in mincemeat.
The guy who was waving the flag
That began with the mystical hand
Hip hooray! The American way
The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!",That's Entertainment!,1995
Liza Minnelli,"Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh, so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender and callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow, follow

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
That dreams were kept beside your pillow
Try to remember when life was so tender
When love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow

Deep in December, it's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December, it's nice to remember
Without a hurt the heart is hollow
Deep in December, it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made us mellow
Deep in December, our hearts should remember
And follow, follow, follow",Try to Remember,1995
