Arlo Guthrie,"John Henry was about three days old,
Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,
Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""
John Henry said to his shaker,
""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""
The man that invented the stream drill
Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor
Heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord,
Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry took sick and went to his bed.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord,
Lord.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man.
John Henry had a little baby.
You could hold him in the palm of your
Hand.
The last words I heard that poor boy say,
""My daddy was steel-driving man. Lord,
Lord.
My daddy was a steel-driving.""
Well, every Monday morning
When the bluebirds begin to sing.
You can hear John Henry a mile or more.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.
Lord, Lord.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.",John Henry,1989
Arlo Guthrie,"Words and music by Ed McCurdy

Last night I had the strangest dream
I'd ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war

I dreamed I saw a mighty room
Filled with women and men
And the paper they were signing said
They'd never fight again

And when the paper was all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads
And grateful pray'rs were prayed

And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
While swords and guns and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

Last night I had the strangest dream
I'd never dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war.

Buy us a bottle of wine

Find that little town that's in the back of my mind

Lead me back to those Oklahoma nights

When we get back to the old barn dance
We'll hear that Rock-a-billy band
Singin' about some long lost romance
And we'll know we're home again

Arlo Guthrie,"I saw the splendor of the moonlight 
On Honolulu Bay 
There's something tender in the moonlight 
On Honolulu Bay 

And all the beaches are filled with peaches 
Who bring their ukes along 
And in the glimmer of the moonlight 
They love to sing this song

If you like Ukulele Lady 
Ukulele Lady like a'you 
If you like to linger where it's shady 
Ukulele Lady linger too 
If you kiss Ukulele Lady 
While you promise ever to be true 
And she sees another Ukulele 
Lady foolin' 'round with you 

2: 
Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot) 
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not) 
Maybe she'll find somebody else 
By and by 
To sing to when it's cool and shady 
Where the tricky wicky wacky woo 
If you like Ukulele Lady 
Ukulele Lady like a'you 

She used to sing to me by moonlight 
On Honolulu Bay 
Fond memories cling to me by moonlight

Some day I'm going, where eyes are glowing 
And lips are made to kiss 
To see somebody in the moonlight 
And hear the song I miss",Ukulele Lady,1991
Arlo Guthrie,"Wind's gonna blow, so I'm gonna go
Down on the road again
Starting where the mountains left me
I'm up where I began

Where I will go, the wind only knows
Good times around the bend
Get in my car, goin' too far
Never comin' back again

Tired and worn, I woke up this mornin'
Found that I was confused
Spun right around and found I had lost
The things that I couldn't lose

The beaches they sell to build their hotels
My father's and I once knew
Birds all along sunlight at dawn
Singing Waimanalo blues

Down on the road with mountains so old
Far on the country side
Birds on the wing forget in a while
So I'm headed for the windward side

All of your dreams, sometimes it just seems
That I'm just along for the ride
Some they will cry because they have pride
For someone who's loved here died

The beaches they sell to build their hotels
My father's and I once knew
Birds all along sunlight at dawn

Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish

O how lonely and how dreary it will be
And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking
And the pain you are causing to me

My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game

But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn

Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side

My heart died that night with my bride

As I walked out in Laredo one day

""""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story

Let six pretty gals come to carry my pall

And play the dead march as you carry me along 
Take me to the green valley and lay the earth o'er me

So you ask me my kind friend
Why I am sad and still
And why my brow is darkened
Like the clouds upon the hill

Rein in your ponies closer
And I'll tell you all a tale
Of Utah Carroll, partner
And his last ride on the trail

In a grave without a headstone
Without a date or name
My partner lies there silent
In the land from which I came

Long ago we rode together
We'd ridden side by side
I loved him like a brother
And I wept when Utah died

While riding up one morning
And our work was almost done
The cattle quickly started
On a wild and maddening run

The boss's little daughter
Who was riding on that side
Rushed in to stop the stampede
It was there my partner died

Lenore upon her pony
Tried to turn the cattle right
But her blanket slipped beneath her
And she caught and held on tight

When we all saw that red blanket
Each cowboy held his breath
For should her pony fail her
None could save the girl from death

When the cattle saw the blanket
Almost dragging on the ground
They were maddened in a moment
And they charged with deafening sound

The girl soon saw her danger
And she turned her pony's face
And bending in her saddle
Tried the blanket to replace

Just then she lost her balance
In the front of that wild tide
Carroll's voice controlled the round up
""Lie still, Lenore"" he cried

And then close up beside her
Came Utah riding fast
But little did the poor boy know
The ride would be his last

Full often from the saddle
He had caught the trailing rope
To pick her up at full speed
Was now his only hope

He swung low from his saddle
To take her to his arm
We thought that he'd succeeded
That the girl was safe from harm

But such a strain upon his saddle
Had ne'er been put before
And the cinches gave beneath him
And he fell beside Lenore

When the girl fell from her saddle
She had dragged the blanket down
It lay there close beside them
Where they lay upon the ground

Utah took the blanket
And to Lenore he said
""Lie still"" and quickly running
Waved the red thing o'er his head

He turned the maddened cattle
From Lenore, his little friend
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him
He turned to met his end

And as the herd came on him
His weapon quickly drew
He was bound to die defended
As all brave cowboys do

The weapon flashed like lightning
And it sounded loud and clear
As the cattle rushed and killed him
He dropped the leading steer

When I broke through that wide circle
To where poor Utah lay
With a thousand wounds and bruises
His life blood ebbed away

I knelt down close beside him
And I knew that all was o'er
As I heard him faintly whisper
""Good-bye, my sweet Lenore""

Next morning at the churchyard
I heard the preacher say
""Don't think our kind friend Utah
Was lost on that great day

He was a much-loved cowboy
And not afraid to die
And we'll meet him at the round up
On the plains beyond the sky""

So you ask me my kind friend
Why I am sad and still
And why my brow is darkened
Like the clouds upon the hill

Rein in your ponies closer
And I'll tell you all a tale
Of Utah Carroll, partner
And his last ride on the trail

Cattle prowl and the coyotes howl
Out on the Great Divide
Never done no wrong, just singin' a song
As down the trail I ride

Rattle snakes rattle at the prairie dogs
You can hear that mournful tune
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west
When the cactus is in bloom
Yodel...

CHORUS
Daylight comes and the cowhands yell
They call out every man
Throw my saddle on my old cow horse
I drink my coffee from a can
The sun goes down on the cattle trail
And I'm gazin' at the moon
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west
When the cactus is in bloom
Yodel . . .

Now we don't have cold weather
It never snows or rains
This is where the sun shines best
Out on the western plains
Some of the boys are gone away
But they will be back soon
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west
When the cactus is in bloom
Yodel...

",When the Cactus Is in Bloom,1992
Arlo Guthrie,"Words and music by Woody Guthrie

While we're on the subject of hard work, I just wanted
To say that I always was a man to work.

I was born working and I worked my way up by hard
Work. I ain't never got nowhere yet but I got there by
Hard work.

Work of the hardest kind. I been down and I been out
And I've been busted, disgusted and couldn't be trusted.

I worked my way up and I worked my way down. I've
Been drunk and I've been sober. I've had hard times
And I got hijacked and been robbed for cash and robbed
On credit.

Worked my way into jail and outta jail and I woke up
A lotta mornings and I didn't even know where I was at.

But the hardest work I ever done is when I was trying
To get myself a worried woman to ease my worried
Mind.

Now I'm gonna tell you just about how much hard
Work I had to do to get this here woman that I'm a-tellin'
You about.

I shook hands with 97 of her kinfolks and her blood
Relatives and I done the same with 86 people that was
Just her friends and her neighbors.

Kissed 73 babies and put dry pants on 34 of 'em, as well
As others, and done the When thing several times, as well
As a lot of other things just about like this.

I held 125 head of wild horses, put saddles and bridles
On more than that, harnessed some of the craziest,
Wildest teams in the whole country. I rode 14 loco
Broncos to a dead standstill and let 42 hound dogs lick
Me all over.

7 times I was bit by hungry dogs and I was chewed
All to pieces by water moccasins and rattlesnakes on
2 separate river bottoms.

I chopped and I carried 314 arm loads of stoved
Wood; 100 buckets of coal, and I carried a gallon of
Kerosene 18 miles and lost a good pair of shoes in a
Mud hole.

And I chopped and I weeded 48 rows of short cotton,
13 acres of bad corn and cut the sticker weeds out of
11 back yards, all on account a 'cause I wanted to
Show her that I was a man and I liked to work

I cleaned out 9 barnloads, and cranked 31 automobiles,
All makes and models, pulled 3 cars out of mud
Holes and 4 out of snowdrifts.

I dug 5 cisterns of water for some of her friends and
Neighbors and run all kinds of errands.

I played the fiddle for 9 church meetings and I joined
11 separate denominations. I signed up and joined
Up for 7 of the best trade unions I could find and paid
My dues about 6 weeks ahead of time, waded 40
Miles of swamps, 60 big rivers, walked across 2
Mountain ranges and crossed 3 deserts.

I got the fever and I got the sun stroke and I got the
Malaria and I got the flu and I got moonstruck and
Skeeter bit, the poison ivy and the 7 year itch and the
Blind staggers.

I was given up for lost and dead about 2 dozen times.
Struck by lightning, struck by Congress, struck
By friends and kinfolks, as well as by 3 cars on
The highways and a lotta times in peoples'
Henhouses.

I been hit and run down and run over and
Walked on and knocked around and I'm just
Settin' here now trying to study up what else I
Can do to show that woman that I still ain't afraid
Of hard work.




",Woody's Rag/Hard Work,1992

We all work together with a giggle and a grin.

You can play with me,
You can take my hand,
We can skip together
Down to the pretzel stand.
You can wear my mommy's shoes,
You can wear my daddy's hat,
You can even get mad at me,
But don't you push me down.

You can play with me,
We can build a house,
You can take my ball,
And bounce it up and down.
You can take my skates,
And ride them all around,
You can even get mad at me,
But don't you push me down.

Chorus

You can play with me,
We can play all day,
You can use may use my dishes,
If you put them away.
You can feed me apples,
Oranges and Plum,.
You can even wash my face,
But don't you push me down.

Jaybird danced with horse-shoes on.
Grasshopper danced till he fell on the floor

Jig along, jig along, jig along home,

Centipede danced with the big giraffe,
Spider danced with the rattlesnake,
Elephant danced with the scorpio,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

Fishing worm done the fishing reel,
Lobster danced on the peacock's tail,
Baboon danced with the rising moon,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

And the rooster cut his weevily wheat,
The catfish tromped the cuckoo's feet,
The ostrich stomped with the kangaroo,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.


Mama rat took off her hat,
Shook the house with the old tom cat,
The alligator beat his tail on the drum,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.


The boards did rattle and the house did shake,
The clouds did laugh and the world did quake,
New moon rattled some silver spoons,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

The nails flew loose and the floors broke down,
Everybody danced around and around,
The house come down and the crowd went home,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

The rain it come and it washed my ground
I thought my little seed was going to drown
I waded and I splashed and I carried my seed
I planted it again on some higher ground.

The sun got hot and my ground got dry.
I thought my little seed would burn and dir.
I carried some water from a watering mill,
I said, â??Little, you can drink your fill.â??

My little seed grew and it grew and it grew.
It grew up a cradle all soft inside;
And a baby was sleeping there covered over with vines

Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo

Once upon a time there was a little boy who
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,
BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'
Grown-ups said ""Get that thing out of here!""

Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make
Things disappear. But the father played too
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass
Disappears, He'd come to someone about
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'
No chair.

People said to the father, ""You get out
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and
Your son!"" The boy and his father were
Ostracized. That means they made them
Live on the edge of town.

Now in this town they used to tell stories.
The old people used to tell stories about
The giants that lived in the old days They
Used to tell a story about a giant called
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a
House and could eat, people, up.
Of course, nobody believed it, but they
Told the story anyway.

One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red
Over the hill. And the first people got up
And looked out of their window, they saw a
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And
They could feel the whole ground shake.
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!""

He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious
Possessions and run! Run!"" Just then the
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,
What's coming over the field?"" - Oh, Son,
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him
To lie down, I could make him disappear.""

The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He
Grabs his father by one hand. The father
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the
Ukelele. They run across the field. People
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you
Alive!"" There was Abiyoyo. He had long
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.

Well, you know the giant had never heard a song
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" The giant
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.

They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,
We don t care anymore!"" And they all sang:

Sailng down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

Sun and water, old life givers
L'll have them where ere I roam
And I was not far from home

Sunlight glancing on the water
Life and death are all my own
Yet I was never alone

Life for all my sons and daughters
Golden sparkles in the foam
And I was not far from home

Sailing down this winding highway
Travelers from near and far
And I was never alone

Exploring all the little byways
Sighting all the distant stars
And I was not far from home

Sailing down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

L'll have them where ere I roam
And I was not far from home

Yet I was never alone
And I was not far from home

In a strange and foreign land
A soldier packs his memories
As he leaves Afghanistan

And back home, they don't know too much
There's just no way to tell
I guess you had to be there
For to know that war was hell

And there won't be any victory parades
For those that's coming back
They'll fly them in at midnight
And unload the body sacks

And the living will be walking down
A long and lonely road
Because nobody seems to care these days
When a soldier makes it home

They'll say it wasn't easy
Just another job, well done
As the government in Kabul falls
To the sounds of rebel guns

And the faces of the comrades
Being blown out of the sky
Leaves you bitter with the feeling
That they didn't have to die

And there won't be any victory parades
For those that's coming back
They'll fly them in at midnight
And unload the body sacks

And the living will be walking down
A long and lonely road
Because nobody seems to care these days
When a soldier makes it home

Halfway around the world tonight
In a strange and foreign land
A soldier unpacks memories
That he saved from Vietnam

Back home they didn't know too much
There was just no way to tell
I guess you had to be there
For to know that war was hell

And there wasn't any big parades
For those that made it back
They flew them in at midnight
And unloaded all the sacks

And the living were left walking down
A long and lonely road
Because nobody seemed to care back then
When a soldier made it home

The night is coming quickly
And the stars are on their way
As I stare into the evening
Looking for the words to say

That I saw the lonely soldier
Just a boy that's far from home
And I saw that I was just like him
While upon this earth I roam

And there may not be any big parades
If I ever make it back
As I come home under cover
Through a world that can't keep track

Let alone the ones who won't

And the breeze will cease to be breathin'

And the sands on the shoreline will be shakin?
And the tide will pound and the wind will sound
And the mornin? will be a breakin?

The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be a smilin?
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

And then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a touchin'
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in

Her face was hidden in the mountain streams
Her voice disguised as the sound of the wind
The rustling of leaves, she would call from within

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead

So many memories of those years have passed
Beyond the confusion, that thought would last forever
The countless veils that I wore like clothes
Have been stripped away, now stand here exposed

Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead

In the night when the moon casts no shadows at all
We sat by the fire as she started to call
Out to all who would hear that the death of what's dead
Is the birth of what's living and her words filled my head

Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead

It's the life that lies sleeping when you think you're awake
Forever is real and the rest is just fake
And though volumes are written on this subject alone
She used three simple words and she brought it all home

Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rail humming
That's a hobo's lullaby

Do not think about tomorrow
Let tomorrow come and go
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all the wind and snow

I know the police cause you trouble
They cause trouble everywhere
But when you die and go to heaven
You won't find no policemen there

I know your clothes are torn and ragged
And your hair is turning grey
Lift your head and smile at trouble
You'll find happiness some day

Don't you feel the steel rail humming

A song is sounding, softly singing

In all of this emptiness around me
Take me from the chilling of the evening

Though you know my love that I must go
A-following the winds that blow inside me
I've nowhere left to run or hide
Except if you will come and run beside me
And even if you do there'll be a lot for us to do
To keep believing
Take me from the chilling of the evening

And now my time has come down many streets
I'm coming from a night decaying

I cannot even hear it playing

This highway in the wind

Evenings just begin the days
And follows with the night
To love you and to be with you
And say that it's all right
Love me while you have me, Babe

And there's times I want to stay

It's going home

Slips away, then it's gone
Leaves the night to carry on
While it's going home

What he said death could not hide

If all the doors were closed in heaven
Where would all the angels go
Would they just fly around forever
Or would they come down here below

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
Would there be angels here tonight
And would they live their lives among us
And share the darkness with their light

If all the doors were close in heaven
They'd have to close the road to hell
We'd all be stuck here with each other
There would be nowhere else to dwell

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
And everyone there had to leave
And death was nothing but a moment
Beyond the breaths you took to breathe

If all the doors were closed in heaven
Who would dare abuse a child
Or let a little kid go hungry
Or not return a simple smile

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
And the host of heaven was on the street
I wonder if they'd look much different
From the likes of you and me

So I hope they close the doors to heaven
And all the angels up above
Come and build a home among us
Remind us what it is to love

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
Would there be angels here tonight
And would they live their lives among us
And share the darkness with their light

Arlo Guthrie,"Lyrics by Glen Anthony
Music by Charlie Chaplin

My love, you are the song
That sings inside of me
The song is always the same
It starts with love and ends with your name

The more that I love you
There's more in you to love
And yet I just don't know how
I could love you more than I do right now
They say that love grows old
But our love turned to gold
You kissed my sorrows away
You touched my heart
What more can I say

Each day my life is new
For God blessed me with you
And when my life is all through
Without a word you always knew
That all my life my life was you

Arlo Guthrie,"Take a trip with me in nineteen thirteen
To Calumet, Michigan in the copper country
I'll take you to a place called Italian Hall
And the miners are having their big Christmas ball

I'll take you in a door and up a high stairs
Singing and dancing is heard everywhere
I'll let you shake hands with the people you see
And watch the kids dance 'round the big Christmas tree.

There's talking and laughing and songs in the air
And the spirit of Christmas is there everywhere
Before you know it you're friends with us all
And you're dancing around and around in the hall

You ask about work and you ask about pay
They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day
Working their copper claims, risking their lives
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives.

A little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet
To hear all this fun; you would not realize
That the copper boss thug men are milling outside

The copper boss thugs stuck their heads in the door
One of them yelled and he screamed, ""There's a fire""
A lady she hollered, ""There's no such a thing,
Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing.""

A few people rushed and there's only a few
""It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you.""
A man grabbed his daughter and he carried her down
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out.

And then others followed, about a hundred or more
But most everybody remained on the floor
The gun thugs, they laughed at their murderous joke
And the children were smothered on the stairs by the door.

And neither have I wings to fly,
Give me a boat that can carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.

A ship there was, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in,
And I know not how, I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against some young oak,
Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Oh, love is handsome, love is fine,
Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

The mountain stands beside the sea.

And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try

Now as I look around, it's mighty plain to see
This world is such a great and a funny place to be;
Oh, the gamblin' man is rich an' the workin' man is poor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.




",I Ain't Got No Home,2017
Arlo Guthrie,"I've got to know, yes, I've got to know, friend;
Hungry lips ask me wherever I go!
Comrades and friends all falling around me
I've got to know, yes, I've got to know.

Why do your war boats ride on my waters?
Why do your death bombs fall from my skies?
Why do you burn my farm and my town down?
I've got to know, friend, I've got to know!

What makes your boats haul death to my people?
Nitro blockbusters, big cannons and guns?
Why doesn't your ship bring food and some clothing?
I've sure got to know, folks, I've sure got to know!

Why can't my two hands get a good pay job?
I can still plow, plant, I can still sow!
Why did your lawbook chase me off my good land?
I'd sure like to know, friend, I've just got to know!

What good work did you do, sir, I'd like to ask you,
To give you my money right out of my hands?
I built your big house here to hide from my people,
Why you crave to hide so, I'd love to know!

You keep me in jail and you lock me in prison,
Your hospital's jammed and your crazyhouse full,
What made your cop kill my trade union worker?
You'll hafta talk plain 'cause I sure have to know!

Why can't I get work and cash my big paycheck?
Why can't I buy things in your place and your store?
Why do you close my plant down and starve all my buddies?
I'm asking you, sir, 'cause I've sure got to know!

Let tomorrow come and go
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all the wind and snow

I know the police cause you trouble
They cause trouble everywhere
But when you die and go to heaven
You won't find no policemen there

I know your clothes are torn and ragged

Lift your head and smile at trouble

When that good ship went down only forty-four were saved.
'Twas the last day of October we saved the forty-four
From the cold ocean waters and the cold icy shore.

That we watched for the U-boats and waited for a fight.
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion roared
And they laid the Reuben James on that cold ocean floor.

Arlo Guthrie & Friends,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

Arlo Guthrie & Pete Seeger,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.",City of New Orleans,1975

That's why the scars on my face 'coz bad karma and violence
Just before a nigga wake I spend the night in silence
To give my nerves a little break before it's back to the malice

To all my, to all my, to all my, to all my
To all my peoples that passed away
Uh huh
To all my peoples that passed away, to all my, to all my
To to to, Free sanity and wings as they cast away

[Verse 1: Armageddon]
Sometimes I envious on peoples that past away
They so synonm, there wings being cast away
I dream so vivid, the scene shakes me fast awake
I keep thinking maybe somethings tryna show me how to master my faith

They say I'm deep and too complex for rap
But yo, I grew to learn there's more to life then cars and gats
So I chose to share the light and write my bars with that
But niggaz scared to grow so they tend to hold you back

They take this shit that they don't understand and call it wack
Tell you that ain't the way it goes son, that's conscience rap
But why'all running in circles working the same old act
And I done reaching at a level, but I'm wrong for that

And I ain't bitching, I'm just tryna let you know where I'm at
I'm getting old, as my son grows, so do my raps
I feel your misery, you living off the next mans life
He just as bad, 'cause he dreams you can strengthen his light

I want to shout out all the two time fellas holding guns for weak thugs
Risking their freedom, for short money and weak love
85 is tryna earn respect from them young boys
Catching temper tantroms, having fits like young boys

And bitches do it too, get deffensive and peranoid
See everybody want to have some power to exploit
Now maybe you can tell me who's the problem at this point
Me or you homes, I hope you following this joint

[Hook: Tony Sunshine]
Stress free, people holla day
Just another me, to see another day
So let the slugs breathe
Easy for a day, I feel all alone while the clouds keep ??

[2pac Talking]
All my mother fucking niggaz at? my niggaz who down to body a nigga in this
motherfucker
All my riders, all my killers, all my motherfuckers, holla at me man, let me
know whatsup niggaz

[2nd Verse: Armageddon]
Niggaz tryna please the crowd when they creating their rhymes
I just be thinking out loud, why'all ain't gonna pay me no mind
Maybe I'm living in the clouds, or just ahead of my time
I got books of all the shit I wrote between all the crimes

Looking back, tryna trace tracks just to see what I find
Nothing but evidence, back to fact the world is mine
And I ain't irrogant, I'm just Intellectually pompous
'Cause I can super seed anything you accomplish

This nigga dry snitching like he looking for sympathy
Nobody give a fuck about you or your history
Do you nigga?Make some shit shop a deal
'Cause that hot shit you talkin could get you popped forreal

Take my advice, I sugested like a cotton a meal
If not, fuck it, you can starve and keep your eyes pealed
But, don't get me involved, I don't owe you shit
The same goes for that little bitch that's all on my dick

Your all just a bunch of misserable fucks
Broke, mad, drunk , high and gangsta'ed up
It's so sad, I wish that I could cry for him and her
I'm busy mastering this ?? tryna stay up

And their ain't no looking back, I got my crazy mind made up
My nigga L home just in time to witness me bust
Niggaz say and speak the truth, getty that's whatsup
Go in the booth, produce the proof, show these niggaz how to really give up

Armageddon,"Chorus:
She want to take me home, lay me up inside her home
She want to turn me on, breakfast in the mornin'
She said ""daddy let me take ya home, papi let me take ya home""
And I said ""Mami you can take me home if you let the whole crew get on"" (bitch)

Verse 1:
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's whilin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin on Crential and cruisin for food when she pulled up beside me sat off in the lap
And I said ""damn girl you actin like you don't know, never seen me before,
never see the crins on MTV video? what you think TS stand for?""
She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no vitar
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX, now I'm rich got the world screamin Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go, every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin me....

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I was up in the club right as I'm Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin me....

[Chorus (phone call)]

[Verse 3: Armageddon]
Yous a big girl, eat it up, now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin up swervin the bumps
I'm trynna fuck but I ain't trynna fuck the 23's up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Trynna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just called the boat the front seat
And I think she's about to go down for a season
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
3 in the mornin and actin indecent
She so horny damn this shit seems like every other night I got a group of chicks beggin me....

[Chorus 2x]",Take Me Home,2004
Armageddon,"Riding high on burnished wings
And with a brazen eye
The buzzard waits to take its pick
Waiting on that helpless cry
In the time it takes
The moment that you're right off guard
Bridges that you thought you'd crossed
Got to cross 'em all again

Just as lightning strikes
Before the thunder
The buzzard falls upon its prey
Before it has a chance to wonder
But the meek will stand
Understanding nature
Seeing far beyond the plan

Take their place in time
Take their place in timeless structure

Out, out of the dark surrounding shadows
Tearing apart ? trying to get to me
Sometimes you'll see, sometimes you'll feel
Colder than steel, instantly real

Burn, burning with fire, from the depths of time
Enter my space to take my grace from me
Slither and slide, ready to hide
Far down inside ? waiting with pride",Buzzard,1975

Get the same jewel mouth full of heavy Mo'
Coulda made you a thug from the guy with the mo'
But yo, I ain't never met a chick that was innocent
They all fuck some, eat some, never kiss

See me in the video like, ""Bitch is suckin dick!""

Ludacris be the number one street - clown wishin 'em luck
Cause I'm bout to make 'em break a leg thinkin I'm givin a FUCK
And you catch a beat - down, bottles is breakin, craniums crack
Chairs thrown when the heat is attacked
and you hear the street - sound, hitters and runners
Killers and gunners, winter to summer the niggaz that want us
are headed East - bound, trouble in West other than South
Cover your chest, they cover your mouth
I'm goin deep - down Dirty indeed, birdies in need
Thirty degrees and you heard it from me
but I'm bout to reach - 'round grabbin my gun
They scatter and run but I'm handlin and havin some fun
They gotta keep - rounds up under the bed, up under the spread
If it ain't then it ain't, no wonder you dead
So go to sleep - now, throats is splitted
and folks that get it they gotta get the hell on widdit, BIATCH

Leave you in the fetal position, witcha ass out
Ready to mash out any crew actin like
they the true facts of life, frontin through the camera lights
Despite, we hold it down regardless
I got Def Jam suckin me like, ""I wish you was my artist""
For starters, who's the largest cat?
Get a hundred grand from my most garbage rap
Now how hard is that? Everything we spit be hot
Whether it's live on Flex or in front of the chicken spot
Grimed out, we really live whatchu rhyme 'bout
See me posted up in the Tunnel, with my shines out
Ice cold like Alaska when I pass ya
Got girls shakin, losin they breath, as if they catchin asthma
Headed to the bar to pop some bottles
Now we in the car headed home to rock some models
All I hear in the background is Gucci and Prada
But I'm tryna gas these bitches to screw me for nada
We the best that done it, confess you fronted
Anybody want to test how much straps, you want it?

[Hook - Fat Joe]
Aiyyo the gangsta's back
Stop it right where you at
Let a real nigga rock real murderer rap
Tell them thug niggaz, listen to that
Gotchu feelin it hard like Joe the God's really bringin it back!

[Fat Joe]
I'm from my days and legends, since age eleven
I was the cause of dope fiends catchin AIDS infections
Most of us are dead, but the rest is locked
Runnin in the rec room and check me out on the box
A CEO could get optioned tryna change the channel
It's like tryna take the flesh outta the mouth of hungry cannibals
Joe the God, the flow is hard
Known for packin two dozen birds like Noah's Ark
I'm the realest of 'em, make you feel the pressure
Catch you at a club, smack you up, steal ya leather
You niggaz soften me, beat you out of the mix
Tough talk, tough walk, but you cry like a bitch
I see you downin the Cris', I'm not hatin, I'm just aggrevated
I ask myself every day, how these faggots made it?
Fuck around with the Don and get decapitated
I'm sick of hearin 'em (?) for all the cats that made it

[Hook - Fat Joe]
[Hook 2 - Armageddon]
Aiyyo the kid is back
Leave it right where you at
Let a real nigga hold that, you probably won't clap
Tell them thug niggaz, move it on back
I'm feelin tight and I'm hot
Ready to pop the crack right through your back

[Armageddon]
That's how Kenny rocks, I'm more advanced than how your learnin
I'm like the force of space balance and planets while they churnin
Poppin rosary beads, piss on ya candle while it's burnin
Rush ya widows crib and pop ya... bodies...
Now I know you can feel the heat I generate
Imagine when I penetrate ya stomach, and make ya body's center bake
We can argue for days, whether it's faster to drop five shots
in ya astronaut before you cloud the stash box
Splash ya brains on ya birds' laps
Swerve you on the curb, crash the Range, and push the front skirt back
And murk after that, blurtin curse words
Yo I popped that nigga's son one before we catch the first
I'ma kill any murderer, leave a nigga burpin up
Blood, chokin on chunks of his lung interior
Every verse that I spit's a personal riff
I meet a ill key frontin, I'm a murder you shit
Niggaz play me while distrubin the Bricks
I'm like the feelin of the first time they ever held a bird in they grip
Motivator thug, scrape 'em, shoot the bolts in his butt
Energizin 'em up, make 'em want to open 'em up
Actin like I can't happen till I smack him in his Adam's apple
Death to rappin, I don't want to battle
I'd rather rush your studio session and shatter the booth
Clap at ya face, give the mic feedback the goof

None better (Bronx niggaz, uhh)
Life of a hustler (ha-hah, what'chu know about that?)
Yo, yo, yo
Yo the mind of a hustler be trained to count money and lies
Supplyin customers and keep it peace and just spendin they time
Pop another thug that's tryin to scream but they dimes
Hoppin all the clubs in town, they don't need to wear shines
They got that energy, confident and always aware
who's watchin them, bitches on top of them, they don't just be near
Probably spot poppy and them they robbed last year
and just, nod and stare and show no fear
Cause nine times out of ten this bitch connects this kid to shoot you
They too hot so catchin a body's too crucial
If you a hustler, I know you relate
Whether you home base or go out of state
This shit is real
and you better recognize when you see 'em, these niggaz kill
A whole 'nother drug dealer keep 'em with steels
So be creepin so it's real on the deal, with the F-E-D
Some of them sleep in six feet cause they skrilled

Fuckin with hustlers - you see us in the clubs
Everybody want to be us, wife beaters and flip drugs
We them hustlers - a little thug's role model
Where the snubb full of hollow's tryna earn a little power

And real dealers don't be yappin on the phone

There go the dial tone, click, now you steamin with holes

Mad cause I'm the only nigga reppin our people
When I came in this game, no one wanted the job
All of a sudden niggas actin like they wanna go hard
Spittin venom 'bout the Squad, try and shittin the God
This ain't no ""Scarface"" shit, blow up your kids in the car
And since you wanna act like you livin a movie
I'll hit you with more shots than Bruce Lee got in a ""Fist of Fury""
Bitch niggas, nothin but snitch niggas
Today you on my dick, tomorrow you on his nigga
Got deported from the Squad, can't afford another car
Where's your house at? I heard your livin with your moms (livin with your moms)
Blane nigga better stay in your place
Keep talkin, burst a flame in your face, motherfucker

[Armageddon]
Yo, yo, with this comparison the Geddy is God
Cause even though you never seen me, I been put fear in your hearts
And I'm smooth like a Mulo it theme
Skip bullets of your Coogi beam
Before you knew you were seen
Yeah I'm nice and I don't care if you know
Cause all you really need to understand is how hard I'm rulin with Joe
And the streets is no place for late bloomers
Just gangsta niggas, snakes and bitches that meant to spread rumors
Listen, I'm from the Bronx were the gun shoot rabid
Front if you want, but don't think we don't shoot rapids
I'm what some might consider a ghost
Cause I move at night, plus I'm the type to play a live nigga close
I'm the ultimate, high consulted, rhyme vocalist
I write dope, spit dust and shit cocoa bricks
This is what you dicks need to act-knowledge
Or get the shit smacked outta ya fat cabbage
Don't ask why we act violent
We just killas and thugs
Niggas wit mad talent, that still dabble in drugs
I only rap now to speak to the streets
They say the Squad gotta feed 'em the beef
So we gonna feed 'em the beef

[Prospect]
My nine milly blaze, and hit hard like Willy Mays
Since my kiddy days, grew up with thugs who were really crazed
Ain't no silly games, right here be the truth
150 proof, whoever, I'm talkin to you
They call me Prospect, I'm one in a mil
One of the real, I rap but I still put a gun in your grill
I'm the reason why I catch you when your car breezin by, with your Iceberg team
You look when the light turns green
Your scared to death, don't make me have to air at ya chest
Or tear ya flesh, for actin like I carin what's left
Anyone can get it in a minute give it some time, I'm livin this rhyme
Let my nine get in your spine, sit and recline
Get so mad, forget and rewind
So I can see what I did again and just slide
To the next level, hop on the bike and just pedal
Bustin at your best rebel, who runnin to test medal
Let me get settled, lay my mom down in this game
For niggas kinda refain, I push 'em down in the train
Bout it the same, my three cousins up in the Benz
Big, G Psycho and E, ya'll know what this is

[Remy Martin]
Yo, yo, It's the T, E, a are a, a are a, O, are Squad
So you know I gotta be that bitch Remy Mar
With Armageddon and your nigga Joe The God
Tony Sunshine and motherfuckin Prospect
Straight out the projects
A forest, where they kill for mils and they blast the steel
But I'm from murda murda Castle Hill
I got a big ass burner, but I'll slash your grill
Yo don't got no status, don't want no static
They knew you was loco toto, and I don't no Spanish
All I know is how to cock back and aim for the cabbage
And keep on bustin 'til the bitch brain splatter
And the kids won't matter, when the crib's on fire
What you spit don't matter, cause this bitch on fire
And I won't stop rockin 'til I retire
Any bitch disagree is a god damn liar

[Outro - Fat Joe talking]
Yeah, uh infamous Terror Squad nigga
Loyalty, what does it mean to you
How many a ya'll niggas is loyal?
All these Benedict Arnold niggas
Switch sidin niggas, ya heard?
Nigga I throw this whole rap shit out the window in a sec, ya heard?
Joe Crack the Don Diggler
The savior, Caesar, the streets is mine nigga
We ride, who wanna test the record launcher, ya see 'em?

So I pieced him out with pity 'coz his ass was on fire

What goes around comes around holmes I ain't lyin'
That's why the scars on my face 'coz bad karma and violence
Just before a nigga wake I spend the night in silence
To give my nerves a little break before it's back to the malice
I'd like to dedicate this rhyme to old emotional scars
Some nights I meditate hopin' bring me closer to God
Tryin' to regulate my time between the Earth and the stars
Get my health back to determine when I curlin' them bars

To all my, to all my, to all my, to all my
To all my peoples that passed away
Uh huh
To all my peoples that passed away, to all my, to all my
To to to, Free sanity and wings as they cast away

[Verse 1: Armageddon]
Sometimes I envious on peoples that past away
They so synonm, there wings being cast away
I dream so vivid, the scene shakes me fast awake
I keep thinking maybe somethings tryna show me how to master my faith

They say I'm deep and too complex for rap
But yo, I grew to learn there's more to life then cars and gats
So I chose to share the light and write my bars with that
But niggaz scared to grow so they tend to hold you back

They take this shit that they don't understand and call it wack
Tell you that ain't the way it goes son, that's conscience rap
But why'all running in circles working the same old act
And I done reaching at a level, but I'm wrong for that

And I ain't bitching, I'm just tryna let you know where I'm at
I'm getting old, as my son grows, so do my raps
I feel your misery, you living off the next mans life
He just as bad, 'cause he dreams you can strengthen his light

I want to shout out all the two time fellas holding guns for weak thugs
Risking their freedom, for short money and weak love
85 is tryna earn respect from them young boys
Catching temper tantroms, having fits like young boys

And bitches do it too, get deffensive and peranoid
See everybody want to have some power to exploit
Now maybe you can tell me who's the problem at this point
Me or you homes, I hope you following this joint

Stress free, people holla day
Just another me, to see another day
So let the slugs breathe
Easy for a day, I feel all alone while the clouds keep ??

[2nd Verse: Armageddon]
Niggaz tryna please the crowd when they creating their rhymes
I just be thinking out loud, why'all ain't gonna pay me no mind
Maybe I'm living in the clouds, or just ahead of my time
I got books of all the shit I wrote between all the crimes

Looking back, tryna trace tracks just to see what I find
Nothing but evidence, back to fact the world is mine
And I ain't irrogant, I'm just Intellectually pompous
'Cause I can super seed anything you accomplish

This nigga dry snitching like he looking for sympathy
Nobody give a fuck about you or your history
Do you nigga?Make some shit shop a deal
'Cause that hot shit you talkin could get you popped forreal

Take my advice, I sugested like a cotton a meal
If not, fuck it, you can starve and keep your eyes pealed
But, don't get me involved, I don't owe you shit
The same goes for that little bitch that's all on my dick

Your all just a bunch of misserable fucks
Broke, mad, drunk , high and gangsta'ed up
It's so sad, I wish that I could cry for him and her
I'm busy mastering this ?? tryna stay up

And their ain't no looking back, I got my crazy mind made up
My nigga L home just in time to witness me bust
Niggaz say and speak the truth, getty that's whatsup
Go in the booth, produce the proof, show these niggaz how to really give up

Armageddon,"Chorus:
She want to take me home, lay me up inside her home
She want to turn me on, breakfast in the mornin'
She said ""daddy let me take ya home, papi let me take ya home""
And I said ""Mami you can take me home if you let the whole crew get on"" (bitch)

Verse 1:
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's whilin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin on Crential and cruisin for food when she pulled up beside me sat off in the lap
And I said ""damn girl you actin like you don't know, never seen me before,
never see the crins on MTV video? what you think TS stand for?""
She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no vitar
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX, now I'm rich got the world screamin Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go, every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin me....

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I was up in the club right as I'm Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin me....

[Chorus (phone call)]

[Verse 3: Armageddon]
Yous a big girl, eat it up, now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin up swervin the bumps
I'm trynna fuck but I ain't trynna fuck the 23's up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Trynna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just called the boat the front seat
And I think she's about to go down for a season
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
3 in the mornin and actin indecent
She so horny damn this shit seems like every other night I got a group of chicks beggin me....

Veo que tu cuerpo se mueve al compás de mi reggae

Y que tu cuerpo se moja al bailar
Todos con ella quieren perrear, pero no se va a dejar
Pues yo soy el que ella prefiere

Veo que tu cuerpo se mueve al compás de mi reggae
Y que tu cuerpo se moja al bailar
Todos con ella quieren perrear, pero no se va a dejar
Pues yo soy el que ella prefiere

Pues perrea mujer, conmigo
Yo a ti te domino
Te controlo
No te quites yal, que esto es lo mío

Tu cuerpo me provoca
A que ignore a las otras
Tu roce me calienta
Y a ti te pone violenta

Suéltate entera, tu belleza me cautiva
Y me lleva a un estado mental de erotismo
Tu sensualidad causa hipnotismo y yo mismo admito
Que eres la belleza mas grande que yo he visto

Pero en la disco te me pierdes y es difícil encontrarte entre la gente
Ya que el antro está lleno porque hoy yo canto
Tu te alejas de los hombres que causan espanto
Pero yo siempre acierto en el blanco

Y te termino llevando pa' mi cuarto pa' estar dando
Porque esta noche me terminaras amando
Luego recordando lo que había pasado y tu llamando
Pa' que te esté propinando

Tu roce me excita, en la pista me motiva
A que te lleve a otro lado, en mi cama tienes cita
Asista a la disco pa' que te toque perrear con este man
O con el laides, como me quieras llamar

Así que suéltate en la pista (mami)
Suéltate en la disco (mami)
No te hagas la difícil que eso no pega contigo (mami)
Quieres que te azote y no pare de perrear, pues dale
Girla si te pegas te va a gustar

Se te marca el gistro (mami)
Dale suavecito (mami)
Perea tu conmigo, tu sabes que esto es lo mío (mami)
Si ya empezamos yo no voy a terminar hasta que tu me digas
Me tienes que propinar

Veo que tu cuerpo se mueve al compás de mi reggae
Y que tu cuerpo se moja al bailar
Todos con ella quieren perrear, pero no se va a dejar
Pues yo soy el que ella prefiere

Veo que tu cuerpo se mueve al compás de mi reggae

Cuando el bajo retumbaba todo el suelo de la disco
Sudor baja con sabor a alcohol
Como extraño esos tiempos
Y es que hoy en día. No se que ha pasao’ en estos días
No pueden evolucionar con la misma batería
Entonces no sabemos ni como movernos
¿Esto es bachata, merengue o es un pop?
¿Y el perreo, donde quedo?
Puede que bailarlo se te olvido
Entonces agarra una nena en el medio de la pista y
Píllala, píllala, píllala fuerte

Te estás preguntando cual es el procedimiento
Cual es este ritmo que se escucha tan violento
Escucha el dembow

Primero que nada, mira, agarra a una mujer

Mira, dale, pana mío. Pégate que pa’ eso fue que vino
Bellaquera full, no te va’ a buscar un lío
Yo se que no eres de aquí pero bienvenido
Pide un trago y patá’ bajo pa’ la pista nos fuimos

Ahora viene la parte 
pa’ que ella se luzca
Ella se luzca y
Mueve el booty, mueve el booty, mueve el boom boom

Me gusta el dembow como el sonido de Yamaha
Música que provoca más polvo que Maja
Y si la gatita hasta abajo te baja
Siente el dembow. Siente el dembow
Kick y snare. Kick y snare
Y un timbal con el bajo va a sonar (dembow)
Éste es el ritmo que la puso a bailar (dembow)
Hasta en chancleta así que no va a protestar (dembow)

Que en el 2012 el mundo se va a acabar
Así que vamo’ a aprovecharlo, ma

Hazlo temblar como si fuera Japan
Y luego te vas a ahogar de tanto sudar

Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1997

The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
Well every day my confusion grows

I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way
I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?

I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear

Insomnia

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep
I can't get no sleep

Woke me out of sleep
Said, ""Girl, you best get on your feet, 
Don't miss the ride""
Last night that angel spoke to me
Said I was going deep
Said I shouldn't fight the love I feel inside

That you were in the way
Forget about those games I used to play, 
Don't press rewind
Baby, I can't have another man,
I want you in my life
Honey, you could be the perfect for me
For all time

If I told you, too many times
That you would make me feel alive
I just want to know you, never let you hide
Even all your little white lies
Only gonna be a matter of mind

Acting like a fool
I'll never calm a buzz like this
The fever's burning through
So the poison's invaded and now I begin
To not know what to do
Just the smell of you got me going back to school

If I told you, too many times
That you would make me feel alive
I just want to know you, never let you hide
Even all your little white lies
Only gonna be a matter of mind

Sometimes it takes him weeks

Too young to have a spouse
I like to try new things

And we share all our time, all, all our time, all, all our time

And kiss me on the mouth

Armando Manzanero,"Hoy, me prometí que te tengo que olvidar
Aunque en las noches me enferme de pesar
Y que no vuelva jamás a suspirar

Hoy, aunque hayas sido mi único querer
Me prometí que me tengo que imponer
El sacrificio de no volverte a ver

Hoy, el sol me dijo que tú amor era mi error
Que no me has dado ni cariño ni calor
Que sólo hicistes más grande mi dolor

Hoy, por ser tan tuya no me vuelvo a preocupar
Ni con tus besos me vuelvo a equivocar
Por Dios te juro que te tengo que olvidar

Hoy, hoy

",Hoy,1992
Armando Manzanero,"Nooo 
Porque tus errores me tienen cansado
Porque en nuestras vidas ya todo ha pasado
Porque no me has dado ni un poco de ti

Nooo 
Porque con tus besos, no encuentro dulzura
Porque tus reproches, me dan amargura
Porque no sentimos, lo mismo que ayer

Te digo que no
Porque ya no estaño como antes tu ausencia
Porque ya disfruto aun sin tu presencia
Ya no queda esencia del amor de ayer

No, No, No 
Aunque me juraras que mucho has cambiado
Para mí lo nuestro ya esta terminado
No me pidas nunca 
Que vuelva jamás

Pues fue una hermosa forma de sentir, de vivir de morir 
Why a tu sombra seguir, asi yo te ame.

Como yo te ame ni en sueños lo podras imaginar
Pues todo el tiempo te perteneci ilusion no senti
Que no fuera por ti, asi es como te ame

Como yo te ame por poco o mucho tiempo que me quede por 
Vivir es verbo que jamas podre volver a repetir
Comprendo que fue una exageracion lo que yo te ame
Como yo te ame no creo que algun dia tu lo quieras entender 
Tendras que enamorarte como lo hice yo de ti para asi saber

Armando Morales,"The love of God has been extended
To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men
There's hope in saving grace

Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Oh, the love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

His glory is supernal, supernal

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2001

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

Truth is in all that I tell

Friend to my whole family
He always tell me when John Brown
Was getting ready to come around

Don't blame me
Don't blame me

I hide it all except a few seeds
And make him think I plant for me
When Mr Grant and I know all the while
We've got enough for the whole island

Three years now we sell it in town
Under the bucket that goes down
No one knew of it but three:
Mr Grant, Davis and me

You're losing ground

You ain't asking for much

As she has... Had time to heal 
And she doesn't need you any longer 

And you... Had time to drink 
And you call her to tell her 
You've gotten much stronger 
At three in the morning 

She says ""Stop calling cause... 
Everyone's asleep 
Some of us work 
You're driving me crazy 

I've learned to get on with my life"" 
Now every night's Friday night 
Picking fights with your friends 
Somehow trying to make amends 

So you search for comfort in a friend 
It ain't the same she won't understand 
You both learned to think alike 
So what was so wrong 

Where's she tonight 
Out there drinking 
While you're left in thinking 
It's taking all the life left in... You

Armin van Buuren,"Free like the river 
Flowin' freely through infinity 
Free to be sure of 
What I am and who I need not be 
Free from all worries 
Worries prey on oneself's troubled mind 
Freer than the clock's hands 
Tickin' way the times 
Freer than the meaning of free that man defines 
Life running through me 
Till I feel my father God has called 

Me having nothin' 
But possessing riches more than all 
And I'm free 
To be nowhere 
But in every place I need to be 
Freer than a sunbeam 
Shinning through my soul 
Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold 
Free from conceiving the beginning 
For that's the infinite start 

I'm gone gone but still living 
Life goes on without a beating heart 

Free like a vision 
That the mind of only you can see 

Freer than a raindrop 
Falling from the sky 
Freer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes 

I'm free like a river 
Flowin' freely to infinity 
I'm free to be sure of what 
I am and who I need not be 
I'm much freer, like the meaning of the word free that 
Crazy man defines 
Free, free like the vision that 
The mind of only you are ever gonna see 
Free like the river my life 
Goes on and on through infinity",Free [Olav Basoski's Bodyckeck Remix],2000

Now I wait for you
Till you wake me, from my sleep
And I'll wait for you
Let my voice be, yours to keep

The touch of your hand, on me
A night everlasting, comes too deep
Don't make me wait, for what I need
This passion is burning, deep in me

Was just in time replaced by the magic appearance of a new day-while
A melancholic Reno was crawling on his back just in
Front of the supermarket door-way child

Hey girl, on a cold summer night
As we stood on the corner
As a man passed by and asked us
What we were doing what we need
As he pointed his big fat finger
To the people hangin' round at the corner of the - other side of street
Oh well

Doin' nothing, just hanging around
What do you mean doin' nothing Sir
So we had to hit him to the ground
Doin' nothing just hanging around
His head all busted lookin' just a little to wise child

Or are we alone?
Alone

Where is the feeling?

Everybody needs to know
Somebody who cares.
Just a friendly face
You can trust to be there.
Are you afraid to be known
And not be a stranger?

Cause everyones connected but no one is connecting
The human element has long been missing
Tell me, have you seen it?
Have you seen it?

Or are we alone?
'Cause I need something to believe in
Tell me, are we alone?
Where is the life? Where is the feeling?
Is anybody out there?
Is anyone listening?
Is anyone left in this whole world?
Or are we alone?
Alone

You don't even go outside anymore
Only feel safe feeling hollow
You think your scars are way too deep to be cured

You hide your heart in the shadows
So afraid to open up to anyone

And I can make it burn again, like the sun

Let me hold you tonight
Just open your eyes you will see the light

If you fall, then I'll fall right by your side
When your done and your loosing sight
And your lost then I'll guide you back into the light

Every step you take, will speak, remain

Within her sentinel moon
Shielding me from the lifeless black
When all her children leave
I will stay behind
To guard the queen
And hold the line

Oh, a beautiful aura of blue surrounds her

In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance

I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos, honey

And that's why
I won't dance, why should I
I won't dance, how could I
I won't dance, merci beaucoup

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1997
Armstrong,"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
