The Cables,"So no one told your life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's DOA
Seems like we're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week
Your month, or even your year

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to fall
I'll be there for you
'Cause I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

You're still in bed at ten, your work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast so far, things ain't going great
Your mother told you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world had brought
You down to your knees

But I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to fall
I'll be there for you
'Cause I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows
What it's like to be me

Someone to spend the day with
Make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst, I'm best with you, oh

Seems like we're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week
Your month, or even your year

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to fall
I'll be there for you
'Cause I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to fall
I'll be there for you
'Cause I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too",I'll Be There,2002
The Cactus Blossoms,"Stoplight kisses, what I want from you
Stoplight kisses, all I want to do

When I pull up to the crosswalk, ease up on the small talk
You know what's on my mind
I loosen up my seatbelt, make it really heartfelt
Kissing time till the don't walk sign

Stoplight kisses, telling you it's true
Stoplight kisses, you drive away my blues

Well the sky got dark, and I got late and I can't see straight
I'm moving slow when the light turns green
Prettiest eyes I've ever seen, oh

Stoplight kisses, telling you it's true
Stoplight kisses, you drive away my blues

Stoplight kisses, what I'll give to you
Stoplight kisses, all I want to do

When I pull into a side street, I can feel your heartbeat
You're so close to me
The rhythm of the traffic sounds like magic
We can make a melody

Stoplight kisses, telling you it's true
Stoplight kisses, you drive away my blues

Well, stoplight kisses, you drive away my blues",Stoplight Kisses,2016
The Cactus Brothers,"Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said ""Well, a-bless my soul""

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin', better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don´t a-get you, then the left one will

The Cactus Brothers,"Just about a year ago, I set out on the road,
Seekin my fame and fortune, lookin for a pot of gold.
Things got bad, and things got worse, I guess you will know the tune.
Oh ! lord, stuck in lodi again.

Rode in on the greyhound, Ill be walkin out if I go.
I was just passin through, must be seven months or more.
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my friends.
Oh ! lord, Im stuck in lodi again.

The man from the magazine said I was on my way.
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play.
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans fell through
Oh ! lord, stuck in lodi again.

Mmmm...
If I only had a dollar, for every song Ive sung.
And evry time Ive had to play while people sat there drunk.
You know, Id catch the next train back to where I live.
Oh ! lord, Im stuck in lodi again.

The Cactus Brothers,"I lay here at night, toss and I turn, lovin' you so, how my heart yearns,
Honey, you're the reason I don't sleep at night.
A-justa walkin' the floor, thinkin' of you, smoke cigarettes, and drink all day too,
Honey, you're the reason I can't sleep at night.

I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me, but if I'm wrong don't fail to call,
Come over and keep me-hee company.
I go for a walk, look at the moon, strum my guitar to some old lonesome tune,

The Cadets,"Dos gardenias para ti
con ellas quiero decir
te quiero, te adoro, mi vida
Ponles toda tu atención
porque son tu corazon y el mio

Dos gardenias para ti
que tendrán todo el calor de un beso
de esos que te di
y que jamas encontraras
en el calor de otro querer

A tu lado vivirán y te hablaran
como cuando estas conmigo
y hasta creerás
que te dirán te quiero.

Pero si un atardecer
las gardenias de mi amor se mueren
es porque han adivinado
que tu amor se ha marchitado
porque existe otro querer

The Cadets,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,1958
The Cadets,"Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day,
My heart was yearning.
I promised I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart
And left me yearning

As we walked into the room,
There were faces
Staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
And said this is the place,
You said meet you right here at noon

Heartbreak hotel
Heartbreak hotel
Heartbreak hotel
Heartbreak hotel

Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other

Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought in beguile
To hurt me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me

We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue,
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through.

The Cadets,"I dropped into a tavern where I saw some friends of mine
The party was gettin' underway and the truth was really flyin'

And I got loaded
I got loaded
I got loaded man, I sure got high

I told my pretty baby that I wouldn't stay out no more
You know every time I tried to leave I fell down on the floor

I got loaded
I got loaded
I got loaded man, I sure got high

It made me feel so happy baby, while it was goin' down
I took a sip every trip that bottle went around

And I got loaded

I got loaded man, I sure got high

Last thing I remember, I heard somebody say
Doggone my soul, let's really roll until the break of day

And stay awake both day and night

Oodles of butter and somethin sweet

Bicarbonated soda by the pound

The Cadets,"I crashed in the jungle while tryin' to keep a date
With my little girl who was back in the states
I was stranded in the jungle afraid and alone
Tryin' to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know there was a record jump my plane
Had been picked up and spotted my girl in lovers lane
And meanwhile, back in the states

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle flat as he can be
So come on pretty baby just you and me
Meanwhile back in the jungle

The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was with cooking gear
I smelled something cookin' and I looked to see
That's when; I found out they was a cookin' me
Great Cuckoo let me outta her
Meanwhile back in the states

[Chorus]

I jumped outta the pot and finally got away
Frantic and worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
But my chance of survival was gettin' mighty slim
So I thumbed down a whale who was headin' my way
And I reached the states in bout a half a day
And when I got to lovers lane I was almost dead
When my soul was gone, here's what I said

Baby, baby, your man is no good
Baby, baby, he should've understood
You can trust me as long as can be
So come back pretty baby where you used to be
Cause I love you, cause I love you
Cause I love you, cause I love you
Cause I love you,",Stranded in the Jungle,1993

In the darkness when you find this
I'll be out of reach

When you missed every shot

My faults shine in the sun
A train bridge of spies
Watches all the cars collide

I roll my green sleeves over Ruby
I don't blame you for doing it to me
Real girls don't take aim
Like kings do these days

I made my mind up to be a black winged bird
Never turn my head for how things were
Leave the bluest skies for boys to burn
And I'll soar on my way
Sad as the state of things we can't change

Now we're paper dolls all aflame
In houses that all look the same

An arson for a wilderness

I hide my saints in the willow trunk
You started me on this junk
Now my black lungs are blue
But I'm still singing to you

If it's strong enough to hold me
Then I'm weak enough to live
But I can't ever leave you, baby I believe
Just want to be the one who shakes down the last leaf

Long time running from the strong lines that holds
It's all I've known, don't adjust your set
There are cracks on the pavement
So watch where you walk
I'm up in my room, can you be here soon?

You've put it across forbidden lines
If you never brought it back
I'd never know how where to find it

I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
BDP Posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam
I'm not Superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School
'cause Rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no-one's from the Old School 'cause Rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
'cause we'll be the Old School artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
'cause even then, I'm still number one.

[Verse 2]
Blastmaster KRS-One of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
KRS-One stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The Alfa Romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
'cause I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old School artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
KRS-One is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions
Made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple: BDP will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one.

Will get you for them zippers, on a quest for them chippas

Hanging at the high school getting at them young bitches
I got the dove sacks, homies love that (who got the bud)
Where the bud at, hollering at my big homeboy who fresh out
Hanging at my grand mama house, homie burnt out
What you gonna do when you get out of jail (speak on it)
I'm gonna have some fun
What do you consider fun a ounce and about five hun
So I put him on a move that I know about
Hooked him with a home girl from the South (good looking out)
Money made, plug a player in the game
Especially when he represent the same thing I claim
Damn they don't make niggas like they used to
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce deuce (that's real)
Cause everybody wanna be a star
In the city of dope, a.k.a. caviar

What have we a house full of cavi (no stress)
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up so hard we sticking up niggas
Tired of the bullshit so we clicken up
Nigga please we ain't tripping off C's and B's
It's the West side Connect with the DPG's
For the cheese we jab with the gift of the gab
Always capping, Mack, Cube and Snoop rapping
Now how did that happen it's all good (fool)
So peep game If you could
Snoop be from Long Beach and I be from Inglewood
Now you despise cause it came to yo surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A we parlay the G way
Some wear red and black and some sport blue and gray
So gangsta's don't dance we hang boogie and bang
So it's the Westside Connect with the Dogg Pound Gang

The Cali Kings,"They don't give a fuck
So I don't give a fuck

Makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Moving through the L.A. streets with the homeboys
Dipping in the toy having Chips Ahoy
Cookies and these rookies still can't see us
A lotta people wanna be us cause we's the O.G.'es
Real Eastside riders from the hood
And I wish niggas would
Come at me like it's all good
If y'all could you'd probably do the same thing
Rap, sling dope, pimp hoes, or gang bang
And it's a goddamn shame, but
Now the babies is the ones blued down and flamed up
Sagging with they neighborhood flag inside they pockets
Think they ain't? They even spray paint the sprockets
On they bike, yelling, ""What that Eastside like?""
Getting high in the bleachers while the teachers on strike
Books collect dust on they shelf
Parents either dead or gone, so they raise theyself
But who cares

Some talk about killing, some hear about it, some do it
Some can't handle it, and others just numb to it
You think we got problems? They the ones
Cause kids is having kids, and kids is having guns
Ask yours daughters and sons what they learning in school
And watch em look at you like you a fool
All they learn is how to smoke a bidi
How to do a tattoo use a rubber, cuss, fight, and write graffiti
The TV and the radio is raisin em
Parents hold your breath, cause death ain't even fazing em
A single mother out working like a slave
Ain't no home cooked meal, just a microwave
Oven, what happened to the loving?
Good taste done been replaced by pushing, and shoving
It all started at home with the family
Now we can't save em, or can we?
Who cares

Makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

They don't give a fuck
So I don't give a fuck

Don't nobody care what happen to us
Except God Almighty, in whom we trust
I bust rhymes like these for a reason
Cause for everything up under the sun it's a season
To live and die, laugh and cry
Everybody knows shit happens, but nobody knows why
And they don't even try to learn
By letting the 5 Percent teach em, it's like they rather burn
And for niggas just to turn they life around and chill
It's harder to save, than it is to kill
As we spill each other blood in the streets
I see yellow tape and wonder who that is up under the sheet
Another child just got shot down
Now what's the chances that they not black and not brown?
A lotta people crowd around cause they feel they got to stop and stare
But they don't really care

Makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

They don't give a fuck
So I don't give a fuck",Whoop Whoop,1998

I work the angles sharp and precise
Dilated Peoples so you better build twice
Act like ya know, not now but right now
Dilated Peoples

The name is Iriscience

I go through rivers (what?) so I don't leave a scent
I travel both directions but leave one set of prints
It's just a little trick, of the indigenous
Developing inner visions of what religion is
I caught the understanding and the underhanded
I plan to build my ship and man it to another planet
Under heavy surveillance, many different agents
Some are camouflage, others are very blatant
I study weapon systems and vocal fighting forms
I'm many moves ahead, the thoughts are highly formed
Like time times time times time is time squared
Went there, sayin' ""Rakaa you don't rhyme fair""
But I never dummy lyrics and they kick it to my people
It's about communication not a rappers ego
Messages I sneak in they seem to seep in
Mixed with alcohol and weed on the weekend
Shared among friends like various sins
One day it clicks it's no longer dim
Time release capsules humble the headstrong
Your thoughts of takin' me head on are dead wrong

[Chorus]

It's the master of Aikido
I let go, karate confrontations 
Evidence scientist in innovation
I locks on when I travels around planets
Smooth but got a rough edge like Wulitzer pianists
Display mucho attack, receive payments for the cadence
A in this, you get fit fowl with flagrance
Free agents on the dotted line more hard to sign
Not easily impressed with gold mines and whole nines
I'm somewhere in-between never rushed and in a hurry
And when I swing my bat I don't think I'll miss like baseball
Fury the jury's hung, from verdict and got no chance
Dilated comes first the rest are second like Stu Lance

Oh yes it get better everyday 
The A-1, is my mind on vintage display?
Unattended in this case 
(The Ace two steps ahead)
Everyday is Mayday and best friends are Feds
But I know this that's why they closest
In a crisis situation you negotiate first 
I'm perfectly focused
Strategic and in a zone 
It was radar detected but my speed was unknown
Anonymity, that's my key to survival
Ev is not for Evidence it's for all the dense on trial
Just remember in this game it take two to tango
Don't go to them let them come to you 
And work the angles

Do you recognize my face?
One of despair again
Is it gone without a trace?
I feel I'm alive again, rescued from the void
Here I'm alone with you
Here I'm at home with you, even now

Look, look they're running close behind
Those you thought your enemies
Are friends now standing by your side
Fight for every step you take
Shaped by every lie you've ever heard

Pain, pain, the pain I've been forced to see
Blame, the blame belongs
To no one but me but oh, I still care
Even so, I still feel loved
Even so, even here, even now
Even now, even now, even now",Even Now,1986

Known to all who hear the sound

Your journey ends so far, and still the distance
Spins round and round you
Now you cry give me sanctuary
You scream but no one listens
Again you cry give me sanctuary
Until the end I'll fight and die, to be free
Oh! No sanctuary

You're walking halfway in
But crawling halfway out
There's a void in your mind that you cling to
You feel lost in time, you've got no words to rhyme
No more charms, no more spells to protect you

Oh can't you see the lies in front of you
Your journey ends so far, and still the distance

You find yourself involved
No escape can hide you
Sleep provides no rest at all

Meet me in this lonely place
Can't go on like this much longer

Lift the veil and let it fall
Caught beneath the surface
Worlds lie in between
You know the search will take you
Out beyond the world of things

What am I to say here?
Words so often fail
How am I to wake you?

From your sleep and left the
veil from your eyes
Will I find love with you?
I expect love from you
Will I find love here with you?

All my expectations
Fall upon this frozen ground
Fall upon this holy ground

It was envy I suppose
Once that passion takes you
It chills the body and the soul

Saying every word out loud

I had learned to fear

Out in the cold
Nothing to eat

Dream of a bride
A life alone

Lying in that jungle
Out in that heat
Fighting of my life
Dying for nothin'
Feeling a bullet enter my soul

The Call,"Too Many Tears Lyrics
Now as you know
It's your time on this earth
From a rock in the cradle
To a ride in the hearse
We keep moving upward
Toward everything free
Kindly look downward
The more you'll see me
I've had six years of luck
I've had six on the line
And I've poured myself out
Like an old bitter wine
I've seen much of nothin'
And nothin's the gain
Thrown on my backside
I don't know my name
	
There's too many tears
Too many tears
Too many people
In too many years
Some tears of laughter
Some tears of pain
Break like a fever
And fall like the rain

Points on the map, tears line the way
I've seen all your pretty things
And it won't stop the pain
There's been much confusion
With too many hurt
I feel my words dyin'
Down in the dirt
I've had lies in my head
There been lies in my heart
I've been tortured by this riddle
And I don't know how to stop
With a lightning flash and thunder, boys
And my mind starts to click
So do what you must do
And you best do it quick
Doctor, Oh Doctor
My world's in you hands
I feel like I'm dyin'
And boy I need a plan
Sister, sweet sister
There's blood on my lips
Why does it feel like
This room's doing flips
The rains come on time
It's clear I can tell
I've seen your work everywhere
And there's mercy in hell
With a lightning flash and thunder, boys
And again it all comes down
Do you see your life merging
With these poor souls on the ground",Too Many Tears,1987

The Call,"I can see night in the day time
Into the woods I quietly go
It takes all the strength I have in me
These are the woods
The night of the soul
Painful to see
Love without action
Painful to see years of neglect
Achin' to see all that they see
Still telling lies to the remains of respect
Creatures we are worth defending
It takes the right word said from the heart
Given to you without ending
Given to you, the purpose of art
Thousands of plans, I've made many
I wonder just how many plans I have made
Feelin' this mood overtake me
Finally to see the truth as it fades
Out of these woods will you take me
Out of these woods, out of the strom
Sinless child can you save me

The Call,"So here we are all alone
As the wine makes you mine for the night
Soft is the way that you feel
And hard is the way that we breathe
In out we're moving
Around with the dirt on the floor
I know what I lack is devotion
And I can't fight this off anymore

We'll go surrender to the night
We won't look back at our lives
And when you sleep I'll be there
To kiss your lips to breathe your air
Right or wrong it must go on
After this night we'll leave it all behind 

Two hearts beat as one
As I open my eyes
Well do you want to keep going?
Cause I've already come all undone

We'll go surrender to the night
We won't look back at our lives
And when you sleep I'll be there
To kiss your lips to breathe your air
Right or wrong it must go on
After this night we'll leave it all behind 

Now she's calling
And it hurts me to go
Away from my favourite addiction
There's no way that she'll ever know

We'll go surrender into our lives
When you sleep I'll be there
To kiss your lips to breathe your air
Right or wrong it can't go on
After this night we'll leave it all behind
But I'm still feeling
Drawn to you
In my dreams
So it seems
The man in me always
Gets his way
Never pays
For what he has done
I need you now, love, love, love
I crave you now, love, love, love",Surrender,1989
The Call,"You surround me, covered
You seduce my soul
All my fears uncovered as my life unfolds
In the warmth of your arms

You awake my senses
I was torn in doubt
Losing all defenses
When you called me out

I return to the heart of a love eternal
Waiting there for me

",Uncovered,1989
The Call,"You may find a better way
You may find the reason for it all
Say you walked on holy ground
Say you heard the sweetest sound of all
But you find that you never really cared
You find out that you have no love to share at all

So you challenge everyone you meet
Crying out to fill a void in you
What are you running from my love
What's this thing you're guilty of
Follow me and never feel accused

But you never do believe a word I say
And you never did believe there'd be day of reckoning

So you run and you run and you run
And you never stop
And you work and you work
Until you drop
You're in over your head and the pressure just don't quit
But you can't escape the reach of love

Faces haunt you in your dreams
Struggles of the broken heart I fear
Waking from a fitful sleep
Dutifully appointments keep
Try to hold this image of respect
So someone tells you when and where to go
But all the time you never really show your feelings

So you run and you run and you run

And you never stop
And you work and you work
And you work until you drop
You're in over your head and the pressure just don't quit
But you can't escape the reach of love

The reach of love
Ooh of love

You may find a better way
You might find the reason for it all
You may hold a better hand
All your pride and understanding
Never really feeling love at all
But what you thought were distant worlds apart
Pulls you in and wraps around your heart forever",You Run,1989
The Call,"You doubt if there's a heaven
You doubt if there's a hell
You doubt if you'll remember
All the stories they would tell
It's a terrible feeling

Living and dealing with doubt
You've doubted your existence
You doubt if there's a truth
Your plan starts to crumble
But you cannot stand to lose
You're back where you started from

Covering yourself in doubt
You doubted your mother
And you doubted your dad
You doubted your sisters
And any brothers you had
It's a bad situation

Living and loving with doubt
Well, you doubted the beginning
And I'm sure you doubt the end
You doubted your teachers
You doubt all your friends
It's an overwhelming sensation

Confrontation with doubt
I don't know why I started
I don't know if I'll finish
I wonder why I try at all
Sometimes I wonder why I try at all

Doubt can make a strong man
Weaken under stress
And doubt can make a weak man
Totally worthless
God, it's a pity
Doubt

You stage your finale
With meticulous care
Your view is consistent
And then out of nowhere
Your vision is clouded
You face competition with doubt",Doubt,1991
The Call,"I feel the heavy hand of truth upon me
I feel the deadly sin of pride
It separates the highest form the lowly
It separates love from you and I
I hear the taunting voice of sure temptation
I hear the rantings of a child
An inner voice telling me I'm nothing
The voice is mine, subject to the lie
Heavy hand on heart
Healing words to impart
Heavy hand on my throat
This is no dream
This is no dream
I see the haunting glow of pure surrender
A shapeless light reveals the hidden vow
I can see the countless sons of thunder,
With their knowing eyes circling around me
I feel divisions in this crowd
Heavy hand on my heart
Healing word to impart
Heavy hand on my throat
This is no dream
This is no joke",Heavy Hand,1991

And where will it end
Where the perfect guest meets his fate
In a scene beyond dreams
I stand where i stand
Convinced by the sight

Darkness and light
Where they meet
In a scene beyond dreams
And a mother cries
And she cries
So we watch, and we wait
And we watch, and the hero dies
So where do we fit
Earthbound and chained
Can this be it
Visions of prophets and kings
From a scene beyond dreams
Scattered and armed
Fuel to the fire
Compassion, alarm
Images fade into scenes beyond dreams
The awaited appears branded with lies
Calls to is own loved and despised
From a scene beyond dreams
And a mother cries, and she cries
And we watch, and we wait
And we watch, and the hero dies

Frozen to the bone, can't take much more
He says Lord I need help here, send me a strong hand
To lift me from the street, help me to stand

I've been forgotten, been forsaken
Poisoned by a bottle I could not shake it
I've been passed over, been rejected

And I'm afraid I'll never feel
The warmth of summer come again
Man I am helpless, I'm freezing
You were there, you were there

I saw a sick man on a sick bed
Scorned by the world like he had two heads
He says I'm a man here dying a cruel death
I'm cut off from the world, man it was so sad

He was suffering, he was ailing
Tortured by his fate, his body was failing
He says I'm an outcast, left defenseless

And I'm afraid that I'll be dead
Before the summer comes again
I've been rejected, man I am dying
You were there, you were there

Saw a rich man alone in a dark house
A prison made of gold he could not break out
He says my life is aimless, it just seems pointless
Boredom truly kills, man I am hopeless

I got diamonds, I got houses
I got silver clouds and silver spoons to match it
I've come up empty, man I am desperate

And I never want to feel
The warmth of summer come again
I'll be forgotten, my life is over
You were there, you were there
You were there, Lord, you were there",You Were There,1997
The Call,"Well they blew the horns
And the walls came down
They'd all been warned
And the walls came down
They stood there laughing
They're not laughing anymore
The walls came down

Sanctuary fades
Congregation splits
Nightly military raids
The congregation splits
It's a song of assassins
Ringin' in your ears
We got terrorist thinking
Playing on fears

Well they blew the horns
And the walls came down
They'd all been warned
But the walls came down
I don't think there are any Russians
And there ain't no Yanks
Just corporate criminals
Playin' with tanks

The Calling,"I've been thinking about you, my love 
And all the crazy things that you put me through 
Now I'm coming around, Throwing it back to you 
Were you thinking of me when you kissed him 
Could you taste me when you licked his skin 
All the while I showered you with trust and promises 
What I'm needing now is some sweet revenge 
To get back all that I lost then 
I gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you

Adrienne, I thought I knew you 
Once again, you used me, used me 
Adrienne, I should have left you 
Long before you used me, Used me up 

Spent my money, drove my car 
I treated you like a shining star 
But in my sky all burnt out you are 
And I'll have the last laugh, when I see you walking with some other guy 
'Cause I know you're gone end up all alone 
So take these words, some good advice 
All you've done gonna come back twice 
You never cared how much it hurt, I really need to tell you

The Calling,"(Fade away, fade away, fade away oh)

You left me with goodbye and open arms
A cut so deep I don't deserve
Well, you were always invincible in my eyes
The only thing against us now it time

[Chorus]
Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you
Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true
If I only had one more day

I lie down and blind myself with laughter
A quick fix of hope is what I'm needing
And how I wish that I could turn back the hours
But I know I just don't have the power

I'd jump at the chance,
We'd drink and we'd dance

As if it's your last, well I know it's your last
Cause today, oh, you're gone

Could it be any harder? (you fade away, fade away, fade away, oh)   Could it be any harder?

Could it be any harder to live my life without you
Could it be any harder I'm alone I'm alone

Like sand on my feet 
The smell of sweet perfume

The Calling,"A little paint, to cover what's deep inside
A little truth you know we all want to hide
When I'm trying, I'm trying now to get to you
But you're telling me like you always do, you say

Don't hate me, cause I'm just that good

I've got to hand it to you now
You're a hard one to please
When it looks as though, you've got all you need
All the many times I've dreamed
I could walk in your shoes
What a nightmare it must be
Just being you say

Don't hate me, 'cause I'm just that good
A little misunderstood
You made me, and I'm just that good

Step outside, walk with me
Everyone I know and see is falling
Is crawling after something maybe,
A bigger house, faster car, never knowing who they are
They're lonely, They're lonely, They're lonely

Don't hate me, 'cause I'm just that good
A little misunderstood
You made me, and I'm just that good

All this time will take its toll on you
As the same it will on me

In a life of our times

And though I've given you all I can

Though we falter, we don't have to fall

Then leave me, or take me as I am

But we keep together you and I

The Calling,"Well he can't sleep at night
And he can't do what's right

It's a deep obsession, taking up his time

I'll try not to make you cry
And if you'd get inside my head, then you'd understand

And you became my favorite drug

Never thought that I could love
Living in shadows, faded existence
It was never good enough

Who saves the day

I’m there for you, no matter what
I’m there for you, Never giving up
I’m there for you
For you

Someone has changed me, something saved me
Now this is who I am
Although I was blinded, my heart let me find that
Truth makes a better man

I didn’t notice
When you were right in front of me
A mask of silence
We’ll put away so we can see

I’m there for you, no matter what
I’m there for you, never giving up
I’m there for you
For you, for you

Within the darkness, you are the light
That shines away
In this blind justice, I can be the man
Who saves the day

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not
then,"" said the
Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy",God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,2010
The Canadian Tenors,"I've heard that there is a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music do ya
It goes like this the 4th the 5th minor fall the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moon light over threw ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your thrown she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
I know this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
Seen your flag on the marble arch and
Love is not a victory march
Its cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah

Did my best but it wasn't much
Couldn't feel so I try to touch
I told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
Even though it all went wrong
Stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

The Canadian Tenors,"'Twas in the moon of wintertime
When all the birds had fled
That mighty Gitchi Manitou
Sent angel choirs instead
Before their light the stars grew dim
And wandering hunters heard the hymn

Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born
In excelsis gloria

Within a lodge of broken bark
The tender Babe was found
A ragged robe of rabbit skin
Enwrapp'd His beauty round
And as the hunter braves drew nigh
The angel song rang loud and high

Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born
In excelsis gloria

The earliest moon of wintertime
Is not so round and fair
As was the ring of glory
On the helpless infant there
The chiefs from far before him knelt
With gifts of fur and beaver pelt

Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born
In excelsis gloria

O children of the forest free
O sons of Manitou
The Holy Child of earth and heaven
Is born today for you
Come kneel before the radiant Boy
Who brings you beauty, peace and joy

Who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping

The silent Word is pleading.

This, this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him praise

So bring him incense,
Gold and myrrh,
Come peasant king to love him;
The king of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone him.

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong

Getting so much resistance from behind

You better stop, hey, what's that sound?

What a field-day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, “Hooray, for our side”

Think you better stop, hey, what's that sound?

Into your life it will creep
It hurts when you're always afraid

The Canton Spirituals,"Why must I be the thief, 
Why must I be the thief, 
Oh Lord, please won't you tell me 
Why must I be the thief, 
Why must I be the thief, 

""Please"", said today a man 
And how come you're the only one 
Who's beggaring, who always stays? 
Why must I be the thief, 

But I stop the hanging man. 
How come you're the only one 
Living by the open hand? 
Now why must I be the thief, 

Why must I be the thief, 
You cursed the butterfly 
And the holy man who bowed his head 
Looked the Arctic height. 

The thief tried that cross 
To shed the other's face, 
But the Jesus man said, Not now, 
I'd rather not now, it's far too late, 
Far too late, far too late, 
Far too late, far too late, 
Far too late, far too late, 
Far too late. 

Do what you must, 
Take what you can, 
Steer the part of every heart, 
Every elder man, every elder man, 
Every elder man. 

I'm the thief, I am the thief 
And you're my heart, yes, and you're my heart, 
But I got you then, yes I will 
'Cause you're, 'cause I missed just your flight, 

Just your flight, 
Fly, fly, fly, fly, 
Fly, fly, fly, fly, 
I'll get you late 'cause it's just goodbye, 
I'll get you late, it's just goodbye, 
I'll get you late, it's just goodbye.",The Thief,2004
The Cantrells,"You told me all about her 
Underneath the shooting stars 
How you love her but you leave her 
And you can't go very far 
Away until you're back again 
Starting it all over 
And we watched the stars fall from the sky 
But we never ran for cover 

[Chorus]
And I said there goes one 
Lighting up the sky 
There goes one 
Gone so very fast, watch how they fly 
There goes one 
Lighting up the night 
There goes another shooting star 
Too late, it's passed you by 

The northern summer's cool night air 
Made us feel like dancin' 
Or maybe it was talk of love 
Or stories of romancin' 
But when you stopped and looked at me 
And you asked me what I thought 
I looked above and I searched the stars 
And the answer that I got was 

[Chorus: x2]

There goes another shooting star 
Too late, it's passed you by 
Too late 
Too late",Shooting Stars,1996
The Cantrells,"There's a flower that grows in the shape of a rose 
And its beauty is with me wherever I go 
But its sweetness was lost in the winter's first frost 
And the chill has stayed ever with me 

[Chorus]
Oh, a long time ago when the world was still bright 
There was fortune far as I could see 
And this blossom still shines in the heart of my mind 
But it holds only sorrow for me 

Oh, the bitter winds blow in a sad tremolo 
And they stir 'round the memory of our long ago 
But the winds have no power to blow away my sorrow 
And so it sits ever with me

And this blossom still shines in the heart of my mind 
But it holds only sorrow for me",Under the Rose,1996
The Capital Dance Orchestra,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light

Deserve expressions that really fit you

All the things that you do to me

The Capitol Jazzmen,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.

Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.

And it's clear now
You are not my kind
Oh! I've tried boy
Better ways to say
What I feel now
It seems you plan to stay
But I won't waste a day
So I say

Hey! get out of my way
Hey! hey! hey!
You've always been in my way

Hear now honey
I'll be good to you
If you stay gone
Far out of my view
I'm sick and tired
Of your dramatic ways
And when I think of
All those wasted days
I shake loose of your laces
And say

Hey! get out of my way
Hey! hey! hey!
You've always been in my way

This is all that I will say
This is all that I will do
I'm not in love with you!",Hey! Get Out of My Way,1995

And ran out of water, conversations ran dry

I dropped dead in the hallway
Cursing the dawn

I read about it in a book
The book flew out the window
Was later found by thieves and crooks

And now
they're singing hallelujah
I'm wondering just what did they find
They say ""what's it to ya?""
Just take a place in line

And wait

And I

I'm a drawer labelled ""lost and found""

Whose oxygen supply ran out

They'll give us something, fill our empty cups
Sit down in the boat, don't spill it
Or we'll just have to line back up

And wait
So we wait
We wait
Yes we wait

And we wait
We will wait

And you can feel the earth shake when they start to dance
You can tell by the way they move you

And as the world moves faster
Whip lashing us round and round
It's quite a slow disaster

It was bad but just a dream

All his pictures and his clothes in the bag

Get my medicine
Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren

Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday

Lying at my feet
A trampled rose

Passing the hat in church
It never stops going around

To get the job done

What I done to me,
I done to you
What happened to the trampled rose?

With the fireworks and leaves

Would he sing 'Kisses Sweeter Than Wine'

It was the same
Now I find it in the street,

Gather 'round me people
There's a story I would tell
'Bout a brave young Indian
You should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix Valley
In Arizona land
Down the ditches a thousand years
The waters grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Til the white man stole their water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now, Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

To walk back down again
And when the fight was over
And Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored

And when did the Indians dance

Jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water and a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine

Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day

And you're the one I need

As the audience watched deliriously

And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy on his rear, said, ""Oh dear""

Mama tried to tell me how my life was gonna be
But I was young and wild, and it was hard for me to see

Dear Mama, now that we're older
We can see the load on your tired old shoulders
Mama you're a trooper, mama you're a soldier
Mama, you mean a lot to me

Mama, you always taught me right from wrong when I was growin' up
And it's a pity that most people like me
Have to try everything for themselves
I realize now that you always knew just what you were talkin' about
And mama for all that hard work you did
And for the sacrifices you made for us
I just wanna say, thanks a lot

The Carter Family,"Johnny Henry's pappy woke him up one midnight
He said ""Before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you,"" Said ""Listen boy
Learn to hoist a jack and learn to lay a track learn to pick and shovel too
And take that hammer, It'll do anything you tell it to.""

John Henry's mammy had about a dozen babies
John Henry's pappy broke jail about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money
He said, ""I'll pay you a quarter at a time startin' tomorrow
That's the pay for a steel driver on this line.""

Then the section foreman said, ""Hey! Hammer-swinger!
I see you your own hammer boy but, what all can them muscles do?"" and he said,
""I can turn a jack I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.""
""Can you swing a hammer, boy?"" ""Yes sir, I'll do anything you hire me to.""

Spoken:
""Now ain't you somethin'! So high and mighty with all that muscle! Just go
Ahead, boy. Pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer!""

He said to get a rusted spike and swing it down three times
I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to
Go on and do what you say you can do

With a steel-nosed hammer on a four foot switch handle
John Henry raised it back til' it touched his heels then
The spike went through the cross-tie and split it half in two
Thirty-five cents a day for drivin' steel
""Sweat! Sweat, boy! Sweat! Only two more swings!""
""I was born drivin' steel""

Well John Henry hammered in the mountain
He'd give a grunt he give a groan every swing
The women-folks from miles around heard him and come down
To watch make the coal-steel ring ""Lord! What a swinger!
Watch him make the coal-steel ring""

But the bad boys came up laughin' at John Henry
They said,"" Your full of vinegar now but you bout' through!
We gonna get a steamdrill to do your share of drivin'
Then what's all them muscles gonna do? Huh? John Henry?
Gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you.""

John Henry said,""I feed for little brothers
And baby sisters' walkin' on her knees
Now did the Lord say that machines ought to take place of livin'?
And what's a substitute for bread and beans? I ain't seen it!
Do engines get rewarded for their steam?

John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner nap
Had thirty minutes to rest before the bell
The mine boys hollered,"" Get up whoever you are and get a pickax
Mine me enough to start another hell and keep it burnin'
Mine me enough to start another hell.

John Henry said to his captain said ""A man ain't nothin' but a man
But if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.
I'll die with that hammer in my hand but, I'll be laughin',
'Cause you can't replace a steel-drivin' man.

There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.
John Henry said to the steam-drill ""How is you?
(spoken) Pardon me, Mister Steamdrill I suppose you didn't hear me. Huh?
Well, can you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?
Listen, this hammer-swinger's talkin' to you.

(Faster...........)
Two-thousand people hollered, ""Go John Henry!!!!!""
Then somebody hollered,"" The mountain's cavin' in!!!!!!""
John Henry told the captin,""Tell the kind-folks not to worry
It ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind, it keeps me breathin'
This steel-driver's muscle it ain't thin.

""Captain tell the people to move back farther
I'm at the finish line and there ain't no drill
It's so far behind that it don't got the brains to quit it

When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills""

Well, John Henry had a little woman
I believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman
John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home
He laid down to rest his weary back and early next mornin' he said,
""Come here Paulie Ann, come here sugar.
You know I believe this is the first time there ever was the sun come
And I couldn't come up. Take my hammer, Paulie Ann and go to that railroad
Swing that hammer like you seen me do it
They'll all know your John Henry's woman but tell em' that ain't all you can
Do
Tell em'.........

I can hoist a jack and I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.
Ain't no machine can that's been proved to you!

There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house
The section hands laid him in the sand
Trains go by on the rails John Henry laid.
They slow down and take off the hats, the men do
When they come to the place where he's laying' retsina' his back.
They say,""Mornin' Steel-driver, you sure was a hammer-swinger.""
Then they go on by pickin' up a little bit of speed.

The Carter Family,"I studied at the feet of a master
Gamaliel we called him, the beauty of the law
I was born of the tribe of Benjamin, I was a pharisee
And I could quote from memory the holy Torah

That day that the Nazarene was brought to trial
It was on a sabbath eve, there was a earthquake when he died
Just another passing preacher who came up from Galilee
Blaspheming trouble-maker, we let him be crucified

Then I thought that I would hear no more about him
But his friends found his tomb empty
Claimed that he rose from the dead
Then they said he walked among them
With the nail wounds in his hands
That king upon a donkey with a thorn crown on his head

His followers kept growing in great number
And the one that they call Caiaphas mocked us in the judgment hall
And with the Greek name Stephen, we knew the gentiles had come in
I cast my vote against him, he was stoned I saw him fall

Then the friends of the Nazarene became united
And I became enraged then led a slaughter zealously
I found their secret places, they were beaten, they were chained
But some of them were scattered, justified in fearing me

Then the man in white, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the man in white
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the man in white

But like the wind that blows the scattered sea
From Alexandria to Antioch their congregation grew
I went to the high priest for letters of permission
To go to other cities, to see my mission through

Six days on the hot road to the masters
And just outside the city in the middle of the day
A great unearthly light struck and overpowered me
Prostrate on the hot road, I was blinded were I laid

Then I thought I heard the rushing of great water
And a multitude of angels singing sweet and heavenly
And through the sound of wind, came a voice so soft and kind
Meant for only me to hear, ""saul, why do you persecute me?""

As I lay there on the ground, in my blindness
He asked me once again, and suddenly the voice I knew
So finally I managed, a trembling response
Who are you lord? I asked him, but I already knew

I am Jesus of Nazareth the voice answered
Arise go to Damascus on the street called straight will be
A place where you will wait for my servant Ananias
He will open up your eyes, you'll be a witness unto me

So now I live to serve my master
As zealous in his service as I once was as his foe
And keeping his commandments given on Damascus road
I go to all the world, and I let the whole world know

Then the man in white, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the man in white

Trouble their minds day in and day out

The one and only

Glorified and transformed

And I’ll be one, I’ll be one in the first resurrection

The Carter Family,"I studied at the feet of a master
Gamaliel we called him, the beauty of the law
I was born of the Tribe of Benjamin, I was a Pharisee
And I could quote from memory the Holy Torah

That day that the Nazarene was brought to trial
It was on a Sabbath eve, there was a earthquake when He died
Just another passing preacher who came up from Galilee
Blaspheming trouble-maker, we let Him be crucified

Then I thought that I would hear no more about him
But his friends found his tomb empty
Claimed that he rose from the dead
Then they said he walked among them
With the nail wounds in his hands
That King upon a donkey with a thorn crown on his head

His followers kept growing in great number
And the one that they call Caiaphas mocked us in the judgment hall
And with the Greek name Stephen, we knew the gentiles had come in
I cast my vote against him, he was stoned I saw him fall

Then the friends of the Nazarene became united
And I became enraged then led a slaughter zealously
I found their secret places, they were beaten, they were chained
But some of them were scattered, justified in fearing me

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

But like the wind that blows the scattered sea
From Alexandria to Antioch their congregation grew
I went to the high priest for letters of permission
To go to other cities, to see my mission through

Six days on the hot road to the masters
And just outside the city in the middle of the day
A great unearthly light struck and overpowered me
Prostrate on the hot road, I was blinded were I laid

Then I thought I heard the rushing of great water
And a multitude of angels singing sweet and heavenly
And through the sound of wind, came a voice so soft and kind
Meant for only me to hear, ""Saul, why do you persecute me?""

As I lay there on the ground, in my blindness
He asked me once again, and suddenly the voice I knew
So finally I managed, a trembling response
Who are you Lord? I asked him, but I already knew

I am Jesus of Nazareth the voice answered
Arise go to Damascus on the street called Straight will be
A place where you will wait for my servant Ananias
He will open up your eyes, you'll be a witness unto me

So now I live to serve my master
As zealous in his service as I once was as his foe
And keeping his commandments given on Damascus road
I go to all the world, and I let the whole world know

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

The Carter Family,"Well, the bible tells us about a man
Who ruled Babylon and all its land. 
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand.

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand. 
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind. 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God, 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood. 
Belshazzar asked him what it said, 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read: 

""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand. 
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your houses are built upon the sand.""",Belshazzar,2008

Well my daddy left home when I was three
Didn't leave much to my mom and me
Except this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that my daddy ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

He must've thought that it was quite a joke
And I got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
Seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd turn red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keener
Roam from town to town to hide my shame

I'd search the honky tonks and bars
And kill that man that gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
Thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
Knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran col
And I said, ""my name is Sue, how do you do?
Now you gonna die""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
Then I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the walls and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

Well I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
And he reached for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
And I knew you'd have to get tough or die
It's that name that helped to make you strong""

He said, ""now you just fought one heck of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But y ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya gut and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the, that named you Sue""

What could I do?  
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
I called him my pa, and he called me his son

When duty calls, just sweetheart's name in vain
I hope your heart will not be crying if I not among the dying
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

When the roses bloom again beside the river
And the Robin Redbreast sings it's sweet refrain
As in days of Old Lang Syne, I'll be with you sweetheart mine
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

There's a bright and a sunny side too.
But if you meet with the darkness and strife,

Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear.
Clouds and storms will in time pass away.

The Carters,"Can you tell us about love?
Hmm, well there's love of children
Love of self
Love of God
Love of a partner
And all of them have a different shape
But all of them is the same in the end
It's about sensitivity, it's about passion
It's about unconditional giving of self to another person
And there's love of humanity
That's the love that is right now needed most
Love of humanity
But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul
It's like when you take some eggs and break them
And you, and you take the shells and mix them up
Trying to find the ones that match
When you find the perfect match
That compatibility results in passion
Results in unconditional giving of self
I hope I can say it again

If you will be my love
 
Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning

No winter wind 
No cold chill 
No questioning 
Not tonight, we don't get the will 

We're going to let it go 
Like we did so many nights in a row 
But if we could go back 
Would we find the strength we lack 
Or would we be right where we are today 

A million miles away 
Still trying to find our way but stumbling around 
Playing that awkward game 
Saying things are fine 
But knowing deep down 
It's gonna take time 

No country roads 
No open space 
No blistering sun 
That used to cover this place 

But if we could go back 
Would we find the strength that we lack 
Or would we be right where we are today

I'm remembering, I'm day dreaming when I'm supposed to be working 
I'm remembering people I miss, the lips I've kissed, and the grocery list 
I'm remembering staying up all night, the northern lights and your dress on tight 
I'm remembering your skin and the sunlight coming in 
And guitar strings and foolish things 
I'm remembering a voice singing, I can almost see the words ringing 
I'm remembering the wind and the way it moves green fields like waves on a holiday 
I'm remembering dreaming of a place I'd be but I'm here 

I'm remembering your skin and the sunlight coming in 
And guitar strings and foolish things 
And whatever else the day brings 

I'm remembering something that you said years ago 
It was something small, really nothing at all 
But now I'm wondering what it means 
The winter sun, the autumn trees, birds on a branch 
And the price of things and telephone rings 
And the bell goes and the day is done 
And I have a beer in the fading sun 
And then I come home to your skin and the sunlight coming in 
And guitar strings and foolish things 
And whatever else the night brings 
I'll be remembering

Well it seems as though this light will never turn green 
I've been driving for a while, can't tell where I've been 
I got nothing on my mind, I got nothing to do 
I'm just driving around listening to Nebraska 

Well, my girl, she told me last night I'm not the one 
Half my heart was ripped out but I still got some 
And if this light should stay red 
I'll be sitting here listening to Nebraska 

I was trying so hard to get to you 
Now I'm driving so far to forget you 
Well, tonight I should be lying with you in a never-ending night

Janey rides through the cheating part of town 
She got up once then she got let down 
Where lies spit up and then they lie back down 
She sits up and you come to her with moistened lips 
Your face is dry but your fingers drip 

You got a lot of nerve coming around here 

Janey's momma does pirouettes inside 
For a host of brokers who can't believe their eyes 
She nails dirt under their fingers with her eyes 
They they charge out through the door 
And through the night 
Baptising what they think is right 
And washing down the dirt with all their might 

There don't seem to be any room 
There don't seem to be a way 
That the flowers on the ground 
Won't get pushed out of the way

I envisioned it to be dark, wet, and cold. if he jumped, or if he fell, no one knows. but I've got a different picture for each one of those.

And the beat that she throw at me

And a triple espresso so you can stay awake
It might be late, but
It’s never too late for that lovin'

I used to cry but now I have to laugh
Because she’s got that torment

And crafty as a cat

Bite the beast
If I want a big piece of the pie
But she’s taken the feast
In the blink of an eye
I cannot justify

What’s going on
It feels so right
When it seems so wrong
Like a plot hatched 
In the sweet spot of that trap
Ask what she’s schemes
She say ‘oh this and that’
Then she snaps like a camera 
In black with a flash
Puts the drum in the drama
The hand in the clap
She’s a map with no bearings 
Attached, no 
Safety in this match
Fire you can’t catch
Then zap I was struck by that 
Bolt before dawn

Save prayers before dawn
'Cause what happens when I’m with you
Makes me shake my head then smile and yawn

And it seems that we are dreamy
As we head out through that strange old morning door

This game is no game
But it’s played all the same
And I love it even
If it makes me deranged
It’s like tears in the rain
Burning spears in my brain
Cause me pain sometimes 
Make me drained 
But I cannot complain 
Mad the ugly good and bad
Had some happy with my sad
And some tricks in my bag
When it’s up run a muck
Like a bull that just bucked
When it’s down it’s a drag

And you fight with no partner to tag 
At times I would dive in the sea
To escape from the rising 
And crashing malea
Drink tea with a fat fish
And find a golden key 
Then rise to the surface
And open my baby 
And maybe she’d say ‘we are crazy’
The two of us together like Melbourne weather
Be like balls in a maze see 
We rolling along in obscurity
But when we meet in the middle
Say mmm it’s a treat 

I’ll give you all night movie marathon

But now I have to cry
Because today my baby tell me
That it’s time to say goodbye
Ask her ‘why what did I do?
You and me we were so sly’
Then she sigh ‘that’s true
We were slinky through and through
But it’s sad and it’s set
I get high then I get depressed
And I guess when we’re together
It’s that happy kind of stress’
Touching left right down 
Kiss my finger I reply
I can’t deny you were the best
And by the best I mean the mess you made

I must confess I never
Met a more sexy maid
That smell like me
So bless your wayward ways
And loving craze and crazy days
And things you’d say
And looks you made
You’re not the queen of hearts
You’re the queen of spades
And you’d take my breath away
Any day that way
So anyway is this the end?
Is this the fifth act of the play?
I kissed her then I turned 
And was about to walk away 
When I sense a little tingle
That begin down from below
Then I hear her with a whisper
You’re the most gullible man I know",Lullaby,2003
The Cat Empire,"Walking down the street 
With some evil in my eye 
And some thoughts in my head 
That were making me feel high 
On my head was a hoodi 
In my ears was some bass 
Was walking by my dog 
When I saw that sexy face 
Come towards me 
With a little cheeky smile 
If she was a phone 
I'd pick her up and dial 
The fire brigade 
Or zero zero zero 
She stopped me in my tracks 
And I said 'mmm hchello hchello' 

I was sleeping in the sand 
With some dreams in my head 
That were causing an extension 
To the towel and my bed 
And the waves were rolling 
Like the curves on those legs 
Of a sweet beach bella 
With that centrefold spread 
In the midst of the slumber 
I heard some footsteps creeping 
And I woke to discover 
The woman I'd been dreaming 
She knelt down beside 
Said 'can I share your pillow?' 
I rolled over and I said 
'well hchello hchello' 
Some like money making 
Some like cars 
And some like the houses 
With the rooftop spas 
And some like to gossip 
About some rich sugar daddies 
But me and my friends 
We like the golden brown honeys 
And some like watching people 
Living on TV 
That's a little strange 
If you're asking me 
'Cause I like to eat and laugh 
And **** and play down low 
These are the things I know 
Well hchello hchello.

Welcome to this song 
Welcome to these rhymes

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man
'We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!",Hotel California,2009
The Cat Empire,"From the city to the world below 
From the strangers to the ones I know

The Cat Empire,"Sing now muse I won’t be scared
She’s wearing flowers not snakes up in her hair tonight
And love we’ve been around before
We washed up on the old shore but it’s new tonight

‘It’s only light’ she said
‘But we are liars to be free’
Ooh ooh ooh we’ll steal the light to see

The hour falls we fall to dance
Now sirens and the marching bands sing
‘It’s nothing but chance tonight’
The billion ones and many few
And everyone I never new they’re here tonight

But we are liars to be free

What if I’m lonely?
What if the skies should fall and disappear?
For one night only
Open your eyes and run into the clear
So if I may, what if I say
‘It’s good to have you here!’

She said ‘If you lead I’ll come along
And if you need me there I’ll sing your song tonight
And all that glows and all that shines
And all we leave behind will keep them warm tonight’

‘It’s only light’ I said
