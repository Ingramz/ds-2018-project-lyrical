Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotion
Caught in a land-slide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs
But they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
(Kisses of fire)

When you sleep by my side I feel safe
And I know I belong
Still it's making me scared
That my love is so strong
Losing you, it's a nightmare fate
And to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Would you promise to be true
And help me
Understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just
Holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start

Y Sentado aquí en la estación
La añoranza tuya para esta canción
Por tanto tiempo

Vete al infierno
Tantos reproches
Tanto arrebato

Y esta noche
Tan solo esta noche
Y esta noche

Yo quisiera

Sobre tu rostro pide perdón 
Pobre tu rostro pide, ¡No mas!

Panteón Rococó,"Ha comenzado a llover,
Y con la lluvia no te puedo ver no no no
Mojado en la calle burlo mi sombra
Sintiendo la soledad un poco honda
Y he empezado a entender
Que este orgullo no te deja ser
La que me ame
La que me quiera, la que por mi
Toda su vida entera me diera

Y escuchar y escuchar
El reloj pasando las horas
Destrozando el tiempo así
Cada noche que pasa me devora
Y cada minuto así estando lejos de ti
Burlando yo mi sombra, buscándote
Rasgando en un camino sin destino fijo
Burlando yo mismo mi sombra, buscándote

Ay amor cómo quisiera envolverte en seda
Y darte mil noches como esta
Cómo quisiera decirte al oído
Que me siento feliz soñando contigo
Cómo quisiera olvidar mis angustias
Y darte estas caricias mustias
Cómo quisiera decirte
Que he pasado los años de mi vida buscándote
Buscándote, Buscándote, he pasado las noches y los días
Pensando en la alegría que provocas
Cuando te veo pasar, cuando te miro pasar

Y tu sin nunca voltear atrás
Sin darte el lujo de observar
Sin saber que tanto te he buscado
No te has dejado de encontrar

Y pasado tanto tiempo, y mi cuerpo no se cansa
Y mirándote de lejos, cuánto tiempo es el que falta

Y volar y volar mientras van pasando las horas
Corriendo en toda dirección causando una revolución
Refugiado en el silencio de esta absurda situación
Y sintiendo los latidos se me sale el corazón

Ay amor, cómo quisiera envolverte en seda
Y darte mil noches como esta
Cómo quisiera decirte al oído
Que me siento feliz soñando contigo
Cómo quisiera olvidar mis angustias
Y darnos estas caricias mustias
Cómo quisiera decirte
Que he pasado los años de mi vida buscándote
Buscándote, Buscándote, he pasado las noches y los días y no,
Y no me creerías si te digo
Que siempre que te veo se me para el corazón
Que al verte yo me siento como que me da un pasión
Que tal vez mi mente haya perdido la razón

Y su descanso lo ocupa pá soñar.

And gave it all away
Like the birth of a new found joy

All alone as the memories now unfold

I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

I wonder aloud,
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free,
Belong to me at last

Through all those complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried and spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete,
All alone as the memories still remain

The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain

Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end forcing you to bend

It's never love. Bloody touch. Broken wrist. Needle rust.
Choking throat. Swallowed teeth. Head fuck. No peace.
I'm shedding my skin to peel you off of me.
You've got to love me.

Do you love me too?
It's so complicated
Tell me why
I know that I can't make it
As time goes by
And why won't you give me
Just another try?
Speak to me darling

Now that I need you

You're not comin' around
You're not comin' around
This love that I'm feeling
It's what I feel for you
Or am I just dreaming
Oh, it can't be true
I want to know now
Is it hard for you?
Would you be happier
If you let me go?
And I will find my anchor
Think you oughta know
I just can't stop loving you
You won't come back for more

Paola Turci,"Aveva uno sguardo intenso e diretto
Le dita curate e un sarcasmo congenito
Labbra sottili, armonioso contorno 
Di denti bianchi e perfetti

Poche parole, eleganza nei modi
Una lieve cadenza d'oltralpe e dominio di sé

Gli incontri divennero assidui e frequenti
Nei luoghi e agli orari più insoliti
Quell'uomo intrigante teneva le redini 
Con singolare destrezza

Pochi preamboli quando mi chiese
Vorresti sposarmi? Era onesto e sicuro di sé 

Ricordo il giorno del mio matrimonio
L'abito bianco di seta ed organza
Fiori d'arancio intorno all'altare
Aspettavo il mio sposo con devozione

La chiesa gremita di gente annoiata 
Per l'interminabile attesa
Alle mie spalle sbadigli e commenti 
E di lui neanche l'ombra lontana

Pochi preamboli quando mi chiese
Vorresti sposarmi? Era onesto e sicuro di sé

Ricordo il giorno del mio matrimonio
L'abito bianco di seta ed organza
Nessuno sposo impaziente all'altare 
Soltanto un prete in vistoso imbarazzo

E scusa se ti faccio male, se me ne vado via così 
E mi riprendo I sogni le speranze le illusioni tutto quel che sai di me 
E mi riprendo questo amore in tutte le versioni e ricomincio a vivere 
E volo così, a braccia aperte tra le nuvole 
Volo così, nell'aria tersa senza limiti 
Volo nell'anima di queste notti tenere 
Volo così perchè è così che devo vivere 
Volo nel cuore di chi ha voglia di sbagliare 
Volo nel sole perchè ho voglia di bruciare 
Volo così, volo così 
Adesso no, ti prego non parlare, non mi cadere in questo blu 
Non ho bisogno di certezze ma di sognare un pò di più 
E all'improvviso il vento smuove nuove sensazioni che non so più distinguere 
E all'improvviso non resisto più alle tentazioni e ricomincio a vivere 
E volo così a braccia aperte tra le nuvole 
Volo così nell'aria aperta senza limiti 
Volo più in alto e mi respiro l'impossibile 
Volo planando e così mi sento vivere 
Volo fra questi scogli superando il mare

Paola Turci,"Prendimi così, con la faccia che ho stasera
Anche se fuori è freddo, mi vestirò leggera
Senza più segreti nella voce dei poeti
E vorrei riconoscerti
Fuori cerchiamo la felicità

Ad un passo solo

Tenerti la mano è la mia rivoluzione

Come una notte di stelle accese la stanza si illumina

Paola Turci,"La vita che ho deciso
L’ho scritta come un libro
Di frasi da citare
Come frecce da puntare
La vita che ho deciso
Io la volevo forte
Come le mani di mio padre
Per farmi attraversare
La vita che ho deciso
Il mio più bel vestito
Aspettando un’occasione come fosse una stagione
Come una buona idea
A cui non rinunciare
Con gli occhi rossi di chi corre perché
Non può più aspettare

E sfrecciano i ricordi tra grovigli di emozioni
Ci sarà un momento per restare soli
E fisserò la porta da cui te ne vuoi andare
Perché niente, niente può più farmi male

Sei tu il mio secondo cuore
Sei l’estate che mi fa spogliare
Sei tu il mio secondo cuore
Una luce che riesce a entrare
C’è sempre bisogno di te
C’è ancora bisogno di te
Ho sempre bisogno di te
Più me

C’è sempre bisogno di te
Adoro il bisogno di te
Da sempre ho bisogno di te
Più me

La vita che ho deciso
Un istinto naturale
Su tutti i dizionari esiste la parola amore
Eppure non c’è scritto
Che siamo eccezionali
A guardarci in fondo agli occhi senza cedere ai proclami

Il rumore dei ricordi come foglie sulla strada
Questa notte che vorrei trovarti a casa
E fisserò la porta
Da cui potrai tornare
E poi niente, niente può più farci male

Sei tu il mio secondo cuore
Una musica davanti al mare
Sei tu il mio secondo cuore
L’unico posto dove voglio andare
C’è sempre bisogno di te
Ho ancora bisogno di te
Ho sempre bisogno di te
Più me
C’è sempre bisogno di te
C’è ancora bisogno di te
Da sempre ho bisogno di te

La prima volta al mondo 
La prima volta al mondo 

Sei il posto più lontano 
Chiuso nella mia mano 
Bestemmia senza Dio 
Ti ho nominato invano 
Alle mie spalle un cielo 
Gigante senza peso 
Mi frantumavi il cuore 
Ma a me sembrava intero 
Con te è la prima volta al mondo

Paola Turci,"È così che ti ritrovi a camminare
Le tue ali barattate per due suole
Sui palazzi la pubblicità del mare
Che male
E così non ti ricordi dove andavi
Hai prestato le tue guance a qualcun altro
Ed hai certo più padroni tu che un cane
Cravatta o collare?

Come stai, come stai, come fanno i bambini a saltare sul letto
Tu che un letto soltanto lo disfi e lo fai
E lo sai, e lo sai non si diverte mai
L’elefante del circo
Così resti da parte felice e ricordi chi sei

Off-line, off-line, off-line
Off-line, off-line, off-line

È così che ti è sembrato di capire
Rispondevi meglio in terza elementare
Hai dimenticato il gioco del muretto
Dottore?
Come il tiro della prima sigaretta
L’incertezza nel toccare altri capelli
Pollicino ti ha lasciato molti sassi
Ma tu li hai persi

Come va, come va, trovi ancora dei muscoli sotto la giacca
O ti senti la tua carta d’identità?
Mentre guardi i papaveri lungo l’A6
E li trovi stupendi
Poi ti accorgi che chi sta piangendo non è il tuo papà, no

Off-line, off-line, off-line
Off-line, off-line, off-line

In questa notte accesa
Ho il cuore capovolto
Lo sento mentre grida e mi sembra tutto giusto
Aspetto l’uragano
Senza aspettarmi niente
Sentirmi il mio regalo, il mio capolavoro
È così che in qualche modo ci si trova
Come fosse il giorno dopo carnevale
E ho capito che quel segno della croce è il punto in cui chiedevo di virare
Non importa più nemmeno dove andavo
Ero in coda per ricevere un sorriso
Ma benedico gli occhi che non mi aspettavo e ringrazio il dolore di averti vicino

E l'incoscienza svanisce
E come un viaggio nella notte finisce

Dimmi, dimmi, dimmi che senso ha
Dare amore a un uomo senza pietà
Uno che non si è mai sentito finito
Che non ha mai perduto, mai

Per me, per me una canzone
Mai una povera illusione
Un pensiero banale, qualcosa che rimane
Invece per te, per te più che normale
Che un'emozione da poco
Mi faccia stare male, una parola detta piano basta già

Ed io non vedo più la realtà
Non vedo più a che punto sta
La netta differenza tra il più cieco amore
E la più stupida pazienza
No, io non vedo più la realtà
Né quanta tenerezza ti dà 
La mia incoerenza
Pensare che vivresti benissimo anche senza

C'è una ragione che cresce in me
È una paura che nasce

Finchè non si sente

E mi avrai verde milonga che sei stata scritta per me

Per la mia sensibilità per le mie scarpe lucidate
Per il mio tempo per il mio gusto
Per tutta la mia stanchezza e la mia mia guittezza

Mi avrai verde milonga inquieta che mi strappi un sorriso
Di tregua ad ogni accordo mentre mentre fai dannare le mie dita
Io sono qui sono venuto a suonare sono venuto ad amare

E di nascosto a danzare
E ammesso che la milonga fosse una canzone
Ebbene io, io l'ho svegliata e l'ho guidata a un ritmo più lento

Così la milonga rivelava di se molto più,
Molto più di quanto apparisse la sua origine d'Africa
La sua eleganza di zebra, il suo essere di frontiera

Una verde frontiera 
Una verde frontiera tra il suonare e l'amare
Verde spettacolo in corsa da inseguire

Da inseguire sempre, da inseguire ancora
Fino ai laghi bianchi del silenzio fin che Athaualpa
O qualche altro Dio non ti dica descansate niño

Meglio star qui seduto 
Guardare il cielo davanti a me 

Messico e nuvole 
La faccia triste dell'America 
E il vento suona la sua armonica 
Che voglia di piangere ho 

Intorno a lei, intorno a lei 
Una chitarra risuonerà 
Per tanto tempo ancor 
È il mio amore per lei 
Che I suoi passi accompagnerà 
Nel bene e nel dolor 
Questi son sentimenti di contrabbando 
Meglio star qui seduto 
Guardare il cielo davanti a me 
Messico e nuvole 

Chi lo sa come fa 
Quella gente che va fin là 
A pronunciare un sì, ma 
Mentre sa che è già 
Provvisorio l'amore che 
C'è, si, ma forse no 
Queste son situazioni di contrabbando 
Meglio star qui seduto 
Guardare il cielo davanti a me

E ogni volta ci regala un bel biscotto

E siam rimasti in gara, dancing

Un p per vera vocazione

Non farti prender dalla sonnolenza
Cinteressa, no, questa conferenza
Che tanto il tempo passa
Anche sotto ai sof

S che il tempo passa sotto ai sof
Nemico numero uno
Degli aspirapolvere di tutta citt
L che lui tiene la sua accademia
Sotto lo sguardo vitreo

Dei bicchieri di Boemia
E intanto il Comune
Cambia colore ai tramways
Che la gente poi ci prende confidenza

S, ma di noi si pu fare senza

Tutto un grande addio
Un giorno Gondrand passer
Te lo dico io
Col camion giallo porter

Via tutto quanto e poi pi niente rester
Del nostro mondo

Che non sia proprio lei
La quinta essenza

E laggi montagne languide, vedrai
E sempre te ne invaghirai
Grande amore e ancora tu le vorrai

Voluta e constuita ogni citt
E quadrata ogni nuvola sar

E anche il rumore che fa il cellophane
Ma una birra fa gola di più
In questo giorno appiccicoso di caucciù

Sono seduto in cima a un paracarro
E sto pensando agli affari miei
Tra una moto e l'altra c'è un gran silenzio
Che descriverti non saprei

Oh, quanta strada nei miei sandali
Quanta ne avrà fatta Bartali
Quel naso triste come una salita
Quegli ochhi allegri da italiano in gita

E i francesi ci rispettano
Che le balle ancora gli girano
E tu mi fai, dobbiamo andare al cine
E vai el cine, vacci tu

È tutto un complesso di cose
Che fa sì che io mi fermi qui
Le donne a volte sì sono scontrose
O forse han voglia di far la pipì

E tramonta questo giorno in arancione
E si gonfia di ricordi che non sai
Mi piace restar qui sullo stradone
Impolverato, se tu vuoi andare, vai

E vai che io sto qui e aspetto Bartali
Scalpitando sui miei sandali
Da quella curva spunterà
Quel naso triste da italiano allegro

Tra i francesi che si incazzano
E i giornali che svolazzano
C'è un pò di vento, abbaia la campagna
E c'è una luna in fondo al blu

Tra i francesi che s'incazzano
E i giornali che svolazzano
E tu mi fai, dobbiamo andare al cine
E vai al cine, vacci tu

Paolo Conte,"Sul ritmo scuro di una danza
Piena di sogni e di sapienza
La donna accoglie i suoi ricordi
Anche i pi stupidi e balordi

C in lei una specie di cielo
Unacqua di naufragio, un volo
Dove giustifica e perdona
Tutta la vita mascalzona, blu tango

Parigi accoglie i suoi artisti
Pittori, mimi, musicisti
Offrendo a tutti quel che beve
E quel fiume suo pieno di neve

E la illusione di capire
Con larte il vivere e il morire
Su antichi applausi a fior di pelle
Di molte donne ancora molto belle, blue tango

Tra le ombre verdi di un bovindo
Gustando unacqua al tamarindo
Luomo che ha niente da inventare
Prova a sognare, prova a sognare

E prova gli attimi e le stelle
E le fontane e le piastrelle
E i bagni turchi e ogni altra stanza
Ma tutto ormai sventola e danza, blue tango

Paolo Conte,"Due note e il ritornello era gia' nella pelle di quei due
Il corpo di lei mandava vampate africane, lui sembrava un coccodrillo
I saxes spingevano a fondo come ciclisti gregari in fuga
E la canzone andava avanti sempre piu' affondata nell'aria

Quei due continuavano, da lei saliva afrore di coloniali
Che giungevano a lui come da una di quelle drogherie di una volta
Che tenevano la porta aperta davanti alla primavera

Qualcuno nei paraggi incominciava a starnutire
Il ventilatore ronzava immenso dal soffitto esausto
I saxes, ipnotizzati dai movimenti di lei si spandevano
Rumori di gomma e di vernice, da lui di cuoio

Le luci saettavano sul volto pechinese della cassiera
Che fumava al mentolo, altri starnutivano senza malizia
E la canzone andave elegante, l'orchestra era partita, decollava
I musicisti, un tutt'uno col soffitto e il pavimento

Solo il batterista nell'ombra guardava con sguardi cattivi
Quei due danzavano bravi, una nuova cassiera sostituiva la prima
Questa qui aveva occhi da lupa e masticava caramelle alescane
Quella musica continuava, era una canzone che diceva e non diceva

L'orchestra si dondolava come un palmizio davanti a un mare venerato
Quei due sapevano a memoria dove volevano arrivare
Un quinto personaggio esito' prima di sternutire
Poi si rifugio' nel nulla, era un mondo adulto
Si sbagliava da professionisti

E la sensualita delle vita disperate
Ecco il dono che io ti faro

Ah, non avere paure che sia gia finita

So tutto
Di questi posti ormai
E il freddo so
Di questa chiave in mano a me

E ti prepari ad abitare
Questa stanza come fosse
Una casa e io che aspetto
Mentre metti nei cassetti

La tua roba e anche la mia
E al di là della finestra
C’è una luna strepitosa

Che abbiamo casa e figli tutti e due
Ma abbiam sorriso senza alcun pudore
All’idea di un ultimo amore

Quali parole, luce di pioggia e luce di conquista
Hum lasciamo fare a questo albergo ormai cos vicino
Cos accogliente, dove va a morir damore la gente

E intanto, nell'ombra dei loro armadi
Tengono lini, e vecchie lavande

Paolo Conte,"Guàrdali, dai treni in corsa si sbilanciano
In cannottiera ti sorridono
Come di, come di

Come di, come di orchestra illusa a Napoli
E poi sgridata a Minneapoli
Comi di, comédie

La comédie d'un jour, la comédie de ta vie
La comédie, la comédie

Ma cos'è la luce piena di vertigine
Sguardo di donna che ti fulmina
Come di, come di

Come di antica amante vista a Napoli
Con lontanissimi binocoli
Comédie, comédie d'un jour

La comédie

Pàrlami, dunque il ricordo si semplifica
Nel suono dolce ed infelice, qui
Come di, come di, come di

Come di, come di orchestra che precipita
In un ventilatore al Grand-Hôtel

She swings in that old dream
The dame keeps burning in the flame
The beauty thinks a burning chance!

Change all

I'm usually round your waist like a chain but then

But not like I love my guitar
Not like I love my guitar, no

You couldn't do it all by yourself
You had to go and get somebody else
Your high enough to call me
But your can't reach the bar

But not like I love my guitar, no

Turn it up

Yeah, now dig

I tried to warn you that it's hard to be a star
Especially when your driving other people's car
I woulda gave you mine, girl, but you took it too far
I love you baby
But, just not like I love my guitar
Not like I love my guitar

I know you love me and you wanna be friends
And if you don't at least you need to pretend
We're still together even if we don't get that far
I love you baby
But not like I love this guitar

I love you, I love you baby
(Not like I love my guitar)

I love you baby and I wish you well (I wish you well)

Che risale le risaie
E fa il verso delle rane
E tutto ha
Arriva sulle aie bianche
Come le falciatrici di raccolto

Da questa campagna altri abissi di luci
E di terra e di anima niente
Pi che il cavallo e il chinino
E voci e bisbigli dalbergo

Regine di corriere e paracarri
La loro, la loro discrezione antica
Acqua e miele

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

S'inonderà di luce
Da un gesto randagio
Una carezza scende adagio

Passa e ripassa e fa moda.
Big Bill sulla sonorità
Sapeva tutto ormai rossa

D'inverno vedrà
Scuotere l'aria scarlatta

C'era il profumo al nord, tigli

Paolo Conte,"Perché adesso tu parli così?
Stai arrotando tutte le erre
Forse tu pensi che

Tutto sembri più nobile, nobile, snob
O forse, forse tuUna simpatia
Hai per qualcuno dai tre cognomi

Sangue blu? Forse un quarto
E modi molto affabili, modi da snob

Le cose che mangiamo
Son sostanziose come le cose
Che tra di noi diciamo

Noi provinciali siamo così

Paolo Corsi,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,
Paolo Di Sabatino,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1997
Paolo Di Sabatino Trio,"Buona notte amore 
Che se così lontano
E questo canto voli sopra il mare e sopra tutte le città 
Così leggero sulle strade 
Come una brezza e sappia dove andare 
È una carezza, lascia un po' socchiuso e arriverà 
Buona notte amore 
Che dormi così poco 
E lo so bene, non è per il caldo, è che non sono lì con te 
E avrai una luce nella stanza 
E come me nel cuore la speranza 
Di rivederti quando fa mattino e ""non partire più"". 
Buona notte, amore mio lontano 
Ti arriva questo canto 
O forsi dormi già? 
E più che sei distante e più che ti amo 
Tra le montagne e il mare 
Buona notte a te
Buona notte, amore 
Le vedi le mie stelle? 
Se vuoi provare guarda verso Genova 
Io sono un po' più in su 
E non mi riesce di contarle
Così vicine che potrei toccarle 
Ma la più bella, la più luminosa l'ho lasciata giù 
Buona notte, amore mio lontano

Paolo Di Sabatino Trio,"Tu dove sarai, in questo istante mentre canto cosa fai? 
Stai preparandoti un caffè con gli occhi chiusi
Sarà la primavera e non ti svegli mai
Invece io che sono un grillo 
Su questo piccolo giardino sopra il mare 

Mi son svegliato così presto e mi mancavi 
E più ti penso e più vien voglia di cantare 
E canterò che mi ami così forte
Stai attento che ti sdraio 
Posso amarti fino alla morte
Invece questa è vita ed è un piacere 

Ma vieni più vicina che possa vedere 
E com'è bello anche per un ometto 
Farsi corteggiare un po'
E tu cosa farai, metti una gonna che non te la metti mai 
E proprio adesso sento che mi stai pensando 
Davanti a quello specchio so che riderai 
Come sarà quel tuo bel viso 
Quel naso così affascinante 
Quel sorriso

Lo sai una volta l'ho confuso con la neve 
In un viaggio fatto tanto tempo fa 
Vengo da te, metterò una maglia fresca 
Quel profumo che ti piace, oggi non lavoro, è festa
Sarà un po' lungo, stai così lontano
Mi godo il viaggio, sai che guido piano 
Adesso guarda dalla tua finestra, non ci credi? Sono qua",E' festa,2017
Paolo Di Sabatino Trio,"Tu che sei nata dove c'è sempre il sole 
Sopra uno scoglio che ci si può tuffare 
E quel sole ce l'hai dentro il cuore 
Sole di primavera 
Su quello scoglio in maggio è nato un fiore

E ti ricordi c'era il paese in festa 
Tutti ubriachi di canzoni e di allegria 
E pensavo che su quella sabbia 
Forse sei nata tu 
O a casa di mio fratello non ricordo più 

E ci hai visto su dal cielo 
Ci hai trovato e piano sei venuta giù 
Un passaggio da un gabbiano 
Ti ha posata su uno scoglio ed eri tu

Ma che bel sogno era maggio e c'era caldo 
Noi sulla spiaggia vuota ad aspettare 
E tu che mi dicevi guarda su quel gabbiano 
Stammi vicino e tienimi la mano 

E ci hai visto su dal cielo 
Ci hai trovato e piano sei venuta giù 
Un passaggio da un gabbiano 
Ti ha posata su uno scoglio ed eri tu

Paolo Di Sabatino Trio,"Era il tempo in cui cominciavo a sentire musica 
Ascoltavo un signore che aveva una voce così 
Non capivo che lingua parlasse ma mi era simpatica 
E riempiva la stanza di note e di poesia 
Tu eri lì con me che cercavi d'insegnarmela 
Mi dicevi hai le mani ancora piccole 
Ma che accordi complicati il Sud America 
Certo che a vedere te sembrava facile 
Era il tempo in cui cominciavo a sentire musica 
Insieme a te

Ti ricordi quella velina sopra il pettine 
Ci cantavo e venivano suoni un po' kasoo 
Tu suonavi Bill Evans dicendo ""quest'uomo è un fenomeno 
certamente, ma qui ce n'è un altro e sei proprio tu"" 
E stavi lì, con me a giocare con la musica 
E pensavo, la mia vita forse è questa qui 
Ma tu giurami che un giorno suonerò così
""Suoni così bene che mi vien da ridere"" 
Era il tempo in cui cominciavo ad amar la musica 
E amavo te

Adesso sono grande, è un bel lavoro fare musica 
Sempre in giro, come adesso che sto a Napoli 
Se vedessi quanto affetto non lo immagini 
È una festa e poi sentissi come cantano 
""Che sorpresa vederti arrivare 
ma un po' ti aspettavo siediti qui
Ma da quando tu sei partito non c'è più musica 
Sta tranquillo, lo so che col tempo mi passerà
Scrivo molto ma quello che scrivo e' cosi malinconico 
Come questa canzone, chissò se ti piacerà 
Dimmi dove sei 
Suoni ancora ma per gli angeli 
E ti siederanno intorno, li farai cantare 
Suona forte cosi ti potrò sentire 
Noi quaggiù col naso in su a capire cosa sia 
Sarà il tempo in cui finalmente farai il tuo concerto, anima mia""",Gigi,2017
Paolo Di Sabatino Trio,"Oggi vado a ritirare la mia macchina 
Ma ci credi che non ho dormito mai
Sento già quel profumino della plastica 
Ti ho aspettata tanto, tu come sarai? 
E mi batte forte il cuore mentre luccica 
E mi batte un po' di più perché è automatica 
E quest'uomo che mi dice come fare 
E non ti posso salutare
Posso fare quel che voglio nella macchina
Sopra tutto posso stare un po' con me 
E ascoltare questa musica romantica
È la stessa che piaceva tanto a te 
E mi guardo intorno è piena d'elettronica 
Ma che meraviglia quest'aerodinamica
Me la godo come un matto la mia macchina 
Me la godo senza te, ma dove posso andare? 
Ci proverò a scappare, per non vederti più
Via, via, attraversiamo il mondo
Ci metterò un secondo 
Non ti ricordo più
Ci sono due ragazzi ad un semaforo 
E si danno tanti baci che confondono 
È una specie di casetta quella macchina 
C'è molta intimità
Oggi è sabato, siamo tutti in giro in macchina 
Ma nessuno sa di certo dove andrà 
Forse è proprio questo il bello che mi affascina 
E che mi da' un po' il senso della libertà 
Posso ridere e pensare, posso piangere 
Mi dicevi ""ma che grande solitudine""
Non m'importano le tue teorie analitiche
Viaggio bene senza te ma non so dove andare
Non mi è servito a niente, stai sempre dentro me 
Via, via, sto attraversando il mondo
Sento che vado a fondo 
Mi sento come te
A me piace tanto andare in giro in macchina
Sto imparando ad andare in giro senza te",La Mia macchina,2017
Paolo Di Sabatino Trio,"Devi partire così presto 
Macomer certo è così lontana 
Scrivimi se potrai tornare 
Qualche giorno per Natale 
Tu non scordarti di mangiare 
Sei così magra che fai paura 
Non preoccuparti se sto sola 
Sono grande come te 
Come sempre non sapevo cosa dire 
Dimmi che mi ami prima di partire 
Poi in silenzio ti commuovi ed io cretino 
Che mi vergogno un po' 
Sono confuso ma è normale 
Non riesco a dirti quello che provo 
Forse è soltanto ch'è così lontano 
E già mi sento solo 
La mia nave parte e m'allontano piano 
E si riavvicinano le mie paure 
Speriamo almeno che sia calmo il mare 
Così potrò dormire",La Nave,2017
Paolo Di Sabatino Trio,"Quando arriverà 
Io le aprirò il mio cuore per entrare 
E lo fa sempre senza far rumore 
Arriva un po' così quando le pare
Quando arriverà non è mai uguale
E non capisco mai se è bella, se è speciale 
Ma poi mi siedo lì vicino mentre parla e viene voglia di cantare
Quando arriverà
Mio bel mistero io t'aspetterò 
Non sembra vero ma ti bloccherò 
Prima che voli via, come magia 
Quando arriverà mi piace sempre 
E se non ti conosce il mondo non fa niente 
Ma mi confondo quando sento che quacuno in strada ti fischietterà
Quando arriverà
Quando arriverà
Succede sempre, mi emozionerà
Perchè non so che cosa mi dirai 
Da dove vieni non lo dice mai
Forse arriva dal mio cuore 
Che a volte è allegro e a volte no 
E quando sento dentro che nasce o che muore qualcosa 
Io t'aspetterò 
Quando arriverà sarà col sole 
O in una notte sotto l'acqua busserà
Ti faccio entrare, forse nasce una canzone e c'è chi la fischietterà
Quando arriverà
Quando arriverà 
È come adesso e mi emoziono già
Perchè per me è lo stesso 
È come allora e come arrivi mi sorprende ancora
Certo arriva dal mio cuore 
Che a volte è grande e a volte no 
Ma quando sento dentro che nasce o che muore qualcosa 
Io ti canterò",Quando arriverà,2017

Ambos todo lo damos sin egoísmo, 
Las chicas a veces no duran, no, 
Las complicaciones dan emoción, 
Cierto que no has jugado muy limpio, 
Mas ella fue quien te eligió, 
Tu problema es ahora el que tuve yo 
Es porque soy tu amigo, 
Para escucharte aquí estoy yo, 
Mas por qué has bebido 
Las chicas pasan, tu y yo no 
Vamos a hablarlo 
Porque así nos ayudamos, 
Porque ser un buen amigo, 
Es lo máximo que hay 
Esta noche esta medio acabada, 
Tengo una idea, no hay mas que hablar, 
No merece la pena por culpa suya 
Es porque soy tu amigo 
Para escucharte aquí estoy yo, 
Sabes que soy sincero, 
Las chicas pasan, tu y yo no 
Por eso vamos, de distinta a enamorarnos, 
Basta que no coincidamos, 
El truco en eso esta 
No compitamos mas los dos, 
Y sin problemas 
Ser primero es un dilema, 
Es porque ser buen amigo 
Es lo máximo que hay 
Lo máximo que hay",Buenos Amigos,1998

por que esta noche no llamarte es duro 
debiera destrozar nuestras fotografias 
Mas te amare, te amare 
hoy ayer why siempre te amare 

Tu no recuerdas ya las locuras 
los besos a escondida en tu abitacion 
why la otra tarde he estropeado todo 
yo que queria sentirme grande 
mas como fui tan tonto Â¿Cuando? 
mas como he dicho todo ha terminado 
tu no lo sabes menos yo 
mas como he dicho todo ha terminado 
queria sentirme grande ma scomo fui tan tonto Â¿Cuando? 

Te amare te amare de corazon a muerte 
siempre te amare 
No podemos ya seguir tan lejos 
llama pronto no perdamos tiempo 
te lo juro quiero que cambiemos 
echa el miedoq ue te quema dentro 
No nos sirve mas esta mentira te lo juro 
ha sido culpa mia queria sentirme grande

Paolo Meneguzzi,"Ciao che fai
Ti sento un po' confusa lo sai
Io sto qua
E non so ancora poi cosa sarà
Di noi si sa
Fino a ieri eravamo con un sogno nella mano
Ciao che vuoi
Mi sembra di essere stato chiaro ormai
No, non farmi diventare violento sai
Hai combinato e scombinato tutto quanto in noi

Ed io non ci sto più
Ed io non credo più
A queste tue parole
A queste strane forme dell'amore
E non sopporto più
L'idea che tu mi puoi manipolare, farmi male
Non dirmi che mi vuoi
Soltanto perché sei
Ferita nell'orgoglio da sola nel tuo sbaglio
Non chiedermi di più
Ho chiuso ormai conte
E non voglio stare neanche un solo attimo
A parlarne qui a telefono

Ciao che fai
A dire il vero non mi interessa però
Se mi vuoi parlare almeno
Possiamo chiacchierare
Di quell'esame che dovevo superare
Ma quanti esami ancora questa vita ci darà
E quante volte abbiamo detto
Domani cambierà
Io non voglio farti male ancor di più
Anche se proprio tu sei stata a farmi solo male

Ed io non ci sto più
A queste tue parole
A queste strane forme dell'amore
E non sopporto più
L'idea che tu mi puoi manipolare, farmi male
Non dirmi che mi vuoi
Soltanto perché sei
Ferita nell'orgoglio da sola nel tuo sbaglio
Non chiedermi di più
Ho chiuso ormai con te
E non voglio stare neanche un solo attimo
A parlarne qui a telefono
La tua voce indifferente
Si confonde tra le interferenze
Fammi stare un po' da solo

Ed io non ci sto più
E non sopporto più
L'idea che tu mi puoi manipolare, farmi male
Non dirmi che mi vuoi
Soltanto perché sei

Paolo Meneguzzi,"Cammino sulla strada con la macchina
Mi femo ad uno stop e vedo lei
Lei che mi sorride dolcemente
Mentre il finestrino scende giù
Ma mentre stiam parlando io sto pensando
Che di noi due non ho scordato e ho paura veramente
Perché così perché all'improvviso
Vorrei poterle dire

Mi sei mancata
Da quando non ci sei mi sei mancata
E adesso che sei qui che sei tornata
Io non lo so
Capir non so
Che mi succede
Però io non riesco a dire molto
Ma lei capisce tutto e già lo sa
E' un sentimento e non è una ragione

Se adesso son cambiato e sono qua
Ricordo che stavamo troppo bene
Volendo forse è facile poter ricominciare
Ma ho paura che sia troppo tardi
Infatti lei sorride abbassa gli occhi ed io mi sento vuoto
Mi sei mancata
Da quando non ci sei mi sei mancata
E adesso che sei qui che sei tornata

I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life
So I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes
That were ripped around the seams
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting

And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Woke up late one Thursday
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes and I
Felt like there were two days missing
As I focused on the time
And I made my way to the kitchen
But I had to stop from the shock of what 
I found a room full of all my friends all are dancing round and round
And I thought hello new shoes
Bye bye blues

To see a girl that's prettier than a diamond in the sun
Oh what fun!
I wonder if she's been naked in her room since I've been gone
I wonder if she said to them as she said to me before

However much you use me baby, come on use me more
However much you use me baby, come on use me more

Getting off the train
To see a girl that's sweeter than an apple picked from Adam's tree
Oh glory be!
And I wonder if she's been pressed against an unfamiliar wall
And said to all those men as she has said to me before

However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more
However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more
And more and more and more

Arriving at the door
Just to be told that the girl I'm missing has been in London for a while
No more northern skies for her
They say she's left a letter up the stairs for everyone
It's pinned against her bedroom door for all the world to see and she says

However much I love you, you will always love me more
However much I love you, you will always love me more
And I guess I's true
However much she loves me I will always love her more

I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I'll love you more and more, and more and more",Alloway Grove,2006
Paolo Nutini,"Autumn leaves under frozen souls,
Hungry hands turning soft and old.
My hero cried as we stood out there in the cold,
Like these autumn leaves I don't have nothing to hold.

Handsome smile, wearing handsome shoes,
Too young to say though I swear he knew.
I hear him singing while he sits there in his chair,
While these autumn leaves float around everywhere.

I look at you and I see me, making noise so restlessly,
But now it's quiet and I can hear you saying,
My little fish don't cry, my little fish don't cry.

Autumn leaves have faded now
That smile I lost well I've found somehow,
Cause you still live on in my father's eyes.

These autumn leaves, oh these autumn leaves,
Oh these autumn leaves are yours tonight.",Autumn,2006
Paolo Nutini,"Pack up loneliness, and hello tenderness.
I've been waiting for your call for so long,
And it must have been hard just to follow your soul.
To stick to the road that your heart wants you to go,
And as you slide through the door
With your morals on your sleeve.
I think it's time for all those morals to leave
Let's get down and freaky baby,
Let's get restless baby.
Come on get crazy with me.

[Chorus]
And I see when you're loving me, I'm loving you.
I love the prowess in the things that you do.
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone.
And when you're loving me, I'm loving you,
And that's when we've got it going on.

So many people think we've got it wrong,
They all try to break us but we won't play along.
So let's get down and dirty baby,
Let's get restless baby.
Come on get crazy with me.

[Chorus]

I was so stranded, I was lost and abandoned,
And I needed another home.
And flew into your arms,
And just flew right into my arms.

[Chorus]

It's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone.
And when you're loving me, I'm loving you,
And that's when we've got it going on.",Loving You,2006
Paolo Nutini,"Oh the phone you know it never stops, it's the last thing I hear at night
And the first thing in the morning.
And as I start to let it burn my head, you slowly creep into bed,
And I'm done with all the talking,
You say you know how I'm feeling, I just need to try to settle down.

Oh a million faces pass my way.
Oh they're all the same, nothing seems to change anytime I look around.
Oh who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you.

Tired as hell and falling up the stairs, filled with a thousand cares,
As you walk out from the bedroom
Though it feels like all my fire has gone, girl you just turn me on.
Can't believe how much I want you
You say you know how I'm feeling, I just need to try to settle down.

Oh a million faces pass my way.
Oh they're all the same, nothing seems to change anytime I look around.
Oh who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you.

We're distracted by the hard times, and the troubles that we make
Let us throw them in the ocean, let it wash our cares away.
On the phone you know it never stops, it's the last thing I hear at night.
And the first thing in the morning

Oh a million faces pass my way.
Oh they're all the same, nothing seems to change anytime I look around.
Oh who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you.

We're distracted by the hard times, and the troubles that we make
Let us throw them in the ocean, let it wash our cares away.

Paolo Nutini,"Woke up cold one Tuesday
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life
So I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes
That were ripped around the seams
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Woke up late one Thursday
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And I felt like there were two days missing
As I focused on the time
And I made my way to the kitchen
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found
A room full of all my friends dancing round and round
And I thought hello new shoes
Bye bye blues

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Take me wandering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking to the break of dawn
Take me wandering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking to the break of dawn

Paolo Nutini,"Picking up the pieces of the wreck you went and left
And I'm dealing with dilemmas in my now so stressful life.
I'm drinking stronger spirits, made my home here on the floor,
And I'm losing all ambition and goals
I'm going all out, I'm thinking you're just as bad.

Paolo Nutini,"Cross the border,
Into the big bad world
Where it takes you 'bout an hour
Just to cross the road
Just to stumble across another poor old soul from
The dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
Eye fight with my brain to believe my eyes
And it's harder than you think
To believe this sadness
That creeps up my spine
And haunts me through the night
And life is good and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wondering 'round
With a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Ochy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

Where'd the days go? When all we did was play
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall from
Walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I struggle to the train to make my way home
I look at the people as they sit there alone

Life is good, and the sun is shining
Everybody flirts to their ideal place
And the children all smile as a boat shuffled by them
Trying to pretend that they've got som space

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Ochy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Ochy

Paolo Nutini,"There's a heart on the line
And it rests with your eyes
Please don't fade and please don't cry, coz it's all white lies
Take a chance and watch it fall, grab too much and lose it all
Now I've lost my disguise, it was all white lies

[Chorus]
Stay here, lie with me, oh lo-fi, lonely sighs
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide

Would it help if I tried, or has it sailed and passed me by
First love grows and then it dies, and it's all white lies

I turn to you and inhale where you lay.
Took a wonder through the garden,
To awake the long long day
And then roll of a while on violet flower bed.

Oh, you kiss my lips again and again and again
And then again and then we watched the sun coming up easy
While the rain came tumbling down
And it watched our bodies so cleanly
We could see them rise up off of the cold cold ground.

Its a shame the way its seems to go
Cause now my best friend, my partner in crime
I'm afraid it looks like we're
Gonna have to go our separate ways.
You see the thing is I love you, I love you
But you see I resent you all the time.
All my other friends their just saying
Your slowing me down.

Before you throw too much of me away.

Paolo Simoni,"15 di Agosto,
La riviera in festa, io ti aspetto qua
Tu sei ancora via,
Giro con la bicicletta,
Passo per il centro, giapponesi e pubblicità
Fotografia e tanta varietà

15 di Agosto,
Quindici minuti che aspetto
Sta benedetta piadina al bar
Con il barista che voglia non ha,
Mi siedo c'è una vecchietta
Mi chiede se sono di fretta,

Io le rispondo,
Signora no! Sono qui da un po' che
Annuso l'estate,
La vita d'estate
Ciao ciao estate
Ma che bel vento d'estate

15 di Agosto,
Dalla strada la spiaggia biancheggia
Io continuo ad aspettare
Un romagnolo in mezzo al mare
Il barista mi guarda strano
Come se fossi di Milano
Fa una scoreggia e alza la ti vu

Poi sghignazzando mi dice sei stato tu
Il caldo, un caldo africano
Anzi è un uomo napoletano
Chiede da bere poi fa

Maronna quest'anno che umidità
Le onde chiaro scuro
Conto fino a quindici poi mi tuffo di sicuro
Signore che giocano a magio
Credo che qui resterò

Annuso l'estate,
La vita d'estate
Ciao ciao estate,
Ma che bel vento d'estate
Annuso l'estate,
Arriva l'estate
Ma che bel vento d'estate",15 Agosto,2014
Paolo Simoni,"E di colpo avere trent'anni 
Sentirne il morso sul culo e convincerti che sei uno dei tanti 
Di quella generazione cresciuta dalla televisione 
Figlia di un ventennio di ruberie sotto il sole

E di colpo quattro case in due anni 
Traslochi e scatoloni di ricordi troppo pesanti 
Ad inseguire un sogno o a limitare i danni 
Siamo stati bravi amore mio a guardare avanti

E di colpo salutare gli amici 
Che vivono all'estero e dicono di essere più felici 
E forse lo sono o è solo un modo dei tanti 
Di nascondere il sangue, il dolore e i pugni nei denti

Io non mi privo del tempo che vivo 
Lo scruto, lo mangio, lo cerco, lo sbaglio, lo porto con me 
Io non mi privo e manifesto 
Amico fai presto che il nostro futuro ce lo portano via

E di colpo il politico di turno 
Si atteggia sorride in tv 
Con i suoi occhi da furbo 
Tra applausi finti e frasi fatte 
Ci vende il suo fumo 
Ma non quel fumo che qualcuno vorrebbe

E di colpo un raggio di sole che per metà ti brucia 
E per l'altra metà ti commuove 
In quel momento in un Paese sfinito 
Lotti in silenzio perché credi che non sia tutto perduto

Io non mi privo del tempo che vivo 
Lo scruto, lo mangio, lo cerco, lo sbaglio, lo porto con me 
Io non mi privo e manifesto

Paolo Simoni,"Forse è il primo bacio 
Dato sulla riva 
Lo sguardo di tua madre 
Il primo giorno di scuola 
Quel giorno che ti hanno umiliato 
E tu l'hai scritto su un muro

Lanciarsi nudi 
Giù da un precipizio 
Ritrovarsi in apnea 
Nel freddo di un abisso 
Imparare le regole 
Per poi infrangerle 
Al momento giusto

Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
E ti ritroverai un po' più grande

La tua prima volta 
Che non ti ha convinto 
E quella chitarra 
Con i primi soldi 
E i tuoi diciott'anni 
Quella foto con tuo padre 
La tua promessa sull'altare

Quella volta che partisti 
E lasciasti tutto 
Uno zaino, un diario 
E poco altro 
Per dimostrare a te stesso 
Solamente a te stesso 
Che per vivere non c'è bisogno di un permesso

Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
E ti ritroverai un po' più grande

Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
E cambiano la rotta al tuo viaggio

Forse è quella cosa 
Che chiamiamo amore 
Una vecchia storia 
Di cui sappiamo poco 
Che convince i cinici 
Confonde i diavoli 
E ci fa cantare

E ci fa cantare 
E ci fa cantare 
Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
E ti ritroverai un po' più saggio 
Ci sono cose che ti cambiano 
Ti cambiano 
Ci sono cose che ti cambiano

Paolo Sorrentino,"What say You, Lord
For the Olive boys down in the house of corrections
As they try for love and any form of ascension?
Am I on the right train headed in the wrong direction?
What say You, Lord, what say You, Lord?

Am I living wrong?
Do You see a long road with no one on it
And the right of men that you learnt only to forget?
You see my sad wife and my high margin of profit
But You don't care at all, You don't care at all

What say You, Lord
Now that they're breeding all our animals insane
And the remedy is growing harder to obtain?
There's a white horse running wild through the switch cane
I can hear him now and I feel him

'Til kingdom come
Caught in this frenzy of elimination
Such an irreparable disintegration
My body's twitching with a ready expectation
For kingdom come, my kingdom come

What say You, Lord?
Why is the truth of this so hard to unveil
Though it's true I never knew what this would entail?
From the hands of Christ to the heads of the Daily Mail
I'll see you all and I'll raise you

Now what say you, all?
I wonder when the light is brought up for sale
With the weight of love and the grace of the Baleen Whale
Will the severed heads of state be at all curtailed?
Will they be here at all, will they be dead and gone?

What say You, Lord
Of the serpent-taled, forbidden fish of the harbors
And the ready men, defiant drinkers and charmers?
All lost and summoning the face of their fathers
Can You see them now? I can see 'em

What say you, all?
Do I believe it if I do not want it?
Do I lie alone and keeps my cold hands off it?
Honey, it ain't hard to loose your grip in the midst of all of this
But it ain't far to fall, it's not far at all

From across the sea

And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to

And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days

Nah, nah, nah, nah, I got trouble on my mind, trouble

It's a stolen G ride whenever we ride
It's war where we reside so I gots to keep my
Pistol close, even cops killing folks
Give their ass the whole magazine, fuck a centerfold
Sixteen with it, ho, one in the chamber
Mask on my face so I remain a stranger
Death round the corner run inside when we pull up
Learn the negotiations, how you talking to a bulldog?
Blap, blap, blap - what you hear when them shots go off
Devil on my shoulders told me squeeze my Glocks on y'all
Only the angel that I seen was the logo on the fitted
I'm a seven black nigga, all my enemies'll get it
Bloody rag wrapped around my motherfucking tech
Snoop ""Murder Was The Case"" what was playing in the deck
How else could I live my life
When yesterday's promise turn to present day's lies?

I'm shooting at the niggas with the badge
Catch you walking out the station, that's your ass
Nigga, that's for Mike Brown, pussy, that's for Eric Garner
Pig, that's for Sean Bell, die from these nine shells
Go against the SWAT team, meet us at the swap meet
Bloods and Crips together, peace treaty like it's '93
They the real enemies, they the ones that killing me
Killing you, they killing us, judges don't do shit for us
Cops kill a nigga, bet they'll never get a sentence huh
Get promoted right after getting off suspension
What the fuck is this world coming to?
Unarmed black kids, they putting guns at you
That's been happening for years so that's nothing new
Got me sick to my stomach, fuck a stomach flu
Tell captain or the police that we coming through
With troops that ain't scared to die and they love to shoot
Some out the roof, it sunk

Oh can you hear him comin'
Is the darkman you better keep runnin'
Always believe in what ever you say or do
That's the point that's why I can't say I love you
I got more than a thousand problems on my mind
I'm commin' from the dark and light's so hard to find
Can't concentrate I steady loose control
The pain in my brain make me wanna explode
Like the fugees day and night searchin' for the score
To bring the vibes I'll be the key to your door
It all started off with a glass of wine
But now I need nine to feel fine before I sign
Somebody help me or else I'M gonna die
Don't be shy ask why before passin' me by
The best things in life is what I heard are free
Michael Jackson will definitely tell you the story
It's the darkman flowin' of the mic
With the flava in your ear to be or not to be
I take a look in the mirror I see somethin' wrong
Last year I was strong somebody please blow the horns
Daily survival tactics and I pray
Dear lord forgive me and show me the way
To the light and the place called paradise
No matter when or how it I should I'll fight
You better be ready before you come to the ringside
No tears my friend only the strong survive
It always comes hard and direct in my face but my man
That the deal that the rule of the game that we play
Everyday what can I say
Real brothers don't die 'till they get their peace of the cake
Go for it go get yours stay on the course
Physical force like a rebel no doubt without a pause
Darkman flowin' on the mic
With the flava in your ear to be or not to be
Mama always said son you reep what you sow
But today now I know I can feel it through my body and soul
Separate the good from the bad
You better do your own thing than ending up sad
It made me bad I didn't have the chance to ask dad
Nightmares in my sleep I wake up frightened and scared
Who cares a boy in young years all I wanted was to see the
Light in full gear
Yeah here I come here I am here I slam
Rollin' with the clique with another dope party jam
Look for what you want and finally succeed and believe
Your dream will come true yes indeed
Make a small step forward than a big step back
Any other direction will probably break your neck
It's the darkman Flowin' on the mic
With the flava in your ear to be or not to be

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

tryin to come up off bitches type thing (""What can I do?"")
And if I don't react the way he want he might swing 
his little trick bitch ass in another direction 
then don't even use protection
I hate stupid shit assholes can avoid 
Yo! And if worse came to worse I'll run a fraud on unemployed 
Cause who the fuck cares that I got gray hairs and can't sleep 
Know what I mean? (Yeah hell yeah, that's deep)

Every now and then I start flippin and get to thinkin 
bout deep shit beyond all that bullshit 
I shoot at people (yeah I know what you mean)
but fuck it I'm evil 
And I'm hip to every bitch tryin to get a grip 
and every nigga tryin to get a grip but fuck that shit 
And I say fuck that shit with my mighty middle finger 
I'm heavy off into this rap shit, buckin singers 
Yo I think I'm gettin tense (word?)
Cause my dollars ain't makin no fuckin sense; but then again
it's probably all that chronic that I smoked 
I use to be like that when I was out there slangin dope 
and lately I been flippin on some old paranoid shit 
like lookin fuckers up and down tryin to start shit (""What can I do?"")
cause I'm a hard bitch (So why don't you just soften up?)
I try to be cool but I get caught up when I go to clubs, straight up 
I don't even trust myself (yo, you can trust me) 
Fuck I know? (I'm just like you)

Aiyyo, I got them buckwild thrills, livin foul kills 
I'm tryin to get to Watts but I'm stuck in Baldwin Hills (damn)
Tryin to find myself for real though, check it 
If I just rewind myself I'll see it ain't that hectic 
why'all don't hear me talkin but its time to get a stack 
Cause I'm about a second away, from goin back 
to the corner slangin dope (now you know you don't want to do that shit)
gankin cluckers, jackin high, cappin marks 
I may be loosin my mind but better that than my heart (I hear you)
I talk a lot of shit but I can back it all the fuck up 
I'm real cool people until some bullshit get brung up
Look here, believe me I ain't comin out my crib 
tryin to snap on life and run out and do some dumb shit 
So I'll be takin another sip to relax me 
And get them problems out my mind that distract me 
Life is workin on my last nerve (yeah I hear you G) 
I'll see yo' ass next week, peace (yo that shit is deep)

Lord please tell me what to do with that girl
The sheriff shared her bed
And he claimed her as his wife
She loved him once for the man
That he was in another life

But I long for his wife
O lord please tell me what to do with that man
The town where I was born
I hold dear to my heart

Tempers flared, ropes formed a noose
Get the traitor, burn that loathsome whore
Wake the hangman from his sleep
O lord please tell me what to do in this town
To walk through the night
Without love, no kisses on my lips
A world without end
My throat is parched, please give me a few sips
She offered the spread upon her table
And the wine went to my head
O lord please tell me what to do with myself
Who knows what to do

Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away, lookin' for a sunny day.

Well; the truck stop cutie comin' on to me,

Said I wouldn't be sorry, but she was just a baby.

And you know something this is how we rub-a-dub
So Field Mob, come down

I met this fine young tender named Vivian
Brown-skinned cinnamon, playin' and pimpin' men
Swimmin' in Benjamins
Body like a Buick bumpin', jumpin' and jigglin'
Butt look like big lips talkin' and whisperin'

Sayin' and her voice so feminine
Either her booty talkin' or my Hennessey kickin' in
I smile, give a grin, grab that butt with both hands
Man she moved it over and started hunchin' my Jimmy then

See, I'm gon' hit her then switch up and stick her friend
I'm skinny built like a spoon, they grits I'm diggin' in
I don't be spendin' ends but they gon' givin' chin
They lick it and kiss it then say

They pagin' and beepin', beggin' for me to come hit again
I'm pimpin' plenty women, game stronger than twenty men
Damn lil' momma proper halter top and knee-knockers
But before I freak the senorita she gotta

Lil' momma work it like she 'bout to hurt somethin'

Dark skinned chocolate, plus shawty drop a 'llac
Big breasts are proper set, her game, she on top of it
She break big ballers that'll infrared dot ya head

Micro's and contacts, ooh, I wanna knock her dead
Vicky Secret scents in the air, why I want her pop her leg
I heard in the streets that shawty give lots of head
Good hot my mouth too, have you jumpin' up out the bed

And plus shawty rock baguettes, chickens wanna chop her head
Off 'cause she jazzy with more cheese than broccoli
We on the dance floor, from side to side she rockin' it
Toot it up and stoppin' it then droppin' and poppin' it

She said ""Ooh, you on hard"" I had to stop and check
Pants pokin', I knew then her number I gotta get
Tipsy off of Heineken ready to shake some
Shawty flexa, time to have sexa

Me say shake somethin'

I like the ones with the weave
The thong-th-th-thong-th-thongs and Capri's
You can come home with me if you a girl on them six-inch heels
Or a black blonde with the natural and gold in yo grill

Earring in yo tongue, you dark and you lovely
Fine from yo heels up,but yo toes ugly
Plus it ain't bubbley, the back part
I ain't actin' hard, but you ain't touchin' me

Look, them tight Capri pants be fittin' her right
But her booty is much bigger, so that's what I like
I know a lot of shawty's out there sayin' that's not right
But she the jazziest and that's what I'ma take home tonight

A me say, I know a little girl by the name of Suzy
She look so sweet and she really sexy
I go home and she take off my shoe
Say ""Ohh Paparuby, let me make love to you""

On top my mind, me say ""My, my, my""
The woman on top of the woman is a lesbian
But the Ruby on top of woman it's a stylin' fashion
Stylin' fashion, it's a stylin' fashion

Fly down from overseas sign down, and get to chumping for cheddar

'Cause I'ma just go buy me some mo', (what it is what it is)

Foreign replay, and not forge my stunna
Dressed everyday, in the latest fashion look
Boys the enemy, best respect the man
Listen to me, know it's rule number one
No buster ain't right, we told the game plan
You do, you better and change the wrist band
The way me flow, my retaliation
So listen to me boy understand, understand
It's a bezeled out wrist, and that I wear everyday
On the right hand-a, the Presidential Rolly
And it's crossed off, like a ton of ice on the tray

Pull up to my bump, as I let it recline
Thirteen's easy five screens, it ain't no fucking with mine
They think I'm fucking with nine, but I multiplied it by fo'
It took some time, but I decided to throw my bitch on the 4's
The bubble-eyed Mazaratti, on a mission to meet Scotty
With bullets for your body, 'cause I'm living like Gotti
Pistol grip and a beam, plus a murdering team
Cash rule everything me, that there ain't nothing but green
Jumping in and out of line, moving slow as I want to
Smoking reefer bending corners, on twenty inch Yokohama
'Cause these niggas be hating me, when I be crawling down
So I'm like Paul Bugsy with a infrared, cause these niggas be falling down
Steady yelling out timber, from the first dance January down to the last dance
December better remember, put a big shell casing up in you
Make you weak like S-W-V, when I shine and grind like E-S-G
But I gotta get love like the Big Steve, throwed in the game like that P-A-T

The niggas told me they had you in Sig, in the Locust.
You were working with those boys and them,
And even had the nerve to try and talk to the streets.
Thinking that they bring some mark ass police.
And then he tried to sue a nigga,
But it got back to a nigga.

This is bullshit, this can't be life
I can't blame it on the hood 'cuz it gave me life

I'm just a nigga hustling for my million dollars

Loud talking in the tank like he a stoned cold killer

This for my people in the game ten toes, rooted in the streets, and withholding info
We got secrets we gone take to the grave
We don't honor nothing else, except the rules of getting paid
And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope
Everything we doing legal equal leaving us broke
What I hope is that a nigga don't forget where he from
And turn his back on his hood cause he's seeing some crumbs
And no money in the world that's enough to respect,
When somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest
Saying 'fuck it' at the same time he squeezing a round
You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down
If it was me, I'd be leery of the people I meet

Papa Roach,"I kill the rhyme again,
I'm comin' sick and on time again
Words manfest from deep inside
Where people hide
Within it, chemical imbalance
On the triple beam Fuck what you heard, it's about what I seen
I seen it happen,
Back hand brand to face smackin'
Definite disorder,
Now his mindset is blackened
The doctors say he's got the brain of a murderer
This rugged style steals your brain like a burglar

My heart is bleeding and this pain will not pass
It's not receding my body going numb
A bad trip child, rolling stoned, keeping high
He don't know what he's doing
Go away, I want to be thrown away

Born sick, nothing in his hands but his dick
He couldn't handle pressure, he couldn't handle shit
For the life he was leading,
Led him down the wrong path
Where guns blast, don't give a shit
About the God's wrath
Don't want to talk to the counselor, Doctor
To tell 'em what's real, tell 'em what's proper
The situation's unclear like gray
And I know it gets worse everyday

My heart is bleeding and this pain will not pass
It's not receding my body going numb
A bad trip child, rolling stoned, keeping high
He don't know what he's doing
Go away, I want to be thrown away

I am a mess, I've made a huge mess
I can't control myself
I'm losing it, I've lost it
I've split all my marbles

'Cause i see you inside of me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away
A hyper spaz, and that is the way
Sometimes I want to be thrown away",Thrown Away,2000

And you don't know if the next man is dumbin'

Channel the energy and with my strength I will devour
Sickenin thoughts is runnin' through my head
That's when I realized I'm glad I'm not dead

Corruption and it grows
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's out nature to kill, kill, kill

It was a dream and then it hit me
Reality struck, and now my life is all shifty
And it all moves, close to a buck 50
We all stand strong in respect to the family
In times of insanity
And through words of profanity
I describe our dysfunctional family
Blood brothers keep it real to the end
Deeper than the thoughts you think, not a trend

Turn around and bitch slap somebody

Terrorizing my soul like Bin Laden
But I ain't fallin' down bro

Shackled in chains
My soul feels stained
I can't explain 
Got a itch on my brain
Lately my whole brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My blood's boilin' it's beatin' out propane
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in the fast lane
In the rain and I might just hydroplane

And I don't fear bullets from uzi's

That'll make ya' fall to your knees
And that's the...

The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Lord please, please, please
Take away my anxiety

Take away my anxiety

The only thing makin' me stay my brother
But I won't give into it bro (No, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God I can't let my mind be trapped by enemies
My own
Got's to find my inner wealth
Grasp a hold of my thoughts 
I can't get lost
I can't give into it now (No, no, no)
Emotions are trapped on lock
Got my brain stuck
Going through the motions 
Only I know what's up 
I'm filled up with pain tryin' to gain my sanity 
Everywhere I turn it's embedded in front of me
Nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange
Paranoia took over me
And it's weighin' me down 
And I can't run any longer

I don't remember last night, I'm getting sick of this
I hit the bottle when I got off stage
and got piss drunk stupid and went I in a rage

I hit the bottom and I don't even care
Some say I'm going to hell but I'm already there

I can't point a finger cause there's no one to blame
So I say I'll never do it again
But when the sun goes down, you are my only friend
I'm thinking I am starting to see
I have become everything I never wanted to be
I'm really getting sick of myself
Cause when I look into the mirror, I see somebody else

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassion's in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
You shouldn't ever come around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause you're drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
And I left my heart open
But you didn't understand
But you didn't understand
Go fix yourself

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself

This fear is a weakness
And it's wearing me out
I burn in the sickness
It feels like I'm going down
I deny my affliction
And I run from the light
It's a lonely condition
But you are the one tonight

Free me from myself
Shot down my mind
A solo revolution
Into the light

Fuck all this madness and put it aside
Out of the shadows, into the light
Free me from myself
Shot down my mind

I didn't care 'bout a thing
It was me and this world and a broken dream
I was blaming myself
For all that was going wrong

I was way out there
On the wrong side of town
And the ones that I loved
I started pushing 'em out
Then I realized
That it was all my fault

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline

So I put out my hand
And I asked for some help
We tore down the walls I built around myself
I was struck by the light
And I fell to the ground

[Chorus]

Is there anybody out there?
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair?
I'm drowning in the pain
Breaking down again
Looking for a lifeline

You know a heart of gold
Wont take you all the way
And in a world so cold
Its hard to keep the faith
I'm never gonna fade away!

But I guess that's not the case
All the years that I loved you
You were out there playing games
You didn't think that I would find out
But it was written all over the place
Is he what you really want now?
Then get the fuck out of my face!
How could you deceive me?
I'm begging you to leave me

Go to hell
I'm better off without you
All is well
I'd rather be alone
To have you, to hold you, and never know you
Cause you sold me out
You're never gonna live this down
Never gonna live this down

How do you look in the mirror?
How do you stand the sight of your face?
If you made it any clearer
I could've seen right through the haze
And I'll never think about you
While I'm sleeping with all of your friends
And I'm hoping that you find out
Cause nothing's the sweetest revenge

Is living trough the pain

There's a battle raging in my head
And I don't want to be left for dead

There's a cemetery in my head
And I don't want to be left for dead

There's a world standing in my way

Stand down it will be OK
You don't have to fight

There's a picture hanging on the wall
Of a memory that I'm denying
The sun sets and the angels fall
Something isn't right

No don't leave me here alone
I don't want to make this hell my home
I would rather die than sell my soul
I would rather lie than let you go

Telling me that I best stop crying
Stand up it will be OK

We'll never fall
We'll never fade

And my soul to take
No matter what
Until the bitter end
We're gonna be the last ones standing

And if they saw us now
I bet they'd take it back

Trying to hide behind your music, you hit the
High way got money the fly way and told it you a hoe ass nigga that's what I say.
And you can go against some niggas that wanna touch it last album I was Made.
This album a mutha fucker.
So all you niggas wanna plot against the Mob since you wanna make it out,
Am finna address the noise.

Beep beep there goes the sound of my cellar, here's the life of a hustler.
I am a hustler
I am Gangster.
I am a hustler,
I am a gangster.
We nah informer, it's the life of a hustler.

Deal with it, don't talk he be about it, cause he a G about it.
I got a problem with a nigga, I go squeeze him out.
What the fuck I am going to talk to the police about.
I am from the streets doing the type of shit you read about.
I cooped the Chrome 45 under pressure.
And then address ya, now ya froze on the stretcher.
You wanted trouble, and I wouldn't settle lesser.
I am the devil in the flesh, my pistol is my protector.
See my reflection as it fades in the black,
When I reappear on a nigga. 
It's a ragging attack yeah.
And Solomon swear, any problem I here.
I just empty the clip, for him calling me to dis square.
That's on my life, that causes me to represent the Mob.
Since you niggas want that heat I am about to turn up the knob.
To High Powered!

[Chorus]

Bitch nigga you catch a dead man walking.
One foot is inside of a grave.
The other one is in a closed top coffin.
You still talking, like you the old G,
When you was locked down thou you was low key.
The niggas told me they had you in Sig, in the Locust.
You were working with those boys and them,
And even had the nerve to try and talk to the streets.
Thinking that they bring some mark ass police.
And then he tried to sue a nigga,
But it got back to a nigga.
And when I see him, I am do the nigga.
So skip that funky ass deposition fools.
If you want it, crank it up.
That's what I am about to do, to High Powered",High Powered [Explicit],2008

Papa Rue,"You win some, you lose some, life in a nutshell
Free all my niggas on locked down, fuck jail
I've seen enough hell to never wanna live there
Tattooed teardrops, sitting in a wheelchair
Kids on the streets doing bad, momma moved out
Dopeman pushing on the corner where the schoolhouse sits
This is bullshit, this can't be life
I can't blame it on the hood 'cuz it gave me life
This a stick-up, don't turn it to a 187
I don't go to church so I'm far from a Reverend
Ain't nothing like a young nigga, armed with an AK
Walking up the sidewalk, shooting in the broad day
Fuck what a broad say, I'm all day villain
I'm getting money so I'm always chilling
And even though they say I'm killing all they children
I'm just a nigga hustling for my million dollars

You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted

Now if I had to play Jack, I'll be leaving you bad news
Everybody in here be bound and gagged too
I'm posted at your crib nigga hurry yo ass home'
You was out here hi-capping and all yo stash gone
The money met the work and that's a real life no-no
It don't take a bunch of niggas, just me solo
I go for dolo, I can't tell on myself
Immature ass niggas get you sentenced to death
Loud talking in the tank like he a stoned cold killer
And you fighting a murder charge, my nigga?
The moral of the story is keeping your mouth shut
'Cause everybody is listening, speaking you fucked up
I tell you like them old cats say
Get what you get and get your ass out the way
'Cause greed'll get you 35 type, you're 27
That's the rest of your fucking life

You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted
It's in my DNA, my blood type G
My roots is deep up in these motherfucking streets

Real recognize what's real, the bullshit see through
The way I spit it, ain't another one that's equal
This for my people in the game ten toes, rooted in the streets, and withholding info
We got secrets we gone take to the grave
We don't honor nothing else, except the rules of getting paid
And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope
Everything we doing legal equal leaving us broke
What I hope is that a nigga don't forget where he from
And turn his back on his hood cause he's seeing some crumbs
And no money in the world that's enough to respect,
When somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest
Saying 'fuck it' at the same time he squeezing a round
You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down
If it was me, I'd be leery of the people I meet
'Cause in this motherfucking game niggas playing for keeps

You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer

I'm feelin' luke warm like the water in my tub
Started out and we was hot, looked up and now we're not
We had that fire like we was boilin' in a pot

Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Fire, I'm feenin' for a flicker
Then we'll fan the flame up into something bigger
Started out and we was hot, looked up and now we're not
We gonna catch a fire, catch a fire for God

Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that
Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Fire, takin' it from warm to hot
Fire, gotta give it all we got
Fire, whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Spark to a flame, I'm flippin' up my game
I caught the fire and I'll never be the same
So unexplainable I can't contain it, son
And my retaining it would only be a shame
So let me hear you say

Heat, like the Kingston concrete
There ain't no stoppin' the fire
We're straight breakin' ground
There ain't no cooling this thing down
We burnin' up and keep'n it krunk as we know how

Papa Smurf,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

Girl, I think I can change
I've learned just enough and I want to love
Stay, here's what I'll do 
I made up my mind and I'll wait for you

It's been some time now, still feels the same
No one even said you'd be here tonight 
But seeing how you're smiling there just makes it right

Love is worth the wait/Times it felt so strange
I believe in fate

Where's your boy, what's his name?
Does he make you laugh girl, when you feel the pain?
I remember just where we stood, 
Said you didn't love me never thought you would

But now you say you've grown
So tired of being alone
Ask me did I wait
I believe in fate

I know what you believe
Love takes all you can be
I know what's on your mind
Fate comes leaving it all behind

Take my hand, let's leave this place
Time, time is such a waste
I always knew it would feel like this
Things that you do show me what I missed
I taste your lips when I dream your kiss

You go pick up your coat 
Stop to use the phone 
Ask me will I wait
I believe in fate

I know what you believe
Love takes all you can be
I know what's on your mind

I can read your mind
Second thoughts have come across so clear
In your eyes

Outside, in the car, in the kitchen
There's nothing left to say
Eternity gets a little shorter everyday

And for a while 
We couldn't pretend
But no denial
Could start things over again

The road goes on forever
The days fade into the night
We're not walking together
And now I'm feeling alright

Forget all the things that I told you
Whispers in the dark
It's all in vain
'cause everything we had just fell apart

Three weeks seems so long when there's nothing to do
Lookin' up at the sky and it's finally blue
High time I threw away that shoebox full of thoughts of you

Try not to rewind 
To the first time
Like it's sometime yesterday
Draw the blinds 
Let the sunshine find a way

The road goes on forever
The days fade into the night
We're not walking together
And now I'm feeling alright

So the party's over
It's time to move it along
So don't look over you're shoulder
Cause I'll already be gone

And for a while 
We couldn't pretend

What's the use of waiting here when you're not coming home
Did you see the rain was falling just the other night
It's over now, step into the light

Picking up from where we left, my heart was left behind
Living through the day we met with your hands next to mine
Every night I dream of you a part of me inside
Keeps holding on, trying to go on

Nothing seems to last forever
Love won't always remember
When you came around I couldn't get over loving you

I never thought that love was so hard until you came along
And now that you're gone, I'm losing the will that would carry me on
Every time I think of you I stop and wonder why

Papas Fritas,"I went down to find a friend 
I called out no word was sent
No answer from the end 
No hope, no sign, two years went drifting by
Away so long

You were only lost in a dream
All alone in between
You were only lost in a dream
Until you set your spirit free

So I ran to my love and she sang out from above

I hear words inside my head
They say stop get back in bed
Those goals you had are dead
I toss, I turn, I break up and I burn
My chance was gone
 
You were only lost in a dream
All alone in between
You were only lost in a dream
Until you set your spirit free

You were lost but now you're found lying here
Where love is all around

How can I believe them
They don't even try

All of the love and laughter
That she holds inside
I know the secret she's after
It got left behind

People say she's angry
They don't understand
Everything just fell apart 
And crumbled in her hands
Now she's just a stranger
Biding her own time
Faces wouldn't change her
Even when they tried

All of the love and laughter
That she holds inside
I know the secret she's after
It got left behind

Even lonely stars will shine.

People say she's broken
But they look away
They don't know she's workin'
Harder every day
I will never reach her
We just grew apart
She will just deceive them
Soon she'll be a star

Running away from a world that can't walk
Swinging your hips so you don't have to talk

Showing your girl 'bout a natural way of living
Got bit in the ass by a tiger at the zoo
When you got home you just passed out in the kitchen
Now you've got no one to lose

Bought a new car with a fuel injected system
Popped in a tape and cruised around the town
Chased by a cop 'til he wrote you out a ticket
Now you can just dig the sound

But she's an undertaker
Now you know the Paper is an around the world heart-breaker
Me be singin' first, but yo, had to have a breakdown
Playin' you fools, so now you know why my belly's round
Takin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, takin' it to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your women, G
'cause now that I'm rich so many women want to do me
It make a man say ""damn""
I'm finally taxin' more play than homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is help up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this groove in ninety two
Hey, you don't bother me and I sure 'nuff won't bother you
And ah, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagara
Think before you step, because these niggas just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold d's on my four and gold lex, 'cause I got it made
I broke the veto once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you
Just let me work this track, and yo, any way is ok
Your place or mine, all night until the next day
Uh

[Chorus]
Do the ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the ditty-ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go from the top
Second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, all should be happy with ding-dong
It's just a mad park a grip, G
It's like every nickel and dime nigga be like
""See, don't you remember me?""
A hustler, and it's on with more hoes to Lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so they can play with my eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove
Pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, belive I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me with the chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up token
Tote on his ass when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there
Huh

[Chorus]

Now here we go
Uh, let's take a trip to another land
Park a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the lex-o, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me, my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like a ???, you ain't heard a damn thing
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'cause doin' the ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Leave you kinda startled like the funk off of fritos
Make you man jealous, while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the piper with concern
And I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And for those disagree, and then jack, that's a pitty
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the ditty
Yeah

For thirty rears spent on the clock

Besides he just wouldn't know how

Paper Lace,"Daddy was a cop on the east side of Chicago
Back in the U.S.A. back in the bad old days

In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of Chicago died
And they talk about it still

When a man named Al Capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
With the forces of the law

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed!

And the sound of the battle rang
Through the streets of the old east side
'Til the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died

There was shouting in the street
And the sound of running feet
And I asked someone who said
""'Bout a hundred cops are dead!""

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died

Paper Lace,"My daddy was a cop on the east side of Chicago
Back in the U.S.A. back in the bad old days

In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of Chicago died
And they talk about it still
When a man named Al Capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
With the forces of the law

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed!

And the sound of the battle rang
Through the streets of the old east side
'Til the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died
There was shouting in the street
And the sound of running feet
And I asked someone who said
""'Bout a hundred cops are dead!""

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!

Paper Lace,"The marching band came down along Main Street
The soldier blues fell in behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line

And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancée
From where I stood I saw she was cryin'
And through her tears I heard her say:

""Billy, don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero 
Come back and make me your wife""

And as Billy started to go, she said 
""Keep your pretty head low
Billy, don't be a hero 
Come back to me""

The soldier blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle ragin' all around
The sergeant cried ""We've gotta hang on, boys
We gotta hold this piece of ground

I need a volunteer to ride out
And bring us back some extra men""
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgetting all the words she said 

She said: ""Billy, don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life""
Billy don't be a hero 
Come back and make me your wife""

And as Billy started to go, she said 
""Keep your pretty head low
Billy, don't be a hero 
Come back to me""

I heard his fiancée got a letter
That told how Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She should be proud he died that way
I heard she threw the letter away","Billy, Don't Be a Hero",1997
Paper Lace,"Oh, the black-eyed boys
They motor-cycled into town
The people cried, it's the black-eyed gang
All in white, a super bang
Oh, the black-eyed boys
They laid a rockin' rhythm down
You feel the time starts to come alive
Ev'rytime the black-eyed boys arrive

Well now the leader of the band, he was the drummer
He did a rhythm like a big tattoo
And you can see he put all his heart and soul in
The lead guitar, he's set astride and roared
And in behind there was a bass boy, too
They pretty soon had the hole town rock and rollin'
Ev'rybody

Oh, the black-eyed boys
They had 'em dancin' in the street
They rocked along from the mornin' light
On and on into the night
And oh, the black-eyed boys
They kept the people on their feet
Cryin' oh, let it never end
Wanna hear the black eyed-boys again

Tonight's the night I've waited for
Because you're not a baby anymore
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Happy birthday sweet sixteen
What happened to that funny face
My little tomboy now wears satins and lace
I can't believe my eyes you're just a teenage dream
Happy birthday sweet sixteen

When you were only six
I was your big brother
Then when you were ten
We didn't like each other
When you were thirteen
You were a funny Valentine
But since you've grown up
Your future is sewn up
From now on you're gonna be mine so

If I should smile with sweet surprise
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen

Paper Lace,"Sunrise, this is the last thing that I'll ever see
Out in the courtyard they're ready for me
But I go to the Lord with no fear
'Cause I did what I did for Maria

As I rode into town with the sun coming down
All the windows were barred, there was no-one around
For they knew that I'd come with my hand on my gun
And revenge in my heart for Maria
My dearest departed Maria

Take an eye for an eye
And a life for a life
For somebody must die for the death of my wife
Yes I did what I did for Maria
I did what I did for Maria

Laughter echoed across from the end of the street
There was the man I was burning to meet 
And my mind was so calm and so clear
And I took my revenge for Maria

And he fell to the ground
Raising dust all around
But I knew he was dead long before he went down
It was quick and was clean, made it easy on him
Which is more than he did for Maria
When he did what he did to Maria

Take an eye for an eye
And a life for a life
For somebody must die for the death of my wife
Yes I did what I did for Maria
I did what I did for Maria

Sunrise, this is the last thing that I'll ever see
Out in the courtyard they're ready for me
But I go to the Lord with no fear
'Cause I did what I did for Maria

Maria, Maria
I did what I did for Maria
Maria, Maria
I did what I did for Maria

Take an eye for an eye
And a life for a life
For somebody must die for the death of my wife
Yes I did what I did for Maria
