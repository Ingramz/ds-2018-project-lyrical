Stewart Michaels,"Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends 
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation 
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer 
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam 
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
We need a break, let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch, and stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Is that alright?  Good! Let's go for a ride, Earl",Goodbye Earl,2006
Stewart Michaels,"I've sure enjoyed the rain and I'm looking forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain when you lose the love you gave someone
I thought by now that time would take away these lonely tears
Well I hope you're fine all alone, where do I go from here
'Cause

Without you I'm not okay
Without you I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

Well I never thought I'd be lying here without you by my side
It seems unreal to me that the life you promised was a lie
You made it look so easy making love into memories
Well I guess you got what you want but what about me, 'cause

Without you I'm not okay
Without you I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

Somebody tell my head, to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you
'Cause baby I can't live

Without you I'm not okay
Without you I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you",Without You,2006
Stewart Michaels,"Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far away?
Now I feel the wind blow outside my door
Means I'm leaving my woman behind

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Yeah, Tuesday's gone with the wind

And I don't know where I'm going
I just want to be left alone
Well, when this train ends I'll try again
But I'm leaving my woman at home

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Yeah, Tuesday's gone with the wind

Train roll on, miles from my home
See I'm riding my blues away
Tuesday, you see she had to be free
But somehow I gotta carry on

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Yeah, my woman's gone with the wind

",Tuesday's Gone,2007
Stewart Michaels,"Well I'm rollin' and tumblin' baby
Pray the whole night long,
Said I'm rollin' and tumblin' baby
Pray the whole night long,
Wake up in the mornin'
Wish the day was gone.

She look just like an angel
She got a silver tongue
She look just like an angel
She got a silver tongue
I ain't never heard such talkin'
From a girl so young

Goin' down to the preacher
Preacher take me in
Goin' down to the preacher
Preacher take me in
Throw me in the water
Wash away my sin",Rollin' & Tumblin,2007

Stewart Rose,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

Stewart Wille,"I love you that's what my heart is saying
While every breeze is playing our Cuban love song
I love you for all the joy you brought me
The lovely night you taught me our Cuban love song
One melody will always thrill my heart
One kiss will cheer me when we're far apart
(Dear one) I love you with such a tender passion 
and only you could fashion our Cuban love Song

",Cuban Love Song,1997
Stewart Wille,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",2002

Stewkey,"Hello it's me,
I've thought about us for a long, long time,
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong,
There's something here that doesn't last too long,
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.
 
Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do you,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care,
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through.
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free,
'Cause I never want to make you change for me.
Think of me,
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should.

Stian Carstensen,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

Stian Carstensen,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Stian Carstensen,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Stian Carstensen,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

The one that has the lock and key,
And know the boy that you care for,
The boy who's in your diary.

When it's late at night, what is the name you write?
Oh, what I'd give if I could see.
Am I the boy that you care for,
The boy who's in your diary?

Do you recall and make note of all
The little things I say and do?
The name you underline, I'm hoping that it's mine.

I just want to write what a beautiful night it has turned out to be

Searching for the very thing he left at home
He searched far and wide, under every stone

Fam, just know when you step to the mic, I'm a old school legend like Alan Shearer

Mannaman are old school legend like Alan, what you gonna do when I pass you the baton?
Lookin' around to your mandem for some help but they've already told you, don't mess with Kannan
Heard man talkin' like a drug baron, said he was knockin' out hoes like Hatton
'Til he gets locked by the feds with a gun and starts squealin' before he's been hit with a baton
I made happen what no one expected to happen
No, they weren't expecting this, when I had beat down Creps in this
Shoot the door open and crept in this
Me and Mass are like Conan and Krept in this
Go back to back and nobody want back him, so back up or find out I get lacquered

No I never be shot 'cause them man not wet, can't wipe out the Mass though, dog, get the vets
Me and Kannan go together like a canon erect

Roll on your block on my toes, that's a ten
Told my connect, bring the O's, I want ten

Gimme five minute, bet I wrote a song
Music and money what I focus on
You ain't got drive, go get your focus on

Hey, yo fuck it. I'm rollin in a 4-barrel Camaro, toward the Tribore, eyes
narrow East River flow with marrow, along side the bridge zombies
pushing bodies in wheel barrels, bitches sterile follow on crutches of
rusted arrows try to breath through esophagus stuffed with sparrows,
the imperial, terrarembrium, the spherical, I turn the steering wheel
and pull into a 7-Eleven, met up with Billy, Danny, Rob and Evan from the
fucking Bio, yo we down for survival with acid raindrenched skin infest-
ed by termites, hermaphrodites on bikes swing spikes, think twice as I
try to pacify the pariah beside the driver and Shotgun kelly flips the
visor, time to devise a plan to reverse the demise of man before he's met
by the lastset of the sun, armageddon, no question to answer, disaster
results from behavior patterns. Earth lay raped, escape to saturn in a 
capsule, thirteen days of travel. Upon arrival plans unravel, imbalance
of chemical pheremones, clones with no genitals surround us, we can't
fuck them, no means of reproduction. I hear a scream and turn in that
direction, 33-23-33, I see seven, coming toward us, to reward us...

Disorder, enter the millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder

[Lord Humongous]

Armageddon, a new death is dawnin', I like the smell of napalm in the
morning, four riders of the apocalypse descend from the north, a fear in
my eye, I behold a pale horse. Armageddon, no time to cry we all die as
the sky turns red, the missles start to fly. Factionstake action, eleven
families rule, millennium approaches, survival of the roaches. Body
armor will make you feel calmer or safe from the drama, deplow stealth
military bombers, ass out, get down on your knees and pray; illuminati
takes your soul on the eve of judgement day as the armies of darkness
irradicate life and we all go to hell and satan fucks your wife. Strife, ter-
ror without a minute to pray, human beings at odds, peace becomes dis-
aray, I'm humongous from Mad Max, Lord of the Wasteland with crazy ill
troops all at my command, don't you ever fall victim to my master plan,
I'm the dealer of death and here's your motherfuckin' hand.

[D-Lux]

I'm ready to take back whatever they sold ya 'cause the scheme is a secret
so nobody ever told ya, an underground illuminated tribe of radicals
ready to take forth and feast like cannibals, animals, huffing the fumes
of rotting flesh exhumed from the corpses of presisdents, dissents and
fools with a one way ticket from the temple of doom, dark sides of
moons and ill atomic booms leave the earth all shakin and full of
wounds from Krakatoa east of Java to Camaroon, and coming soon to a
theater near you, the end of everything that we once knew.

[Billy]

The grand finale strap my body with TNT, take the president and his
bitch with me tearing down the walls of this conspiracy, fuck skull and
bones and illuminati. Irradication of the land of the free but I'm the
brave, ain't going out like a motherfuckin' slave, neobarbaric post-
apocalyptic war, ground zero brooklyn, the world at war.

[Sticky Fingaz]

I woke up, bar codes on my forehead, it's a living nightmare, my families
all dead. I gotta call Fred but no dail tone, I'm out for
self 'cause I'm gonna die alone, this is madness I'm drooling with the lock
jaw, my elevator don't go to the top floor, I hold my breath 'cause the O2
killed, I'm suffocating, I can't pay my oxygen bill. There's no tomorrow, I
wish a nigga murder me, the president declared a state of emergency.
The coast guard bangin' at my front door, I got homemade bombs if they
want war. There's no sun, they put a fucking chip in me, I'm a clone, mat-
ta fact it's a different me. I'm high tech kid, you get a bomb in the mail, so
if you die today then I'll see you in hell, I'll see you in hell, see you in hell.",New World Disorder,1999

Let me call this nigga
Come on man; pick up the damn phone

[Brother]
Hello

[Sticky]
I got your pictures, damn we look just alike
A younger version of me, half my age same height
I played ""beat you up"", made you tough, thought you to fight
Put you on, showed you things, put up your first bite
Now you on the streets making the same mistakes I did
That got me nowhere, so I'm trapped upstate in this bid
Caged like an animal ain't no way to live
Got a baby on the way, who gone father my kid
Where you going now I can clearly see
You either going in an bag or in jail with me
Remember when we was younger and you promised me
You be the first in our fam with al college degree
I know you see the cars, the girls, the clothes, the jewels
And think it's all about the money, heard you dropped out of school
I ain't trying preach but if I don't, who gonna
Couldn't live with myself if you died on the corner
You're my baby brother

[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
You are my baby brother 
And you know I love you nigga
I'm just trying to keep you out there
You don't want to end up in here

[Brother]
I hear what you saying big brother, but listen to me
I ain't trying to be the nigga working Mickey D
When I can hustle on the block and come home with a gee
Yeah you right I want jewels and push a luxury V
But what's wrong with that, I want to love comfortably
Just like the next man driving round the hood in my Lex Land
I ain't got nobody taking care of me 
And as far as a school, well it just ain't for me 

[Sticky & Brother]
So what you want to do huh
What you gone sell drugs all your life
(I might)
See you ain't even right
Maybe when you sober up to see the light
(Hold up, this is my life, I live it anyway that I like)
Yo look I'm just trying to help
You know all you want to do is get blunted
(I need money, my wifey got a seed in her stomach)
If you can't see the cycle then you must be blind
And your child getting a father that was just like mine
You're my baby brother

[Chorus]

[Sticky & Brother]
So is you like that. I mean what's the deal?
Don't you too worry about trying to keep it real?
(Man whatever, this is how you feel then this how you feel)
Yo what's this I hear, you had a gun concealed
(Yeah, I keep my nine (See this what I?.)
(Hold up, let me speak my mind
Look at you, you can't even talk you doing mad time)
Yeah look at me, this is how you want to be
Locked up, the cops tell you where you can pee
(I got to go man)
Ooh you don't even want to hear me out?
(Yeah, but you talking mad shit I don't even care about)
All I saying is that you got to be more responsible
(Aight man, whatever I'm a talk to you)

[Sticky]
Yo, yo.... Damn
He gone end up just like me

[Chorus]",Baby Brother,2000
Sticky Fingaz,"This is to my niggas up in here with they fuckin' shorties and
shit...your girls...your wifies and shit...this is to them niggas...

(Chorus 1)
Victoria don't know how to keep a secret
like a nigga need pussy, a bitch need dick
statistics show that out of every ten hoes
whether married or in love done cheatin' befo'
and if they did it once, they'll probably do it again
turn your back, Jerry Springer style, screwin' your friend
and that alone's enough to make any niggas furious
nigga you wasn't hittin' it right, maybe she's just curious

(Verse 1)
You all serious, your girl all gigglin'
'cause she know I'm right, somebody slid up in that clitoris 
(somebody slid up in that clitoris) 
(somebody slid up in that clitoris)
how to know if your girl cheatin'
does she go out every weekend?
freakin', you and her hardly speakin'
she hang with hoes, and you hate them chicks
leave the club around Three, don't get home 'till Six
probably met some nigga, she ain't goin' home
claim the battery died on her mobile phone
you found a number, she swear she don't know who's it is
she know more niggas than you in the music biz
you try to talk to her, but she's in her own World
on the phone with some nigga, actin' like it's her home girl
you don't think your girl got bones in her closet?
bring it up she starts an arguement and change the topic. 

(Chorus 2)
aiyo, turn it up, and take a look at your bitch
if she smilin' somebody stuck a dick in your bitch
now think about when you're not around, who she be wit'?
and think about the bullshit you got away wit'

(Verse 2)
You better pay attention now, or you gon' cry later
middle of the night, a nigga blowin' up her skypager
you can't hear it though, she got it on vibrator
she be creepin' 'cause you think she gon' violate her
when you havin' sex is she already sore?
did the pussy feel like it was tighter before?
is she gettin' gifts she couldn't only afford?
been together for a Month and she already bored?
if your girl is cheatin' with her legs open wide
you never know, she could be playin' from both sides
she could be playin' with another chick G.
'cause nowadays all bitches ain't strictly dickly.

(Chorus 2) - 2X

(Talking to girl)
Aiyo...
huh?...
let me ask you somethin'...
yeah?...
you love me?
yeah I love you
huh...yeah right...

(Chorus 3: repeat 2X)
It was just sex, probably ain't mean nothin' to her
it was just sex, it was just a fuck to her
no emotion, no love, no feelings inside
it was only one time, it was only one night",Cheatin',2000

You want to wild out, come on!

Fuck hoes, come on!
What?! We can do it kid however you want!

[Verse 1]
Oh you ain't know?
Sticky Fingaz went solo
And got the whole hood in a choke hold
Radio locked like I was po-po
You rappers get no dough
I make you have oral sex with the fo-fo
I'm unstable, get cash under the table
I blaze you, not even God could save you
What?! I ain't havin it, I'm ignorant and arrogant
Dogs couldn't sniff me out, 'cause I ain't have a scent
Your wifey's checkin me, said I had sex appeal
Been hittin niggas' girls, way before the record deal
Let me make it clear just so it's understood
That don't make you no thug 'cause you from the hood
My nine's stainless, I speak in sign language
My mind changes, every time the wind blows
Gunshots got me jumpin out of second story windows
Beef on impulse, you get murdered over insults

HOOK

[Verse 2]
Goddamn I'm hungry, and it's time to eat
I'm the worst thing since crack to hit the street
The man that could murder me, I'm dyin to meet
Rapper fuck your own seed and shoot a 5 wit me
I intake shit from no man, I set up my own fam
I never was a kid came out the pussy a grown man
I slept in a slum, I'm second to none
I give you ten seconds to run, 9, 7, 3, 2 1! BLAU!
Half my niggas ain't gon' never see sunlight
Got twenty stitches under my navel from a gunfight
You better watch your back for them thug hoes
I believe in safe sex and go to bed with a snub nose
Rhyme like my life on the line, I'm nice with the nine
Knockin out big niggas twice my size
So take a dirt nap when normal people slept I used to purse snatch
A bullet costs a quarter, but your life ain't even worth that

HOOK

[Verse 3]
It's a whole new me, but the same old you
We had beef before well deja vu
Never seen nothing like this I rip your whole crew
Ever thought about death, that's what you bout to go through
I stay to myself, I'm anti-social
I ghost you, and wild out like I'm supposed to
My rollie got a body son, it costs a life
Every time it tick I can see the soul on ice
I call a hotline, to get yours, I got mine
And son I got glock nines, tech nines, mack 10's 11's and 12's
22's, 25's, 32's, 38's, 44's, 45's, AK-47's
Don't be a smartass, I put a hole in your forehead
Stomp you out and beat yo' ass to syllables...
You... stupid.... mother, be lucky I ain't killin you all
I hung myself on my umbilical cord

The nine mill guaranteed to clear the spot in here
And we ain't get searched kid, we got glocks in here

Love the freaks that ceep and be giving it up

Nine on my dick and three on my toungue
My manager, the bitch name is Helen Wate
Need a free show? Nigga go to Hell and wait

Niggaz'll duck, chains tucked, Timbs get scuffed
I pull a four-four from out of the seat
Up out it and beat
Picture me not riding with heat
Jump out of the Jeep
Clear a nigga out of the street
Nobody can creep
Thirty deep nigga, I'm out of your reach
Ain't nothing but killers boasting next to me
I'm prejuduce, I hate every color except for green
In the club, that's were my niggaz jwewlry shop
When the hammer cock, we don't care who we box
So why you come to the club, what you livin it up
Why you fuckin with that chicken, was she givin it up

Unless you talkin' business or money I'm unconcerned

I live for now because my days is numbered
I got a six shot revolver, watch the barrel on my gun turn
I'm like an accident just waitin' to happen
A nigga fuck, my killas in the cut waitin' to clap 'em

It's pitiful this game is too political, critical
But let's not talk about the big I's and the little you's
Niggas wouldn't be confused if they mind their P's and Q's
Keep your nose out of mine and I won't have to squeeze the two's

And cock the glock, what's that sound?

So watch out watch out, niggas better clear a path
Think I'm scared to blast 'cause I'm doing flicks on Miramax

Fuck security, my bodyguard is my two nines
Knew I'd make it big in due time
My only lie when my lips move
Gun in my crotch my forth leg is a pistol, who wanna get shot?

And strippin' niggas and still gettin' figures
And pistol whippin' niggas and flippin' niggas
I ran with life bidders and ice pickers

Now wonder if this life fit us in Vegas with strippin' white bitches
But that's just a deep thought in the back of my mind
I'm Black Trash true to the streets gritty and grime
I got a bone to pick a holdster with a shoulder grip
Concealed inside my leather camouflage so I can ride, notice it?

Don't tell nobody, but between me and you I put three in you
Add you and ya crew to the M E N you
I got bloopers of ya death and I draw it myself
You want the job done right you gotta do it yourself

My code defendin' my conscience, my mind afflicted with monsters
Kill a nigga over nonsense for five cents
You a glutton for punishment, I'm the nigga runnin' shit
Yo breath stank that cause you be talkin' a ton of shit

You can't take me out, forget about it
Killers in front of ya house, forget about it
Y'all niggas don't want no war, forget about it
I'll bring it to your front door and you won't do shit about it

You need work, come see me son I'm takin' applications
You can't beat me join me save yourself the aggravation
You dead if you harm a single hair on my head
My payback is goin' to cost you a arm and a leg

Layin' on the couch
Was dressed with black jewelry this time
Mmmmmm, c'mon

[Sticky Fingaz]
Everybody want me, I created thieves
Why I'm almost as important as the air you breathe
I been through hard times, when it wasn't enough for me
Stick a weak kid'll have you livin' in luxury
I'm the reason niggas sellin' drugs to fiends
I'm the reason Mr. Simpson got off clean
I'm the reason some parents gotta bury they kids
And I'm the reason why your cousin on the run from feds
I've been through customs, borders
I've been handled by authorities
Drove people crazy when they couldn't see more of me
I've been saved, I've been buried alive
Say my name enough and any nigga testify
Who you think lead that whole seller ass that time
All by myself, I created black on black crime
I'm America's most, I'm tadded up with Ghostt
Even my hand got big, from net to gross
I'm emotionless, yet I breathe jealousy and envy
People kill for me or die to defend me
But in the end am I really worth the sun
Rich people make me work for them
And poor people work for me

Who ran up in the house, duke

You stayed up in the crib, like a bitch
Lookin' ill, and it's lurkin' me (for who?)
I got stabbed for you
Yo, shot up the ass for you
Should stop blowin' the cabs for you (for who?)
Chill, some niggas called crabs for you
Holdin' them garbage bags for you
Ill, blowin them hags for you

I'm more powerful than God, or Razale
Cause when you pray to God nigga, you pray for me
I'm an exchange hand to hand, with heavy weapontry
This one couple fucked on me, and slept on me
Up in the dice games niggas stepped on me
Bet on me, couldn't pay, bled on me
I enslaved populations, and controlled masses
I come in all forms, coins, paper, plastic
Even credit, I owe you
You work for me nigga, I own you
If you are smart, you make me work for you

If you had a million of me, what would you do with me yo?
Would you blow me in a month and have nothin' to show
Or would you invest in me and watch me grow
Take me to the streets and flip me from, do' to sto' to do'
I underseen things I wish I hadn't seen
I came between loved ones and families
A nigga kill his old man to get his hands on me
Got secret ensciptions, examine me
want to find me, the bank machine is where I be
And showed 'em to a hundred grand, F.D.I.C.
I'm more notorious than the B.I.G.

If it wasn't for cool Herc, hip hop wouldn't be created
That's bullshit, I would of created it tens years later
Niggas acting up till the guns is heard
I don't hear you poppin shit now, mums the word
And all you rapping niggas, what, that's all you got
Think you a thug now you doing songs with Pac
Gotta bullet in my stomach doctors scared to remove it
And 25 stitches above my dick to prove it
But I can't die, so I don't wear no vest
I'm like super nigga, gotta SF on my chest
Nigga I'll take a automatic and play Russian roulet
Just to collect, life is short expect my death
Told you once, told you twice
This is the last time you can boooooooop give me a flat line

[Verse 2]
I tried everything swallowed pills slit my wrist
Made my own brother shoot me, X-1 fuckin missed
Tried to paint the walls with my brain but the gun jammed
At my first shoot out, I stayed everyone ran
I want it rawwwwww, and more than ten different women
Locked myself in the garage with the Benz runnin'
As a kid, they had to watch me carefully
Tried to put the blow dryer in the bath with me
Everywhere I go, I hear voices, who calling me
Doc said my brain damaged but I don't see nothing wrong with me
Maybe that's why half the industry won't do a song with me
I walked amongst the dead
Talked to punks with lead
An eye for an eye
We can all go blind
All you niggas talking about you ain't scared to die
I feel nigga, cause I ain't scared to kill you nigga WHAT
I'ma rule the underground or get shot trying
No matter how many times I get hit with the hot iron

[Chorus]

You can't kill me {8X}

Sticky Fingaz,"Come on man - oh my fucking God man..
Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?
It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault
Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck..
 
Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you

Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?
 
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware
 
Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me
 
It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?
 
Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane
 
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same
 
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?
 
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?

The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets

The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using
 
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you
 
[Chorus]
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God
 
Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?
 
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity
 
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain
 
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth
 
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?
 
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?

How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest
 
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?
 
The process of all life
is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self
 
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?
 
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living
 
[Chorus]
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God",Oh My God,2000

I think one right here... 
Is long over due
All ya'll
All ya'll

[Sticky Fingaz]
To all my sisters all across the world
I applaud you
I know can't nothing can't erase the pain we caused you
I'm sorry sister for all the times we used you
Hurt you, beat you up, bad and abused you
Raped you, took your womanhood, violated you
Betrayed you, you women, we supposed to praise you
Instead we called you hoes and bitches and dissed you
I was thinking ""Damn, what if that was my mother or my sister?""
You never feel it, till it hits home
We abandoned you, left you all alone
With our babies in your hour of need 
Left you all by yourself to raise our seed
And all the times we made you go wild in court
And had to fight us just to get child support
There is only a handful of us that handle our responsibility
I'm from a broken home; know this shit is killing me
How a man can make a woman a mother and a father
If men got it hard, then women got it harder
And I represent every man on earth when I say this:
Sister I'm sorry and I pray for your forgiveness

[Chorus- Choclatt]
Sister I'm sorry
For all the wrong I've done
Sister I'm sorry
I'm telling everyone
Sister I'm sorry
Nothing can change the past
Sister I'm sorry
Your forgiveness is all I ask

[Sticky Fingaz]
I broke a promise, cheated on you, lied to you
I ain't recognize the goddess that is the side of you
I know sorry ain't do it but my acts of faith 
Made me overstay, hope it's not to late
But I don't understand is how we could hit our girl
And how we can bring a bastard kid in this world
I don't want my child being ashamed of me
Like ""Mommy, where's daddy?"" Wonder what became of me
Swear to life I don't know how ya'll made it all these years
Can't even look you in your eyes without mine filling with tears
You my sister, I respect and love you
You woman, men came from you
And he came from she
All men ain't the man that they claim to be
Sister I'm sorry, swear to god, please forgive me

[Chorus]

[Choclatt]
Sister, I'm so sorry
Please forgive me

I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry for hurting you
For mistreating you
For not loving you
I'm so sorry",Sister I'm Sorry,2000
Sticky Fingaz,"Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing 
Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence 
Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin' 
Prosecution set it with your opening statement

Your honor, before we get started
I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed 
Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara
His two year old daughter T'want to 
And the baby's mamma Sandra 
[He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!]

Order in the court!

I'm sorry for the outburst your honor 
I have an original copy of the police report 
January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught
The forensic report states there was a gun in the car 
And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm 
Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle 
Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you 
You said you was outside the store in Manhattan 
So could you please tell this court what you saw happened 

Yeah he killed Tyrone 
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything 
The worst shit I saw in my life 
I want to testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie 

Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?

Yes that's him right there 

Are you sure?

Yeah without a doubt 
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I ain't hold no grudge 
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood 

You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before 
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?

Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!

Objection sustained, prosecution next question 

I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour 
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class 
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass 
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass 
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask 
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor 
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure 
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet 
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it 

Is that the moment when he shot him?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah man that's when he popped him 
I was so scared I laid there, played possum 
He started to blast this way, 'til the gat was empty 
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display 
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor 
I can't remember no more, that's all that... 

Okay, okay calm down 
I have no further questions your honor 

Court is now in session, now gettin' back to business 
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness 

Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin' for the case 

Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor 
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it 
It happened so fast, I didn't see a lot of it 
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus 

Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous 
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages 
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]
You lyin' in the stand to get him fryin' in the pan 
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone 
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home 
Was you mad because he came home bangin' your chick [what you talkin' 'bout?]
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin' and shit 
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin' on him 
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him 
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone 
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone 

Man you crazy man I was right there... (Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk...) 

No he wasn't! He's lyin! Fuck you you liar!
Man fuck that he's lyin he wasn't even there man!
(He killed Tyrone man! Fuck that!) No I didn't! 
Man he's lyin' man! He's lyin' 

Order in the court now I'm warning you defense 
Tell your client take it down, matter fact 'proach the bench 
Counsel in my chambers so that we can situate 
Let the jury be excused so they can go deliberate...

Yo man, Mr. Haley what kind of defense is this man!
What you doin' man?! She gon' fuckin' hang me man!
No! Sh-she's got it in for me I'm tellin' you man!
You promised you'd get me off man!

In the case of the State vs. Kirk Jones you heard it 
Both sides testified and the jury reached a verdict 
Guilty! All counts from theft to murder one 
(Huh? Wha-wha-what?! Guilty?!] 
By the time you gettin' out you gon' have a grandson 

Fuck you bitch I'll see you in hell bitch!
Fuck that!! Fuck that!! Fuck, get off me! Fuck you Pat Haley!!
(What?! Get him out of my courtroom!!)
Fuck the judge, fuck everybody!! 
(Baliff, baliff remove him from my courtroom...)
Fuck this shit!! I hope you all burn in hell!!!
You're gonna die bitch!! Fuck you!!!

You will spend the rest of your life in jail for this!
You will be held for contempt of court, and anything else I can find that....",State Vs Kirk Jones,2000

Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing; police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me 
(can I get your autograph?)
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
Security wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob and automatically assume I ain't got no job

Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday

I couldn't live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an onyx, shit
I be serice sippin vodka and tonix
Smokin on a marlboro instead of a newport

That's why kids in trench coats shoot up they schools
And parents out live they kids
And sex, the thing that bring life also take it away
When you say this is a wonderful world, ha-ha-ha-ha

(Sticky Fingaz)
I've seen trees of green, red roses too
I seen 'em bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I've seen skys of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What are wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I've seen friends shaking hands
Sayin' How do you do?
They're really sayin' ""I love you""
I hear babies cryin'
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself

That's bullshit, I would of created it tens years later
Niggas acting up till the guns is heard
I don't hear you poppin' shit now, mums the word

And all you rapping niggas, what, that's all you got
Think you a thug now you doing songs with Pac
Gotta bullet in my stomach doctors scared to remove it
And 25 stitches above my dick to prove it

But I can't die, so I don't wear no vest
I'm like super nigga, gotta SF on my chest
Nigga I'll take a automatic and play Russian roulette
Just to collect, life is short expect my death

Told you once, told you twice
This is the last time you can bop give me a flat line
Even if I bleed to death I can't die
Not even if I fell from ten stories high
Yo, I'ma rule the underground or get shot trying
No matter how many times I get hit with the hot iron

I tried everything swallowed pills slit my wrist
Made my own brother shoot me, X-1 fuckin' missed
Tried to paint the walls with my brain but the gun jammed
At my first shoot out, I stayed everyone ran

I want it raw, and more than ten different women
Locked myself in the garage with the Benz runnin'
As a kid, they had to watch me carefully
Tried to put the blow dryer in the bath with me

Everywhere I go, I hear voices, who calling me
Doc said my brain damaged but I don't see nothing wrong with me
Maybe that's why half the industry won't do a song with me
I walked amongst the dead, talked to punks with lead
An eye for an eye, we can all go blind

All you niggas talking about you ain't scared to die
I feel nigga, 'cause I ain't scared to kill you nigga what
I'ma rule the underground or get shot trying

If your bank is the check cashin' place
If you put on pantyhose instead of shavin' your legs
If you use grease that you used over and over again
If you only go to church on Easter and holidays
Then you ghetto, believe that

[Chorus]
Can you be rich and be ghetto? (Yep)
And just cause you poor do that mean that you ghetto? (Nope)
So people don't understand what it mean to be ghetto
And if you gonna ask then you probably never know

Bein' ghetto, it's just the things we do sometimes
Like hangin' your clothes on the oven to dry
But you late, you gotta go and they ain't ready yet
(You put 'em on anyway, and rock 'em halfway wet)
First you wear then return everything you buy
Always lookin' for a discount 'til the day you die
Got three kids, by three different guys
(And all they need to give you is a Mai Tai and a shot)
You know you ghetto when you use a wrench for a channel changer
No antenna, you gotta use a metal hanger
Drink from the container and put it back in the fridge
(Knowin' damn well the shit was wrong you did)
Put salt on your food, before you even taste it
Get a doggy bag, ghetto niggaz ain't wastin' shit
You know you ghetto, no, you know you grimy
(When you iron dirty pants 'til them shits get shiny)

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

The ghetto's not a place, it don't matter what color you are
You can be white as chalk or as black as tar
And it really don't matter how much money you have
(You can live on Fifth Ave. and be ghetto fab)
You know you ghetto when your soap is the size of Chiclet
Run into the kitchen wet for dishwashin' liquid
The water cold cause they shut off all your power
(You know you ghetto if you pee in the shower)
No toilet paper, somebody used the last you had
No problem, just get a Daily News or a paper bag
Ball it up and crumble it, make it soft in your ass
(But when you flush, the toilet always gets stopped up)
And if you got the money, the landlord never get it
We never pay the rent, yo we almost got evicted
If this shit is funny or offendin' you
(Chances are, it's because you're ghetto too)

Keep my hustle in the street til the day I die

From NY, Southside where guns hide
Shells fly, eyed red, I'm dumb high
Got one eye, you get wet and hung dry
Leave you tongue-tied, mothers watch their young die
Nig' you wan' die?  Fuck a car through run by
I'll be waitin at your crib for my money til the sun die
Six niggaz eat, divided off one pie
A nigga as ill as me is so hard to come by
Squeeze this rap shit til the well run dry
I never spoke to one time not even one time
Look at my brain it's every rapper combined
I'm bout to OD on some shit like Sublime

Who are you to question, how I live
When the whole entire world is negative

Keep my hustle in the street til the day I die

I said you're lookin for trouble if you want his cream
Remember everything ain't what it seem

Can you feel me?  Can you feel me motherfucker?
Can you feel me?  Can you feel me?

You get laughed at and asked that where the mask at

They couldn't change me, too hot, dippin them feds
I made a promise, not to go back to jail
Under my garments, gun tuck, packin that steel
But reguardless, this nigga here is out of the field
Now my partners is only money, that's real
I got my mind made up, my shine ain't up
Until I'm in that casket, my time ain't up
Tell you bout my lifestyle, I'll walk you through

Now peep the hooptie, I'm followed by my crew

I kept it thorough with my ear to the streets
Now we gettin Cash Money without the gold teeth

Half my life in these streets down the drain
Analyze the game through the eyes of my father
Had to feel my way through with the revolver
That goes to tell you he ain't show me nothin
Mad at the world when they ain't owe me nothin
So I apply pressure, why not for more measure
And more cake, we turn hoods to whole states
For my real niggaz, dressed in greens is upstate
Trapped in that cold cell with no bail
We ain't mean to hurt nobody to get them dollars up
Half my niggaz goin dead'll push ya flowers up

They thought they could stop us with probation?

Play the future by the air until it's time to face it

Born the struggle in this jungle, escape poor
While the White House got ten rooms with ten blind doors
I was born to fight for what's right, by the day and night
Prayin for life cause shit ain't tight in these streets
That's why I stay squeezin my heat
And strippin life from mammals
A hungry young hustler ready to gamble
For a better way of livin so fuck sittin in prison
Cause every niggaz a ? victimized by the system

Cause I don't listen - she told me not to cum in her mouth
Thuggin her out, love don't live in this house

Speak my name, better think careful duke

Like when clingin on to life who gon' be there for you?

Get blood on they seats, drive you to the hospital


I got an image to protect and records to sell
Nobody!!! Cause you goin to hell

Besides a one sided story is easy to tell

My poster on the wall only way you see me in jail

Sticky Fingaz nigga, the legend, the myth

Niggaz get shot everytime I shoot the gift



[Chorus]


[X-1]


I banged out in dorms and tore mouths off


While y'all run to cops as soon as it pops off
I can't respect lames when I'm knowin you soft

That's why I feel the pain for my thugs up north

No regrets in this world, not one care

No respect for this world without no peers

They did me wrong for years, I'm finally gettin back

Never sheaded a tear seein niggaz on they back

Lord knows it hurts to put his people in the dirt

Bullet holes in shirts and chumps buried in skirts

Prayin to God is hard, these streets don't play


But you gotta keep up your guard and hope the pain go away

I'm from where they shoot street lights out
And you gotta yell to talk over passin trains

And watch who you fuck with when passin 'cain

Cause them same fists'll get your wrists trapped in chains, nigga



[Chorus]



[Geneveese]

My killers move triggers and set firearms off

Smoke the type of blunts that set fire alarms off

One shot'll blow your face, chest and your arms off

Murderin Guiliani for all the pain that he's causin

Launderin dirty laundry through banks of corporate ?

Shit doctors can only calm me til the drugs wear off

One pump of the sawed-off and your squad'll be hauled off

Dropped her off in the car lock, locked in the trunk of the car

Shit's official, we spittin through government issue

40 automatic pistols rippin through brain tissue

Stuffin coke up wit your bitch I'll piss through

And a black on black lambo, puffin on A Line Of Crystal!
Under our politics, codes of the street


Never negotiate with killers with intentions of breach

Only associate with villains if you willin to bleed
Cause leakin'll get your mother hogtied and brutally beat

Fuck niggaz though it was man?
Right, right, uh-huh
I'ma holla at 'em dog
Nah mean
Got my nigga, Mike be	
South suicide Queens
X-million, bout to tear it down wit my nigga
You know? Stick holla at 'em dog

[Sticky Fingaz]
I'm gettin tired of the war stories, kid I heard 'em all
And before they could fake and make up another one that's false
I'ma take it and break it down, so y'all could knock it off
It's my call, in my corner they too soft
Mr. I-Don't-Give-A-Fuck, don't need much
But heat in the truck, weed in the dutch, beats I'm beatin 'em up
Streetsweepin 'em up, niggaz deals is suckers
More than the game, don't let the fame go to your brain
I'm still in the rain, where lives get caught in the drain
It's nothin to me, niggaz ain't fuckin wit me
I dump at your v and leave you niggaz slumped in your seat
Jump if it's beef, but wolves need somethin to eat
Nigga dollar signs cover my eyes, gucci material
Bottom line, hand on my nine wit no serial
First class flights and TV's is digital

[Chorus]
You could bust guns and get it right homey
Up in the club, we came to get it gully
Smoke weed, drink henny, man get it ugly
Hard liquor for sure, cause we don't pop bubbly
Load up your steel, nigga dump it only
We don't talk, true story, all about our money
From the streets we ride, you know our style homey
If shorty want to bounce wit us then she out homey

[X-1]
Shit, cause it's all official
Load your pistol, I ain't right and I'm sure to hit you
Shoot through walls, you could die with your bitch too
So ladies, get out the way first
You gotta be kiddin dog, I got to spray first, nigga
Turn your promotional van into a hearse
Oh, bitches love the way I sit in the drop, pull up in the spot
They suck cock off the strength of the watch
Lil' homey, and that's alone
Fuck you got guns for if your gats at home?
You need to have 'em on your waste like me
Run, duck, hide from the jake like me
Been around the world on fake ID
I got businesses, shot witnesses
Bottom line: X-1 is hot with this shit

[Columbo]
Yo woozy, googly and cookie
Roofies and usually on two-three
Luny, disrespectful and moody
Stupid, I hate the world I'm too into me
Drink until I throw up and smoke until I tweak
Can't see me settle for less until I peak
Two milly, I'm too willy
Fifty thousand pills a week, I'm too filthy

No more stunts no more lies
No more bitches in my ride
No more all night parties all leave it behind
No more freaks living right
No more drama in the life
From now on its me and my lady just me and my baby

It starts going on tour the first time
Imagine the thoughts going threw a young rappers mind
Knowing your mine and couldn't give a fuck if you leaved
Things I did its hard for my self to believe
That that I'm sitting back thinking about smoking these trees
Girl you right I'm damn near ruined your life
The only one that was there at the end of the night
My vision was wrong guess what my bitch is gone
And you don't want me now that's why I'm flipping this song
Ignoring my calls daily fuckers you trying to scare me
Talking on the machine acting like you you can't hear me
Thuggin' it out to much I think its rap
Sending you gifts but god damn you sending them back
Killing myself like I ain't got know prize
Seeing your your face every time I close my eyes
Damn girl don't let this be the end of the ride

[Chorus]

I've been around the world seen the best of woman
Bitches liking my style I guess it's the thug in them
I'm just living my life with no time to talk to them
Tired of dissing my wife 'cause niggaz we all do it
Hoes calling my cell you cursing about crazy
Got to know that you hate me probably ready to snake me
Like pulling up to the club one night
In my Benz with your friends and about to get right
Them birds they got nerve filling my mouth with words
Telling you that I don't car all night they in ya ear
Fuck what am I suppose to do I'm miles away from home
Heard in your voice your feelings over the phone
Those nights we had fights I tried to keep it calm
Throwing my shit outside on the front lawn
I ain't want when I had you  now I need you that your gone (damn girl)

Bloodstain your album cover before it get wrapped
P-89 your mind, you won't forget that
Caught behind enemy lines, you gonna get clapped
On chase got shot in the face
Nine niggaz, broad to nothin, while the slug judged his fate
Shoulda got low 'steada tryna flossin his cake
Reaction was slow, reflexes way too late
These are warzone niggaz, home sweet home niggaz
Killers ain't afraid of nothin, it's on niggaz

Put chumps to sleep, lay 'em in deathbed

You never saw the nigga face that was holdin the glock
You just heard shots then the nigga next to you dropped
Til you seen blood you ain't even know you got popped
Felt your body temperature change from cold to hot
Left you for dead, you still alive, count your blessings
In the middle of the street holdin in your intestines
All they wanted was the money, you had to be dumb
Jumped for the gun, he blew off and punctured your lung
Your man came back and found you scrollin on the pavement
Grabbed you in his arms and said ""hold on son you gon' make it!""
Your vital signs droppin, your haloucinatin
""Somebody call the ambulance!""  If you live it's amazing
One still in your stomach, two went through your chest
Your boy tellin you ""don't talk son, save your breath""
The more you walk to the light the more it's hurtin less
You gettin nautious from the smell of burnin flesh
Cryin to God, think he can hear you beg?
Tears in your eyes, screamin ""I can't feel my legs!""
You closer to death, paramedics pumpin your chest
Blowin you breath, you dyin but you under arrest
How it feel to see a man dead knowin you next
I guess that's what niggaz meant by blood in the x
Tryin to hang on but you gon' wish you was dead
Cause if you live the rest of your life it's in the feds

It's my suicide letter
At the end of this song I'm gonna blow my fuckin brains out

[Sticky Fingaz]
If you readin this, I'm probly dead by now
Probly ODed and put three in my head by now
I'm on the balcony alone, nobody here to stop me
I should film this and leave Banned From TV a copy
I'm sick of this world and everything that come wit it
Death, life, politics, religion, fuck all of it
Always feel the pain or I'm ignorin it
Could barely see the love but all we need more of it
Yeah right, like that's gonna happen
They workin on the next nuclear weapon
Niggaz still starvin, niggaz still robbin
It's no money that's when you have mo' problems
I wanted a son but that was the past
Cause to tell the truth I don't think this world gon' last
And I'm not a quitter nigga, I ain't givin up
I'm just ready to move on son, I had enough

Live or die, it's my life
I may, I might, it's my time
? or shine, it's my ?
So say goodbye, it's my life

[Sticky Fingaz]
I can't recall anything fore the age of five
Far back as I could remember, had the lazy eye
All the shit I been through and I stayed alive
But today feel like a good day to die
Felt it before but it's hard to say goodbye
Felt like I'm talkin to myself when I pray to the sky
Like they took my faith and created a lie
Don't try to talk me out of it, I made up my mind
I'm a man, I meant no cry for help
So I'ma have to start the revolution by myself
I'm losin it, too much goin on in my head
Statistically speakin, I'm supposed to be dead
Made a crew of wild niggaz goin to war for 'caine
Decorate the walls in ya building wit ya brain
Strugglin in the hood, I know too well
But why to get to heaven nigga gotta go through hell?

With the beast out running
Pretty girl I think you're stunning
I'd like to take you home

The water is free but the taps stopped running
Pretty girl I think you're stunning
Just suck it in tongue and cheek

Because the river runs deep
Yes the river runs deep

I took all my name
I decided to tell
I'd take my own life
Just to see you in hell
But I'm alive
Nobody heard you fell
So I threw you a line
Down a dark wishing well
I heard a noise draw dark aloof
I'm blind but better off than you my friend
But I will need you in the end
A blur got sharp and loud and true
My minds made up, I'm here for you my friend
'Cause you will need me in the end

'Cause I will need you in the end
Will need you in the end
Immortal air in a fresh cool morning
I need to be there when you wake
To the sound of me speaking peace
For the devil in your sleep
Haunted by the ghost of the man I used to be

Birds fly away into the clouds of unknowing
Titans of Aphrodite they show not when you're coming

I don't know if it's the pretty face or the expensive taste
That got everybody wantin' to touch me like Case
Feels So Good like Mase, to pull over
Anywhere I want, diplomats on the Rover
The way I put it on a nigga sober
I have 'em comin' back, knockin' on my door like Johovas
Ya'll already know that Charli's in charge
Weekly massage, platnuim and gold cars
Money stashed in NY to Witchitaw
And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are
Aggy, cause they baby daddy want to bag me
That's why I never leave home without the 44
Ya'll hoes can't do nothin' to me

Pinned up in what?

And it ain't that I'm stuck on myself, I'm really hot

I need Jet Ski's in mind, can't tease a dime
Lookin' in the mirror, feeling pleased with the shine

Wear the ice on the bra of my chest
When the money ain't right I go far to the left
Niggas want to play games then Charli direct
want to Long Kiss Goodnight, don't hold ya breath
Bitches know I'm the shit with my MAC lipstick
Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator
Shoes alligator, my bag is too
If I was broke like you, I would be mad like you
But you can come work for Charli, a boss with a body
Ask anybody, I could take over Gotti
Poo by the poo while you just another hottie
Niggas roll bricks that'll stay if it's notty

Cause shit for no Charli will be in the breifcase
Yeah Long Kiss Goodnight, Baltimore get it right
For the cash, pop out the window and shoot through the ice
Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here
Check it, and I don't get by with nothin' I can't leave in 30 seconds
But my kids, they think mommy a teacher
They don't know, for the love of this
I make the whole world tre' dough
Bingo, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen
Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said ""Hi""
Bet he won't fail you no more, one more ""F"" and he die
Even with my nails done, I can take guns apart son
So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un
Dealt with birds, but I had to move on
But for none of these I tatto the little P-pac on my arm
Ask Un how the ones be when he advance me dough
So I put out mines and tell dawg keep yours yo

Stieber Twins,"Hier kommen drei MC's, bekannt für Rap-Parts, die Stil haben
Samy Deluxe, Luxus Chris und Maximilian!

Viele Rapper kommen nicht voran in ihren Texten
Es ist, wie wenn ein DJ immer nur mit einer Zeile backspinnt
Mit einer Zeile backspinnt, mit einer Zeile backspinnt
Wir bleiben live in Action
Wir sind wie Show & AG angekommen auf dem nächsten Level
Also nick' zum Beat und lass dich von den Texten fesseln
Wir studieren den Musikmarkt, planen unsere Invasionen
Denn dort ging Hip Hop verloren, und es gibt Props als Finderlohn
Viele behandeln Rap heutzutage wie 'n Leihwagen
Achten nicht auf echte MC's, wie uns, die das Leid tragen
Wollen nach kurzen Fahrten lieber in anderen Sparten einparken
Und schnell noch Miss Afrotrap auf 'ne Spritztour einladen
Und wo sie heiraten läuft hier überall die Hochzeit
Und danach stehen noch mehr dieser Lackaffen im Spotlight
Die nix andres verkörpern können als Glamour und Luxus
Hip Hop ist schutzlos, du siehst, dass er zerstört wird, aber guckst bloß
So sieht's aus! Täter konnten fliehen, blieben anonym
Fingen an sich rapmässig anzuziehen, hüpften wie mit Trampolin
Meinen, dass sie Leute animieren, aber verlieren nur Kalorien
Sagen nichts wie Pantomimen, Musik ist nicht da, um sie anzuziehen
Hör lieber hin, erkenn wer die Erfinder, und wer die Diebe sind
Wir sind die Effektiveren: Samy, Max und die Stieber Twins

Yeah! Die euch den echten Rap wiederbringen (wo seid ihr?)
Genauso so real sind wie ihre Lieder klingen
Maximilian (Hamburg), Maximilian, Maximilian

Ich lag im Fieber mit Malaria, vollgepumt mit Lariam
Visionen wie Mohammed, als er am Berge Hira war
Raps kamen inflationär wie der serbische Dinar
Check Samy Deluxe, Chris, Mar und Maximilian
Das Leben ist mehr, als Mics, Beats und Samsemilla
Dolce Vita, Deutschmarks und Senoritas
Auch wir lieben das, nur nichts währt ewig
Das Geschäft ist schnelllebig, doch Geld macht behäbig
Was über den Äther geht ist bestenfalls medioker
Ich geb keinen Eurocent auf Eurotrashbands im Medienpoker
Die Charts mit ihrem Scheiß erobern
Zeit, dass wir Styles anfordern
Wollt ihr Cyphers oder Seifenopern?
Hypokrisis im Hip Hop Bizz bringen die Scene in Misskredit
Wisst ihr was 'n Bitchmove is?
Sich mit fremden Federn schmücken, was?
Ins Licht der Szene rücken, was? Sich für die Medien bücken, was?
Beißen wollen wie Tse-Tse Mücken
Der Shit macht mich krank wie Malaria
Ihr habt mehr als nur Musik auf dem Gewissen wie Frank Farian
Wir scheinen, aber blenden nicht, reflektieren und spenden Licht
Aber brennen mit Esperanto international verständlich!
Also holt euch den Scheiß, weil auch Freundeskreis um die Fäulnis weiß

„Seid ihr bereit für die Stieber Twins?“

Konstruier mein Rapkonzept am Reissbrett wie Architekt
Vergiss dein Papi, der sein Ferrari in der Garage pflegt
Ich geh' zu Steve, der für Kies auf der Straße breakt
Hip Hop lebt, wenn sich auch dein Arsch mitbewegt
Stieber Twins und Mad Max, präziser wie Skinny Caps
Mit Metro schneller, als Stars in Yellow Cabs
Vergiss mal Midi, Synthi, Presets
Ich komm wie Grandmaster Caz mit Klartext auf Crossbacks
Scheiß auf Gesellschaft, in der nur der lacht
Der die Brüder Grimm tausendfach auf Tasche hat
Ach, deine Prachtyacht am Mittelmeer, millionenschwer
Umzäunt von Stacheldraht, weil Armut lange Finger macht
Ey, Yuppi mit Golfhobby, dir fehlt Profil, Mann, genau wie Dunlop
Die ohne Pit Stops durchs Ziel fahren
Chris und Maximilian beobachten wie Sielmann
Tiger, wie Shirkan, die wegen Zebras am Nil waren
Überleg! Deine DNA ist seit diesem Jahr veränderbar
Wie Bomber der USA das Klima in Hiroshima
Doch eins ist klar, egal, ob dein Scheiß oben oder unten war
Evergreens sind immer da, der Rest Drosophila
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ich sag, drei MC's, die schon seit Jahren lodern (lodern)
Die ihre Hörer Live on Stage erobern
Es wird Zeit, dass wir Styles anfordern
(Was?) wollt ihr Cyphers oder Seifenopern?

I'm just
Kicking up a racket

Unless you turn the knobs up full

I like

The lights keep changing to only their hum
And standing in line along the kerb
The binbags wait till the morning comes
You hear yourself walk echo lonely
See shadows move in every door
Are you sure that's your own footsteps behind?
Is there really nothing to turn round for?

[Chorus]
And you feel that you're always gonna walk the city streets all on your own
The night is dark as a car crawls by
And the road goes on and on
They don't care about you
They never even think about you
'Cause they're gonna do without you, and you're gone

Just another big city night

Over your shoulder, round every corner
Remember what's happened to people you've known
Watch for yourself 'cause no-one else will
You're gonna get it if you're alone
Suddenly a stab from a knife out of nowhere
Jumped from behind like they always do
It only makes one line in the paper you read
Somebody got it, but it wasn't you

Is tossed by waves of sound and up on music loud
When all at once it gets too much

Someone's falling down
Someone's falling down
Because she can't stand no more
Someone's falling down

She says her mother kicked her out
She's got no name and no home to telephone
She's hitching rides and sleeping out
But she's OK with nowhere else to go
So what else can you do but simply pick her up
And watch her simply walk away
Does no-one care enough you know it's not enough

Knew it couldn't be forever

And then found something all our own

Just a case of touch and go

When we'd got that usual block out of the way

That had been hidden for so long
Like switch a light on in the dark

And ever since I've sought the sheer release I've found
In the explosion of electrifying sound
That hits and lifts me off the ground
The jolt & jangle of live wires

I want to hear the 2 guitar clash [etc]

Oh can you hear it, I want to feel it, I want to be it 'cause its real

And keeps you on the ground

The human shield protects your heart from being ground down

Dreams will all be shattered and your hopes dashed on the ground

Could this all be a dream
So what I'll live my dream

No easy answers when the question is self doubt


Better wrong than silent gotta let your feelings out



",Stand up and Shout,1994
Stiff Little Fingers,"Always seems to be same round here
Town full of losers all crying in their beer
Nobody's willing to take any chance
Drown your brain in the rave machine dance, boy dance
You got one last shot here to change your world
Yeah, one last push just might make it work
But you sit on your arse watch your life drift by
Lookin' at you, tell me, should I laugh or cry
Why can't you realize it's all gone wrong
Why can't you see who's laughing now

[Chorus]
Baby blue baby blue
What have they been telling you?
Baby blue baby blue
What have they been telling you?

Ever day you toe the same tired line
Slave to your past you just serve your time
Stand and watch as it falls apart
They've taken your mind, your will and your heart
You got one last shot here to change your world
Yeah, just get out and make it work
But you're much too scared to take the risk
In case they put your name on their endangered list
Why can't you see that it has all been lies?
Why can't you hear them laughing now?

[Chorus x2]
I'm not the sort of man
To just leave well alone
I feel we're all owed
So much more

Now they're telling us the world's gone wrong
In fact it's been like that all along
Not just the ozone but the black coal seam
We're left with the sour milk 'cause there's no more cream
This is our last shot to change the world
Yeah, our last effort to make it work
But they are much too scared to commit their wealth
It's time to force some international health
When will they realize that now's too late?
I guess they never will somehow

Stiff Little Fingers,"Sometimes it's fine
Sometimes I know just what it's all worth
Sometimes it's fine
Sometimes it feels like Heaven on Earth
Then other times you scream at me
The hate freezes your soul
And it's cold
It feels so cold
It's so cold
It's cold

Sometimes we smile
Sometimes we sit there and laugh out loud
Sometimes we smile
Sometimes I'd try to seek you out in a crowd
Then other times I'd run a mile
Than see your face again
And it's cold
It feels so cold
It's so cold
It's cold

Sometimes we talk
Sometimes we reason everything out
Sometimes we talk
Sometimes I wonder what we argue about
Then other times I see the hate
The stubbornness that's your role
And it's cold
It feels so cols
It's so cold
It's cold

But I won't cry
No, I won't cry
I won't cry
I won't cry, anymore

Sometimes we fight
Sometimes we stand toe to toe and shout
Sometimes we fight
Sometimes I want to get up and get out
The other times you smile at me
And arguments seem so old
It's not cold
It's not so cold
No, it's not cold
Not cold",Cold,1994
Stiff Little Fingers,"Well you snap to attention
And pay heed to what they say
'cause you know
That you please them all that way
And you don't need to think now
'cause your mind has gone astray
And they'll do your thinking anyway
And your head is full of ideas
That don't mean a thing

With your new sense of duty
And your brain washed shiny clean
It's time
To take your part in the parade
Yet you sound like your father
And I don't want to be mean
But did
You never want to break away?
And your head is full of answers
With no questioning
And your life is very simple
You won't let the outside in

(Chorus):
Won't you tell me
Why won't you get a life?
Are you scared of what feels right?
Won't you help me
Reach the meaning of you

Well it's hard for me
To understand how this can be
You're the same age as me
Yet you're older by years

Repeat vs 1

So I won't try to change you
You can carry on that way
But I hope
You come back to life one day



",Get a Life,1994
Stiff Little Fingers,"I don't know how to say
I think that we should call it a day
It's easy to be your slave
But that's not the way that I want to behave

Believed you when you lied
Could stop you if I tried
Now I reach out for you just to stay alive

[Chorus:]
I want you

Won't miss you if you go
I'd kiss you adios amigo
Because now I understand
You make me an embarrassing man

Who people see as weak
Yet you play upon my greed
I wish you didn't satisfy my needs

Lost count of the times
I've forgotten my lines
And everyone laughed at the fool
So I put you on hold
Although it turns me cold
I'm sick of you calling the tune

I can't say this is the end
Because if we're no longer together
So I'm telling you ""never again""
Though I know that forever

[Chorus:]
I'll want you
I want you

",I Want You,1994
Stiff Little Fingers,"You feel the damp in the evening air
You see them standing you feel them stare
You hear their insults you can hear them shout
You try to answer but no words come out
Your face gets hotter as the anger rise
You can see excitement in their eyes
As they free their aggression in the usual way
It's easier to fight
Harder just to walk away

The streets are empty as you're going home
You got your collar turned up against the cold
You're tired and hungry and and you're fit to drop
The rain is pouring won't it ever stop
You hear the voice from the alleyway
Saying:



",Walk Away,1994
Stiff Little Fingers,"I'm sick of being pushed around
I'm tired of being forced back down
So all your dreams and your ambitions
Lie there on the floor
What if I want more
What if I want more
What if I want more
What if I want more

I'm fed up hearing



",What If I Want More?,1994
Stiff Little Fingers,"Don't pity this poor immigrant
My eyes were open when I caught the boat
All I wanted was your shelter
And maybe just a little hope
But you turned your anger on me
For the courage that you lack
I don't want your half assed freedom
You can have the whole deal back
So now I'll tell you something
Let's get this straight from the start
Don't call me Harp

As the rain pours down and freezes on the ground
Lean against a street light
Try to work out where it all went wrong
I can see you in my mind's eye
I have no choice
I can hear you in the wild wind
I hear your voice
Your voice

Can't believe it's over
I can't believe that I walked out the door

Led me to believe I knew the score
I can see you in reflections

I'd change my mind

One day we were there and now we are gone
I wish that you'd forgive me

Can't believe I'm so stupid
I would not see
That you never gave up trying
Or loving me

If you didn't want me back
No I couldn't blame you now

I'll dance to the beat, shuffle my feet wear a shirt and tie

Blind to the ways of mankind

Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto living second rate
And your eyes will see a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway

You'll admire all the number book takers
The pimps the pushers and the big money makers
Driving great big cars spending twenties and tens
And you want to grow up to be just like them
Smugglers scramblers burglars gamblers
Pickpocket pedlars even panhandlers
You say I'm cool I'm no fool
But then you end up dropping right outa school

Arise!

You've listened to too many liars too long
And too many were your masters
You've got the chance here to right all the wrong
Don't squander it on disaster
You're standing in a bright new dawn
Got hope and belief enough for everyone
Got the opportunity in your hand
Now use it while you can

Arise!

People have written you off many times
But you are a great survivor
And though you have suffered some terrible crimes
I know it's just made you stronger
You're standing on your own two feet
Got a morbid past but you've got it beat
Got the key for living sitting in your hand
Now use it while you can

Chorus:
You've got to hold on
To how you feel today
This is the last train from the wasteland

Arise!

And cynics will tell you there's problems ahead
But you go ahead and solve them
They'll fill you with doubt and suspicion and dread
But your strength can overcome them
You got to face the critics down
Any fool can give in but you can't bow down
You got too many lives and futures in your hand
So save them while you can

(Chorus)

And every road that I've walked down
I know your streets I know your towns
I think I know the way you feel
So stand up strong and proud
Fear is not the answer
Arise!

And though this is only the start I know
How long they have kept you waiting
No matter how far down the road you go
The first few steps, a new beginning
So grab the future with both hands
Nobody said it'd be the promised land
But you can make it better than it's ever been
So change it while you can

(Chorus x2)

Arise!

Last train
Last train
Last train
Last train
Arise!



",Last Train from the Wasteland,1999
Stiff Little Fingers,"When you're facing up to trouble
And your mind has drawn a blank
You've no money in your pocket
Even less stashed in the bank
When your friends seem to desert you
And your family's offside
Want to leave this mess behind you
Want to run away and hide

[Chorus:]
Then I want it
Got to have it
Hope is all I need

If you feel you're left in darkness
If you feel you're on your own
And the smallest of you problems
Seems to turn up fully grown
Don't give up on your tomorrow
'cause you know you'll reach the dawn
Just spit in the eye of trouble
'Til your suffering has gone

He's drinkin' supermarket cider
In a doorway in the town
And he's shouting 'bout the government
And how they let him down
He's got a sister lives in Brixton
Always tried to do her best
Yet she winds up broke and shafted
Just the same as all the rest

He's got a torn and greasy greatcoat
And a New York Yankees vest
And some strongly held opinions
That he must get off his chest
Yet his friends don't think about him
They all gave him up for dead
And they all got real embarrassed
About the problems with his head

Chorus:

Shout it out! (Shout it out with me)
Shout it out! (It's a mystery)
Shout it out! ('cause what I can't see)
Why he's invisible to them
Yet so obvious to me

He make his home in cardboard boxes
And the pigeons are his friends
And you cross over to avoid him
Never try to make amends
For the way that he's been treated
And we all must share the blame
And we never look him in the eye
And never ask his name

I thought we were past this stage
Never in this day and age
These things are still going on
Tell me where did we go wrong
I thought we had changed for good
Maybe I misunderstood
Does our new and caring nation
Only care for politicians
Those that have will all do well
All the rest can go to hell

(Chorus x2)

Stiff Little Fingers,"Gill and Galloway were working late
On a summers night in '58
In a small town Alabama hideaway
In the U.S.A.
The two cops were knocking on the door
Of a young black boy
It was a quarter to four
They said:
""Hey nigger! Hit the floor.
You're about to be history.""

Pop Bickham was the young black man
He couldn't work it out, he didn't understand
But when they come with their guns you do what you can
So he picked up his rifle and he shot them down
They said he killed them in cold blood
And the jury they agreed
They said: ""you'll be sorry for what you've done""
And the whole town they agreed

Chorus:
They picked you up and they sent you down
A poor black boy in a rich white town
And for 38 years you never made a sound
That was half a life away

You see one of the cops had something to hide
He'd raped Pop's sister more than once or twice
And Pop wasn't going to let it go this time
So the cops had to take him out
But the courtroom didn't hear all of the story
They held back facts from the all white jury
No doubt what the verdict would be
Take him down, he's guilty

(Chorus)

All these years in a prison cell
Never once complaining
Half your life gone to hell
All because of hatred and bigotry
You're a better man than me

But somewhere in your life
You've got someone who cares

Chorus:
And I'll speak those honeyed words
Yeah, I'll speak those honeyed words

That you won't be beaten
And if you start to waver
Or you start to shake
Just stand up and be counted

So you're living on a false reputation
You're a big man in this town
And it seems by your own estimation
That you're a character of renown

Your facade's defective
Yet it's what's expected
When you're really just the same as all of us

Whole lives lived under the burden
The strain of the buying age
Believe me I know it for certain
That you can break from the cage
By holding your head high
Get a little self pride
Self respect on your side
And you'll find that all the doors fly open wide

(Chorus)

And all the problems at your door
Don't let them bother you no more
Just take them all down one by one
You'll find they fall apart
If you face them with head and heart
And what was hard doesn't seem so hard no more

No Love No Charity

Inside you've forgotten the decency
We were both taught
You've made your choice
And now I can give you

Won't deal in dreams I've put them all aside
And I believe I've changed for good

You whip me up when I'm feeling lazy
You tantalise I'm hypnotised tonight

And though it might seem ideal
I worry that it isn't real
It's on my mind all the time
Feeling fine is that a crime?

I won't listen to the people
Who tell me it's wrong to feel this way
They don't feel the way I feel

Now it seems my brain's on fire

Yet no-one saw and no help came
And no-one wants to take the blame

Will get round to you later

Put the bastards underground
Buried every black in town
Who dared to raise his voice

Yet something makes them stand and shout
One day they will find you out
Dig up every fact in town
And shove them in your face

Hearts a-bubble in the rubble

Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Well, barbed wire love snags my jeans

Caught when not suspecting vice
The night was rife with wasteland life
You set my arm alight

All you give me is barbed wire love (doo-doo-doo-doo)
All caught up in barbed wire love (doo-doo-doo-doo)

Blasted by your booby-traps
I felt the blow in both knee-caps
Your eyes did shine, your lips were fine
The device in your pants was out of site

Stiff Little Fingers,"Don't think of tomorrow, do it today
Let's live our lives in yesterday
The lies you're spreading were dangerous then
I can't watch you spread them all again
You tell me we're more equal then other men I know
But your advice just can't be right and can't be left to grow

It's hard to reason, it's hard to see
Why you never learn from history
You came downtrodden and you learned to walk
And now you want to march before you talk
You're looking for a scapegoat a victim or a fool
And though you're free now that don't mean
You've freedom to be cruel

(Chorus:)
Don't give me opinions when you can't understand truth
I can't listen to a word you say, you haven't any proof
I believe in standing up for what I think is true
But you hand me all this hatred and I just can't believe in you

You're being twisted, you're being used
And you'll never see my point of view
You're kicking back now but can't you see
That what you're kicking ain't your enemy
You're taking easy answers, believing age old lies
Though once oppressed you're like the rest
And just as much despised

(Chorus)

Tell me all your problems, how you never got a break
And now you're free, you're telling me
That what you see you'll take

It's all so stupid, it's all so sad
That you've had to have the life you've had
That system's gone now, everything has changed
And there's no-one left to take the blame
You've got to start rebuilding, rewriting your own rules
Get it right don't end up like those bullet headed fools

(Chorus)

Just passing time beneath the lights
Up in town and all alone
Got no business so minds his own

He might as well go for a stroll
Idly looking in a hi-fi shop
Footsteps, a chuckle, and one hard slap

And they didn't even see his face
See him flinch or hear him groan
They didn't even see his eyes
One mean blow and on they ran

He put his fingers to his side
And felt his flesh was open wide
He felt the rent the blow had made
For the hand that fell had held a blade

And they didn't even see his face
See him stumble, hear his cry
They didn't even see his eyes
Just lashed out in passing by

What can it mean?
Who can make some sense of that?
Did it mean a thing to them?
What can make a mind like that?

Those forty stitches helped him over
Who can live life over his shoulder?
He tried to put it in his past
And flew safe home back to Belfast

You give me all your theories on life
How nothing that I say ever matters
And nothing that I do's ever right

You care for nothing at all

This is no laughing matter

You seem to have no spark only boredom
You seem to have no interest at all
You seem to think you're better than others
You seem to be just ripe for a fall
Sometimes I just want to smack your face
Sometimes I don't care at all

Nothing gets through at all

I'll show them all what fools we have been

",No Laughing Matter,2003
Stiff Little Fingers,"
It was a different world back then
Though not so long ago
I thought I understood most men
And now I just don't know
For all that I thought myself smart
I can't fix the rupture and break
In my achilles' heart

And all the certainties I had
Here all been washed away
It seems my world was built on sand
It vanished in a day
With all my beliefs torn apart
And I'm left with now are the shards
(of) my achilles' heart

What seemed like dreams are really nightmares
What seemed like fiction's really real
When my brain won't take in what my eyes say they've seen
Then we've surely reached the end

So although life must soldier on
A way of living now has gone
A right to freedom and to be
Has been denied to you and me
It's difficult but we must start
To undo the damage that's done
To our Achilles' heart

I saw a dead man walking
And he smiled at me
As he went on his way

And then he sang a song
Full of loss and longing
That's could break your day or make your day

In a crowd of laughing people laughing?

I saw a dead man walking
And he smiled at me
As he went on his way

I'm hurt and I'm bleeding and I'm really scared
I don't wanna go back outside
Cause the bigboys are waiting and they'll get me one more time

And if we can't protect the weak
How can we call ourselves strong
Is the assurance that they seek
So beyond us all

Help me, someone, is anyone there?
This man asked directions and I said I'd help
Now I'm tied up and all alone
And I don't think he ever plans to let me
Go back home

And if we can't protect the young
How can we call ourselves grown
They place their trust in anyone
Only to lose it all

And when it happens we seem so surprised
Like we've not seen it all before
We wring our hands & cry
What do they do it for
What do they do it for
What do they do it for

Broken fingers & the phones too far
Can't even think now why I opened the door
Robbed and battered I've lost all pride
There was only enough cash to see that I got by

And if we can't protect the old
How can we call ourselves civilized?
And is the comfort they deserve
So difficult to provide?

I won't acquiesce take second best I'm never satisfied
'cause there's a fire inside won't be denied
And I'm still burning see you'll never put the spark out in my soul
Still burning and injustice builds a bonfire in my core
Still burning.

If I turn my back on all the honesty you lack
Would that make me more mature?
By pretending to be blind, and accepting all your lies
I'd be giving in for sure
I won't acquiesce or take second best
I'm never satisfied 'cause there's a fire inside won't be denied
And I'm still burning you'll never put the spark out in my soul
Still burning and injustice build a bonfire at my core
Still burning

Yet we can still lock a man away for 19 years
Having denied him the use of witness statements
That might have cleared his name
And we call that justice?

That what I did was right

That had long been missing
Yeah you brought out a passion
That you never stopped giving

And if music seems mundane
It's 'cause the companies get their own way
And all the young bands seem to say

So thanks for giving me my creed
I'll try to stay onside
Why'or helping me to dare to dream
After all this time

I still agree with what your saying

Who died and made you Elvis?
Who died and made you Elvis?
Who died and made you King?

So you believe your press
You think you're the greatest thing convinced you're the big Tam'

There's something you should know about
And it's time you got it straight, I hope I'm not too late so

Who died and made you Elvis?
Who died and made you Elvis?
Who died and made you King?

Who died?
Who cashed their chips in and left you in charge?
Who died and made you king?

Now in the scheme of things
You're no more important than that guy standing next to you.
So stand up straight
And be what you ought to be and not what you think you are

Just be yourself
There's a lot more you'd get if you'd

The key to freedoms said to be, release and leave the memory
Think you offended me? Please, with critics like these who needs an enemy?
Indeed a breed of pedigree beast unleashing speech telepathy
Here to bleed the industry of its diseased and evil effigy
Demons, thieving, greed and revelry, we're in need and seeking remedy
But it seems to stay ten feet ahead of me like a centipede
I'm a train upon a track, I'm a flame upon a match
Ain't straying from my place I want my face upon the map
I'm the weight upon your back, I'm a razor on your lap
We came to conquer, stage and opera, fade it onto black
Now hush, hear the voice, so addicted to the
Rush to fill the void, missing everything we
Love to feel joy, build it up then we
Crush, kill, destroy

Jump up, but you're stunned, dumb struck, you're done like Young Buck post Fifty
We claw at the morons, and pour on the soothing hooks on heaters
Like them pouring the Boron on core on the shore of Fukushima
They adore the recordings and we lording it over them
Think we're joking? Then we're going door to door with some Dobermans

And I never saw you bend a knee
To any man
But you were never short of brothers
There was always someone
Holding out a helping hand
Well, I remember the summer
We were riding to a show
And our road went on forever
So we were riding nice and slow
And then I heard the band play
And the sun broke through the sky
It was a fine day for a funeral ya
But I never wanted you to die
No one ever wanted you to die
We were watching at the crossroads
When I saw you wiping out
Some metal box just slipped down
Right into the side of you
I was screaming
I was screaming
I was screaming
But nothing was coming out
They always said you were
A dark horse
Because you rode the land alone
But you know I think the real reason
That you were always riding home
And your road goes on forever
The sun will always shine
One day we'll be together
When we cross the final line

we went so high we couldn't stop
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere

How could we know the right would turn-out bad

Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday

Stig Rossen,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Stig Rossen,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1994
Stig Rossen,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,1997

He found the starry sky one night, a secret he will keep
There is a house next to the station
It's not abandoned any more
You see the lights up at the station
Somebody's living there for sure
No one's ever stayed inside up there till dawn arrives
There was some damage to the spacecraft
So now they're stuck in outer space
Something went wrong down at the lift-off
Two billion miles or more away

so they may be back in June...""

Out in the garden,
I'm picking roses, how could he not
The more he picked and the more he pulled,
Until I gathered an apron full.

She climbed on yonder hill above
To give a rose unto her love.
She gave him one, she gave him three
She gave her heart for company.

And as they sat on yonder hill
His heart grew hard, so harder still.
He has two hearts instead of one.
She says, 'young man, what have you done? '

'how foolish, foolish you must be
To think I love no one but thee.
The world's not made for one alone,
I take delight in everyone.'

A stony pillow for his head.
He lay his head down, no word he spoke

Like an acrobat
And make my way to
What's there
I will get dressed
Again, in spite of all
With a laziness
Of a circus
Before or after the performance
As I'm walking down the many stairs
Remembering my stunts all over
Remembering I'm sick and like to die
I will be
The only not mad woman in the park
I will be
What's left of longing on this earth
It took two weeks to lead up to this agony
The time without you is so slow
And thirty years to spot the enemy

About what and why and how and when

In all, nothing was right

It looked like it was going to be fine

Cathedral. Daylight. Establishing it's beauty in elevation, stain
Glass and stone carvings. From its huge doors suddenly comes a
Flow of white cloud choir boys. Angelic, white surplussed, all
Bobbing in a disciplined stream. But then, suddenly in their
Midst, startling, ridiculous, incongruous is Martin a young man
In an ill fitting rain coat. As the boys proceed in their orderly
Way, Martin is left alone. Peculiar, disturbing. Which one...
Which one will it be? 

Two. Interior. An office near the Cathedral. Daylight. A view of
The Cathedral through the window. Alone, in this Dickensian
Office above the small printing presses, sits Mr. Bates, middle
Aged, meticulous, writing with a gold barreled fountain pen. He's
Finishing a little verse beneath a picture of an angel: 

Although we all must sometimes stumble
As we journey through this life,
I've never heard you moan or grumble,
The perfect mother and wife.
Bates places the sheet of paper on top of a pile of similar
Sheets, his face heavy with contempt. He stares into the middle
Distance. A framed photograph of a lively, attractive young
Woman, Patty, his daughter, is in front of him, on his expanse of
Desk. He glances at it. He caps his fountain pen, neatly puts the
Sheet into the pending tray, neatly lines up his blotter, his
Desk aids, and satisfied, rises to join the homeward throng.

You've got to be a, you've got to be a man.

Sting,"Young men, soldiers, nineteen fourteen
Marching through countries they'd never seen
Virgins with rifles, a game of charades
All for a children's crusade
Pawns in the game are not victims of chance
Strewn on the fields of Belgium and France
Poppies for young men, death's bitter trade
All of those young lives betrayed
The children of England would never be slaves
They're trapped on the wire and dying in waves
The flower of England face down in the mud
And stained in the blood of a whole generation
Corpulent generals safe behind lines
History's lessons drowned in red wine
Poppies for young men, death's bitter trade
All of those young lives betrayed

Sting,"There were rooms of forgiveness 
In the house that we share 
But the space has been emptied 
Of whatever was there 
There were cupboards of patience 
There were shelf loads of care

Found nobody there 
After today  consider me gone 

Roses have thorns and shining waters mud 
And cancer lurks deep in the sweetest bud 
Clouds and eclipses stain the moon and the sun 
And history reeks of the wrongs we have done 
After today, consider me gone 

I've spent too many years at war with myself 
The doctor has told me it's no good for my health

But to look for heaven is to live here in hell

Sting,"The sun sets across the ocean
I'm a thousand mile from anywhere
And my pocketbook in my heart

Feels like somebody's face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe 
Got a plastic Jesus, a cordless telephone for every corner of my room 
Got everybody but you tellin' me what to do 

Well I've been down so long
It can't be that much longer still
And I've been down for so long
That the end must be drawing near

So long as it's somebody else's dime""
Cause if you're the top of the bottom
It all feels the same
We live out of fear if we're too rich or we're too poor
Guess all I can do is muster up some change
And a little bit of faith
And take some dignity when I walk through this door 

Gonna take a trip
Catch a train
Got a ticket in my hand
And then a fat man takes my money
And like cattle we all stand
I'm just a faceless body lost in this vast and worthless sea
In a thousand people I do not know
But really they are no different from me
They all have passion
They all have fear
They all have intense confusion
And no sweet moments that are clear
They all have aspirations

This situation was not of your picking
You say that this wasn't in your plan

Tied to a chair, and the bomb is ticking

Pay for love but the hate comes free
Bring enough money for the rest of your life

Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet 
While there's a moon over bourbon street 

It was many years ago that I became what I am 
I was trapped in this life like an innocent lamb 
Now I can never show my face at noon

I've the face of a sinner but the hands of a priest 
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet 
While there's a moon over bourbon street 

She walks everyday through the streets of New Orleans 
She's innocent and young from a family of means 
I have stood many times outside her window at night 
To struggle with my instinct in the pale moonlight 
How could I be this way when I pray to god above 
I must love what I destroy and destroy the thing I love

Pursued its fleeting, fluttering significance
While he suffered its seeming less meaninglessness
And lived in seeming madness

And who walked in secret the last turn of the labyrinth
Ruination!

The golden trail was blazed
And I was reminded
Of the eternal, of ship men and their stars
For a day I could breath once more and live
And face existence
Without the need to suffer torment,
Fear, or shame

A 40 year-old accountant had lost his bid 
To collect 38 dollars in damages from a cocktail waitress
Who broke a date with him

Judge Richard Figoney ruled yesterday in small claims court against Tom Hosley
Who sought the money from Alison Cheeselet, 31
Because she had backed out on a date to accompany him to the theater
Mr. Hosley said he drove 35 miles from his home in Campbell to San Francisco
To pick up Ms. Cheeslet and was upset that 
She had not called him before he left home to tell him the date was off

Judge, explaining his decision, said,
""The promise to engage in a social relationship for one evening 
In exchange for affection 
And all one evening at the theater
Is an impossible ?
? involving a contract.""

Mr. Hosley had presented the cardboard
Broken heart at the theater

I said to my baby this sounds like the ticket for you and I 
It said volunteers wanted for a very special trip 
To commune with Mother Nature on a big wooden ship 
We took a taxi to the river in case any places were free 
There was an old guy with a beard 
And every kind of creature as far as the eye could see 

This old guy was the boss  he said  ""I won't tell you no lie 
But there's more to this journey than is apparent to the eye"" 
He said he'd heard God's message on the radio 
It was going to rain forever and he'd told him to go 
""I'll protect you all don't worry I'll be father to you all 
I'll save two of every animal,  no matter how small 
But I'll need some assistants to look after the zoo 
I can't see nobody better so you'll just have to do"" 
I said, ""Just tell me something before it's too late and we're gone 
I mean just how safe is this boat we'll be on?"" 

""It's Rock steady, Rock steady 
Rock steady, Rock steady 
Rock steady, Rock steady 
Rock steady, Rock steady"" 

It rained for forty days and forty long nights 
I'd never seen rain like it and it looked like our old friend 
Was being proved right 
We had no time to worry though there was just too much to do 
Between the signified monkey and the kangaroo 
We had to wash all the animals we had to feed them too 
We were merely human slaves in a big floating zoo 
She said, ""Hey baby I don't mean to be flip 
But it seems this old man is on some power trip"" 
I said, ""No,  no sugar you must be wrong 
I mean look at the size of this boat we're on. 
We're as safe as houses, as safe as mother's milk 
He's as cool as November and as smooth as China silk 
He's God's best friend, he's got a seat on the board 
And life may be tough but we're sailing with the lord.""

Like a room in my house had just been rearranged

But if we stay here much longer I'm gonna lose my mind."" 
So we said we had a mission for his favorite dove 
To see if there was any mercy from this great God above 
So to find dry land,  away the white bird flew 
We didn't need no country just a rock would do 
When the dove came back to us he threw down a twig 
It was manna from heaven and meant we could blow this gig 
""But the rock's too small, "" he said, ""can't you see?"" 
I said, ""It's just perfect for her, it's perfect for me.""

Hey Mr. Pinochet
Su siembra huele mal
Y ese dinero que recibe

Amores invisibles
No dejan de danzar
Danzan con sus padres

Once that you've decided on a killing 
First you make a stone of your heart 
And if you find that your hands are still willing 
Then you can turn a murder into art 

There really isn't any need for bloodshed 
You just do it with a little more finesse 
If you can slip a tablet into someone's coffee 
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess 

It's murder by numbers  one  two  three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now if you have a taste for this experience 
And you're flushed with your very first success 
Then you must try a twosome or a threesome 
And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less 

Because murder is like anything you take to 
It's a habit-forming need for more and more 
You can bump off every member of your family 
And anybody else you find a bore 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now you can join the ranks of the illustrious 
In history's great dark hall of fame 
All our greatest killers were industrious 
At least the ones that we all know by name 

But you can reach the top of your profession 
If you become the leader of the land 
For murder is the sport of the elected 
And you don't need to lift a finger of your hand 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your A, be	, see, D, E

Sting,"There was a time when I would have followed you 
To the end of the earth
I was willing to share it all with you, the love, the hurt
I've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dust
But I never stopped believing in you
I always thought our love was strong enough
One you could hold on to

You never see it coming you just let it fly
On silent wings, silent wings
You can't hide what you feel inside 
And the fire has left your eyes
On silent wings

I see us in my dreams and we're dancing
I can almost hear the song
But the prayers they go unanswered
We both know, we're just hanging on 
I can feel the change but I'll never know the reason why 
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me, oh, it's just a memory

You never see it coming, you just go separate ways
On silent wings, silent wings
There's no more promises to break, our love has slipped away 
On silent wings

You never see it coming, but you know it has to end
Silent wings, silent wings
I will never be the same again
I feel the whisper of the wind of silent wings

Crumbling towers in beams of yellow light.
No flags of truce, no cries of pity;
The siege guns had been pounding through the night.
It took a day to build the city.
We walked through its streets in the afternoon.
As I returned across the fields I'd known,
I recognized the walls that I once made.
Had to stop in my tracks for fear of walking on the mines I'd laid.

And if I've built this fortress around your heart,
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire,
Then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm,
And let me set the battlements on fire.

Then I went off the fight some battle that I'd invented inside my head.
Away so long for years and years,
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead.
While the armies are all sleeping beneath the tattered flag we'd made.
I had to stop in my tracks for fear of walking on the mines I'd laid.

And if I've built this fortress around your heart,
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire,

Saw a city  in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play.
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light,
Two priests on the ferry.
October geese on a cold winter's night.
All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea.
 
Two priests came 'round  our house tonight,
One young, one old,  to offer  prayers for the dying to serve the final rite.
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows.
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows.
All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea.
 
If I had my way, take a boat from the river and I'd bury the old man.
I'd bury him at sea.
 
Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth.
Better to be poor than a fat man in the eye of the needle.
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing.
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?
All this time the river flowed endlessly like a silent tear.
 
All this time the river flowed.
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?
Yeah  yeah.  Yeah yeah.  Yeah yeah.
 
Teachers told the Romans  built this    place.
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town.
They lived and they died. 
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound.
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left 
Were the stones the workmen found.
All this time the river flowed in the falling light of a Northern sun.
If I had my way, take a boat from the river.
Men go crazy in the congregations, they only get better one by one.

Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you

Felt more alone than I do now

Black sail in a pale yellow sky

It was gone where the grey gulls fly. 

If it happens again I shall worry 
That only a strange ship could fly 
And my sanity scans the horizon 
In the light of the darkening sky. 

That night as I walked in my slumber 
I waded into the sea strand 
And I swam with the moon and her lover 
Until I lost sight of the land 

I swam till the night became morning 
Black sail in a reddening sky 
Found myself on the deck of a rolling ship 
So far where no grey gulls fly 

All around me was silence 
As if mocking my frail human hopes 
And a question mark hung in the canvas 
For the wind that had died in the ropes 

I may have slept for an hour 
I may have slept for a day 
For I woke in a bed of white linen 
And the sky was the colour of clay. 

At first just a rustle of canvas 
And the gentlest breath on my face 
But a galloping line of white horses 
Said that soon we were in for a race 

The gentle sigh turned to a howling 
And the grey sky she angered to black 
And my anxious eyes searched the horizon 
With the gathering sea at my back 

Did I see the shade of a sailor 
On the bridge through the wheelhouse pane 
Held fast to the wheel of the rocking ship 
As I squinted my eyes in the rain 

For the ship had turned into the wind 
Against the storm to brace 
And underneath the sailor's hat 
I saw my father's face

Roaming the country for the common good

We found ourselves down Mexico way
The town, the mayor, the P.T.A.
Pleading on their knees with us all to stay

We'd only stopped for a few burritos
But they told us of the trouble with los banditos
A poor little town in need of aid

Love is thicker than blood
Love, love, love is stronger than justice
Love is a big fat river in flood

The outcome was predictable
Our banditos were despicable
Of blood we lost a dozen litres
A small price to pay for los senoritas

The town mayor was happy, but his face was glum

He thought that maybe the rain would postpone his death

All the crops were dying when they ought to be high
So to save his farm from the banker's draft

He made a spell and a potion on a midsummer's night
He killed a brindled calf in the pale moonlight
He prayed to the sky, but he prayed in vain
Heavy cloud, but no rain

The sun won't shine till the clouds are gone
The clouds won't go till their work is done
And every morning you'll hear me pray
'If only it would rain today'

Sting,"Turned on the weather man just after the news 
I needed sweet rain to wash away my blues 
He looked at the chart but he looked in vain 
Heavy cloud but no rain 

Back in the time with Louis XVI 
At the court of the people he was number one 
He'd be the bluest blood they'd ever seen 
When the king said hi to the guillotine 
The royal astrologer was run out of breath 
He thought that maybe the rain would postpone his death 
He look in the sky but he look in vain 
Heavy cloud but no rain 

Well the land was cracking and the river was dry 
All the crops were dying when they ought to be high 
So to save his farm from the banker's draft 
The farmer took out a book on some old witchcraft 
He made a spell and a potion on a midsummer's night 
He killed a brindled calf in the pale moonlight 
He prayed to the sky but he prayed in vain 
Heavy cloud but no rain 
Heavy cloud but no rain 

The sun won't shine 'til the clouds are gone 
The clouds won't go 'til their work is done 
And every morning you'll hear me pray 
If only it would rain today

She said she'd save her love for a rainy day

And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat

You ask yourself, who'd watch for me
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it

I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend

No one would you see
You ask yourself, who could it be
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free

I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way

You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die

It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
The jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny

And the warm wind sighs as you practice your swing
And the cares of the world will fade away as you

We had no moon to light our way
And though a million stars were slowly turning
We lacked the consciences to pray

Our horses running like a devil chase us
Their feet, they hardly touched the ground
Yes, I'm familiar with a grey wolf howling
But I'm certain I never heard that sound
Devil to pay on judgement day
Would Jesus strike me down if I should pray?
This cowboy song is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
Your distant sun, your shining light
You'll be my dog-star shining tonight

I've been the lowest of the low on the planet
I've been a sinner all my days
When I was living with my hand on the trigger
I had no sense to change my ways
The preacher asked if I'd embrace the resurrection
To suck the poison from my life
Just like an existential cowboy villain
His words were balanced on my knife
Devil to pay, on judgement day
Would Jesus strike me down if I should pray?

This cowboy song is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
Your distant sun, your shining light
You'll be my dog-star shining tonight

Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a Queen is weeping
Somewhere a King has no wife

And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life they'd lived is dead

And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers ""No, this will be the last""

Still it's uncomfortably near

My old heart
Ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes
That old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say
That my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me

Pardon me
But I gotta run
The fact's uncomfortably clear
Gotta find
Who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Tell me why my angel eyes ain't here
Excusez moi my angel eyes ain't here
Excuse me while I disappear",Angel Eyes,1995

Sting,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1995
Sting,"In the moonlight 
When the shadows play 
When the thought of what could happen 
Takes your breath away 
Sighs and whispers 
Quiet laughter in the air 
Unspoken invitations everywhere 

In the moonlight 
All the words you say 
Make it relatively easy 
To be swept away 
In the half light 
Can we trust the way we feel 
Can we be sure that anything is real? 

Stars keep secrets as they wander indiscreetly 
While the echoes of a song go drifting by 
We must be careful not to lose our way completely 
Or the magic that we seek here 
We can't be sure will be here 

In the morning 
With the moon away 
And if in each other's arms 
Is where we're meant to stay 

In the love light 
When our eyes have grown accustomed to the daylight 
We'll see what waits for us to share 
For all the things we've dreamed of in the moonlight 
Will be there",Moonlight,1995

Mañana ya 
La sangre no estará 
Al caer la lluvia 
Se la llevara 
Acero why piel 
Combinación tan cruel 
Pero algo en nuestras mentes quedara 

Un acto así terminara 
Con una vida why nada mas 
Nada se logra con violencia 
Ni se lograra 
A todos los que han nacido 
En un mundo así 
No olviden su fragilidad

Sting,"If blood will flow when fresh and steel are one
Drying in the colour of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay
Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are how fragile we are

Sting,"Oh the sisters of mercy
They are not departed or gone 
They were waiting for me 
When I thought that I just can't go on 

And they brought me their comfort 
And later they brought me this song 
Oh I hope you run into them
You who've been traveling so long. 

Yes, you who must leave everything 
That you cannot control 
It begins with your family
But soon it comes around to your soul 

Well I've been where you're hanging
I think I can see how you're pinned 
When you're not feeling holy
Your loneliness says that you've sinned. 

Well they lay down beside me
I made my confession to them 
They touched both my eyes 
And I touched the dew on their hem 

If your life is a leaf 
That the seasons tear off and condemn 
They will bind you with love 
That is graceful and green as a stem. 

When I left they were sleeping
I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights
You can read their address by the moon 

And you won't make me jealous
If I hear that they sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that 
And besides it would still be all right 

We weren't lovers like that 
And besides it would still be all right",Sisters of Mercy,1995
Sting,"Seven weeks have passed now since she left me
And she shows her face to ask me how I am.
She says the kids are fine and that they miss me,
Maybe I could come and babysit sometime.

She says ""Are you ok? I was worried about you,
Can you forgive me?  I hope that you'll be happy.""
I said ""I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,
I'm so happy, I'm laughing through my tears.""

I saw a friend of mine.  He said ""I was worried about you,
I heard she had another man.  I wondered how you felt about it""
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears.

Saw my lawyer, Mr. Good News
He got me joint custody and legal separation.
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears.

I can't stop crying, I'm laughing through my tears,
I'm laughing through my tears.

I took a walk along last night, I looked up at the stars,
To try and find an answer in my life.
I chose a star for me, I chose a star for him,
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife.
Something made me smile, something seemed to ease the pain,
Something 'bout the universe and how it's all connected.

The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream.
We try to do the best within the given time.
A kid should be with his mother, everybody knows that,
What can a father do but babysit sometimes.

I saw that friend of mine, he said ""you look different somehow.""
I said ""everybody's got to leave the darkness sometimes.""
I said, ""I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears.""

She's got me flying like a bird in a bright June sky 
And then just when she thinks that I've got her number 
Brings me down to the ground with her wintry eye

She can be all four seasons in one day

To our warm summer love with all its charms 
But like a thoroughbred horse she can turn on a sixpence

She blows hot and cold just like stormy weather 
She's my gift from the Lord or a fiend from hell

I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bread on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head

I set off running to wake from the dream
My brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head

Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head

Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together 'til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead

I walked on the banks of Tyne
I wondered how I could win you
Or if I could make you mine
Or if I could make you mine
The wind it was so insistent
With tales of a stormy south
But when I spied two birds in a sycamore tree
There came a dryness in my mouth
Came a dryness in my mouth
For then without rhyme or reason
The two birds did rise up to fly
And where the two birds were flying
I swear I saw you and I
I swear I saw you and I
I walked out this morning
It was like a veil had been removed from before my eyes
For the first time I saw the work of heaven
In the line where the hills had been married to the sky
And all around me every blade of singing grass
Was calling out your name and that our love would always last
And inside every turning leaf
Is the pattern of an older tree
The shape of our future
The shape of all our history
And out of the confusion
Where the river meets the sea
Came things I'd never seen
Things I'd never seen
I was brought to my senses
I was blind but now that I can see
Every signpost in nature
Said you belong to me
I know it's true
It's written in a sky as blue
As blue as your eyes, as blue as your eyes
If nature's red in tooth and claw
Like winter's freeze and summer's thaw
The wounds she gave me
Were the wounds that would heal me
And we'd be like the moon and sun
And when our courtly dance had run
Its course across the sky
Then together we would lie
And out of the confusion
Where the river meets the sea

Something better would arrive

Over the sea
Home where my true love is waiting for me

How will she know of the devils I've seen
Cross in the sky  star of the sea

Under the moonlight  there she can safely go
Round the Cape Horn to Valparaiso

And every road I walked would take me down to the sea
With every broken promise in my sack
And every love would always send the ship of my heart
Over the rolling sea

And water's my grave

Words and music by sting

Everyone I know is lonely
My god's so far away
And my heart belongs to no one
So now sometimes I pray
Please take this space between us
And fill it up some way
I've been waiting for my brothers
Since fucking christmas day

There's a song that everyone's heard
Let me hear it, make me a part
Songs everyone's heard
Let me hear it, make me a part

Nothing seems to matter
To no one anymore
They say my world is shattered
I just did it on the floor
It won't go no further
It is here I make my stand
If you say my life is precious
When you held it in your hand

There's a song that everyone's heard
Let me hear it, make me a part
Songs everyone's heard
Let me hear it, make me a part

There's a song that everyone's heard
Let me hear it, make me a part
Songs everyone's heard
Let me hear it, make me a part

On your hand his golden rings like he owns a bird that sings.

When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings.
The priest has said my soul's salvation is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion.
I keep the faith in my fashion.

I'd take these hands and I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate.

And hell fire's a promise away I'd still be saying I'm still in love.
Still in love, still in love, still in love, still in love

He won't love you, like I love you.
He won't care for you this way.
He'll mistreat you if you stay.

Come and live with me.
We'll have children of our own.

Sting,"When you're down and they're counting
When your secrets all found out
When your troubles take to mounting
When the map you have leads you to doubt
When there's no information
And the compass turns to nowhere that you know well
Let your soul be your pilot
Let your soul guide you
He'll guide you well

When the doctors failed to heal you
When no medicine chest can make you well
When no counsel leads to comfort
When there are no more lies they can tell
No more useless information
And the compass spins
The compass spins between heaven and hell
Let your soul be your pilot
Let your soul guide you
He'll guide you well

And your eyes turn towards the window pane
To the lights upon the hill
The distance seems so strange to you now
The dark room seems so still

Let your tears be my tears too
Let your courage be my model
That the north you find will be true

Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve
As I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way

Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

In your blue blue shadows I would hide 
All good people asleep tonight 
I'm all by myself in your silver light 
I would gaze at your face the whole night through 
I'd go out of my mind  but for you
I'd go out of my mind  but for you  

Lying in a mother's arms 
The primal root of a woman's charms 
I'm a stranger to the sun

When it's warmth that he seeks? 
You watch every night, you don't care what I do 
I'd go out of my mind, but for you 
I'd go out of my mind, but for you

My hunger for her explains everything I've done 
To howl at the moon the whole night through 
And they really don't care if I do 
I'd go out of my mind for you

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Enters the room where a sleeping princess lies
All your money, your pretty necklace
This is my work on such a night
There's a storm coming over the mountain
I'll be gone long before the morning
After the rain has fallen
After the tears have washed your eyes
You find that I've taken nothing, that
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye
He was as gentle as the night wind
As no lover had been before
And the rings she wore for her bride groom
Slipped from her fingers and fell to the floor
Take me with you, take me with you
Before my lonely life is set
I've been promised to another
To a man I've never even met
After the rain has fallen
After the tears have washed your eyes
You'll find that I've taken nothing, that
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye
After the thunder's spoken, and
After the lightning bolt's been hurled
After the dream is broken, there'll
Still be love in the world
She said take me to another life
Take me for a pirate's wife
Take me where the wind blows
Take me where the red wine flows
Take me to the danger
Take me to the life of crime
Take me to the stars
Take me to the moon while we still have time

After the tears have washed your eyes

Sting,"I sat down and wrote this letter
Telling you that I felt better
Since you'd gone and I was free
I'm so happy
I have so little time to spare now
I'm wanted almost everywhere now
I make out like Casanova
Friends are always coming over
Signed my name as if I meant it
Sealed it with a kiss and sent it
The letter had improved my mood
Happy in my solitude
But halfway home I changed my tune
And when I saw my lonely room
The mirror caught my eye
When I sit down I cry
Big lie small world
Big lie small world
I had to intercept that letter
Telling you that I was better
I raced to catch the postman's van
He was leaving as I ran
I miss the bus I miss the train
I end up walking in the rain
Big dog chased me down the street
I hadn't had a bite to eat
Feeling sorry for myself
Wishing I was someone else
I walked across the city
'Cause I couldn't stand your pity
Big lie small world
Big lie small world
The place you live looks opulent
And obviously a higher rent
Than our cozy little room
I had this sense of doom
The landlord says you're out of town
That your new boyfriend's always around
The hour was getting late
So I sit down and wait
Here's the postman with my letter
Coming down the path, he'd better
Give that thing to me
I have to make him see
Begging doesn't do the trick
He thinks that I'm a lunatic
And then who comes upon the scene
But your new boyfriend Mr. Clean
I hit the postman, hit your lover
Grabbed the letter ran for cover
The police arrived in time for tea
Said they'd like to question me
I can only curse my fate
I have to face the magistrate
It hasn't been the best of days
I'd like to fly away

Sting,"How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair?
And how many times did you swear
That you'd never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights?
How many lies, how many fights?
And why would you want to
Put yourself through all of that again?
Love is pain I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way of
Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?
Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
I'm starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across
We're starting up a brand new day
It could happen to you,
Just like it happened to me,
There is simply no immunity
There's no guarantee.
I say love is such a force if you should find yourself in it
You need some time for reflection
You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero Mac
I'm begging her to take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero buddy
Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy
We're starting up a brand new day
I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm the bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave
I'm the plough and you're the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm the flagpole to your nation
I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I'm the suture
You're the magnet to my pole
I'm the devil in your soul
You're the pupil I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher
You're the flower I'm the rain
You're the tunnel I'm the train
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day
You're the crop to my rotation
You're the sum of my equation
I'm the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
And go up instead of down
You're the pan and I'm the handle
You're the flame and I'm the candle

Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl

Sting,"I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realise that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
Sweet desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise

No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

And the beast is at bay
We've run them in circles
By the end of the day
We chased them through bramble
We chased them through the fields
We could chase them forever
But the fox would not heel
And some saw her shadow
On the crest of a hill
All the hounds are distracted
Away from the kill
One day we'll reach a great ocean
At the end of a pale afternoon
And we'd lay down our heads just like we were sleeping
Controlled by the drag of the moon
We ran through the forest
And we ran through the streams
And we ran through the heather
Though we ran in our dreams
And you were my lover
And I was your boy
We ran like the river
For what else did we know
One day we'll reach a great ocean
At the end of a pale afternoon
The dogs are all howling
And the horses are late
All the hunters have hunted
Through the end of the game
Our love was a river
A wild mountain stream
In a tumbling fury
On the edge of a dream
And they chased us through bramble
And they chased us through the fields
They could chase us forever
But our heart would not yield
And the fox is done running
At the end of the day
I'm ready to answer
I'm ready to pay
And this river's done running
And time will come soon
Carried to the great ocean
By the drag of the moon

'Fill her up son, unleaded
I need a full tank of gas where I'm headed'

I'm gonna fill her up and head west

Got no prospects, no education

Let's consider this as just a loan
I can sort it out later on the phone
I'm gonna pick my girl up tonight
I'm gonna fill her up and head west
I'm gonna show her all the bright lights
We're gonna say we lived 'for we come home
And as I head through the woods on the way back
The evening sun is slanting through the pine trees real pretty
It's like I walked into a glade of heaven
And there's music playing
This money is cold in my hand
And a voice somewhere is saying
'Why would you wanna take that stolen thing
And what real happiness can it bring?'

Sting,"I watch the western sky
The sun is sinking
The geese are flying south
It sets me thinking
I did not miss you much
I did not suffer
What did not kill me
Just made me tougher
I feel the winter come
His icy sinews,
Now in the firelight
The case continues
Another night in court
The same old trial
The same old questions asked
The same denial
The shadows closing round
Like jury members
I look for answers in
The fire's embers
Why was I missing then
That whole December?
I give my usual line,
I don't remember
Another winter comes
His icy fingers creep
Into these bones of mine
These memories never sleep
And all these differences
A cloak I borrowed
We kept our distances
Why should it follow that
I must have loved you?
What is the force that binds the stars?
I wore this mask to hide my scars
What is the power that pulls the tide?
Never could find a place to hide
What moves the earth around the sun?
What could I do but run and run and run?
Afraid to love, afraid to fail
A mast without a sail
The moon's a fingernail
And slowly sinking
Another day begins
And now I'm thinking
That this is indifference
Was my invention
When everything I did
Sought your attention
You were my compass star
You were my measure
You were a pirate's map
Of buried treasure
If this was all correct
The last thing I'd expect
The prosecution rests
It's time that I confessed
I must have loved you
I must have loved you

Sting,"I've had a question that's been preying on my mind for some time
I won't be wagging my tail for one good reason
It has to be a crime

This dog house never was the place for me,
Runner up and second best just ain't my pedigree
I was so happy, just the two of us
Until this alpha male
Turned up in the January sale

He won't love you
Like I love you
It won't be long now before that puppy goes astray
And what I like about this guy the most
He'd be my favourite lamp post
Devil take the hindmost

Je sais que c'est dur, mais il faut se faire au changement, tu vois
J'ai négligé le primordial pendant trop longtemps crois moi
Je suis consciente, je vois bien que tu souffres, mais ça s'attenuera
Car c'est d'un homme plus d'un chien dont j'ai besoin près de moi
Cesse donc de grogner, mon choix est fait c'est comme ça
N'en fait pas trop, ton attitude risque de t'éloigner de moi
Faut que tu comprennes, puisque tu dis m'aimer tant que ça
Désormais nous sommes trois, lui toi et moi

It's a shaggy kind of story
Would I tell you if I thought it was a lie?
But when the cat's away the mouse will play,
I wouldn't dish around here
There's something fishy 'round here

I howl all night and I sleep all day
It takes more than biscuit, baby, to chase these blues away
I've got a long enough leash
I could almost hang myself
It's a dogs life loving you baby
But you love someone else
Now he's moved by basket
I'd like to put him in a casket
I'll wear my best collar to his funeral

Ta mauvaise foi, j'aimerais bien que ça s'arrête
Me séparer de toi, aujourd'hui ça trotte dans ma tête
Moi non, j'en peux plus, tu n'est qu'un chien, c'est trop bête
La situation m'avait pourtant l'air d'être des plus nettes
C'est clair, que je l'aime c'est un fait, ton egoïsme m'inquiète
Après toutes ces soirées passées seuls en tête à tête
Chaque chose a une fin, et c'est la fin de la fête
Pour toi, car bientôt il n'y aura plus que lui et moi, lui et moi.

Sting,"A thousand years, a thousand more
A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs
To a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,
A million names but only one truth to face
A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs,
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame,
This single haunted memory of your face
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
I may be numberless, I may be innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief
I still love you
I still want you

Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves

If he's not a generous man
I step into his van

And after that it's just a matter of logic
They have the money I have the time
Being pretty's my only crime

I say it's really up to me

Don't judge me
You could be me in another life
In another set of circumstances
Don't judge me
One more night I'll just have to take my chances
And tomorrow we'll see
A friend of mine he wound up dead
His dress was stained the colour red
No next of kin no fixed abode
Another victim on this road
The police just carted him away
But someone took his place next day
He was home by thanksgiving
But not with the living
Don't judge me
You could be me in another life
In another set of circumstances
Don't judge me
One more night I'll just have to take my chances
And no it's just not in my plan
For someone to care who I am
I'm walking the streets for money
It's the business of love, 'hey honey'
C'mon, don't leave me lonely, don't leave me sad
It'll be the sweetest five minutes you ever had

You could be me in another life
In another set of circumstances

Sting,"I sat down and wrote this letter
Telling you that I felt better
Since you've gone and I was free
I'm so happy

I have so little time to spare now
I'm wanted almost everywhere now
I make out like Casanova
Friends are always coming over

I signed my name as if I meant it
And sealed it with a kiss and sent it
The letter headed through my mood
Happy in my solitude

But halfway home I changed my tune
And when I saw my lonely room
The mirror caught my eye
When I sat down, I cried

Big lie, small world
It was a big lie, small world

I had to intercept that letter
Telling you that I was better
I raced to catch the postman's van
He was leaving as I ran

I missed the bus, I missed the train
I end up walking in the rain
Big dog chased me down the street
Hadn't had a bite to eat

Feeling sorry for myself
And wishing I was someone else
I walked across the city
Because I couldn't stand your pity

Big lie, small world
It was a big lie, small world

The place you live looks opulent
And obviously a higher rent
Than a cozy little room
I had this sense of doom

Your landlord says you're out of town
But your new boyfriend's always around
The hour was getting late
So I sit down and wait

Here's the postman with my letter
Coming down the path he better
Give that thing to me
I have to make him see

Begging doesn't do the trick
He thinks that I'm a lunatic
But then who comes upon the scene
But your new boyfriend, Mr. Clean

I hit the postman, hit your lover
Grabbed the letter, ran for cover
The police arrived in time for tea
They said they'd like to question me

But I can only curse my fate
I had to face the magistrate
It hasn't been the best of days
I'd like to fly away

Have been summoned to his bed

Egypt shakes with every cough
No two ways about what's coming
No discussion, bets are off

Soon our monarch will have filled the tomb
Just like his fathers did
Summon Egypt's greatest builder
Another pyramid

Build it, build it

He should scrub his next vacation
Even put tonight on hold

See him happy to his shroud

I'd never imagined before

That the world could be turned on it's head

I'd never have thought

To be here in this place

I'd never have dreamt that in love

I'd be lost and so easily led

I guess I was caught

By that hint of a smile on her face


I thought I was happy

When my life was as easy as pie

But that was the past

Of an ignorant youth

I'm falling in love with the girl

But I'm forced to be living a lie

And she'd never love mew&d

If she knew the truth


Is it asking too much

If I pray for a miracle, miracle

That one day she'll love me

One day she'll say I care


Although he's changing day by day

He finds these tender words of love

Impossible to say

He walks in the room

And I'm never quite sure

If he's trying to be somebody else

I'm liking him better that he's

Not his arrogant self

Perhaps I'm expecting too much

Of a miracle, miracle

One day he'll love mew&d

One day he'll say I love you

And I will love him until I die


Distant Star

Cast your light

On my life


And one by one

I didn't anticipate feeling the power of love

In this way


And day by dayw&d

We've never been closer than this

And I find myself daring to pray


We'll find these tender ways of love

Impossible to disobeyw&d


One day she'll love me


One day he'll say I love you


And I will love her


Until the moment

Our hearts stop beating

And we are light

I could almost hang myself

Once that you've decided on a killing 
First you make a stone of your heart 
And if you find that your hands are still willing 
Then you can turn a murder into art 

There really isn't any need for bloodshed 
You just do it with a little more finesse 
If you can slip a tablet into someone's coffee 
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess 

It's murder by numbers  one  two  three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now if you have a taste for this experience 
And you're flushed with your very first success 
Then you must try a twosome or a threesome 
And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less 

Because murder is like anything you take to 
It's a habit-forming need for more and more 
You can bump off every member of your family 
And anybody else you find a bore 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now you can join the ranks of the illustrious 
In history's great dark hall of fame 
All our greatest killers were industrious 
At least the ones that we all know by name 

But you can reach the top of your profession 
If you become the leader of the land 
For murder is the sport of the elected 
And you don't need to lift a finger of your hand

It's as easy to learn as your A, be	, see, D, E

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over (over)
And it seems as though the writing's on the wall (yeah)

It's what they call
The rise and fall

I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties

I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before me go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same

'Cause with the money, came a different status
That's when things changed
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews
No pictures, and less demands

Given advices that were clearly wrong
The type that seemed to make me feel so right
But some things you may find, can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places

And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away

When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart

Now I know (now I know)
I made mistakes (made mistakes)
Think I don't care
But you don't realize what this means to me

Used to be

A literal translation by j. mark sugars 1997

Once I was a gentle maiden,
But now I am a spent, worn-out widow,
My consort strongly plowing the waves
Over the hills and far away.

He is my hero, my gallant darling,
He is my caesar, a gallant darling;
I've found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away.

Every day I am constantly enduring grief,
Weeping nitterly and shedding tears,
Because my lively lad has left me
And no news is told of him - alas!

The cuckoo does not sing cheerfully at noon
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-tree woods
Nor summer morning in misty glen
Since my lively boy went away from me.

Noble, proud young horseman,
Youth without gloom, of pleasant countenance,
A swift-moving fist, nimble in a fight,
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.

Let a strain be played on musical harps,
And let many quarts be filled on the table,
With high spirit, without fault, without gloom,
That my lion may receive long life and health.

Gallant darling for a while under sorrow,
And ireland completely under black cloacks,
I have found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away

Through restless waters and deep commotion 
Often frightened, unenlightened 
Sail on, sail on sailor 

I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters 
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders 
Unrepenting, often empty 
Sail on, sail on sailor 

Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail 
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail 

Seldom stumble, never crumble 
Try to tumble, life's a rumble 
Feel the stinging I've been given 
Never ending, unrelenting 
Heartbreak searing, always fearing 
Never caring, persevering 
Sail on, sail on, sailor 
Sail on, sail on, sailor
Sail on, sail on, sailor

I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways 
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters 
Uninspired, drenched and tired 
Wail on, wail on, sailor 

Always needing, even bleeding 
Never feeding all my feelings 
Damn the thunder, must I blunder 
There's no wonder all I'm under 
Stop the crying and the lying 
And the sighing and my dying

What can you say when a love affair is over

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look

And you feel your life is shrinking like the petals of a flower
As you creep towards the closet you're so careful not to wake him
And you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer

There's a time of indecision between the bedroom and the door
But the part of you that knows that you can't take it any more
There's the promise of the future in the creaking of the floor 
And you're torn if you should leave him with a number

And in your imagination you're a thousand miles away
Because too many of his promises got broken on the way
So you write it in a letter all the things you couldn't say 
And you tell him that you're never coming home

She'd live the life she'd always dreamed if he had only let her

Now in her imagination she's a million miles away
When too many of his promises got broken on the way
So she wrote it in a letter all the things she couldn't say
And she told him she was never coming home
She told him she was never coming home

I wake up in an empty bed a road drill hammers in my head 
I call her name there's no reply it's not like her to let me lie
It's time for work it's time to go but something's different I don't know
I need a cup of coffee I'll feel better

I stumble to the bathroom door, her make up bag is on the floor
It really is a mess this place it takes some time to shave my face
I'm not really thinking straight she never lets me sleep this late
I'm almost done and then I see the letter

In his imagination she's a universe away
Too many of his promises got broken on the way
So she wrote it in a letter all things she couldn't say
And she told him she was never coming home,
She told him she was never coming home,

Put on these high heeled shoes

Shut out the world behind us
Put on your long black dress

Just leave your hair in a mess
I've been searching long enough
I begged the moon and the stars above 
For sacred love

I've been up, I've been down
I've been lonesome, in this godless town
You're my religion, you're my church
You're the holy grail at the end of my search 
Have I been down on my knees for long enough?
I've been searching the planet to find 
Sacred love

The spirit moves on the water
She takes the shape of this heavenly daughter
She's rising up like a river in flood 
The word got made into flesh and blood
The sky grew dark, and the earth she shook
Just like a prophecy in the Holy Book
Thou shalt not covet, thou shalt not steal
Thou shalt not doubt that this love is real
So I got down on my knees and I prayed to the skies
When I looked up could I trust my eyes?
All the saints and angels and the stars up above
They all bowed down to the flower of creation
Every man every woman
Every race every nation 
It all comes down to this 
Sacred love

Don't need no doctor, don't need no pills
I got a cure for the country's ills
Here she comes like a river in flood 
The word got made into flesh and blood 
Thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill
But if you don't love her your best friend will

All the saints up in heaven and the stars up above
It all comes down, it all comes down 
It all comes down to love,

Put on your long black dress

There's a wire in my jacket, this is my trade
It only takes a moment, don't be afraid
I can hot wire an ignition like some kind of star
I'm just a poor boy in a rich man's car
So I whisper to the engine, flick on the lights

And I picture myself in this different situation
I'm a company director, two kids and a wife
I get the feeling that there's more to this one's life

Spends the night with his lover, there's a trace of her cologne
And the words of his mistress, as she whispers them so near
Start ringing in my ear

I imagine his wife, she don't look nothing like a fool
She picks the kids up from some private school
She remembers what he told her, he was late and worked alone

Yes, I'm the soul of indiscretion,
I was cursed with x-ray vision,
I could see right through all the lies you told,
When you smiled for the television

You pray the drums will never cease
And you may win this war that's coming
But would you tolerate the peace?

Investing in munitions 
And those little cotton flags
Invest in wooden caskets 
In guns and body bags, guns and body bags

And it always made good sense
You know the war can make you rich my friend

Invest in every tyranny

When all the earthly wars are over
You may find yourself just standing there
On the white cliffs of Dover

You may ask, what does it profit a man
To gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? 
Is that your body you see on the rocks below
As the tide begins to roll?

And you invested in this prison
From which you never got released
You may have won this war we're fighting
But would you tolerate the peace?

A war on our dissent
There's a war inside religion

On the birds and the bees

There's a war on education 
A war on information
A war between the sexes

I'd never imagined before

That the world could be turned on it's head

I'd never have thought

To be here in this place

I'd never have dreamt that in love

I'd be lost and so easily led

I guess I was caught

By that hint of a smile on her face


I thought I was happy

When my life was as easy as pie

But that was the past

Of an ignorant youth

I'm falling in love with the girl

But I'm forced to be living a lie

And she'd never love mew&d

If she knew the truth


Is it asking too much

If I pray for a miracle, miracle

That one day she'll love me

One day she'll say I care


Although he's changing day by day

He finds these tender words of love

Impossible to say

He walks in the room

And I'm never quite sure

If he's trying to be somebody else

I'm liking him better that he's

Not his arrogant self

Perhaps I'm expecting too much

Of a miracle, miracle

One day he'll love mew&d

One day he'll say I love you

And I will love him until I die


Distant Star

Cast your light

On my life


And one by one

I didn't anticipate feeling the power of love

In this way


And day by dayw&d

We've never been closer than this

And I find myself daring to pray


We'll find these tender ways of love

Impossible to disobeyw&d


One day she'll love me


One day he'll say I love you


And I will love her


Until the moment

Our hearts stop beating

And we are light

Sting,"If I caught the world in a bottle
And everything was still beneath the moon
Without your love would it shine for me?
If I was smart as Aristotle
And understood the rings around the moon
What would it all matter if you loved me?

Here in your arms 
Where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfill
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms 
When everything seems to be clear
Not a solitary thing would I fear
Except when this moment comes near the dancings´ end

If I caught the world in an hourglass
Saddled up the moon so we could ride
Until the stars grew dim, Until?

One day you'll meet a stranger 
And all the noise is silenced in the room
you'll feel that you´re close to some mystery
In the moonlight when everything shatters
You´ll feel as if you've known her all your life
The world?s oldest lesson in history

Here in your arms 
Where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfill
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms 
When everything seems to be clear
Not a solitary thing do I fear
Except when this moment comes near the dancings end

Oh, if I caught the world in an hourglass
Saddled up the moon and we would ride
Until the stars grew dim

Unrepenting, often empty

(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

We don't want war, can't take no more
It's drastic time for sure
We need a antidote and a cure
Coz do you really think Mohamed got a problem with Jehovah
We don't want war imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they'd view life like you and I do
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way, act and behave this way
We still live in primitive today
Coz the peace in the destination of war can't be the way
There's no way, so people, just be a woman, be a man
Realize that you can't change the world by changing yourself
And understand that we're all just the same
So when I count to three let's change

[Chorus]

Got no time for grand philosophy
I barely keep my head above the tide
I got this mortgage, got three kids at school
What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside
I'd change the world if I could change my mind
If I could live beyond my fears
Exchanging unity for all my insecurity
Exchanging laughter for my tears

[Chorus]

I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition
In the midst of all this negative condition
Divided by beliefs, different sink and religion
Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonize together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse
Utilizing all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one
I don't understand why it's never been done
So let's change on the count of one

It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one
Next thing you know you got a billion
People doing some wonderful things
People doing some powerful things
Let's change and do some powerful things
Unity could be a wonderful thing

Sting,"Can she excuse my wrongs with virtue's cloak?
Shall I call her good when she proves unkind?
Are those clear fires which vanish into smoke?
Must I praise the leaves where no fruit I find?

No, no, where shadows do for bodies stand
Thou may'st be abused if thy sight be dimmed
Cold love is like to words written on sand
Or to bubbles which on the water swim

Wilt thou be thus abused still
Seeing that she will right thee never?
If thou cans't not overcome her will
Thy love will be thus fruitless ever

Was I so base, that I might not aspire
Unto those high joys which she holds from me?
As they are high, so high is my desire
If she this deny, what can granted be?

If she will yield to that which reason is
It is reason's will that love should be just
Dear, make me happy still by granting this
Or cut off delays if that I die must

Better a thousand times to die
Than for to live thus still tormented
Dear, but remember it was I
Who for thy sake did die contented

Better a thousand times to die
Than for to live thus still tormented
Dear, but remember it was I
Who for thy sake did die contented

To do me due delight, 
To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die,

Through thy unkind disdain; 
For now left and forlorn 
I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die 
In deadly pain and endless misery.

By frowns doth cause me pine

Sting,"As I in hoary winter's night stood shivering in the snow,
Surprised I was with sudden heat which made my heart to glow 
And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near,
A pretty babe all burning bright did in the air appear 

Who, scorch'd with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed
As though his floods should quench his flames which with his tears were fed.
Alas, quoth he, but newly born in fiery heats I fry,
Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but I!

My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns,
Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns 
The fuel justice layeth on, and mercy blows the coals,
The metal in this furnace wrought are men's defil'd souls,

For which, as now on fire I am to work them to their good,
So will I melt into a bath to wash them in my blood.

And straight I call'd unto mind that it was Christmas day.",The Burning Babe,2009

But every tack we made we brought the North Head close aboard
We saw the cliffs and houses, and the breakers running high,
And the coastguard in his garden, his glass against his eye

All the crops were dying when they ought to be high
So to save his farm from the banker's draft

He made a spell and a potion on a midsummer's night
He killed a brindled calf in the pale moonlight
He prayed to the sky but he prayed in vain

The clouds won't go till their work is done

Sting,"Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine.

Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,
To keep her from the howlin' winds.

Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
That's the way I remember her best.

I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night,
In the brightness of my day.

A bed of grass, a soft green pillow.
Lay down your head, and close your eyes.
And when they open, the sun will rise.

Here it's safe, and here it's warm.
Here the daisies guard you from every harm.
Here your dreams are sweet, and tomorrow brings them true.
Here is the place where I love you.

Deep in the meadow, hidden far away.
A cloak of green, a moon beam ray.
Forget your woes, and let your troubles lay.
And when again it's morning, they'll wash away.

Sting,"This town, this stain on the sunrise
Disguised in the mist, this morning.
It’s 8 AM, a seagull shouts
A sailor’s warning, this sky.

This bend in the river
Slows down and delivers me
The tide rolls back
And all my memories fade to black.

And yet,
And yet…
I’m back

This town has a strange magnetic pull
Like a homing signal in your skull
And you sail by the stars of the hemisphere
Wondering how in the hell did you end up here?

It’s like an underground river or a hidden stream
That flows through your head and haunts your dream
And you stuffed those dreams in this canvas sack
And there’s nothing round here that the wide world lacks.

And yet,
And yet…
You’re back

Some night I’d lie on the deck and I’d stare
At the turning of the stars
Those constellations hanging up there
From the cables and the rigging

I wonder if she saw the same or managed to recall my name
Why would she ever think of me, some boy she loved who fled to sea?
And why waste time debating
Whether she’d be waiting for the likes of me?

So you drift into port with the scum of the seas
To the dance halls and the brothels where you took your ease!
And the ship’s left the dock, but you’re half past caring
And you haven’t got a clue whose bed you’re sharing.

And your head’s like a hammer on a bulkhead door
And it feels like somebody might have broken your jaw
And there’s bloodstains and glass all over the floor
And you swear to god ye’ll drink no more.

And yet,
And yet…
In truth
It’s too late to find her

Too late to remind her at some garden gate
Where a servant tells me I should wait
And perhaps a door’s slammed in my face
My head must be in outer space.

And yet,
And yet
Before the sun has set
Before the sea there may be something else
That’s waiting for the likes of me.",And Yet,2013

I had a friend on the ships his name was Joe Dorsey,
He'd get into port he'd be straight to the horsies,
He begged and he pleaded, he was some operator,
600 to one, and he'd pay me back later,
He claimed it was certain that we'd be in clover,
And the next time we sailed past the White Cliffs of Dover,
We'd be sailing a yacht of our own to the Med,
I lent him the money, I was out of me head,
I didn't see hide of him for nine months, maybe ten,
And didn't the bastard just ask me again?
For the loan of a tenner he'd pay me back soon,
All the money he owed me, I answered the loon,

A passionate courtship albeit brief,
But what happened next, it just beggared belief,
If I tell ye, ye'll be sober.
The second night in she claims she's with child,
Afore yesterday night she'd been pure, undefiled,
I must be the father, court papers she'd filed,
So what did I tell her me rovers?

Sting,"Did you ever hear the theory of the universe?
Where every time you make a choice,
A brand new planet gets created?

Did you ever hear that theory?
Does it carry any sense?
That a choice can split the world in two,
Or is it all just too immense for you?

That they all exist in parallel,
Each one separate from the other,
And every subsequent decision,
Makes a new world then another,
And they all stretch out towards infinity,
Getting further and further away.

Now, were a man to reconsider his position,
And try to spin the world back to its original state?

It's not a scientific proposition,
And relatively speaking… you're late.

It's not the same moon in the sky,
And these are different stars,
And these are different constellations,
From the ones that you've described.

Different rules of navigation,
Strange coordinates and lines,
A completely different zodiac,
Of unfamiliar signs.

It's not the same moon in the sky,
And those planets are misleading,
I wouldn't even try to take a bearing or a reading,
Just accept that things are different,
You've no choice but to comply,

And ye don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.
Why I'm as hard as iron plate, woe betide ye if yer late,
When we have to push the boat out on a spring tide.
Now ye could die and hope for Heaven, but ye'd need to work your shift,
And I'd expect ye's all to back us to the hilt.
And if St. Peter at his gate were to ask ye why yer late,
Why you'd tell him that ye had to get a ship built.
We built battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen,
Super tankers for Onassis, and all the classes in between,
We built the greatest shipping tonnage that the world has ever seen,
And the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

All the platers and the welders, and the boiler making crews,
When they see that bugger finished on the slipway,
All the hardship's soon forgot and we'll cheer as like as not,
And the bairns'll wave their Union Jacks all day.
It's a patriotic scene, all that's missing is the Queen,
But she said she couldn't make it of a Tuesday.
Then something wells up here inside, and you could take it in yer stride,
But you wonder if you'll see another payday.

For there's a mixture of emotions, hatred, gratitude and pride,
And you hate yourself for crying but it's difficult to hide,
For there's a sadness in the leavin' and ye worry what's ahead,
And that worry never leaves ye, keeps on nagging in yer head,
And so ye pray to God for orders, but ye'll worry till yer dead…
Until they bury your remains in the blacksmith's shed,
And the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And I don't know what we'll do if this yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

My name is Adrian Sanderson and riveting's me trade,
But it's intellectual discourse I'm known better for,
And I may forego English grammar when I'm injured with a hammer,
But I've a preference for the deference of a metaphor.

I've read the Odyssey by Homer and the Iliad as well,
I read Tacitus and Pliny and the Scarlet Pimpernel,
I put a night shift in with Dante on his journey into Hell,
And that's what we'll all be facing if the yard's put up to sell,
For the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

When you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris.

Well it's obvious I'm gifted with the rhymin' and the meter,
And hereabouts I'm thought of highly as a bard.
If I wasn't shooting rivets I'd be famous in me time,
All those literary circles I could dazzle with me rhyme,
And I never lacked ambition you could say it was a crime,
And rivets may be riveting but sonnets are sublime,

Ah, me name is Tommy Thompson, I'm shop steward for the Union,
Me dream is proletarian revolution,
Comrades, brothers, fellow travellers and others,
Class struggle is the means of dialectic evolution.

Das Kapital's me bible and the ruling class are liable,
And quoting Marx and Engels, it's entirely justifiable,
If the workers' revolution here is ever to be viable,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

So it's a one-day stoppage, or an overtime ban,
Or a work to rule for the Five Year Plan.
'Til the means of production are safely in our hands,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

I'm not saying it won't be hard if the boss hands us me cards,
When they try to close us down like other shipyards.
And if industrial action only helps the competition,
As I've heard the bosses bleating from their usual position,
And I stand accused of anarchy, disruption and sedition,
Well ye'll never knock us down, you reactionary clowns!
When it's time for occupation of the shipyard.

My name is Peggy White,
And I've nursed ye through your injuries and yer cuts and wounds I've bound.
Busted arms, and busted heads,
Broken backs and broken legs,
I'd sooner put ye in a splint than have them put ye in the ground.
And the fumes from all the welding where the poison air is hung,
And the toxic radiation that's been blackening your tongue,
I could give you's all an aspirin while you're coughing up your lungs,
But it's all you'll ever get here in this shipyard.

But the truth is that we're heading for a God almighty fall.
But it's clear that intervention's not the government's intention,
'Cos they've got no need for ships, now have I got your full attention?
While the closing of the yard may be beyond your comprehension,
I'm the one who sees the writin' on the shipyard wall.

I've begged and I've pleaded at every meeting that we've held,
That we limit our demands to this reality,
It's like two different metals in a join ye cannot weld,
And there's nothing to be gained from this dream of solidarity.
There's nowt for us to bargain with when the industry's at sea,
It must be obvious to you as it's obvious to me,
And my advice to all of you's is to take redundancy,
And accept that there's no future in this shipyard.

Ah, me name is Davy Harrison, I like a drink or two,
You could ask me when it started but I haven't got a clue.
I'm never sad or miserable I'm never ever blue,
And I'll still be up tomorrow for the shipyard.

I drink meself into a stupor and I wake up with two heeds,
And then the missus starts complainin' about all me drunken deeds,
Like when I got the train to Sunderland but found meself in Leeds,
And I had to get up early for the shipyard.

I once gave up the drinking, was it 1963?
But it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me,
It was the worst three hours I ever hope to see…

And if you're too old to dance, you can raise your glasses,

""I want ye to go to the store lad and get a few things, ye see?
Now here's a list, can ye read lad? Can ye read it back to me?
And me and the boys'll listen while were having wah morning tea.""

Now reading was me pride when I left school at fourteen,
There wouldn't be no problem here, I'd show them I was keen,

So I gets to the store all nervous and the quartermaster's there,
I pulls the list out of me pocket and I starts to read all square,
Well I hadn't barely finished when the store-man's face turns red,
He gives me such an evil look I thought I'd soon be dead.

No mention of the missing men… they seal the double hull.

The ship was launched upon the tide and all the townsfolk cheered,
A brass band played but not a word of omens they had feared,
But before the afternoon was out, the celebration wrecked,
A dignitary clutched his heart…and collapsed upon the deck.
No doctors could revive him as the telegraphs would tell,
And the name upon the coffin… Isambard Brunel.

And now upon the open sea, the mighty ship did plough,
But many feared the darkness, in the shadow of its prow.
An explosion on the lower deck, would take the souls of five,
With a growing superstition 'mong the sailors still alive.

The captain and his boy are lost while rowing to the shore,
The crew will threaten mutiny and say they'll work no more,
They began to say the ship was cursed, they hadn't even seen the worst,
They'd signed on able-bodied men, but they wouldn't sail to Hell…
When the name upon the manifest is Isambard Brunel.

For 14 years that ship will sail, misfortune taken hard,
The owners barely find a crew to reach the breakers' yard.
And as they take the plates apart, unseal the double hull,
The breakers call the foreman o'er, they'd found a human skull.
And then they find the younger man, perforced to understand,
That in the hour of their torment, he'd reached his father's hand.

In 18 hundred and 59, the engineer Brunel,
Would build the greatest ship afloat, and rule the mighty swell.
The final shift was over, and the breakers' hammers fell,
And the name upon the manifest, the contract signed in Hell,
Was the same as on the draftsman's chart… one Isambard Brunel.",Ballad of the Great Eastern,2013
Sting,"You see these work boots in my hands, they'll probably fit ye now my son,
Take them, they're a gift from me, why don't you try them on?
It would do your old man good to see you walking in these boots one day,
And take your place among the men who work upon the slipway.

These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled,
When a feller needs a job and a place in the world,
And it's time for a man to put down roots,
And walk to the river in his old man's boots.

He said, ""I'm nearly done and asking this, that ye do one final thing for me!
You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree.
If ye need a seed to prosper, ye must first put down some roots.
Just one foot then the other in these dead man's boots.""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They could walk there themselves, and they probably will.
There's a place for ye there to sink your roots,
And take a walk down the river in these dead man's boots.

I said, ""Why in the Hell would I do that? And why would I agree?""
When his hand was all that I'd received, as far as I remember.
It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness up to then ye see.
I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place when I came of age September.

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves, and they probably will.
I'd plenty of choices, and plenty other routes,
And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots.

What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him?
When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left, or a broken pot to piss in.
He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
He said, ""What the hell are ye gonna do?""
I said, ""Anything but this!""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves and they most likely will.
But they won't walk with me 'cos I'm off the other way,
I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say.
When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall?
I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all.
Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through,
Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you,
I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more dispute,
And ye'll die before ye see me in your dead man's boots.",Dead Man's Boots,2013
Sting,"When a man of my age shaves his face in the morning,
Who is it that stares back and greets him?
The ghost of his father long dead all these years?
Or the boy that he was, still wet in the ears?
Or the terrible sum of all of his fears,
In the eyes of this stranger who meets him?

So his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline,
To face up to the truth of his soul,
It's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge,
Something strange, unexpected, out of control.

There are times when a man needs to brave his reflection,
And face what he sees without fear,
It takes a man to accept his mortality,
Or be surprised by the presence of a tear.

It was only an arrangement, a practical arrangement,
I forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook,
Don't be fooled by illusions you created yourself,
And fall in love with someone, when she loves someone else.

Like a covering of snow on a winter's night,
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight,
But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts,
You still love her but she loves someone else.

And where does that leave you?
You self-styled man of vision.
You feel stupid, you feel angry, are you losing your mind?
To destroy the one she loves, does that become your mission?
Like a pantomime villain with an axe to grind?
To regain your self-respect, hold your head up like a man,
Use the ice around your heart before it melts,
But you're not fooling anybody, you're only fooling yourself.

It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight,
But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts",I Love Her But She Loves Someone Else,2013

But he couldn't find his own way out

His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
This solitary madness is where he is driven
It was him who was trapped in the soul cage son
It was him that was trapped in the soul cage

I know that he loved you, but he hadn't the words

Sting,"In the streets around here there was nobody tougher than me,
I was quick with me fists and fast with me footwork as you can plainly see,
But while fighting was useful for getting your way,
Among the toughs of the town where you could hold sway,
There had to be something that was better than this,
I was fifteen years old and I'd never been kissed.

Well of course she'd ignore me, her friends would all sneer,
At me bloody nose dripping and me cauliflower ear,
For it's hard to convince in a romantic pose,
With a lovely black eye and a broken nose,
Where a girl is attracted to skills more refined,
Than the pugilist's art, and so I inclined,
To take meself serious as a modern romancer,
And I secretly learnt all the moves of a dancer.

Ye swing to the left, ye swing to the right,
Keep your eyes on your partner, more or less like a fight,
Ye just follow the rhythm, and ye keep to the beat,
The important thing's never to look at your feet,
Then a miracle happens, your mind's in a trance,
Though the strategy's subtle, retreat and advance,
It's all about attitude, all in your stance,
Attention to detail, leaving nothing to chance,
Which explains how the pugilist finally learned how to dance.

Well, I'd waltz with a broomstick and if I was caught,
I'd pretend I was sweeping or practicing sport,
But I really had eyes for your mother ye see,
Wanting her to acknowledge this new version of me,
But now everyone's watching, expecting I'll fail,
But there's fire in me belly, there's wind in me sails,
I knew it was risky and I was taking a chance,
I couldn't retreat now, I had to advance.

So I swing to the left, I swing to the right,
Keep me eyes on me partner, like I would in a fight,
I just keep to the rhythm and follow the beat,
The important thing's never to look at yr feet,
But a miracle's happened, and your mind's in a trance,
They're all laughing and cheering and looking askance,
On the night that the pugilist finally learned how to dance.

It's a three-minute round and you're back in yr corner,
You're licking yr wounds just like little Jack Horner,
Don't let your guard down try a jab with your right,
Or you're losing on points by the end of the night,
Then a miracle happens, and everyone's screaming,
You're pinching yourself just in case you're still dreaming,
You've taken the initiative, you've taken your chance,
It's the night when this pugilist finally learned how to dance.

In a bout where the strategist's bridges were burned,
Where it seemed that his fortune had suddenly turned,
'Twas the night that this scrapper was suddenly dapper,
And this poor fellow's heart was still going like the clappers,
The night that the pugilist finally learned how to dance.",The Night the Pugilist Learned How to Dance,2013

If I'll only submit to the surgical knife?
But what are the odds on a month or a week?
When the betting shop's closing its doors, so to speak.
When you're tied to a pump and a breathing machine,
With their X-rays and probes and their monitor screens,
And they'll wake ye up hungry, saying ""How do ye feel?""
And then you're stuffed full of pills and a barium meal.

Prolonging me life? Now that's some kind of joke!

And they'll cut and they'll slice, and they'll poke and they'll jab,
And they'll grill ye and burn ye, and they'll wish ye good health,
With their radium, chemo and God knows what else?

For a few extra rounds in a fight to the death.

Here comes the sound, I force my fingers in my ears

I could not fall no further than this, down, down, down, down

So don't despair of the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there

Some days I'm strong, some days I'm weak
And days I'm so broken I can barely speak
There’s a place in my head where my thoughts still roam
Where somehow I've come home

And when the Winter comes and the trees lie bare
And you just stare out the window in the darkness there

His tail between his sorry legs

Many a vain bird crowed
And many a songbird lost her way

Many a band of brothers rode
In many a painted wagon
Many an unsecured load
Whenever a climbing truck was slowed
There was many a traveler's curse bestowed
Heading South on the Great North Road
South on the Great North Road

Many a transport greasy spoon
Many a wasted afternoon
Where many a maiden gave her heart
And many a gift bestowed
But a gift is a yoke to a traveling man

South on the Great North Road

If we get back home, we'll tell our tales
To all of those who'll listen
The might have beens, the chances lost
The monies that went missing

As if our cups had over flowed

Collapses on its density

How do I breathe now, how do I inhale?
I'm a diver on the seabed, my oxygen's failed
How do I wake up, how do I sleep?
How do I laugh now, I can't even weep?
Where do I run to, where do I hide?
An insect preserved in formaldehyde
Yesterday's paper, its pages curled
How can I live in this broken world?

Keep up appearances as they say
But all those reasons you might stay
Ring hollow in my mind today
I've listened ‘til my head would spin

Looking ‘round his timber yard, He found He had no lumber
Apart from some old twisted branch, in shadows left to lurk
He pulled it out into the light and set about his work.

She told me that the world should not expect too much of me
When the Good Lord carved my crooked soul, out of a crooked tree
When the Good Lord carved my crooked soul, out of a crooked tree.”

Sting,"From way back here on the bandstand
She looked like a goddess in the lights
At some point in the set she’d turn her face and glance my way most nights
I’d take a little solo, I’d play for her, she’d smile, return the favor
I’d make the sweetest love to her with every semiquaver

“There’s a sadness in your playing,” she said
“That penetrates my bones
Something in your intonation, something in your tone
Always understated, but never overblown
My name for you is Sad Trombone
Yes, my name for you is Sad Trombone.”

It seemed like she’d found the secret key to my soul
And gathered up my broken life and somehow made me whole
We’d share a room together, my bandmates were all green
And they warned me ‘bout some story in a movie they’d all seen

“There’s a sadness in your playing,” she said
“That penetrates my bones
Something in your intonation, something in your tone
Always understated, never overblown
My name for you is Sad Trombone
Yes, my name for you is Sad Trombone.”

Now when the light goes out and the music stops and the curtains close
That’s when the heartbeat race
Sadness on your face, and you can’t take no more
I see you searching for your smile
We haven’t seen that in a while
Now when the light goes out and the music stops and the curtains close
That’s Sad Trombone

We never made much money, the ticket counts were light
We’d count the bars until we reached some hotel for the night
She was my morning coffee, the butter on my toast
‘Til she got a better offer from some outfit on the coast

Oh, there’s a sadness in my playing now
A desperate cry, a moan
Something in my choice of notes
Something in my tone
Sliding to the deepest bass from a lonely baritone
I guess I’ll always be the Sad Trombone
I guess I’ll always be the Sad Trombone

It’s an old, old story, and one you’ve probably heard
You start out in a major key, then you’re down a minor third
Aimlessly sliding, sinking like a stone
It doesn’t get no deeper, than the scraps that you’ve been thrown
But some things they just stay with you, long after they have flown
And it always comes back down, to the bone
And it always comes back down, to the bone
Down to the bone
Down to the bone
Down to the bone
Down to the bone
Down to the bone",Sad Trombone,2018
