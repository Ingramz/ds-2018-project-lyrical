Rob Wasserman,"Well up in the evening down in Mobile, Alabama
Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer
Gotta make some money to buy some brand new shoes
Trying to find somebody to take away these blues
""She don't love me"" hear them singing in the sun
Payday's coming and my work is all done

Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a tepee built right on the tracks
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles about

Everybody's trembling and running around
Picking up their money, tearing the tepee down
Foreman wants a penny about to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long
Can't stop the train, gotta let it roll on",Let It Rock,2013
Rob Wasserman,"When the road gets too long
And you run all out of song
And the pain gets too much
For you to bear

Turn around, turn around
Turn around, and I'll be there
Like a road, like a road
Leading home

When the gray clouds start to blow
And you need some place to go
When you want some company
That really cares

Turn around, turn around
Turn around, and I'll be there
Like a road, like a road
Leading home

When the [rain] is past and gone
And the road you're travelling on
Doesn't seem to be going
Anywhere

Turn around, turn around
Turn around, and I'll be there
Like a road, like a road
Leading home

Like a road, like a road
Leading home

When the road gets too long
And you run all out of song
And your pain gets too much
For you to bear

Turn around, turn around
Turn around, and I'll be there
Like a road, like a road
Leading home

Like a road, like a road
Leading home",Like a Road,2013
Rob Wasserman,"Out on the open highway
Such a lovely day but something's wrong
Something, something must be wrong

Just left home this morning
This old road keeps rolling on and on
Rolling, rolling on and on

Won't somebody help me?
Somebody help me?
Somebody help me?
Somebody help me

I've never been so lonesome and long way from home
Never been lonesome and long way
Never been lonesome and long way from home

Out on the open highway
Such a lovely day but something's wrong
Something, something must be wrong

Rob Wasserman,"I turn and walk away then I come 'round again
It looks as though tomorrow I'll do pretty much the same.

I must turn down your offer but I'd like to ask a break
You know I'm ready to give everything for anything I take.

Someone called my name you know I turned around to see
It was midnight in the Mission and the bells were not for me.

Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain,
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain,

Ten years ago, I walked this street my dreams were riding tall
Tonight I would be thankful Lord, for any dream at all.

Some folks would be happy just to have one dream come true
But everything you gather is just more that you can lose.

Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain,
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain,

All the things I planned to do I only did half way
Tomorrow will be Sunday born of rainy Saturday.

There's some satisfaction in the San Francisco rain
No matter what comes down the Mission always looks the same.

Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain.",Mission in the Rain,2013
Rob Wasserman,"I wanna say to my sisters and my brothers
Keep the faith
When the storm flies and the wind blows
Go on at a steady pace

When the battle is fought and the victory's won
We can all shout together we have overcome
We'll talk to the Father and the Son
When we make it to the promised land

If we walk together little children
We don't ever have to worry
Through this world of trouble
We gotta love one another

Let us take our fellow man by the hand
Try to help him to understand
We can all be together forever and ever
When we make it to the promised land

Our bible reads
Thou shall not be afraid
Of the terror by night
Nor the arrow that flies by day

Nor for the pestilence
That waiteth in the darkness
Nor for the destruction
That waiteth in the noon-day hour

If we walk together little children
We don't ever have to worry
Through this world of trouble
We gotta love one another

Let us take our fellow man by the hand
Try to help him to understand
We can all be together forever and ever
When we make it to the promised land

This world is not our home
We're only passing through
Our trail is all made up
Way beyond the blue

Let us do the very best that we can
While we're travelin' through this land
We can all be together shakin' a hand
When we make it to the promised land

If we walk together little children
We don't ever have to worry
Through this world of trouble
We gotta love one another

Let us take our fellow man by the hand
Try to help him to understand
We can all be together forever and ever
When we make it to the promised land

Make it to the promised land
We can all be together forever and ever
When we make it to the promised land

Walk together little children
We won't ever have to worry
Through this world of trouble
We gotta love one another
 
Let us take our fellow man by the hand

Quicker it opens, the sooner it closes

Rob Wasserman,"Stop that train: I'm leavin', today!
Stop that train: I'm leavin', anyway!
Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.

All my good life I've been a lonely man,
Teachin' my people who don't understand;
And even though I tried my best,
I still can't find no happiness.

So I got to say:
Stop that train: I'm leavin', oh, baby now!
Stop that train: I'm leavin', don't care what you say!
Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
Said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.

Some goin' east; and-a some goin' west,
Some stand aside to try their best.
Some livin' big, but the most is livin' small::
They just can't even find no food at all.

I mean, stop it:
Stop that train: I'm leavin', leavin', mm-hmm.
Stop that train: I'm leavin', I don't mind!
Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.

Stop that train: I'm leavin', leavin'!
Stop that train: I'm leavin', can't take it!

Rob Wasserman,"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,
Tangled up in blue.",Tangled Up in Blue,2013

Rob Wasserman,"Mary run around, sailin' up and down,
Looking for a shot in some direction.
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop,
Lord, you know they made a fire connection.

They love each other, Lord you can see that it's true,
Lord you can see that it's true, Lord you can see that it's true.

He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he choose this place beside her.
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say,
Nothing thay you need to add or do.

They love each other, Lord you can see that it's true,
Lord you can see that it's true, Lord you can see that it's true.

Its' nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
you better not be there when it rolls, over,
And when that train rolls in, you wonder where it's been,
You gotta try and see a little further.

Though you'll make a noise, just can't hear your voice.
All the dizzy ride on your cold shoulder.

Won't you believe what I say is true?
Everything I did I heard it first from you.

Everything I tell you, I heard it first from you.
Heard your news report, you know you're falling short.
Pretty soon, we'll trust you for the weather.
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been.
You got to try to see a little further.",They Love Each Other,2013

Rob Wasserman,"You know the night I met you
My eyes had been looking for you
All over everywhere
Over low roads, down highways, and bald deserts

You know the night
You know the night

Your eyes had this same shine about 'em, I noticed
And when I first looked through the wild, wayward mist
I felt such a warm friendly, cool sunny smile
That I wanted to look in your eyes for all time

And I felt like you feel
When you feel like the angels are curling your hair
And you feel like the devil is scratching your heel
I just felt like you feel
When you feel like the angels are curling your hair
And you feel like the devil is scratching your heel

Did you feel this way too when I met you?
You know the night I first met you
Did you look at me and think
Here's this guy who hopes like I hope
And sees the same kind of dreams I see
'Cause you wondered, I know
If your hopes could find shape
In the words that we used there to work back the fog
Your hopes and your plans for the good of the people
Could all of your hundred and one
Dreams just as bright as the sun
And all your wants and your hottest desires
Find shape in the flow of my talk?
You know the night
You know the night

And if my jellied brain turns to ashes and sand
There will still be such night smiles across all the land
There will still be such faces meeting here in the dark
And there around the corner, or maybe in the park
It's when we meet this way and we look at each other
We get a hold of our scattered aims and we bring em'

And you're out hangin' with your friends
So you say
Somehow I know it's not quite that way

It's getting pretty late
And you haven't checked on me all day
When I called you didn't answer
Now I'm feelin' like you're ignorin' me

I wish that you were home
Holdin' me tight in your arms
And I wish I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No, you don't deserve me

Wasted my time thinkin' 'bout you
And you ain't never gon' change
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way

When you touch me my heart melts
(And anything you did wrong I forgive) Yeah, yeah
So you play me and take advantage
Of the love that I feel for you

Why you wanna hurt me so bad
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad
Now I'm drowning in disappointment
And it's hard for me to even look at you

I wish that you were home, oh, yes, I do
Holdin' me tight in your arms, ooh, baby
And I wish I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me (I don't wanna hurt no more)
It just ain't fair (It just ain't fair, no) the way
you treat me
No, you don't desert me (You, you)

Wasted my time thinkin' 'bout you
And you ain't never gon' change (You ain't never gonna
change)
I wish I wasn't (I wasn't in love) in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way (I wouldn't feel this way)

Said you care about me, but from what I see
I ain't feelin' that, so I disagree
Gave you all my love and understanding
And you treated me like your enemy

So leave me alone, don't bother to follow me
Now just go back where you came from
This house is no longer your home
You are not welcome no, no, no more, no more

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me (You couldn't hurt me, baby)
It just ain't fair (It just ain't fair) the way you
treat me (The way you treat me)
No, you don't deserve me (You don't deserve me, baby)

Wasted my time (Oh, oh) thinkin' 'bout you
(Thinkin' about you)
And you ain't never gon' change (You're never gonna
change, never gonna change)
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me (You couldn't hurt me this
bad)
It just ain't fair (It ain't fair) the way you treat me

I'm wonderin' should I let you in
I open up the door and see
The flowers for me, so beautiful in your hand
You start beggin' me to take you back

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Tryin' to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah livin' the raw deal, three course meals spaghetti, fettuccine, and veal
But still, everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for tryin' to bury
Seven zeros, over in Rio Dijanery
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 everyday, that's my word
Swimmin' in women wit' they own condominiums
Five plus Fives, who drive Millineums

I get a fifty pound bag of Euk for the mutts
Five carats on my hands wit the cuts
In something European chromed out with a clutch, what (I wanna hold figures, fuck being a broke nigga)

Drinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers
Lost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals
Freakin' the three-quarter reptiles
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you

Don't let the melody intrigue you, 'cause I leave you
I'm only here for that green paper with the eagle

I'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picasso's
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's
Tienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa
And a Latin chick transportin' in the chocha
Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota
Avoidin' narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas
Stash in the building with this chick named Willona
From Daytona, when I was young I wanted to bone her
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, uh
Gangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown
Pinkie ringin', gondolas with the man singin'

If it's murder, you know she wrote it
German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deepthroat it
Know you wanna feel the womb 'cause it's platinum-coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, player-hatin' from the sidelines

Called the honey of super doom
She rode her five-legged beast
In a mirrored bikini right out of the womb

And then she grabbed a big old pipe
And smoked up some fine old monkey brains, get on it

Owned midget who was almost ten feet tall
He spray-painted UFO's are real
In the rubble of the Berlin wall

But all they had was jizz on the walls
And bones of a mangled priest

Look out

Now baby doll what do you say
When the spacemen comes to town
I think he's got a one-track mind
And he likes to boogie down
So in the end all she did was murder metropolis
And show us big ""fuck the world"" carved right onto her chest

To another broad, I mean cutie, with the nice round booty

That’s right, this is called the basement!
And my man cl smooth kick it for you like this

From the heights, not what am I write, simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I’m your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin' fella
So prepare for landing, and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the Buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stop
Now all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my er
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon I’m like a mink while you’re soon to pimp a raccoon stole
Vocal arrangement, ready set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave the basement

The basement, put the funk in grand
Here comes my man
My brother, grap lover, get wreck cousin, c’mon

Call me the grap lover, yes, the younger soul brother
Keep your eyes on the prize cause you won’t find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don’t slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people savior
Clockin' all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you’re soon to discover
Yo, that’s the kid from mecca and the soul brother
Yeah once in a while I be with cl on the dl
Or I flow with pete, and find my placement in the basement
The basement, yes where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace I gotta go, grapster’s out the door of the basement

Of the basement! next we got, a special guest
I ain’t gonna tell you who it is
C’mon, rap along

Tick tock tick, things are gettin' thick
Here comes the heavster, and I know it makes ya - sick!
To see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas I’m tellin' ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I’m never strapped
But I know a crew of young guns that’ll send you back
So easy does it on the dl
Peace to Pete Rock, and the mecca don cl
Heavy d’s on this track, lettin' you know there’s no replacement
Peace signin' off, check one two straight from the basement

Straight from the basement
I’m tellin' you now, kid
It’s crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin' up? 

Fourth but not least, the backbone of the wig out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin', upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the u.s. states, even London
Past time present, black to the future
Swimmin' in beats like a dolphin, so call me don shula
A raider well like art shell, crazy defense
A pro bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is cl smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The pimp daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin' from the basement

That’s right, crazy funky
Aw my man
He’s crazy funky, his name is rob-o, check him out

Ali-kazaam, you’ll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin' ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks life pays when
Kid said, Pete makes beats in the basement
Cold hit, the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I’d just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint’s bumpin' lovely
Walkin' down the street, much props, on the ? 
I hear voices sayin', that’s rob-o’dingo in the basement

Ah ha ha ha! hah yeah! this is funky!
I can feel it
My man from the Vernon, his name is di-da, make it raw

Fly like an eagle, a seagull
Always into somethin', like snoopy, the beagle
People, grab a tight hold of the sound
Hard, snatchin' raw papes off the shelves
Blowin' up spots from state to state
I’m comin' to town but you just can’t wait
Check the station, for conversation at six-block
Uno here, to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Thinkin' of crazy shit, like psychology
So speak the piece, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in the basement

In the basement, is where I dwell
Check the MC swell
Cause I am, crazy funky, with cl smooth

Robb Stewart,"Verse 1
 
 We must be kind
 And with an open mind
 We must endeavour to find 
 A way-
 To let the Germans know that when the war is over
 They are not the ones who'll have to pay.
 We must be sweet-
 And tactful and discreet
 And when they've suffered defeat
 We mustn't let
 Them feel upset
 Or ever get
 The feeling that we're cross with them or hate them,
 Our future policy must be to reinstate them.
 
 Refrain 1
 
 Don't let's be beastly to the Germans
 When our victory is ultimately won,
 It was just those nasty Nazis who persuaded them to fight
 And their Beethoven and Bach are really far worse than their bite
 Let's be meek to them-
 And turn the other cheek to them
 And try to bring out their latent sense of fun.
 Let's give them full air parity-
 And treat the rats with charity,
 But don't let's be beastly to the Hun.
 
 Verse 2
 
 We must be just-
 And win their love and trust
 And in additon we must
 Be wise
 And ask the conquered lands to join our hands to aid them.
 That would be a wonderful surprise.
 For many years-
 They've been in floods of tears
 Because the poor little dears
 Have been so wronged and only longed
 To cheat the world,
 Deplete the world
 And beat
 The world to blazes.
 This is the moment when we ought to sing their praises.
 
 Refrain 2
 
 Don't let's be beastly to the Germans
 When we've definitely got them on the run-
 Let us treat them very kindly as we would a valued friend
 We might send them out some Bishops as a form of lease and lend,
 Let's be sweet to them-
 And day by day repeat to them
 That 'sterilization' simply isn't done.
 Let's help the dirty swine again-
 To occupy the Rhine again,
 But don't let's be beastly to the Hun.
 
 Refrain 3
 
 Don't let's be beastly to the Germans
 When the age of peace and plenty has begun.
 We must send them steel and oil and coal and everything they need
 For their peaceable intentions can be always guaranteed.
 Let's employ with them a sort of 'strength through joy' with them,
 They're better than us at honest manly fun.
 Let's let them feel they're swell again and bomb us all to hell again,
 But don't let's be beastly to the Hun.
 
 Refrain 4
 
 Don't let's be beastly to the Germans
 For you can't deprive a ganster of his gun
 Though they've been a little naughty to the Czechs and Poles and Dutch
 But I don't suppose those countries really minded very much
 Let's be free with them and share the B.B.C. with them.
 We mustn't prevent them basking in the sun.

 But don't let's be beastly to the Hun.",Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans,2002

Hey, friend
Don't turn your back

Hey, brother
We're wasting time
I hurt you, now you hurt me
It's a life of crime

We don't have to walk 
That road alone

I know love lies sleeping

Forgive the past
Let the good things last
And brother together we can move on

So far away

What would you say

I tell you 
Say it now
Or we'll lose the grace,
That time has allowed

I heard a maid sing in the valley below

Remember the vows that you made to me truly
Remember how tenderly you nestled close to me
Gay is the garland, fresh are the roses
I've culled from the garden to bind over thee.

Here I now wander alone as I wonder
Why did you leave me to sigh and complain
I ask of the roses, why should I be forsaken,
Why must I here in sorrow remain?

Through yonder grove, by the spring that is running
There you and I have so merrily played,
Kissing and courting and gently sporting
Oh, my innocent heart you've betrayed

How could you slight so a pretty girl who loves you
A pretty girl who loves you so dearly and warm?
Though love's folly is surely but a fancy,
Still it should prove to me sweeter than your scorn.

Soon you will meet with another pretty maiden
Some pretty maiden, you'll court her for a while;
Thus ever ranging, turning and changing
Always seeking for a girl that is new.

Such a sadness in your eyes
Behind the poise, small talk and make-up
I could see what you labored so hard to disguise

What we both know there's so much that's unsaid
Though we try not to let it show
Too many words go unspoken now
We sit in silence and don't ask why

I'm the one who you told look don't touch
I'm the kid who wouldn't amount to much
I believe in the senses sight and sound
I have always been too loud

Won't you help me drown it out
I'm what I feel, what I'm feeling is surreal
I'm a mass of spinning wheels
Always digging in my heels
Now I've got the faith to

Fall back again
Crawl from the warm waters 
Water to air
You're on your feet again
Your feet again

Huh, this is what my daddy told me
I wish he would hold me a little more than he did
But he taught me my culture
And how to live positive

I never want to shame the blood in my veins
And bring pain to my sweet grandfather's face
In his resting place
I'll make haste to learn and not waste
Everything my forefathers earned in tears
For my culture

Fall back again
Crawl from the warm waters 
Water to air
You're on your feet again
Your feet again

Where the rainbow sighs
And the eagle crys to sun
We are all one, in the sun

And the white snow falls
To the sand, and to this face, 
And to these hands, and to where I stand
Up over yonder

Moving up a ways, over yonder
 
Where the sky elk talks
And the white bull walks in the rain

Wish I could say the save the world, like I was super girl
The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me
'Cause I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?

I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground

Come and take me
Love you save me

And the boys at the RR say she's a flat firebrand
Yeah but they don't know how the dirty words fair her
When she's tearin' up the bed with a natural goodtime man

I remember the night I met her
I was starin' down a G and T
When a gal let fly with an F-word
I had to look around and see
The bartender said ""Hey, buddy
Don't even let it cross your mind""
But I took her home, and I'm glad I did
'Cause I found the heart that the mouth kept hid
She's a whole different women when the lights get low

As filthy as a pig at a trough
Can turn to a perfect angel

Robbie Fulks,"A world filled with wonder, a cold, fathomless sky
A man's life so meager, he can but wonder why
He cries out to Heaven its truth to reveal
The answer: only silence, for God isn't real.

Go ask the starving millions under Stalin's cruel reign
Go ask the child with cancer who eases her pain
Then go to your churches, if that's how you feel
But don't ask me to follow, for God isn't real.


He forms in his image a weak and foolish man
Speaks to him in symbols that few understand
For a life of devotion, the death blow he deals
We'd owe Him only hatred, but God isn't real.

Go tell the executioner of the power he can't defy
Go tell his shackled victim of the mercy on high...
Then go to your churches, go beg, pray, and kneel,
But don't ask me to follow, for God isn't real.

Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di Surriento

Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
E una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Penso alle notti la in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia d'un elica

Senti il dolore nella musica
E si alzo dal pianoforte ma quando
Vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembro piu dolce anche la morte

Guardo negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assai ecc

Poi penso alla lirica, e al grande palco
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro ma due occhi
Che ti guardano, cosi vicini e veri

Ti fan scordare le parole
O in fondo I tuoi pensieri
Cosi diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti la in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita

Come la scia d'un elica
Ma si, e la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensava tanto
Anzi, si sentiva gia felice
E ricomincio il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai, ecc

Robbie Nevil,"Steam was rising
In the Asian quarter
When she stepped out in the street

Voices dropped 
And every eye was on her
As she braved the midnight heat

Dominique
She was a cool oasis
She could soothe the burning heart

Dreams of passion
Written on their faces
One by one they fall apart

Soldiers of fortune surrender
Like children
And follow wherever she leads

And they all fall down
It's on more night of

Dominoes, dominoes
Every heart is falling
But something else is calling 
Her into the night

(Can't you hear me)
Dominoes, dominoes
I'm coming back to find you
Don't let the shadows blind
You from love
When it's mine

To eyes that stared
She never shared emotion
It's a secret that she keeps

And no one sees
The tears that I see falling
Urgent whispers callin' me

Conquering heroes have soon
Fallen prey to that
Far away look in her eyes

And they all fall down
It's one more night of

So tired I can barely move

A few days off in his crazy world

Back on holiday
Isn't it time we had a vacation?
Back on holiday
Need a little rest and relaxation!

Tell the boss I'm not coming in
I'm busy taking it slow
No time to waste in a traffic jam.

Noon and night I think I've paid my dues
Pack my bags and I'm ready to make my getaway

He'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet
To rise in the world, he carried a hod

See, he'd sort of a tipplin' way
With love for the liquor poor Tim was born
To help him on with his work each day
He'd a drop of the craythur every morn'

Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

One morning Tim got rather full
His head felt heavy which made him shake
Fell from a ladder and he broke his skull
They carried him home, his corpse to wake

Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And laid him out upon the bed
A gallon of whiskey at his feet
And a bottle of porter at his head

Whack fol, de, dah
Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun

And misses Finnegan called for lunch
First she brought in tea and cake
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch

Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job
""Arrah"", biddy says, she ye're wrong, I'm sure
Biddy then gave her a belt on the gob
And left her sprawling on the floor

As I was sitting with my glass and spoon
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was ""The Jug Of Punch""

What more diversion can a man desire
Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire?
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

And if I get drunk, well the money's me own
And them that don't like me, they can leave me alone

And I'll be welcome wherever I go",Jug of Punch,1988

I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that ever I did

And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all",Parting Glass,1988
Robbie O'Connell,"There was a wild colonial boy, Jack Duggan was his name
He was born and raised in Ireland in a place called Castlemaine
He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
And dearly did his parents love the wild colonial boy

At the early age of sixteen years, he left his native home
And to Australia's sunny shore he was inclined to roam
He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, he shot James McAvoy
A terror to Australia was the wild colonial boy

One morning on the prairie as Jack he rode along
A listening to the mockingbird a singing a cheerful song
Out stepped a band of troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
They all set out to capture him, the wild colonial boy

""Surrender now Jack Duggan for you see we're three to one
Surrender in the Queen's high name for you're a plundering son""
Jack pulled two pistols from his belt and he proudly waved them high
""I'll fight, but not surrender,"" said the wild colonial boy

He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
And turning 'round to Davis, he received a fatal wound
A bullet pierced his proud young heart from the pistol of Fitzroy
And that was how they captured him, the wild colonial boy",Wild Colonial Boy,1988
Robbie O'Connell,"Oh, the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in

And the seas will split
And the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking

Oh, the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And know that it's for real
The hour when the ship comes in

Then they'll raise their hands
Sayin' we'll meet all your demands
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered
And like Pharaoh's tribe
They'll be drownded in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered",When the Ship Comes In,1993

Robbie Robertson,"Are you out there
Can you hear me
Can you see me in the dark

I don't believe it's all for nothing
It's not just written in the sand
Sometimes I thought you felt too much
And you crossed into the shadowland

And the river was overflowing
And the sky was fiery red
You gotta play the hand that's dealt ya
That's what the old man always said

Fallen angel
Casts a shadow up against the sun
If my eyes could see
The spirit of the chosen one

In my dream the pipes were playing
In my dream I lost a friend
Come down Gabriel and blow your horn
Cause some day we will meet again

Fallen angel
Casts a shadow up against the sun
If my eyes could see
The spirit of the chosen one

All the tears
All the rage
All the blues in the night
If my eyes could see
You kneeling in the silver light

Fallin', fallin', fallin' down
Fallin', fallin' down
Fallin', fallin', fallin' down
Fallin', fallin' down
Fallin', fallin', fallin' down
Fallin', fallin' down

Fallen angel
Casts a shadow up against the sun
If my eyes could see
The spirit of the chosen one

All the tears
All the rage
All the blues in the night
If my eyes could see
You kneeling in the silver light

If you're out there can you touch me
Can you see me I don't know
If you're out there can you reach me

Robbie Robertson,"It's way up in the Black Hills where we come from
There's a girl and she warned me don't pick up that gun
By the law of the land
By the promise that might is right
She would hold me and cry, don't you go off and fight

Somebody knocking at my door
Oh, I been called to war
Say goodbye to Tobacco Road
Wear my colors, call my brothers
For my country I'll go

Down on Hell's half acre (again)
Shakin' with fever (again)
Rumble in the jungle
Down on Hell's half acre (again)

She wrote me a letter and said what have they done
Placed a crown of thorns on this native son
Oh, maybe they're right, but maybe they're wrong
But what can I do, you're not here you're gone

Something in the air is much too quiet
Hear my heartbeat
The storms that rages from within
Three times thunder, blood runs cold
Got this wound on my soul

Down on Hell's half acre (again)
Walking on fire (again)
We got trouble in the wasteland
Down on Hell's half acre (again)

Back in the land where buffalo roam
Is this my home?
She said you've changed, you're not the same
Clouds of napalm and the opium
The damage was already done

The distant red neon shivered in the heat
I was feeling like a stranger in a strange land
You know where people play games with the night
God, it was too hot to sleep
I followed the sound of a jukebox coming from up the levee
All of a sudden I could hear somebody whistling
Fromright behind me
I turned around and she said
""Why do you always end up down at Nick's Cafe?""
I said ""I don't know, the wind just kind of pushed me this way.""
She said ""Hang the rich.""

The fields are empty, abandoned '59 Chevy
Laying in the back seat listening to Little Willie John
Yea, that's when time stood still
You know, I think I'm gonna go down to Madam X
And let her read my mind
She said ""That Voodoo stuff don't do nothing for me.""

I'm a man with a broad imagination

A wanted man with a haunted heart
Sonny found out the hard way

Playing for keeps, loser weeps

Struck by lightning, the fire is dying
And she called out your name
Sudden thunder, the sky is crying
Can't tell the tears from the rain

In these shoes, I've walked a crooked mile

Are you ready to blow the steam

Robbie Robertson,"I tried to reach you
On Valentine's Day
But how can I reach you
When you're so far away

Don't make me a victim
Don't make me the clown
With my arms reaching out
And my head hanging down

We can't go on
Touching the flame
Breakin the rules
Of the game

I bring you this cross
I carved out of wood
I'm just trying to tell you
That I'd change if I could

Grew up on the west side
Never even been to the east side
Don't know what they do with their lives
Over there over there

We can't go on
Hiding the pain
Breakin the rules
Of the game

We can't go on
Living in shame
Breakin the rules
Of the game

",Breakin' the Rules,1991
Robbie Robertson,"In this dusty little railroad town
Smack in the heart of the bible belt
Where nothing ever changes
While nothing remains the same
When first I saw the raven
Lean against the wind
I said who's the girl
With the tattoo on her skin
I followed her home
She lives down by the water
My friend Teddy told me
She's the Frenchman's daughter

On this day of reckoning
I'm riding shotgun with you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

When I come knocking on her front door
The neighbour said she don't live there no more
Well she moved from the country
Down to the city
Where the scene was dark
And the street was gritty
In the hustle and bustle and all the commotion
She got addicted to the locomotion

On this day of reckoning
By the old wooden bridge
I wait for you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

I remember the smell of the burning leaves
And we were making love
She was like a young Georgia O'Keefe
From another time
In an old abandoned railroad shack
On should never go
Where anything can happen
When the zephyr blows

On this day of reckoning
I'm calling to you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

The phone rings she said
I can't tell you where I'm calling from
Cause my papa's on the lam
For something shady that he's done
There hangs a tale of love
For the first time
For the first time

Robbie Robertson,"Crow has brought the message
to the children of the sun
for the return of the buffalo
and for a better day to come

You can kill my body
You can damn my soul
for not believing in your god
and some world down below

You don't stand a chance
against my prayers
You don't stand a chance
against my love
They outlawed the Ghost Dance
but we shall live again,
we shall live again

My sister above
She has red paint
She died at Wounded Knee
like a later day saint

blackbird in the sky
That's the sound that you hear
when the buffalo cry

You don't stand a chance
against my prayers
You don't stand a chance
against my love

but we shall live again,
we shall live again

Robbie Robertson,"The general rode for sixteen days
The horses were thirsty and tired
On the trail of a renegade chief
One he'd come to admire
The soldiers hid behind the hills
That surrounded the village
And he rode down to warn the chief
They'd come to conquer and pillage
Lay down your arms
Lay down your spear
The chief's eyes were sad
But showed no sign of fear

[Chorus:]
It is a good day to die
Oh my children dry your eyes
It is a good day to die

He spoke of the days before the white man came
With his guns and whisky
He told of a time a long time ago
Before what you call history
The general couldn't believe his words
Nor the look on his face
But he knew these people would rather die
Then have to live in this disgrace
What law have I broken
What wrong have I done
That makes you want to bury me
Upon this trail of blood

[Chorus:]

We cared for the land and the land cared for us
And that's the way it's always been
Never asked for more never asked too much
And now you tell me this is the end
I laid down my weapon
Laid down my bow
Now you want to drive me out
With no place left to go

[Chorus:]

And he turned to his people and said dry your eyes
We've been blessed and we are thankful
Raise your voices to the sky

And my people have called upon me to reply to you
And in the winds which pass through these aged pines
We hear the moanings of their departed ghosts

And if the voice of our people could have been heard
That act would never have been done
But alas though they stood around they could neither be seen or heard
Their tears fell like drops of rain

Sacrifice your freedom
Sacrifice your prayer
Take away your language
Cut off all your hair
Sacrifice the loved ones
Who always stood by me
Stranded in the wasteland
Set my spirit free

My name is Leonard Peltier
I am a Lakota and Anishnabe
And I am living in the United States penitentiary
Which is the swiftest growing
Indian reservations in the country

I have been in prison since 1976
For an incident that took place on the Oglala-Lakota Nation
There was a shoot-out between members of the American Indian Movement
And The F-B-I and the local Sheriffs State Troopers
Two agents were killed and one Indian was murdered

Three of us were charged with the deaths of the F-B-I agents
My co-defendants were found not-guilty by reasons of self-defense
My case was separated and I was found guilty before a jury of non-Indian people
The prosecutor stated that they did not know who killed their agents
Nor did he know what participation Leonard Peltier may have played in it
But someone has to pay for the crime

There's a lot of nights that I lay in my cell
And I can't understand why this hell this hell and this terror
That I have been going through for twenty-one years hasn't ended

Sacrifice your freedom
Sacrifice your prayer
Take away your language
Cut off all your hair
Sacrifice the loved ones
Who always stood by me
Stranded in the wasteland
Set my spirit free

But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay sacrifice
To make things better for our people
The sacrifice I have made when I really sit down to think about it
Is nothing compared to what our people a couple hundred years ago
Or fifty years ago or twenty-five years ago have made
Some gave their lives
Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arms
So the sacrifice I have made is nothing compared to those

Never want to stick around to the very last dance
Sometimes i stumble and take a hard fall
Loose (?) hold your grip off the wall

Shine your light down on me
Lift me up so i can see
Shine your light when you're gone
Give me the strength to carry on
Carry on

I thought i saw him walking by the side of the road
Maybe trying to find his way home

He's here but not here
He's gone but not gone
Just hope he knows if I get lost

Shine your light down on me
Lift me up so i can see
Shine your light when you're gone
Give me the strength to carry on
To carry on",Shine Your Light,2004

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

And an old man guards the home

Never gave a second thought
Never crossed my mind

I'm not the judgin' kind

I could take the darkness oh
Storms in the skies
But we all got certain trials
Burnin' up inside

Or silly souvenirs from far away
Don't leave me alone in the twilight

Does it make me any less than you
Why should I stand here and be judged

Been run off more than once for goin' underground
Where I met an old bluesman with a walking cane
He wore a stripe suit and used someone else's name

He said son I've seen it all
And it's not what you think
He said there's some tough choices to be made

Would not be moved to sell my soul

Rock you sinners
The demons are out tonight
Roll you sinners

Heard a gospel choir singing of war and peace
I was deeply moved so I stepped inside
I just stood in the back where I could easily hide

And pointed me out
She said Hallelu Hallelu
Oh then she began to shout

And if he sings a song then that song's been sung

Some things you can't change no matter what you do

Robbie Seay Band,"I'm gonna sing this song to let you know that you're not alone
And if you're like me, you need hope, coffee and melody
So sit back down and let the world keep spinning 'round
For yesterday's gone and today is waiting on you to show your face

And it might not be the prettiest thing that you'll ever see
But it's a new day, ah baby, it's a new day
And it might not look like a beautiful sunrise
But it's a new day, ah baby, it's a new day

I'm a pilgrim soul, I've traveled far and come back home
And this land is hard and cold for those who long to love
And I know it might seem that the world is crumbling
But it's me and you dancing in the kitchen at 2 A.M. and we're still alive

And it might not be the prettiest thing that you'll ever see
But it's a new day, ah baby, it's a new day
And it might not look like a beautiful sunrise
But it's a new day, ah baby, it's a new day

It's the calm of the storm that comes blowing in
It's the springtime saying I'm back again
The clouds that roll by crossing moonlight
Me and you, love, everything's alright

Standing in the rain with nowhere to go
Laughing and we're spinning and I hope that you
Remember this day for the rest of your life
Me and you, love, everything's gonna be alright

And it just might be the prettiest thing that you'll ever see
Well it's a new day, ah baby, it's a new day
If you look outside to see a beautiful sunrise
Well it's a new day, ah new day, it's a new day

And it just might be the prettiest thing that you'll ever see

People say that you're no good for me
So you love another
And she's making a fool of you
Oh
If you love me baby
Don't deny it
But you left me
And tell me
I should try it
Tell me I'm a baby
And I will understand

But to know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby
You could take me to heaven and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody's baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't need your freedom
Girl all I want right now is you

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day
Knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool
To give you all I do
Bet you someday
Baby
Someone says the same to you

But to know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby
You could take me to heaven and back

I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around, stick around

Heaven knows I was such a young boy
I didn't know what I wanted to be

I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me

To win the race? A prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV

But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
And now I'm gonna get me so happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Somehow the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah

What a kick just my buddies and me

We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on M-T-V (boys on M-T-V)

Oh yeah
And now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know

There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
And when you shake your ass
They notice fast
Some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get
That's what you get
I just hope you understand sometimes the clothes do not make theman
All we have to see now

Is that I don't belong to you

Can take you home where I live

I think it's time for me to not be home alone

Suppose I'll read about you in The Mirror
I think there's something everybody should know

And my pain walks down a one way street

And I know I'll always be blessed with love

She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead

Robbie Williams,"We didn't think it'd last beyond summer
I met her father she met my mother
We didn't have anywhere else to go
She said to me when we grow older
Will we still need young love on
Our shoulders
Does it just fade away
Will we ever know?

She touched my face and called me
Her lover
I never thought that I'd need another

[Chorus:]
Your cool suburban sun
You're foolin' everyone
You win some, you lose some

I didn't know what we had found
Just caught the bus and rode it to town
She wouldn't notice anything else but me

[Chorus]

Dancing at discos
And moaning at phone bills
Torremolinos and sun burnt in high heels
Swap it and sell it
And drop it and smell it
All those years ago

She touched my face and called me
Her lover
I never thought that I'd need another

Robbie Williams,"Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond a star
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
And we'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll meet just as before

Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
No more sailing
So long, sailing, sailing, sailing
Goodbye, farewell, my friend, no more sailing
So long, sailing, no more sailing
No more, farewell

No more
Oh, no more sailing
No more, no more
No more sailing
No more, one more time
No more sailing",Beyond the Sea [From Finding Nemo],2000

I feel it's time

Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup,
Wash it off
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind me now

I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

Unaware but underlined I figured out the story
It wasn't good
And in the corner of a mind I celebrated glory
But it wasn't to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me

We will never be uncovered again

Send black mariah for blue delusions
Lays heavy oh so heavy
On my mind

I'm so sick of people's expectations
Leaves me tired all the time
If your home's full of useless aggravation
Then don't bring it to mine

I seem to spend my life
Just waiting for the chorus
'Cause the verse is never nearly
Good enough

The hooligan half of me
That steals from Woolworths
While the other lives for love

I'm so sick of people's expectations
Leaves me tired all the time
If your home's full of worthless aggravation
Then don't bring it to mine

So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fails, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not

And not the words he would reveal

What they did that made you happy

And you gave me what I need

If they knew my name in every home
Kevin Spacey would call on the phone

Come back to the old five and dime

I make you smile all the time
and your conversation would complement mine

I will talk and Hollywood will listen
See them bow my every word
Mr. Spielberg look just what you're missing
Doesn't that seem a little absurd to bow at my every word

Buy up the rights to my book
And live on a ranch from what the box office took
I go on visit the set
They'll call me their savior
All the people wills come
Celebrity lives on the moon
But I'll be back home in June

Just a jack knife has Mac Heath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight

When the shark bites with his teeth, dear

Fancy gloves though wears Mac Heath, dear
So there's not a trace of red

On the sidewalk, Sunday morning
Lies a body oozing life
Someone's sneaking round the corner
Is the someone Mack the knife?

From a tug boat by the river
A cement bag's dropping down
The cement's just for the weight, dear
Bet you Mack is back in town

Louie Miller disappeared, dear
After drawing out his cash
And Mac Heath spends like a sailor
Did our boy do something rash?

Left my spirit unfed for too long 
I'm coming home to my family 
Where I can be strong 
Be who I planned to be 
Within me my ancestry 
Givin' me continuity 

Would it be remiss to continue in this way 
Would you rather I quit 
Come with that other shit
Making people's hips sway 
Lip service I pay, but I'm nervous 
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep 
Like a lifeline, I light lines 
'Cause my compassion is deep 
For the people who fashioned me, my soul to keep
And this is who I happen to be 
And if I don't see that I'm strong, then I won't be

This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
Than he did 
But he taught me my culture 
And how to live positive 
I never want to shame 
The blood in my veins and bring pain 
to my sweet grandfathers face 
In his resting place 
I made haste to learn and not waste 
everything my forefathers earned in tears 
For my culture 

Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
(For my culture) 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again. 

Hello Dad, 
Remember me? 
I'm the man you thought I'd never be. 
I'm the boy who you 
Reduced to tears 
Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years 
Yeah, that's right 
My name Rob 
I'm the one 
Who landed the popstar's job 
I'm the one who 
You told look, don't touch 
I'm the kid 
Who wouldn't amount too much. 

I believe in the senses that I sound 
I have always been too loud 
Won't you help me drown it out? 
And When I feel 
What I'm feeling is so real 
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel
Always digging in my heels 
Now I got the faith to 

Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again. 

Ha, lace up your booty 
Going back to the roots, continue my interlude 
Feed freakin' for loot 
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now 
And your forefathers further know how 
But now, what happened to the world without the hatred 
Use your head, if the needle is wise, be the thread 
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by best 
Spreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth

This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
than he did 
But he told me my culture 
And how to live positive 
I never want to shame 
The blood in my veins and bring pain 
To my sweet grandfathers face 
in his resting place 
I make haste to learn and not waste 
everything my forefathers earned in tears 
For my culture 

Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again 
(For my culture) 

Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
Your on your feet again 
Your feet again

The thunder of a scream
And you realise that it was yours
You don't know what to tell them
'Cause you don't know where you've been
And you've been late so many times before

It's only natural to feel like you're sinking
It's only human to be so unprepared

Don't worry baby

It's just a phase to get you through
Getting by
So you get a little restless
And you get a little wasted

She decided to quit just a little light entertainment
Embrace it
It might just save your life

You always say you're sorry
But you never know what for
And it's been happening more and more
Act your age and not your shoe size
And blah blah blah blah blah
That's your role model

Slammin' the door

So it's only natural to feel
The guilt of a nation
It's only human when your young
You're gonna cry

Don't worry baby
If you get a little high
It's just a phase to get you through
Getting by
So you get a little restless
And you get a little wasted
It's just a little light entertainment

So where else can you go to
Cause no one's given you the book
About what to say and how to feel
And what you should and shouldn't have took
It's feelings that your fearing

A book that no-one read
A film that never made me sad

One fine day
In the middle of the night

You'll wake up in it
One fine day

Remember when we never struggled through?
A bad time we never had
A love we never fell into
Please don't remind me to forget

'Cause forgiveness is a place
I ain't got used to yet

Was to radiate your home

So come reminisce about a time we didn't have

Robbie Williams,"It was me and my monkey
Him with his dungarees and Rollerblades
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft top down
He liked the wind in his face
He said ?Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said ?No' he said ?That's where we're gonna go, you need a change of place'
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he said
?I left my wallet in El Segundo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, and we've got a monkey bed'

Me and monkey
With a dream and a gun
Hoping my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and monkey
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand
Why he did what he did
Why he did what he did

And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor
He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages
Called up escort services and ordered some okie doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores
?Hi, my name is Sunshine. These are my girls. Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world'
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine
What's up, you better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good time'

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and my monkey
Like Billy the Kid
Trying to understand
Why he did what he did
Why he did what he did

Got tickets to see Sheena Easton
The monkey was high
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores
He couldn't sit still
Sheena was a blast baby
But my monkey was ill
When I played black jack
Kept hittin' 23
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey
I couldn't be sure
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
?My name is Rodriguez' he says with death in his eye
?I've been chasing you for a long time amigos
And now your monkey is gonna die'

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
We don't want to kill no Mexican
But we got ten itchy fingers
One thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare
You do not stare
You do not stare

Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy
And I ain't about to run
Put your gun down boy

Come soon",Monsoon,2003
Robbie Williams,"You said when you died that you'd walk with me everyday
And I started to cry and said please don't talk that way
With a blink of an eye and the Lord came and asked you to leave 
You went to a better place but they stole you away from me

And now she lives in heaven
But I know they let her out
To take care of me
There's a strange kind of light
Caressing me tonight
Pray silence my fear
She is near
Bringing heaven down here

I miss your love I miss your touch
But I'm feeling you every day
And I can almost hear you say
You've come a long way baby

And now you live in heaven
But I know they let you out
To take care of me
There's a strange kind of light
In my bedroom tonight
Pray silence my fear
She is near
Bringing heaven down here

You taught me kings and queens
While stroking in my head
In my darkest hour
I know you are there
Leaning down beside me
Whispering my prayers
There's a strange kind of light
Caressing me tonight
Pray silence my fear",Nan's Song,2003
Robbie Williams,"Don't fight the feeling, relax 
Oh child the knot's in your back 
'Cause you've been holding on 
I feel you when you're reaching out 

I'll talk you through memories 
Just keep breathing with me 
It's time to hold my hand 
And walk into the revolution 

When there's no one to touch 
And you've been thinking too much 
You only hurt yourself 
When it's all about retribution 

I see the pain in your face 
And praying rare for this space 
It's time to lead you on 
C'mon, it's a revolution 

When you can't keep on keeping on 
And everything you lean upon is all but gone 
Everybody falls sometimes 
But love shines on 
And on and on and 

With love in your eyes and a flame in your heart 
You're gonna find yourself some resolution 
A million miles with one step 
You'll find yourself yet

Talking about the revolution

Walking with the revolution

Taking you higher 

Old love lingers on 
You're just feelin it wrong 
I know you're tired 
But when it's time to sleep you're gone forever 

Make friends with your past 
And you can leave it at last 
It's time to find yourself 
Walking with the revolution 

And you can keep on keeping on and 
Everything you lean upon is all but gone 
Everybody hurts sometimes 
But love shines on and on and on and

Robbie Williams,"You can't manufacture a miracle
The silence was pitiful that day.
A love is getting too cynical
Passion's just physical these days
You analyze everyone you meet
But get no sign, love ain't kind
Every night you admit defeat
And cry yourself blind

[Chorus:]
If you can't wake up in the morning
Cause your bed lies vacant at night
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely
Can't control it, try as you might
May you find that love that won't leave you
May you find it by the end of the day
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely
Something beautiful will come your way

The DJ said on the radio
Life should be stereo, each day
In the past you cast the unsuitable
Instead of some kind of beautiful, you just couldn't wait
All your friends think you're satisfied
But they can't see your soul no, no, no
Forgot the time feeling petrified, when they lived alone

[Chorus

Some kind of beautiful (will come your way) [Repeat: x4]

All your friends think you're satisfied
But they can't see your soul no no no
Forgot the time feeling petrified
When they lived alone

Robbie Williams,"Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond a star
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
And we'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll meet just as before

Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
No more sailing
So long, sailing, sailing, sailing
Goodbye, farewell, my friend, no more sailing
So long, sailing, no more sailing
No more, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen to you
No more sailing
No more
Oh, no more sailing
No more, no more
No more sailing
No more, one more time
No more sailing",La Mer (Beyond the Sea),2003
Robbie Williams,"One eye on the shadows,
Protectin' his fellows,
From sun up to the moon on his back.
Sent the villains to Hades,
A hit with the ladies,
A stallion in the sack.

You can't get your life back,
When right follows left, Jack.
The more you see, the less you know.
When others would leak it,
His service is secret,
Plays God when it's your time to go.

Queen and country, safe and sound,
With villains six feet underground.
And no-one knows 'cause no one's found
Any trace of a man for all seasons,
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone.
So alone.

And you and I wouldn't have a clue,
Who's doin' what, why, when and who,
Up a creek with no canoe,
Watch out! For the man for all seasons,
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone.
(But safe at home!)

From the House of Lords, saving Norfolk broads,
Commoners and landed gentry.
His word is Bond, whether brunette or blonde.
Baby, it's so elementary.

For the man never did stop your life with one stare,
See the film! [Johnny English]
You'll know how it goes.

But this ain't no fiction, just check the diction:
Quid pro quo, a pro's pro!
Aaaand fellas...
Don't be jealous, when they made him,
They broke the mould.
So charismatic, with an automatic,
Never prematurely shooting his load.

Ha!

Queen and country, safe and sound,
With villains six feet underground.
And no-one knows 'cause no one's found
Any trace of a man for all seasons,
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone.
So alone.

And you and I wouldn't have a clue,
Who's doin' what, why, when and who,
Up a creek with no canoe,
Watch out! For the man for all seasons,
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone.
So alone... (But safe at home!)

But safe at...
But safe at...
But safe at...
But safe at home!

But safe at...
But safe at...

With villains six feet underground.
And no-one knows 'cause no one's found
Any trace of a man for all seasons,
Loves 'em and leaves 'em alone.
So alone.

I didn't write your songs
When we were going out
So why should I start now
You are not about

I feel as though all the past in closing in on me
I found a photograph
Of me and Kimberley

We hardly used to even drink
We didn't smoke
We'd walk home from the pub
'Cause we were always broke
So when your mother called
And said that you were dead
I thought she's talking of
Another Kim instead

I feel as though all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph
Of me and Kimberley

She said it seemed
You accidentally overdosed
It was so long since I talked to her
And once we were so close
And I am left with all these things
I didn't say
And a picture of you in my arms
The day you went away

I feel as though all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph
Of me and Kimberley
I feel as though all the past is closing in on me

Robbie Williams,"Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond a star
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
And we'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll meet just as before

Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
No more sailing
So long, sailing, sailing, sailing
Goodbye, farewell, my friend, no more sailing
So long, sailing, no more sailing
No more, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen to you
No more sailing
No more
Oh, no more sailing
No more, no more
No more sailing
No more, one more time
No more sailing",Beyond the Sea,2004
Robbie Williams,"When we were only 17
And thrown into society
That was the end of you and me
From what we could have been

And if we didn't keep in touch
I guess we didn't care that much
We never understood that stuff
But now I need you

I never meant to let you down
But lettin' you down was easy

Didn't it break your heart
Maybe I'm just too needy
Do any of you still need me
In your lives, in your heart

Don't say yes just to please me
If you're still you and you aren't
But don't say no

We fought together laughed together
Said things that we hoped were clever
The thought of missing you forever
Makes me wanna cry

And now that you've grown up to be
A sentimental memory
Are you still you 'cause I'm still me
At least I hope so

A life beginning somewhere else
It was our time to die

Didn't it break your heart
Maybe I'm just too needy
Do any of you still need me
In your life, in your heart

Don't say yes just to please me
If you're still you and you aren't
Don't say no

So, what do you know?
Where do you go, has it been fun?
Oh, did you survive being buried alive
Like I did?

Didn't it break your heart
Maybe I'm just too needy
Do any of you still need me
In your life, in your heart

Don't say yes just to please me
If you're still you and you want
Don't say no

Didn't it break your heart
Maybe I'm just too needy
Do any of you still need me

Robbie Williams,"I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go
When we're grey and old

'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head

And I feel that love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love

And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

Waiting for god,
To stop this.

And darkness.
Everyone around you was corrupted, 
Say something.

There's no dignity in death,
To sell the world your last breath.
Your still fighting over everything you left,
Oh.

I saw you standing at the gate,
When Marlon Brando passed away.
You had that look upon your face,

But you.

No one really gave a damn,

For one of us
I always thought it was for you

I'll never leave
I'll always love
You know that all those words are dead
Buried in yours tonight
Move aside
I'm taking you home

I cannot hear what you say
Except for the occasional word
Sulphates a sentimental sight it bothers me
No longer king of bloke and bird

All of my life
Searching hard
Down in the wires
Of love

Summer me now summer my life away
Summon me onto another day

A hand through the clouds keeps
Knocking me down
It's no less than I deserve
They built museums I don't visit them
I've made enough trouble of my own

Into the night
Searching hard
Look for the light
Of love

Summer me now summer my life away
Summon me on to another day

Summer the evening, winter ways
Are falling down again
I sing from the chaos in my heart, my heart

Makes life worth living
Shoving the shoes out in the light
She walks in, I can hear her",King of Bloke and Bird,2005

Sticks her handbag on the chair

Puts hers handbag on the chair
And she weights the words we shared
When we were fifteen and still cared
'Cause she feels I'm a scar from the wound
That time can't heal

And I said
Don't let your dreams out of your head
Stick it to the man instead
Don't fool your heart lying about
The feelings that you had back then
Did you try to change your life?
Did you ever try to change your life?
You repeat and repeat
And repeat and repeat
Now what's up with that?

Now she loves somebody else
In flash clothes
She was the girl with the acid stare
And now she'd pay to have one of those

And she weighs the word she says
And she knows you exist

Robbie Williams,"There's no earthly way of knowing
What was in your heart when it stopped going
The whole world shook
A storm was blowing through you

Waiting for God to stop this
And up to your neck in darkness
Everyone around you was corrupted
Say something

There's no dignity in death
To sell the world your last breath
We're still fighting
Over everything you left

I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space

No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

Through your eyes the world was burning
""Please be gentle, I'm still learning""
You seemed to say as you kept turning up

They poisoned you with compromise
But at what point did you realize
Everybody loves your life but you?

A special agent for the man
Through Watergate and Vietnam
No one really gave a damn
Do you think the C.I.A. did?

I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space

No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

No one learned from your mistakes

Going to waste

I don't want to die
But I ain't keen on living either
Before I fall in love
I'm preparing to leave her

Robbie Williams,"It was me and my monkey
Him with his dungarees and roller blades
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft top down 
He liked the wind in his face
He said ""Son, you ever been to Vegas?' 
I said ""No"" he said ""That's where we're gonna go, you need a change of place""
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he said 
""I left my wallet in El Segundo"" and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel 
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
""If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, and we've got a monkey bed""

Me and monkey 
With a dream and a gun
Hoping my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and monkey 
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did

And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor
He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages 
Called up escort services and ordered some oki doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores 
""Hi, my name is Sunshine. 
These are my girls. 
Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world""
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine 
""What's up?""
""You better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good time""

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone 
Me and my monkey 
Like Billy the Kid
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did

Got tickets to see Sheena Easton
The monkey was high
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores
He couldn't sit still 
Sheena was a blast baby
But my monkey was ill
When I played black jack 
Kept hittin' 23
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey
I couldn't be sure
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before 
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run 
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
""My name is Rodriguez"" he says with death in his eye
""I've been chasing you for a long time amigos
And now your monkey is gonna die""

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
We don't want to kill no Mexican 
But we got ten itchy fingers 
One thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare 
You do not stare
You do not stare

Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy
And I ain't about to run 
Put your gun down boy

Robbie Williams,"I smoked Consulates and Park Drive, drank Nookie Brown
Learned how to skive
Polo mints to hide my breath from my mum
Did a little weed cause it felt like fun
Did a little bit of speed if my friend had some
Nicked Volkswagen badges I'm a Beastie Boys son
Me so horny, me so young and I still get my washing done
Auntie Joe died of cancer God didn't have an answer
Rhythm was a dancer
Any room for a chancer? That's me in the corner, thanks sir!
I wore a troop track suit, British Knights shoes, Kangol hat like LL Cool's
Before I was 'avin it, 'avin it large
They nicked the BMX from out my garage
Knew it was Tier from off the estate cuz every time he'd see me, he'd smile like we were mates
From then on in I'd have to walk to me Nan's
And I'd dream my dreams through a sea of prams
Like a hooligan on the football stands
And I'd throw the v's to Leeds and West Ham
Then I ran, I ran so far away down Scotia Road to a taxi bay
Then I ran again cuz I couldn't pay, a Muslim didn't get his fare that day
I apologize today

Things are better when they start
That's how the 80s broke my heart

And who are you calling poof? You like Wham, man, I hate that stuff
And then my grandad died and left a hole in the family and lots of women had to nanny me
School was a laugh, they didn't have ADD, thick was the term they used for me
(Over and over)
Repeatedly
(Over and over)

Take my breath away take my breath away
Bidly bidly bidly bong
Pass it on the left hand side, right turn, Clyde

That girl in the fourth year, got pregnant and she was raised Catholic, brilliant!
I cried, she cried, we cried, her youth died
Drank cider in the cemetery
The year above us had discovered E and I said it weren't for me
?12.50? I could rob me mum's purse and buy one off chalcky
Met a girl on Monday, drank fizzy pop on Tuesday
Fingered her on Wednesday and on Thursday and Friday and on Saturday
Dumped by Sunday

Things are better when they start
That's how the 80s broke my heart
The wonder years, I've played my part
That's how the 80s broke my heart

Like I said, I lost my virginity to a girl called Anne-Marie, well she said she fancied me
And then she said ""fuck me"" and I thought 'fuck me, I'm all talk and it'll be over too quickly'
And it was but I couldn't care less, I'd seen a girl's part,made a mess on her dress, oh yes!
You're now rocking with the best, second person in my year that had seen a breast
I'm in my 30s now and I'm still impressed
Where are the Falklands mum? And what have they done?
Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from?

It's the 80s, what you looking at, ya mong?
So young, so long, so young, so long
Too short, so long
What you looking at ya mong?
Too short, so long, too short, so long
So long.",The 80's,2006
Robbie Williams,"Picking up the story from where I left off, it's 1990 now so school can fuck off
I got no GCSEs, nothing higher than a D,
I couldn't tell me mum because she'd batter me
Me and Tate sat on the bowling green, life is a shitter
We had five quid between us and bought six cans of bitter
I took me ten Benson home and I smoked through the sorrow
If I could just avoid me mum maybe I'll tell her tomorrow
I stumbled through the door and said ""Mum, it's like this.""
She said ""That man's been on the phone and you've made the list!
You're in that boy band, son, come and giz a kiss!""
Phoned up Martin and Rich and carried on getting pissed
""Boys I don't believe it, I'm gonna be famous!
Pick you up in a Porsche and buy you lots of trainers.""
I met the other guys, one seemed like a cock
I think it's gonna be like New Kids on The Block

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Do you know who you are, baby?

(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)

I adopted four brothers, some I liked more than others
One was like a brother from another mother
But the lead singer made it hard to like him
But I still loved him, to spite him
The first three months, you know, I nearly quit
I played snooker with me dad he said ""Don't be a dick!
Unload the bullets, your mind is a gun,
You're gonna shoot yourself when they're number one!""

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Do you know who you are, baby?

(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)

Now it's dinner with Versace, lunch with Princess Diana
And I'm gonna get battered if I go out in my manor
Because as much as we were loved we were also hated
The boys got jealous cause the girls got plated
Now we're famous and that, and we're dancing and that
And I'm thinking ""I can sing, Why am I stood at the back?""
So fuck the band give me Sambuca and gak
We're all a bag of nerves and not a band of brothers

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Do you know who you are, baby?

(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)

And now it's breaking my heart because the dream's turned to shit
It ain't broke but I'll break it in a little bit
And I'm always in trouble but I've stopped saying sorry
Everybody's worried ""What the fuck's wrong with Robbie?
He's not answering his phone, he's not talking to me
I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury.""
And now I'm running away from everything that I've been
And I'm pissed and I'm fucked and I'm only nineteen
I can't conform no more, I can't perform no more
But the boys know I'm fucked and so they show me the door
And if truth be told I wasn't fit enough to stay
So I put my head down and walked away.

That was the 90s; 90 to 95

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby

Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in the jungle
I started bangin' my first bongo

Every monkey'd like to be
In my place instead of me
Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby
I'm the king of bongo bong

I went to the big town
Where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Looking for a bigger crown

I play my boogie
For the people of big city
But they don't go crazy
When I'm bangin' in my boogie
I'm the ""king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong""
Hear me when I come baby
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come 

Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me
Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie
I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town
I'm the king of bongo, baby
I'm the king of bongo bong

king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come baby
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come

They say that I'm a clown
Making too much dirty sound
They say there is no place for little monkey in this town

Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie

Hear me when I come

Bangin' on my bongo all that swing belongs to me

Robbie Williams,"When he saw her getting off the bus
It seemed to wipe away the years
Her face was older, just a little rough
But her eyes were still so clear
He drank his coffee and he hurried out
Across before she walked away
Then he approached her like a little child
Too scared for what he had to say

""Hello Louise,
Remember me?
Now should we part
Or stay awhile?
As if we were still lovers""

She took a moment just to recognise the man she'd known so well before
And as he started to apologise
Lose any bitterness she bore
She gently put her finger on his lips
To let him know she understood
And with her suitcase standing on the floor
Embraced him like a lover would

He told louise
""You look so good
It's just you see
You make me feel
As if we were still lovers""

It's not always true that time heals all wounds
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal
The memories of something really good
Something truly real, that you never found again

As if we were still lovers

And though they talked just for just a little time
Before she said she had to go
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign
That told him all he had to know

And so Louise
Waved from the bus
And as she left
She gave that smile
As if they were still lovers

Suburbia's a slipstream
To a memory
Of a time when you were
Close to me
I pretend
I'm there again
I close my eyes and see you
Better than before
Then I feel you touch me
And it's 1984
I know what you will say
Before you start
In my heart

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Every thought's a fashion
Or a crime
And every boy is just
A waste of time
But I pretend
It was different then
Maybe it's a habit
Maybe it's a sin
But I find out
When I try it on
It crawls beneath my skin
Once it gets inside me
It won't go
Now I know

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Rent
Shopping
Being boring
It's alright
It's a sin

I want a lover

What have I? What have I?
What have I done to deserve this?

Till I get to say sorry
I get hysterical, historicals, of love it's just chemical
Give us something to stop me
Only you
Know me

Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday
You don't know 'cause you're not there
You simply found the words to make all modern feelings fade away
Only you
Know me

What are you thinking?
I done bruised up my mind with this thunderbird wine

I pray for my sanity
Where we don't have to answer to anyone 'bout anything

This is not like a brochure
Flying cars and sex machines
We are all so compliant
'Cause everything is what it seems
And it can't be the satellite
To tell you how loved you are
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

You've been bending so long now
You think it's standing up
And they line up behind you to build you up, buttercup
We can lose all meaning
Quicker than a credit card
And not everyone's healing, so try your best and don't love too hard
Cause they can't build a satellite
To tell you what's in your heart
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

Will I ever feel the waking
Naked as a lullaby
Don't ask me to explain again
I can't lie to my heart and I

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

Now we can put it down to circumstance, our childhood, then our youth
Out of some sentimental gain I wanted you to feel my pain,
But it came back return to sender

My tears could fill the Albert Hall,
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

What a shame we never listened
I told you through the television
And all that went away was the price we paid
People spend a lifetime this way
Oh what a shame.

So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus, oh
And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us
I wrote a letter in my mind,
But the words were so unkind,
About a man I can’t remember
I don’t recall the reasons why,
I must have meant them at the time
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

What a shame we never listened
I told you through the television
And all that went away was the price we paid
People spend a lifetime this way
And that’s how they stay
Oh what a shame.

Words come easy
When they’re true

Never cries, never open her eyes

Across the pond, it's afternoon, and the union jack flies high
We're on our first cup of coffee
We're on our third cup of tea
And we can't pretend to live on different planets, you and me

In this collision of worlds
Watch the new day dawn on a distant shore
In this collision of worlds
Oh, you can't sit this out no more

Abbey Road, Route 66
CIA to the MI-6
Right lane, left lane
Metric, imperial, pounds, dollars
Howdy, cheerio
That V8 growl to a V12 scream
Hail to the chief, well, God save the queen!
Cops, bobbies, Tabasco, Wasabi
Pistachio ice cream!

Well it's too late, you can't stop it now
In this collision of worlds
Yeah, find you a place and just watch it now, watch it now

Yeah, you're a good ol' boy
Well, you're a decent bloke
I say it's irony, I say it's a joke
When I look around, now I can see
We ain't so different, you and me

Meat and potatoes, bangers and mash
Dollars, pounds, dosh, cash
Autobahn, to the rising sun
The I10, to the M1
Congress, parliament, president, the queen!
Petrol, you say gasoline
Now grab your bird, and get your girl
Now it's a small world!

Watch the new day dawn on a distant shore

No, you can't sit this out no more

Robbie Williams,"I was there to witness
Candice's inner business
She wants the boys to notice
Her rainbows, and her ponies
She was educated
But could not count to ten
How she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men
And I say

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high
But in the hole there's water
You can get some, when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she's made of candy

Ring a ring of roses
Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them
Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high
But in the hole there's water
As you win
She'll be the Hollywood love
And if it don't feel good
What are you doing this for
Now tell me

Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low

Robbie Williams,"We became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:

At last, we meet on no man's land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say

Not in the eyes, no not in his eyes anymore
His eyes

All that I want
Is to pick you up and out of that dress
Carry it to the depths
And feel the sin of your flesh
It’s all that I want

Arching your back with that look on your face
All that need’s an hour and space
When did it change?
I guess when we started sweeping on the carpet

I’ll talk you to sleep
And no one will know

Something deep inside me dies,
'Cause I know you won't get better, better, better
You'd rather be right done with love,
The only thing I understood
Nothing's ever good enough.

I stumble through the words as they're leaving me,
Tremble at the side of Your Majesty,
And I cut myself just to get them out.

This time I'll be different, I promise you,
This time I'll be special, you know I will,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes.
This time I'll be better, I want you to know,
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

You took my youth, you took my health,
And if you're not here I find myself
You're supposed to make this better, better, better
No self-control and no reason why,
If I don't change, then we both die,
This is it for you and I.

Blisters at the end of my fingertips,
Praying to a god I don't think exist
Will you listen now?
Can you forgive me somehow?

This time I'll be different, I promise you,
This time I'll be special, you know I will,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes.
This time I'll be better, I want you to know,
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

Closer now to the end,
If love was the answer,
Then hope was the question
Closer now, let's pretend
We've never been out here before.

This time I'll be special, you know I will,

Why? So I just scream and shout

I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Everybody's looking at me, but I don't see them
Living for the weekend, caught in the deep end
Tryin'a tread water, do it for my unborn daughter
Lamb to the slaughter, life's getting shorter
Tryin'a get high off a quarter
I'm fly in a saucer, my life is a corker
Star, pop bottles, date top models
Middle finger in the air, not a care, going full throttle
Where's the love though?
Nobody cares about that, where's the club?
Where's the drugs though? Front row
Follow the flow, Megaupload
Feel the adrenaline rush, who's the mug though? I don't know

Now pass me a shot, and make it a double

It's all or nothing, I don't wanna juggle
No crabs in a bucket, I don't wanna huddle
I've got my own name, tryn'a figure out the whole game
Going insane, 150 in the slow lane
Getting ahead of myself
I'm already thinking how can I better myself
Should I be somebody else? Should I be pacing myself?
I'm high as a rocket, and if I get too carried away
There would be no one to stop it

Except for one or two.

Some of them are mean.
Most of them are twisted.
Few of them are clean.

Just keep it simple.
You don't have to kiss though.
Don't waste time whit the idiots
Think that they're heroes.
They will betray you.
Stick with us weirdos.

For all your days and nights
I'm gonna be there,
I'm gonna be there, yes I will.
Go gentle through your life.
If you want me I'll be there.
When you need me I'll be there for you.

Don't try to make them love you.
Don't answer every call.
Baby be a giant.
Let the world be small.
Some of them are deadly.
Some don't let it show.
If they try and hurt you.
Just let your daddy know.

Now when you go
Giving your heart make sure they deserve it.
If they haven't earned it.
Keep searching, it's worth it.

For all your days and nights (days and night)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)

With my hair down in my eyes 
And she says hi 
And I hurry to the breakfast table 
While the kids are going off to school, goodbye 
And she reaches out and takes my hand 
And squeezes it and says ""how you feelin' Hon?"" 
And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart 
And I see my morning sun 
And if that's not loving me 
Then all I've got to say 

God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
There's no such thing as Dr. Suess 
Disneyland and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feeling low 
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind 

Sometimes I call him up knowing he's busy 
And ask if he could get away and meet me 
And maybe grab a bite to eat 
And he drops what he's doing and hurry's down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
He sits waiting patiently and smiles when he first sees me 
Because he's made that way 
And if that's not loving me 
Then all I've got to say 

God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes 
There's no such thing as make believe 
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves, no B.B. guns 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time 
And when my self is feeling low 
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind",Little Green Apples,2013

We are mad motherfuckers

And I'd like to sing a song that says that you'll be fine
But now you know me so you know that I'd be lying
One of the things you get from me and your mother
Is that we're bad motherfuckers, sure, you're a bad motherfucker

We all believe, that you're gonna break the chain
We all believe, that you're the one
We all believe, that the angels are watching over you, my son

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines 
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line 
Oh-oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run 

Yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend 
I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
And strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
Oh-oh, will you walk with me out on the wire 
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe, I want to know if love is real 

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight 
In an everlasting kiss 

One two three four!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
Everybody's out on the run tonight 
But there's no place left to hide 
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness 
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
Oh-oh, someday girl I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place 
Where we really wanna go 
And we'll walk in the sun

Robby Balboa,"Introduction â?? Trials
We have a whole lot of superstars on this stage here tonight,
And I want you to know one thing, this isâ?¦

Verse 1 â?? Suffa
Hilltop, that's where the blood runs,
Thick, it's where kings bury there loved ones,
Sick, kids guard their crop with a slug gun,
From rips, move like Schapelle on a drug run,
So quick, there's kids in the park waiting,
These are my poison diaries like Mark Latham,
So start hating, though you know in your heart,
We've been owning this art since our flow in the park.

Verse 2 â?? Mortar
You can't serve me like Serena and Venus,
Comparatively I leave you looking like the machinist,
Cats know they've been hit, when I spike the mic level,
And draw blood like intravenous,
Without a pencil I'm hell bent,
Leave dents in the condenser, you can tell when,
Mortar's been in the booth to rhyme,
I don't scratch vinyl, I scratch up the mic with my canines.

Verse 3 â?? Trials and Sesta
Mr Trials, young ladies jump in the sack,
I never kiss and tell instead I fuck it and brag,
I'm an angry drunk when I'm grabbing a rum,
And skull shots till we fall from grace like Eric Clapton's son,
South of the country, west of the city,
Chip into that kitty if we're going to be drinking until the skank pretty,
Will he attack? When he snap, got the track like,
Bring it back, hear him rap? Isn't that Funkoars?
You can find us staggered in a cipher,
Turning human traffic to a five car pile up,
We leave them all for dead,
I used to think big till it killed L, Pun, Smalls and Kev,
Like bad move, got you looking like you're eavesdropping the devil,
And T set the theme to send them to hell,
Bet on it, you're never better, I tell them again,
Seddy bury every adversary he put against.

Verse 4 â?? Hau
Fresh off the boat with an impressive approach,
To writing rhymes like pressing your throat,
The unquestionable dopeness, and oh yes,
It's the one and only, in the house like the gun is on me
Got you gronks saying blimey he's clever,
He's brighter than that sun in the shiniest of weather,
Girls you want diamonds forever?
Well throw your hymens the sky if you feel the vibe.

Verse 5 â?? Drapht
None of gravities properties are on top of me,
Can't hold me back from taking a stab like Chopper Read,
Can't hold me back, I'm back around again like stalkers,
My mic holds a force like a sword or a tomahawk,
To Conan, walking with no man now,
'cause you freeze when you spit like a snow mans mouth,
Arouse with every word, first you've got to know this,
We don't belong together like Rove and showbiz.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.

Verse 6 â?? Vents
The saga begin, RPM drama again,
My lung burn, dangerous carcinogen,
Starving like Stalin in parliament in Prague again,
In camouflage targeting,
In Rock Creek Park, carve terror in the bark,
Blueprint, build pyramids in the dark,
The blood run deep, renegade creep,
Hilltop connect bro, centigrade heat.

Verse 7 â?? Muphin and Pegz
Muph, some give me shit for my name,
But I don't give a shit about you shit for brains,
Been a long while so I know the game,
It's more about music than your clothing range,
We're here to overtake, setting the standard,
Obese crew, we're the devilish family,
Stand on stage accepting a Grammy,
For the most incredible rapping since edible panties,
Unforgettable pansies in a flickering fit,
Knickers in a twist in a spiral of shit,
Undeniable gift with decipherable spits,
My fireball pit will burn you Muppets,
True rugged, blue blooded dignitary,
Crews love it when we do something visionary,
Move up never lose touch, living ready,
This is the hard road cargo hitting heavy.

Verse 8 â?? Robby Balboa
Robby Balboa bless the text,
Deliver you ticket to death,
Rivers of rhythm ripping the flesh,
Triple your bets on the primitive pest,
Selling sick smut from the cinema steps,
It begins with a breath, a kid killing his pets,
Just sitting in debt when I'm feeling a wreck,
Life's a bitch and so we're wringing her neck,
Fuck a metro in a pink shirt 'cause we're kicking the set.

Verse 9 â?? Honz
The Funkoars and the Hilltop, yes, we still rocking it,
And I ain't going near your bill unless we fucking topping it,
I drink till I'm all over the shop like barcodes,
And as far as rap goes, I've mastered my flows,
Certified and we back again to wreak havoc,
With these pads and pens so understand my friend,
We about to take over just like Hove spit it,
To the most gifted get them glasses up and toast with us.

Verse 10 â?? Pressure
Pressure MC, born with a mechanical mind,
The talent of rhyme, instinctual like animal kind,
Now I flow with the best, from east coast to the west,
We live in the flesh like my raps sewn in your chest,
You can't fathom the dopest flow, amateurs don't you know,
What ever happened to a good old fashioned broken nose?
Don't become a casualty of my faculty,
Damn I got spine but you'll never see the back of me.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.

Robby Benson,"There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so I'm sure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be
True, that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Well, who'd have thought?
Well, bless my soul
Well, who'd have known?
Well, who indeed?

And who'd have guessed They'd come together on their own?
It's so peculiar

Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah,
Someday I'm going to make her mine.",Her Majesty,1983
Robby Krieger,"Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all of your hope is gone,
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion,
And your world around is crumblin' down;  
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach on out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you.
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through.
I'll be there to always see you through.
 
When you feel lost and about to give up 
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold, 
And you're drifting out all on your own, 
And you need a hand to hold:
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you, 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you.
I'll be there to love and comfort you.
 
I can tell the way you hang your head,
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need, 
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me.",Reach Out (I'll Be There),1983
