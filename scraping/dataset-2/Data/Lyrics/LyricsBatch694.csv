Just another day, selling ice cream in the bay 
And fools trying to get him for his pay 
But Master P don't play, it's all about money
Just another day, selling ice cream in the bay 
And fools trying to get him for his pay 
But Master P don't play, it's all about money

I'm in the southside with ghetto cheese, or should I say ice cream
72 oz's, players I mean 2 ki's
For all you niggas that smokes 
I got my homies with the gats posted by the liquor store 
Cause we ain't takin no shorts, in the 9 scrilla
Say what you want fool I guess I'm a drug dealer 
>From the southside of Richmond, California
Where niggas run through with gats all up on ya
You better break North or South, before we take you out
Ain't no love in this motherfuckin' crackhouse 
Lay down on the floor bitch break me off
Before you meet my little partner Mr.Sawed-off
I'm goin crazy, Indonesia
Blowin' up the brown sticky nigga bout to please you
With this ketchup, watch I'll wet ya
Ain't no gettin up cause your in a mess bro

Just another day, sellin' ice cream in the bay 
And fools trying to get him for his pay

But Master P don't play, it's all about money

[Verse 2]

Drop the top on the Regal, shot a desert eagle
Candy cane switches that's how us G's roll
Hoo-ridin' to the lizzay
Seen Tina from the town laid her that's a dizzay
The side show was jumpin' (bumpin')
Oozin bikershorts and daisy dukes outside pumpin'
And niggas from Richmond rollin' hella deep
My little homies from Oakland got chased by the police
And these hoes want to kick it 
I met a bitch from Frisco gave me her number on a traffic ticket
And tonight I'ma page her
My niggas talkin shit bout these hoes fade ya
When your ballin they jealous they hatin'
I guess they mad cause a nigga own gold daytons
And they bitches started lookin at me
Niggas I'm trigger happy, fuck it and my ass nappy
Get more hoes than freak show 
Ask your bitch, nigga she know
But ya'll can't fade us
Cause No Limit niggas come harder than the Raiders
I'll break you off a little left and feel it chump 
What you see motherfucker is what you saw
Cause ain't no stoppin' No Limit
TRU and Master P it's only the beginning 
And we in it to win it like a roitweiler
I won't stop fool I already made a million dollars
And I'm up and outtie on a comeback
Tryin' to get a fuckin' million in big stacks


Chorus: [Mo B. Dick]

Just another day sellin' ice cream in the bay 
And fools trying to get him for his pay 
But Master P don't play, it's all about money
Just another day sellin' ice cream in the bay 
And fools trying to get him for his pay 
But Master P don't play, it's all about money

[Mo B. Dick]

Just another day sellin' ice cream in the bay 
It ain't No Limit, It ain't No Limit
Just another day sellin' ice cream in the bay 
It ain't No Limit, It ain't No Limit

[Master P talking]

Say wassup to all y'all players out there
Ice cream is trickin' us
In case y'all wondering what ice cream is
It's anything that you can make profit off of
I mean get paid, scrilla, scratch, paper
That's ice cream 
Anything you can make some dizzolars off of
Ya heard me?, remember that players",Sellin' Ice Cream,1996
Master P,"[Mo B. Dick]
Things ain't what they used to be.  
Things ain't what they used to be.

[Verse 1: Master P]
I remember back in the days it wasn't like that
Everybody knew everybody, now days it ain't like that
We used to stand on the corners and drink brew 
Now days you gotta duck when they drive through
Cause they blastin', life is like plastic
But who would be the next egg took out the easter basket
Is it you, me, or her or she or he? 
who would live to see the long age of 23? 
Cause once you dead and gone who gives a damn
On your tombstone would read Rest In Peace Sam  
But in the ghetto you cooked 'till you dead 
Ain't no love when you dead and gone cause you red 
Like roaches for the gutter, peanut butter
your life in the gutter , fool cause you fluttered 
With this game that I spit, shoot out, don't quit 
Now you a victim of society another statistic
I heard the gunshots rain from the middle of the street 
The gun-smoke cleared three people on the concrete
I mean it's crazy, slippin' on daisies
Time to call it quits, they done put a bullet in a baby

[Chorus: Master P and Mo. be Dick]
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be

[Verse 2: Master P]
Watch you back in the ghetto black 
Open the box, Mom's ain't nothing to eat 
Back in the day, I thought we was a family
My little brother on the street corner selling crack 
Only 15 used to be a quarterback
I wish the law would rehabilitate my auntie 
I came home try to visit that girl tried to do me
Started tweakin' said that she needed crack
Stole my grandma's rent money out her purse black
I stay Tru 2 Da Game you devils' can't see me 
I put that on my mom, I put that on my gold teeth   
My homies bangin' ,no respect for the American flag
But they kill over that blue and red rag

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Master P]
I remember back in the day smoking weed was the everyday drug
Now days they shoot heroin and sell blood 
Back in the day catchin' the clamps was gettin' us shot 
Now days catch the AIDS and your time will stop
My lil' homies doin' time, 25 with a L
A victim of the system, I'd rather die and go to hell 
I try to be legit and start my own company
Till these sucker want to bump into P
They point the finger at me for tellin' another what to do
How could another person tell you what to do
I could tell you to rob or steal or kill 
that's like pointin' the finger at Jack or Jill
For being the first person on this little earth
Is like askin' Mary why she had to give birth
And who would be the next victim to lose his life 
And who would be the next one to make a life
But when you make a life you gotta learn to teach your kid
So one day they can grow up and make it big
But all this gangbangin' and turf wars gotta cease
Cause y'all know we livin' in the last days G

Time to check my crackhouse, my crackhouse, my crackhouse
Time to check my crackhouse, my crackhouse, my crackhouse
Time to check my crackhouse, my crackhouse, my crackhouse
Time to check my crackhouse, my crackhouse, my crackhouse

The P rat a tat
It's time to start checkin' shit
I'm the wrong nigga in the projects to be fuckin' with
Man get that Mack-11
It's time for some drama
Any nigga come up short with the cheese gonna see his momma
Gone off that posit and slippin' that 4
I'm bout ta lay it down with this muthafuckin' toy
You bitches better break me off my money 'cause I'm crazy
Girl you ain't got my cash

You won't see your baby
Put my dope in the baggies I mean the bundle up
Dollar bills in my fuckin' pocket tightly crumbled up
50's in my mouth got my goddamn tongue
Remember when I walk on the set
Bitch I'm gonna leave you dumb
Break me off my cash
I ain't takin' no shorts
I'm aimin' that Tek-9 right at your heart
Ain't no fuckin' return from the dead

I'm ready to kill bitch
I'm the wrong nigga in the game to be fuckin' with
I'm kickin' doors down
Tryna' get my money
Leavin' fiends on the ground
Face down like dummies
You better have the cash
Or your ass in the body bag
Killa murda muthafucka
I ain't runnin' from the tads

Rat-a-tat-tat is the sound from my gat
I told you muthafuckas that you won't be coming back
You came up short with the muthafuckin' grits
That's why yo ass got caught up in some gangsta shit
Call me the black rambo
'cause I don't give a fuck
And just like my boy said
Yo ass got plucked
You shoulda came right with my money
You started smokin'

That's why I had to break you off some tokens
So jump on the bus ride to hell bitch
I'm gonna let your know who the fuck you be fuckin' with
Tha M-A-STER to the muthafuckin' P
And I ain't takin' no shorts with ya'll niggas with my D

[Chorus]

Went into the crackhouse and opened up the safe
One nigga at the door lookin' at me hellah fake
I played it all like it was fuckin good G
That's when I told my man
Hit 'em with the oozi!
That's it
1-2-times rat a tatta
One nigga on the ground lookin' like a eggo plater
But I ain't even trippin'
Gotta show them I ain't fakin'
'cause if these other niggas get me for some bacon

I started counting my dope
Everything was cool black
Headed to the front
Got them fiends walkin' in the back
I ain't even trippin'
Ain't no time to serve these fiends
I got 40 g's and two fuckin' keys
Headed to the bienz to put the fuckin' cash up
Jumped on the freeway nigga fuckin' dashed bro
Think I see the rollers behind me through the rear-view

But I ain't even trippin' 'cause I ran through clear view
Stopped at Egg-Zone tried to get some gas
That's when I see two robbers on my ass
Played it all cold
Told be	 to get that pistol
Jumped back in the bienz shoulda seen they head whistle
I went back to the house and my homie want some flour
I ain't Scarface but got the money and the power
They call me Nino Brown
Or fuckin' Frank Nitty

But if you come up short
There's gonna be some shit up in my city

[Chorus]

From down south to the muthafuckin' hills
Y'all niggas better recognize
Y'all better fuckin' recognize

I'm tru to da game, Masta P'll be da name
I'm in it for the money, fuck these bitches an the fame
'cause when you broke bitches get ghost like sideways
Like gold daytons rollin' up the highway

On my way to the town to take some cizash
An if you shizort bitch you in the bizag
I got fifteen in the tank, on my way to Burbank
Fist stealin' 5, ready till 5, blowin' dank

An still tryin to make a dollar outta fifteen cents
Got the Cutlass full of coffee for no evidence
It's a drought but I got ice cream 16 five, everyday, all day
Hit me on the door knob
'cause we be ballin', bitch we be haulin'

Got chickens up the highway from New Orleans
An y'all foo's can't stop the real deal
An when you see the tank, fool you better guard yo' grill
'cause No Limit in this to win this
An got a million soldiers ready to handle business

6 deep is how we mobb, an we tru
(Ungh)
But we'll kill if we have to

Been on the block in the Bay, nigga hop by the tre
Nigga stop at eight, early chop the cake, but not today
Cock the K, 'cause these busta ass niggas know we not to play
Say, hello to the Richmond nigga, East Bay killa

Down south thrilla, quick to fill ya, wit more shells than the sea
More mail than the post office
These lyrics an dope keep me stayin' up like it was coffee
Now stop, pause, take a look

East Bay nigga crook, seven E deuce cut
Ready to buck on any nigga that steps up
I be the man, understand this, skanless niggas get fucked up
Number one on Billboard, bitch, y'all niggas still tryin' to come up

y'all niggas soup, I'm gumbo, ready to rumble, ready to tumble
Yo' girlfriend outta line, I'ma catch her like Columbo
Tongue twistin' like an Uzi, y'all niggas can't do me

Ice cream slangin, 
And if the radio don't play this gangsta shit, what are they thinkin?
They could stop, a nigga from comin up
They could stop a young nigga from makin big bucks
Independent, and black owned
But still got more money than Al Capone

A murder, a hustla, fuck it, a drug deala
But if they shoot, did up with police
Ready to run dope from here to the Middle East

Got the latest word, swerve to the side of the curb

But I still gave him five dollars to wipe my white walls
And then I burst up out the block, dropped the top cause it was hot
Hit the spot with the most hoes at the sideshow, abouts to plot
Spin donuts, you know I'm macking, a straight up nigga
Catch me spinnin', you can tell I was there cause I clocked smoke when I was finished
I seen five-O, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin' he'd be nice and all cause I gotta 185 in the hood 
And you know they can't catch me
And if you see me chilling you can stop me

1st Verse: [Master P -- Fiend] 

Master P: 

Somebody musta' told these hoes I was a muthafuckin' rapper, 

but will they jus' tell them hoes that I was a muthafuckin'

All the bitches I done broke fo' they bank, 

I got so many cocktales I need a muthafuckin' fish tank. 

I got hoes like acorns fallin' outta trees, 

No Limit niggas don't say hoes, 

ain't no caps that be floatin' in the breeze... 

Fiend: 

Now, Now, Now P, all the time, I done put in work 

I ain't know, I was livin' next door to Captain Kirk. 

kepta smirk on his face, lookin' like drug swappin', 

come to find out, some bitch holdin' his money down hostage. 

Got keys to his cottage, done changed the law and the act, 

and all he get to do, is eat that funky hoe from the back. 

On top of that, 

the bitch fat!!! 

Makin' a career off this nigga, 

and all his homies gone, because they can't get it clear to this 

nigga, 

go figga, 

all she wanted was that man to change, 

but if it was me, I done been done slapped that bitch in the brains. 

Chorus: 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby. 

Captain Kirk, can you save me?

Verse Two: [Silkk The Shocker] 

See I met this bad ass trick, 

I mean this bad ass bitch. 

Tellin' her friends about month go by see I'ma be like buying her 

shit. 

I bought her lunch the first time, 

but see there trick that's nuthin' but game, 

I hit it one time and they be callin' back, 

talkin' bout' ""Silkk, why you do all that playin'?"". 

And she had the nerve to tell me, 

if I ain't a fuckin' trick I'm worthless, 

I told her Bitch if you ain't suckin' dick, 

then none of yo' clit defeats the purpose. 

Figured she had game, tryin' to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind, 

I figured lookin' at me she see nothin' but dollar signs. 

Simply, a bitch might give you some weed, 

a bitch might give you a buck, 

man, but since you my boy you 

better use a condom, before you try to fuck. 

Take the game from this show bug, 

'cause Silkk ain't no love. 

I give'em a little somethin', but at the end I 

take'em back and get the most love. 

And ain't no beam'em up Scotty, 

ain't no savin' hoes that ain't puttin' in no work. 

It all depends on TRU niggas like us, no Captain Kirk (Bitch freeze), 

all you ghetto hoes get yo' Lee Press-On Nails, fix yo' wig, 

bring yo' Bebe kids 'cause the Ghetto Enterprise is leavin' in

",Come and Get Some,1997
Master P,"And the lady America was finally slaughtered 
And divided into 3 quarters 
Her children the cities fell
Battlin' golden' platinum 
Friends of terror and endless bloodshed 
Pity was not spared for no man  woman  child or rapper 
And believe 
For his rap was felt by everyone 
And this time when trust had no meaning 
Family and friends who survived destroyed one another
Decide to the world 
Love, peace, and brotherhood
Soldiers, high ashes to survival 
To open up a path to reality 
For some, judgement 

[Verse] 
The devil took the straps off my nigga legs 
The Virgin Mary came when my homie bleed 
Too many fuckin' thieves and enemies 
The vultures pecked the mouths for the green cheese 
I watched his soul leave his clothes left him cold 
On these streets, anything goes 
He was on the road 
It took 'em ten to do him in 
The killas fled, damn, but they'll be back again 
He was Polo'd down with the matchin' socks 
I mean stuffed like a turkey with a half a key of cooked rocks 
The reaper came and took him 
I saw the tears from my baby mama's eyes over look him 
As I walk through the shadows of death 
Where no rapper or no man can spare no breath 
The kingdom of freedom is all they said 
Why the shackle and chain? 
My homie's life slaid
From the cradle to the grave every soldier shall ride 
Bite the apple of eternity(uggggHH) 
Every mother will cry 

[Chorus x2] 
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends 
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end 
 
[Verse]
Now who's to say if it's the beginning or ending 
Start to finish 
Losin' or winnin' 
I'm trapped in a whole world of sin 
Who's to say your life is worth more than mine 
Should I give my heart to the President so he can live and I can die? 
Now my whole life I was scared 
The only judge is god 
But why do I (we) live by these man made laws 
Ten commandments they say do not steal or kill 
But I lost too many niggas and some say they split my wig for meal 
Heaven, leadin' up to the steps 
Everything I do wrong in my days is leading to my death 
And even though I never see 
I believe there's a god 
But I hate when your best friend turn to your enemy 
When times is hard 

[Chorus x2] 

[Verse] 
As the sand slowly poured 
I see flashes of life 
Time started ticking it's the end of my life 
Blind fo' his eyes when he look at god 
Behold no man or your life destroyed 
He took many prophets and poured to the kingdom 
Big ones and small ones 
Good ones and mean ones 
As the angel came the ghetto from hell 
Some words of the piece cause they didn't know no better 
So they sold to the pitch-forks of the fire 
Do g's go to heaven or just young niggas retire 
Crosses burned cause they souls was scarred

Takin' cruises on boats, sippin' champagne 

Rollin' out the red carpet when they see ya $10,000 mink coat

Taking trips in Land Cruisers 

Droppin' off cash to the bank 

But they don't know what you just seen 

The shit i done put you through 

The penitentiary tension you done take for ya' boo 

The FED's harass you 

The lies you don't told for me 

And when i went to jail you found a way to visit me 

Runnin' up ya phone bill 

Sometimes the kids didn't even have a decent meal 

It ain't no limit to this ghetto love

And man I can't lie 

'cause i'll be hustlin' , hangin' wit my homies all night ch'all 

I'll be hustlin' from the morning to the night fall, aight ch'all? 

It's kinda hard tryin' to stay clean

Take this hundred g's in case a nigga like me get busted 

Ya' blame it on my mob lifestyle 

My thuggish-ruggish friends

My foul lifestyle gonna have to come to an end 

Ya' gotta' realize I ain't tryin' to be no broke fart 

I'm takin' the chances now 

'cause it's gonna be hard for our future sons and daughters

Cash chips like casinos 

Live life as a high roller 

Silkk the Shocker make moves like Valentino 

I only got one chance, so I got to take it 

If you could just be patient 

Diamonds inside a 20 just for waitin' 

Yo' mom think I'ma thug she don't like it 

But you still sneak out and see me 

Ya' friends think I'm a ghetto thug 

But this is ghetto love that they can't see, G

Master P,"I'm going through some thangs
These bitch ass niggas got me goin' through some thangs.
I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitch ass niggas got me goin' through some thangs.

I close my eyes, I can't sleep, I visualize death
I seen my little homie get smoked like a cigarette 
And these G's on the streets, enemies, 
They'll take your life for a hundred see's
I mean a hundred dollars or less
The game gets so wicked that I wear a bulletproof vest
And now I'm grown, and they wonder why I'm crazy 
Imagine feedin' tablets and beer to a baby
Never had a chance when I was 5 
Nigga took me in the car, took me on the ghetto ride
Cruisin' through streets that I've never seen 
Pull the clip off a 30 round magazine 
Taught me how to deal with a triple beam 
And ever since then I've been servin' dope fiends
I got the game in the bag that's so big
Nigga see my nuts it's like two figs
Swoll to the fullest, 
In my heart to my vein, pump nickel plated bullets 
And this ghetto got me stressed (stressed), 
'cause niggas that you know (bitches) will rob you blind & leave you to rest.

I'm going through some thangs
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs

I hit that nigga with a are-15, do it clean
Back up in the lex, bumpin' Mia, with my mug mean 
Bulletproof vest, Smith and Wess 
For enemies fuckin' steppin' in my direction
I'm gonna teach these niggas a lesson. 
Flexin' like an Anaconda, I'm stuffed like bombers
Hit ya step and get wet, then duck my doorway teck. 
I holds my own like I'm pissin'
Beef with us is death wishing, I put to work because they didn't listen 
They tryed to set me up, why did they push me? 
Hook me up in the town with the killer pussy
Rap me up between the sheets
Nigga bust out the closet, but my 9 made 'em dead meat. 
I shot the hoe who set me up
I'm drivin' off mad because the niggas threw off my nut
I'm going through a thang, ain't no thang though
Cause before I left, I hit the set and took all the dope

I'm going thorugh some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs

So if it seem, point the beam
Since a youngster,these niggas pushed my cemetery dream
Lean my body if they could, 
And wished ya die, I wished ya coward motherfuckers would
Everyday, I thank god for my baby, she fall asleep on my chest 
But if her momma catch her callin' me daddy, she whoop that ass 
I'm not scared to blast, why my momma wish she never had me? 
She know these streets got me crazy 
I'm hittin' my momma for some pocket change, 
To stay one step ahead all these niggas in the game 
My daddy, gangsterism pumpin' d up in my vein. 
Should I kill a nigga for respect, or should I let him go?
And if I do, someone please close my eyes 
When I'm layin' bleedin' on the floor 
That's why I never trust a bitch
Cause now a days these bitches carry an extra clip

Always down for a caper,

I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs

Going through somethings, ya heard me? 
I done made it out the ghetto
And every nigga that I know, that still there 
Think I owe them something 
And every motherfuckin' nigga that was down with me 
Or wanted to be, wanna be just like me 
They think I owe them something
Every bitch I stopped fucking with, 
Thank I owe them something
Know what I'm sayin'? 
Nigga can't even ride in his motherfuckin' car
Nigga can't even walk though the streets 
Without a motherfucker thinkin' a nigga who think he owe him some
I got mine, and you can get yours
Motherfuckers in my family, 
They think a nigga just got boo-coo money,
Just a blown on them, just to give to a motherfucker 
That don't wanna do nothing for theyselves motherfucker
Be a real motherfucker, be a true nigga, get ya own
Damn, can't even mourn the dead anymore 
Without motherfuckers thinking if you a big nigga in the hood
You must be stickin' prices on other niggas heads
But I'm bigger than that nigga

Master P,"I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood
'Til all this black on black crime stop
Some say the blind lead the blind
But in the ghetto you never know
When it's gon be yo time

Sitting in the ghetto thinkin' 'bout
All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted Cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friend's gone
And I'm so all alone
And I really miss my homies
Even though you're gone away
I know you're in a better place
And I hope to see you soon someday

I used to hang with my boy, even slang with my boy
I used to bang with my boy, goddamn I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin' birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin', got me perkin', never jerkin'
Still blowin' dolja fo' ya 'cause I know you're up there workin'
Your little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see your t-shirts with your face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend, on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin' in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name, leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change
Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall
The ghetto persons that lost their loved ones to these ghetto scandals

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!)
Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli)
All my homies who done made it to the crossroads
(Biggie Smalls)

How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
(It's like I can't believe you gone)
My best friend's gone
(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on)
And I'm so all alone
(Everytime I see something you done left
I really miss my homies
(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg)
Even though they gone away
(I just keep reminiscin)
I know you in a better place
('Cause I know you alright)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(And I keep smilin, knowin I'm a see you in the crossroads]

We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin' weed 'til 3, hollerin' at the hoes
Spendin' $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, ""C, leave that dope, 'cause rappin' is yo thang""
I ain't gon' even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin' why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin' ki's
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

Even though you gone away
(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon' be forgotten)
I know you in a better place
('Cause as long as I'm here
You gon' live through me and other TRU playas)
I really miss my homies
Even though their gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

I'm just sittin' here dazed thinkin' about all the times we had
Thinkin' about the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante? It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may y'all rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin' I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin' girls, writin' down numbers like memos
Makin' million dollar bets, makin' all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together then I suddenly wanna smile
See you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could believe that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and P and C forever gon be ridin' and thuggin'
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon' miss you

I know you in a better place
(Every time I get on my knees)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place
I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin'
Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)",I Miss My Homies,1997

Chorus (2X) 
[Mia X] 
We capitolize and monopolize on everything we see 
Keep pistols drawed and cocked 
We got the industry locked, we can't be stopped, too hot 
Check the spots that we got on billboards 
The tank can set up roadblocks, we fadin all you hoes 
Want some mo? 
Then let's go, stretch you out like elastic 
Zip that ass up in plastic, have ya folks pickin caskets 
We drastic, our tactics is homegrown in the ghetto 
So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas 
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mama Mia 
The unlady like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her 
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed 
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away 
So stay in yo place, when ya hear mamma speakin 
Cannons spray, clear the way, when ya see the tank creepin 
Chorus (2X)

Hi i'm that nigga that rappers look up to 
If they want to know how to do it 
It could be the little bitty skinny muthafucka 
With the braids in his hair 
Used to live on Tchopitoulus 
I done paid my dues, but still playin the blues 
Nigga play me like you was scared to lose 
I'm still a fool, you ain't heard the news 
I wasn't a No Limit nigga, but I made the move 
I won't stop now, bitch, I can't stop 
You can't stop me, so, bitch, don't try 
We TRU soldiers, and we don't die 
We keep rollin, n-n-nah-nah-nah 
All aboard, it's like a band inside 
The group going hallelujah 
Niggas goin to war, got to fightin and shootin inside rumors 
Little bitch sayin he there, we there, be where? 
see there, Silkk there, Fiend there, Mamma there, P there 
Ain't no salary cap, on top of my dollars

I gets down nigga, I hold my tank up high 
Watch how many bitches get wild, n-nah-n-nah

Master P,"This is a ghetto public announcement (weed smokers)
Roll your blunts tight
And light your joints
Inhale...slowly exhale
And that's how you get high.
(clip from Friday)
I know you don't smoke weed...i know this
But I'm gonna get you high today.
Cause its Friday, you ain't got no job, and you ain't got shit to do.
Pass me da green, i need some weed with my hennessy (repeat 8 times)
(Inhale....exhale) Eyes selling red, got my dank from the Bahamas
Went to see my girl smoke some green with her mama.
Jumped in my Cutlass on the way to the liquor store.
Picked up some blunts, got ten on the 2-0.
Fix these palm trees wit some green leaves
Got a nigga's head spinning like the seven seas.
Puff, puff, pass, nigga that's what Simon say
Fools that hog the green or da weed gonna get carried away.
Fingernails burnt, lookin like a tweeker
Ears steadily poppin, but not from the speakers
Green got me hungry, feindin' for them munchies
cause real smokers don't blow no fuckin green on empty stomachs
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my hennessy (repeat 4 times).
Green trees pack wood, make cabbage
I like to get high but it ain't a bad habit.
??????? with that weed smoke comin out my lac 
Got a ??? in the front and one in the back
Blowin shotguns to me and my homie
I feel like this weed make a young nigga horny
I stopped the fuckin lac at Holiday Inn
I ain't even trippin, told the girls to come in
Laid her down steady cause she know I'm ready
Choppin up weed like muthafuckin spaghetti
Hoes down south must know voodoo
cause every time i hit the weed I'm lookin for Isuzus
Pass me da green, i need some weed with my hennessy (repeat 5 times)
y'all high yet?
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my hennessy(repeat 3 times)
Damn nigga y'all chokin, get the fuck out of here nigga.
Pass me da green i need some weed with my hennessy
Nigga I said are y'all high yet?

My homies call you that nigga
But you my bitch
Since we banging, I guess we one click
You be that nigga that I drink with
And you don't even trip if i was to let a freak kiss
You give me rubbers so I can stay strapped
You say you can't catch no fucking rat
Without a mouse trap
So we be kicking it like g's
Its a drought, but you got a connect on some keys
You roll up the ?? and drink 40s'
You'll whoop any bitch at any ghetto party
We walk past security cause you got the strap
And when my homies see ya
You the only female they give dap
You the only nigga that I'll kiss
Make love to and still do some gangsta shit with
Like Menace to Society we kick it

Why you ills with the hotties
I'm numero uno in your eyes honey poppi
Yo lady Gotti
Thugged out, hooriding ready to kill
Yet make me feel like others can't with my sex appeal
Be riding ghetto thrills
But still the bitch behind the trigger
The bitch about her scrilla
The bitch to smack her nigga
If the tone faintly rises in his voice
The choice is mine
When it comes to haters living or dying
Blueprinted crimes illustrated by your baby
The unlady like mistress
Be all about illicit business
Bitches witness us together looking tenderly
But to scared to tell wifey, for fear of me
I'm only trying to be the one with the green papers
Bounce on the dick and help me pull off a mean caper
That's why you praise the biggest mama and you care
Other hoes get x'd out in what we share yeah
I give you rubbers for your friends for show
Take me shopping tomorrow
Short change them hoes
Save them 3 more nuts for me
Alize, hot tubs and an ounce of weed
Please, there's not a jealous bone in my body
Take me off to Jamaica
Then take your wifey to (aloha) Hawaii
I don't mind being number 2
You keep more ice on my hands and wrists
Than an ink blue
And if it all falls through you still got me
Yout true bitch nigga down to hustle

Master P,"Chorus:
Look at all these haters surrounding me every day
hatin on a baller but they can't stop my pay
stop all the hatin I can't take it no more
I'm just tryin to get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for

Verse 1: Master P

Pop the lock on the benz with the keys 
To high to see his own enemies
his baby mama with him in a short skirt 
his last ride was in a car, i mean a black hearse
his friend took his life for the mighty dollar 
then ran through the alley must have been a coward
No more hit 'em up like in the old days
homies scrab with Mack 10s and AKs
that's why I roll by myself I mean I'm a loner
cause haters be all up on me
tryin to sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
and the same niggas want to blow on your weed
set you up for a caper 
don't want to see you make no money then take ya
gotta figure out how to get what you got 
cause haters be the same niggas on the spot

Chorus 

Verse 2: Master P 

How do hatin get started?
It started by the jealous people 
and they get mad over the things you have 
and the things they'll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really ain't hard to get 
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors 
I'm really not impressed
I tell you only one time 
with my scrilla fool don't mess

Verse 3: Fiend

I only get with a few cause these bitch made niggas is actors
see I don't had to many gun-ins, run-ins with these ass backwards
non-packers
I'm strapped like P
or see
they ask for me 
capture me 
but I'm going out with a blast
I put that on some cash 
I'm standing last 
for some ass
y'all young crazed punks are trippin 
don't hate me nigga just go ahead and credit my ??
I'm admitting 
that I'm not only on the thwat
but I know i got stopped 
on tha ??
and its understood that I'm not 
one of the best niggas that ever lived
but I got some advice to give 
and that is

Chorus 

Verse 4: Silkk

I wonder why they hatin for?  Probably cause we got G's,
mad cause we makin moves, cause we got keys
But really I can't fade them
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you'se a motherfuckin playa
I know y'all gonna kill me in a matter of lies 
I got friend that will turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me 
when I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes up on  my enemies  I gotta watch my friends
like when I'm sittin on top or ridin in a benz
Why don't y'all go out y'all's ass up and get something 
don't worry about how i got mines
always tryin to point a finger and say that's not mine.
and kill me 
it kills me 
its digusting cause I got a few G's
they try to rob me
but they know they won't touch me
smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
but I just can't call it or catch
but i still got G's and I'm still ballin

Throw em up if you a soldier, if you dodging these niggas, these bitches and
the rollers

The clock hits twelve, I'm on the grind
Punching your code if you want these nickles, quarters and dimes
I got the ghetto soed up like mack diamonds and windy
And I got more sealers than JC Pennies
Throw it up if you a soldier
But if you a punk motherfucker talkin shit and working with the rollers
You better duck down quick when the tank pops
Cause we be slanging automatic fucking slangshots
I went from halves, to hoes with weed to working water
From selling grams, to motherfuckin quarters
From quarter keys, to really tapes and cd's
Not every nigga in the hood knows me
Uhhhhhh, but getting rowdy
Stayin TRU to the game, and still bout it bout it

I'm a represent my hood till I die
And when I'm gone put it on the blimp and let it ride

ain't no mugging, just thugs with me
ain't no hugging, ain't no loving P
These ghetto heroes is dead and gone
That's why niggas in the ghetto live like Al Capone
I be breaking niggas like ice in Iceland
Crushing niggas like sevens in dice games
Nickel plated meters knocking down doors
With hoes and gators, jaboes and polo's
So watch your back when you hustling crack
Cause jackers take your life away and ain't no coming back
Uh, I seen a lot of movies, but this shit is real
And only cars get brand new grills

Automatic gats for combat what we pack
Flip niggas like flapjacks, with oz's and crack
We killing with tatooes our guns and balls
The car with the tek-nine in my droor
Went from selling double up's to going double platimum
For selling crack and, jack and gun clapping and rapping
Watch me smoke my little weed, got my drink and bud
What's up to all the slangers, the bangers, bloods and 'cause
I was a soldier, I still remain a soldier
A cobra, even sold my mamma a bowl a
Down a fifty of hennesee and blow a bag of doshia
Quarter keys with five G's which a hustle for D
Now selling gold LP's, that's a hustling for cheese

Got these ghetto hoties wanting to put they love in me
I'm a G from the CP3 and dedicated
Screaming No Limit Soldiers and these playa haters hate it
Relax shorty, hit the blunt, drop the Ruger
Come close to a nigga, let the P seduce ya
Work it like a Solo Flex, say you wanna a ruff-neck
Cristal and strawberries, weed smoking, rough sex
I want you to open your legs as wide as you could
So I can hit from the back with this nickle plated wood
Up and down like a roller coaster
From your stomach to your back
Let a gangsta poke ya
I ain't trippin', never slippin' cause I got straps
9 months later, we ain't bustin' no caps
Crispy clean, no strings attached

I heard you want a romance
Won't you lay up there and give me the chance
I ain't saying romance, now what you to be enhanced
I'm matured enough, and I ain't approached you for nothing
And the reason I came up off cause you working with something
Now I done had a little herb, now I done build up the nerve
On top of that my head tight from everything the boss serve
I'm pitching, cause your curves got me wanting to slide home
And prove that I flip other things besides ounz
Tel your girl you're gone, baby you gots to rome
He leaving with things, he get it on, get it on
You cold make me moan, so you up for screwing me
Please use engenuity when you doing me
Damn you ? blues with you matching hot shoes
Pretty legs but knees gone get bruised
There's no one gonna get used

Straight to the point shorty
Look I'm trying to do something

Back stage at the concerts peepin'
You wanted me to see you and I'm thinking about creepin'
Far from home, destination unknown, rock bone
Hotel booked and I don't wanta be alone
Maybe it's the tone got me visualizing this song
Camouflage love all night making me moan
Thug passion, in the back seat ripping off your fashion
Run and tell your girls about your night with the assassin
I'm here tonight and the vibe is right
Red and blue lights are glowing over Brian McKnight
But tomorrow my flight, and I'll be outta your sight
Take my address down so you can write
But for now lets do something
Fuck the frontin' and the talking
My dogs just about barkin'
Take your outfit off and put the soldiers shit on
And go to the war with me

Hit me when you trying to do something

Mansions with marble floors, knocking off chocolate hoes

Ladies wanna make love to me
Niggaz wanna look at me all mean

Fast livin' got me trapped in this street game 
Before i die i hope i have a chance to make a change 
4x 
I'm at the time in my life when a nigga ready to change 
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this thang 
feel like I'm trapped in a prison slowly waiting to die 
it's getting harder for my people yet we don't know why 
they cuttin sistas off welfare these kids can't eat 
and it's the children like thuggish minds turned out by the street 
I couldn't see it while I was outside slangin my rocks 
servin' death to my people, commitin the ultimate evil 
robbin' and killin' my own kind, Lord forgive me 
blinded by this life of crime, God somebody hear me 
since the death of my momma, my life is filled with drama 
lost both of my kids, punished for what dirt that I did 
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget 
all the mistakes that I made, that time won't let me erase 
I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game 
Steady checkin' myself, God help me to change 
Chorus 4x 
If I could change, I'd bring my momma back from the grave 
I ain't got too much trouble cause we livin' in the last days 
crime pays, doing broads can get you AIDS, gotta wear a strap these 
days 
All the time I stay high, trying to fight my stress 
jealous fool of the world trying to put me to rest 
last night i had a talk with my momma 
then the cry, asking god if she'd serve a purpose before she dies 
you can see it in my eyes, a brotha wanta slow down 
I ain't mad at ya daddy cause you didn't come around 
I'm knowing that the times is hard, but you can make it 
You see the opportunity, you take it 
but what about my little baby, I got a mouth to feed 
But i still wanta hang on the streets and smoke weed with the O.G.'s 
my homies rest in peace in the game 
I don't think you'll ever know the pain 
I wanta change 
Chorus 4x 
Lord know, picute me ballin 
trapped in this ghetto with my young G's callin 
Henacee and weed when they bury P 
a quarter key, 6 G's, when they carry me 
fall on my knees to no nigga 
trapped in this hood, raised by chrome trigga 
never had a pops, a nigga learned to slang cream 
should have been a chemist, the way i work a triple beam 
life, is like a page, I wanta turn 
I wanta make a change, but Lord you let my brotha burn 
I done seen a nigga lose his life over zurcubian stones 
everynight, my auntie bring a nigga home 
momma worrying cause the rent late 
3 strikes, my cousin's doing time upstate 
I sent him Camel with no filters 
I'm in the ghetto slangin dope with staight killas, ugghh 
I know kids that pack gats cause they bout it, bout it 
I'm from the murder capital of the world and we rowdy, rowdy 
is there a heaven for a gangsta, Lord put me to sleep 
cause your best friend turn into your enemy 
crooked cops is dirty in this shaded game 
go on take me out the ghetto

Tired of motherfuckers followin' me man take another route
Nigga somebody else, keep ya eyes open fool

[Chorus: x2]
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
I'm paranoid I can't sleep I'm in this dope game
I think these hoes and these niggas out to get me man

I ain't never had nothing in my whole life
I'm from the ghetto grew up on eggs and rice
I'm paranoid, I can't sleep cause I done stole a key
Peep out the window unmarked car after me
My little homie down stairs hollerin' 5.0
But I ain't runnin' from no motherfuckin' white folks
I got the a-k spray hit the window (lay it down) duck
So nigga holler God damn, hit him in the trunk
The dogs chase me but a nigga ran through the back
That's when I seen dope and willy in the Cadillac
They said p where ya going man get in
Put the gat to his head said interstate 10
Play it off, play it off while I do a trick
Take me to the project to meet my bitch
100 g's, 2 keys, and a bullet-proof vest, like
Billy the kid I got some pussy and headed to the west

Chorus

I was pullin up out the driveway
Car been parked since Friday
I looked and look back it wasn't there
But I saw him followin on the highway
And I today know that I'm gonna blast
See I don't know who's in it cause the cars windows were tinted
And I be seeing shit that ain't it ain't there
But I be seein shit, I be in places without even bein seen there
But be seen in places without even bein there
And it seems like I'm in a different time zone
This dope game got my mind gone got my mind gone
Be having nightmares in the day, I be woke but I be sleep
I looked at shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me
It got me noid, it got me noid
It got me noid, but I ain't paranoid

[Chorus]

I beez more paranoid than a fugitive
Because I choose to live pro life
When it comes to mine my ruger 9's on cock
For all them haters with the scandolous plots
The red dot marks the spot for my nineteen shots
But I forgot the way they did ya boy
That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy
They wanna trap me kidnap me duct tape my mouth
Torture me until I tell em about my man and point the dope house out
I used to be about the same drama game
That's why I'm two steps ahead of you gutter brains
You know the name mia x the biggest momma
Ghetto sara lee at the store
Betty crocker when I choppa fo' sho'
The evil eyes be watching cause niggaz be always
Tryin to get in the best players spot and knockin'
Motherfuckers head off and kris krossin
Throw in mo salt than martin
When it rains it pours, horns with the rough tones
They try to get me slung on my back
Got to watch the jealousy acts so black
My eyes be in the front and the back and the sides peepin'
For all them crooks that be out creepin'
I feel they watchin' me

They watchin' but true soldiers don't die they multiply
Keep an open eye for all them haters

From the south to the west to the mid to the east coast 

Verse One: Master P 
I got heroin and cocaine 
some call me the dope man a young nigga havin thangs 
A thug like Tupac 
went from cheddar to cheese from powder to cooked rocks 
From the ghetto to the lakes 
(to the lakes 3rd ward, Caliope) 
Slangin' thangs in the hood to move my records to 54 states 
Got more work than the mayor do (mayor do) 
it stick to niggas that talk shit 
like a baller they bitch hair blue 
Got more corns than fritos 
Got more hoe's than Macys sell muthafuckin Girbauds 
Keep the muthafuckin party jumpin (uhh, bout it, bout it) 
For puttin the south on the map like Eazy-E did Compton 
Hoo-ride with these gangbangers (gangbangers) 
No Limit Soldiers, mercenary killas keep one up in the chamber 
_Got it Made_ like Special Ed 
Got more _Vapors_ than BizMarkie ever had 
After _Dead Presidents_ like Eric B. 
_Hypnotize_ the rap industry like Biggie 
Going _Federal_ like E-40 
Shock the world like Silkk, put my pockets on tilt 
Puttin fools _On Hold_ like En Vogue 
Used to slang white ice cream, now its platinum and golds 

Chorus 2X 
Verse Two: Mystikal 
Without no business

But by the time they finish fuckin you, bitch you gon learn 
Ain't no fuckin favors, ain't no fuckin friends 
That shit don't mix, this business 
Be bout yo paper, yo royalties or them bitches will take ya 
Make sure yo contract is escilatin' otherwise them bitches will rape ya

Them no good son of a bitches got me livin for concerts

Fuck how good you rap it ain't shit without yo business 
No business 

Chorus 2X 
Verse Three: Fiend 
I could end the world with one line 
but I chose to make these hoes suffer 
Fill the voice with no muffler, I's a bad motherfucker 
Uncover, unleash the beast, dangerous from head to feet 
Can't control my rhymes, because them bitches seep through 
My teeth, so cold I heats, rising like some yeast, bake some beats 
Meltin needers off of technique and that's just when I speak 
Seek and you should find that my mind is beyond 
and y'all niggas lines behind the times of my first lines 
Shit I'm in my prime, I want it with the mic or the nine 
For mine it protects crimes to the blind (he ain't lying) 
And I ain't dying line goes the paper the chase 
P done gave me the break for me to make some cake 
still dope I cook in sake, got pretty ass hoes to bake 
that's definitely a dumb nigga lure, you want to smoke 
Cause this business makin me a weed conniseur 
Meet the have-been, one of the last men on this note 
Who want to get served by the nigga, the nerve at the throat 
You think you bad but bitch you never had 
A nigga to give more heart attacks than Fred Sanford had

Pushin' in weight from state to state
Niggaz ridin' dirty on my mobile phone, it's UGK

I said, ""What's really happenin?"" He said, ""I gotta pocket full of stones""

Now P, be dat new kid on the block
36 OZ's choppin' up rocks in my rock shop
And label me a drug deala, just anotha hard nigga
Rest in peace to 2Pac and the rest of y'all thug niggas

Used to roll cutlass, now it's Benz's and vets

Label me an alien, just like Outkast

Got a real nigga's job, so damn hard tryin to play 'em
Weigh em, no weigh me, cause that's what they gon' pay me

Fast livin' got me trapped in this street game 
Before i die i hope i have a chance to make a change 
4x 
I'm at the time in my life when a nigga ready to change 
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this thang 
feel like I'm trapped in a prison slowly waiting to die 
it's getting harder for my people yet we don't know why 
they cuttin sistas off welfare these kids can't eat 
and it's the children like thuggish minds turned out by the street 
I couldn't see it while I was outside slangin my rocks 
servin' death to my people, commitin the ultimate evil 
robbin' and killin' my own kind, Lord forgive me 
blinded by this life of crime, God somebody hear me 
since the death of my momma, my life is filled with drama 
lost both of my kids, punished for what dirt that I did 
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget 
all the mistakes that I made, that time won't let me erase 
I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game 
Steady checkin' myself, God help me to change 
Chorus 4x 
If I could change, I'd bring my momma back from the grave 
I ain't got too much trouble cause we livin' in the last days 
crime pays, doing broads can get you AIDS, gotta wear a strap these 
days 
All the time I stay high, trying to fight my stress 
jealous fool of the world trying to put me to rest 
last night i had a talk with my momma 
then the cry, asking god if she'd serve a purpose before she dies 
you can see it in my eyes, a brotha wanta slow down 
I ain't mad at ya daddy cause you didn't come around 
I'm knowing that the times is hard, but you can make it 
You see the opportunity, you take it 
but what about my little baby, I got a mouth to feed 
But i still wanta hang on the streets and smoke weed with the O.G.'s 
my homies rest in peace in the game 
I don't think you'll ever know the pain 
I wanta change 
Chorus 4x 
Lord know, picute me ballin 
trapped in this ghetto with my young G's callin 
Henacee and weed when they bury P 
a quarter key, 6 G's, when they carry me 
fall on my knees to no nigga 
trapped in this hood, raised by chrome trigga 
never had a pops, a nigga learned to slang cream 
should have been a chemist, the way i work a triple beam 
life, is like a page, I wanta turn 
I wanta make a change, but Lord you let my brotha burn 
I done seen a nigga lose his life over zurcubian stones 
everynight, my auntie bring a nigga home 
momma worrying cause the rent late 
3 strikes, my cousin's doing time upstate 
I sent him Camel with no filters 
I'm in the ghetto slangin dope with staight killas, ugghh 
I know kids that pack gats cause they bout it, bout it 
I'm from the murder capital of the world and we rowdy, rowdy 
is there a heaven for a gangsta, Lord put me to sleep 
cause your best friend turn into your enemy

go on take me out the ghetto

Just a young thug tryin' to make it
Visualize me in ghetto in these fools tryin' to break me
Kill me for my weed and my hindesee
Young villains when I'm gone won't remember me

Greeting women be my past time
Live the life of the hustler
Came up on ghetto rhyme
17, rouse for the busters

Keep 2 for the klucksters
I got 45's knives and gads cockes
Young homies banging for the size of my glock
In the average age is 25

Young homies don't even live to retire
Get paid
Puff what
Slang keys

Master P,"Hit the block lexus truck slangin ice cream
A million records sold , that's why y'all know p
Came up on hard times tryin to make ends
2 stones to my niggaz that's dead and in the pen
The ghetto won't change , they label me the dope man
I slang raps but the feds think it's cocaine
Tap my phone , these hoes won't leave me alone
Nigga gon legit , so stay off the ding dong
Independent , that's why they hate me
A million man ghetto march for master p
So fuck rap pages ( don't know )
Y'all didn't want to see a nigga make it off the streets
That's why you'll never see p on mtv
Top 40 , but niggaz y'all know me
Number 1 in every mom and pop and billboard record store
So fuck y'all playa hatin hoes
Gimme a pen , a pad , and ill make a hit
Show every nigga in the ghetto how to get rich
Cause y'all don't know what go on behind closed doors
White folks pimp niggaz like hoes
But tru niggaz , say fuck that
You owe me money , it's time to meet the chrome gat
I got the drank , finna tomorrow I take a piss test
And I know my probs. want me to go back
An ex-con addicted to gangsta rhymes
Last year I caught a bullet but it wasn't mine
Time to go nigga on dead row , or should I say I'm stuck in the ghetto

Chorus:
(2x) just a ghetto thang , a ghetto thang , you would understand if you
Was
From the ghetto man
(1x)its a ghetto thang , a ghetto thang , these niggaz got me caught up in
This ghetto thang

Silk:

See I ain't got no money up in my pocket
How the fuck ima stop it
Ima get the glock and cock and plug you like a socket
See game get deeper but y'all don't feel me
Telling me to gets up out the game , get a job
I shouldn't rob a nigga , I might kill yah
See up on the block I rides deep on gold thangs
These niggaz be trippin up on my shit and they'll jack you like it ain't no
Thang
See I'm from the city where niggaz be salty and they stay faulty like wires
And I ain't seen a gangsta retire yet
On a bet , threw my cothes up on the floor and I sweat
Trust nobody cause these niggaz today will smoke you like a cigarette
Now bet , rest in peace to all homies that didn't make it
Took life for granted , an I panic while seeing niggaz with ski masks
We blast with ski masks and bust a cap into they weak ass
Everyday struggle and I stay hustlin like a pan handler
Fuck it if I took a chance to get dead like cancer
I betta not chance it
Slik , just another nigga tryin to make it up out the ghetto

(chorus)

Big ed:

Got a hold on me , jealous fools wanna roll on me
Will I die or will God just let me be
Fufill the prophecy reach my destiny avoid the burial plot
Unlive the ones that got popped
I got a son but she says that it isn't mine
I'm 24 and since birth I've served hard time
In this concrete jungle , a war zone , many of my peers die
Finally made it back home
Self preservation is a thing for me
Duckin and dodgin bullets stone faces on the ones who pulled it
I promise my mama I wouldn't die before she did
I got my life right got my wife and then my kids
But everywhere I look I see sadness
Imagine tryin to raise your babies in this worldwide madness

From master p and the whole tru click. it's time to hook ya ice
Cream up and turn it into candy.
Mo b. dick: oh!

Chorus i: I got candy!
Mo b. dick: I can serve you on the block
Cocaine, cream, or rock, it takes over fiend
I got candy!
Mo b. dick: I wanna know
If you feel it, too, just like I do.

[silkk]
I hits the block non stop, rocks in my sock
Pause for a second when I see the cops
Rocks of candy, whatever you wanna call it
But when I get you hooked, it's like a muthafuckin alcoholic
I stay ? ? ? around like a poster, watch fiends follow like a toaster
Candy I have move em fast like ? ? ?
Knick knack paddy whack, give a fiend a fast sack
9 times outta 10, he'll tell his friends and they'll be right back
Whole bunch a niggaz, and just one fiend
They come to me for less cut, cause I boast bigger cream
And them fiends come back cause they understand me,
I open up shop, open up shop cause I got candy

Chorus ii: he's got candy! yo eyes roll in your head,
Mo b. dick: you toss and turn in yo bed
Cause I only sell the best to you,
Mo b. dick: indeed I do!
Simply put I'm the reason why
Silkk: why?
Everyday you get high,
Mo b. dick: real high!
And you know I got that crack for you
Mo b. dick: indeed I do!
Just for you

I'm sittin on the post, choppin game with this bitch,
I see ya later ho, I gots money to get
Cause as long as a fiend with dream, I got cream
Money moves everything around me, kn'what I mean?
Cause as a ? ? ? with a dolla, I'm sittin on a drop and parlour
On some gold thangs, watch all them hoes follow
My money makes stacks and real deals
I keep my cash, nigga taj, I can't chill, I gots to pay bills
And these niggaz can't stand me
Got this ho that said she wanna suck my dick for candy
Gotta watch out for these dope fiends cause they be runnin tricks,
$3 what they gon come with, $3 what they gon get
I hold the block like a 7-11(7-11), kick yo door in like taj (taj)
Cut the shit up like machetti, chop the shit up like grass
Cause I'm a stay hustlin till they fuckin can me bitch,
Because it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I got
Candy

Chorus I

[master p]
Uuuunnnngggghhhh! I smoke weed cause I'm a drug deala
I sell candy on the block fool, to make my fuckin scrilla
7 grams for $2.50,
Got niggaz in the hood on hold, tryin to get with me
I keep a stash for the drought,
But the shit I sling daily in plastic out my mouth
My homies use code names,
Like l.d., big champ, slim, t dove, and big mann
I take penetentiary chances to make a livin,
Every 1st of the month, is like thanksgiving
Fiends hug me like they miss me
Hoes see me rollin in my car, and wanna be with me
I get my candy from california by the keys
Ship it in boats and trains back to new orleans
And open up shop like mr. rogers,
But sell mo hits than the dodgers
And fiends holla ""ungh!"" cause it's all good
From the triple beam, straight to the neighborhood
And when you sellin candy trust nobody
Cause niggaz even snitched on john gotti
Niggaz stay tru to the g-zame,
Never front on muthafuckin candy in the dope game
And never go to the fedz on ya folks
Cause punks get fucked with the soap

Chorus iii:
Mo b. dick: I got that real good cocaine (cocaine) each and
Every day, all real tru soldiers, on these streets I gotta get my pay.
My game so tight, so good, so good, yeah!
Mo b. dick: cocaine, he-roin, that fire ass weed
Values and boulders, just tell me what you need baby. oh!

Standing on stages with bullet-proof vestes, lookin' for other cliques

The government and the press, them motherfuckers want me outtie
For runnin' my own shit
Niggas sellin' their company like the slaves sold their souls to 30 cents

Don't you know 15 percent of what you made?
You a sucker, a clucker
So stop rappin hardcore, you hip-hop motherfuckers
And stay true to the gizzame
Be about your paper, nigga fuck the fizzame
Third ward nigga, runnin' the hill

They was scarred into our motherfuckin' souls from these wars,
The streets, the ghetto, the hood. The ghetto.

No Limit soldiers throwin grenades!
Strictly, heavy artillery, calm and gunnin
I got your ground troops runnin from INCOMING!
Go, go go go, the future caliber
Bout to rip your (?) vest, split your capita
The niggas be marchin in the land camp
Bitch we ghetto soldiers, the streets is what made us!

Fools die a million deaths, solider dies once

Candy painted hummer, triple gold D's
We bout it, eyes on our CREAM cause we rowdy
Battle kicked advil, niggas load they carriages
Weapons on the mayor of the cash cause I know character

Punk your ass like a sac bitch

See, don't come stunt and don't try to front

Of broken no seed in the botton pockets of my fatigues

When I'm playing survival games, that's why I sport a vest
But niggas are put to rest, but got them right tatted on my chest
I was best on my recon, started harm and dis
The war from this, is that Fiend was born from this
Scarred from this, so all the armies now go hide

Enemies retire, and the bigger go up, till my gun show up

We changin clothes, when the po po's chase
Narrow with the bass, got them hoes all in my face
And them fake niggas hate, so I started different ways
And even when I'm dead and gone
My legacy'll live on
Tatoo me on your arm and tell niggas he got his rhyme on
Murder murder kill killin and shit that I spit
For lunatics who be feelin this shit
Put the gat in my face, I never squeal, nigga keep it real
Pops gave me the game, bout to bag a feel
We attack like the Men in Black
You react, if you got a gat

I'll never change in the purple rain

Chorus till fade",Gangstas,1997
Master P,"It's crazy out here (uhhhhhhh)
Yo mama I'm tryin to keep my head strong (whats up Mystikal?)

Uhhhhhh!  (uhhhhhh) I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

I feel like a bird nigga with no wings
I'm stuck in this ghetto trying to have a little change
My homies killing up each other cause we gotta eat
And I ain't tripping cause I'm running from the police
I done seen little kids in the projects starving
I done seen more hoes messing then Marvin
See in the ghetto the sun it barely shines
But so many niggas in jail and the welfare lines
And all my life I thought Bill Clinton ran the country
Until I found out Bill Gates had all the money
And the media starting east and west coast wars
I'm from the south, where they predijuce on us all
Come out of the powdered milk and eggs don't fill us up
But why the government sold us drugs and charges to clean us up
Gave us three halves and high interest student loans
Four dollar minimum wage and section eight, we call it home

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

It's real when you can do whatever you want to do
when you want to do it
Ain't to many niggas out there living like that
That's why the rest of you niggas aint never gone through it
How many niggas in the penn
how many niggas in the cemetary don't know why?
How many strikes y'all niggas need
How many innocent children in the ghetto got to lose thier lives?
WHY!!!!  Why you gotta make your momma cry?
HUH!!!!  She take you out of the street
cause that's where you gonna die
But you won't listen cause your mind is one track
and your head is hard
And your getting flipped, and your talking back
Showing your ashy act, ass straight up off the wall
Lemme talk to y'all, don't think it's too hard to fall
but that's far and all
And sore and all, it's cool when it started off
Now niggas duckin bullets like dodgeballs
Niggas got me scared to plant my seeds, fear of high's gonna grow
Living in a messed up time, a messed up court
I'm telling ya, you can't do shit no more!
It's bigger than us, it's out of our hands
that's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
Cause it's your world, and we your children
your sons and your daughters
We struggling, trying to get out of the ghetto
trying to make it to mars!!!

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Dear mama pray for your son, hoping I can make it through this game
Wishing I can change, I've been through so much
Seen so many things, couldn't find the words to explain
The only way to avoid stress is to get high, by drinking hennessey but I
But I can't get too high, cause I gotta keep my eyes on my enemies
I've seen harder times, but there gonna be some harder days
Penetentary close, but you know what?  Cemetaries aint that far away
Before I die I'm trying to make the whole world feel
like our people scared to stand there
The way we express ourself, they think that we all some killers
But look into the eyes of a ghetto child influenced by the street
Go to sleep to gunshots, wake up from the sirens of the police
See now my life aint been the same nigga, life as a thug
If I had to draw a picture of my life
I have to paint my picture in blood
Closest homie died, before he die little cousin told me this
Get you something cause cemetaries
packed full of niggas who had dreams to be rich
So keep your head up, to all my ghetto children it was hard 
To tell my family one day I was gonna grow up to make millions
When I told them, they seemed to laugh at my so called dream
I like to scream when I came home from jail
When I was told best friend turned into a fiend
I aint gonna lie, my conscience aint clear, when I close my eyes
Of course you gotta realize, god forgive me, I'm just trying to survive
They cut welfare and health care, that shit gotta stop
I got a positive note, my auntie having a baby
Congratulations, she on rocks

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

(scarface)
Ghetto niggaz remain violent all the killers remain silent
Niggaz strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all rome'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggaz do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makin' music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause it's deep
Some niggaz make it out the neighborhood and won't circle
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintian me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggaz

This is for my homies and my thug niggaz (uuuuugh)

'face, imagine us working at mcdonald's
And me and you selling fucking tapes in the bahamas
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggaz
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
Real ghetto niggaz can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggaz off from new orleans to california
Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)
Independent, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see c.e.o.'s in a suit and tie
But we young niggaz in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

Listening to this shit my radio did
Shit, gotta change the situation

Chasin' niggas wit my occupation
Clean across the nation

And you got to be a soldier to be inlisted

On a whole lil' trip just don't loose your grip
Wait a second (Wait a second), were is the sack
You don't have to ask no questions just jump in the back
And leave your strap, cus there ain't none of that
Were we goin', it ain't nuthin' but 808, beats and flauntin'
Niggas showin' niggas love, hoes suckin' dicks
That's how we do it, cus everything is in the mix
Doggy Land, Doggy World, Snoop World whatever
It don't matter cus we 'bout it, and homies down to do whatever
Everything is legit, and the bitches the shit
And niggas they give you love, cus dey down for it
Now that's just how it goes, and all the hoes on me
And everything is V.I.P, and that's on D.P.G
Now nigga creep in, just like a liquor store
Now nigga if you want a hoe, nigga just let me know
I'll send a H, and when she gets you (got you)
She with you forever, and a day, that's the D.P. way

Wipe your feet before you enter in
Now take a seat and peep dis beat and sip yo' gin
Cus ain't no killin', everybody chillin'
Steady stackin' paper from the floor up to the ceilin'
Now in my world, a bitch is a girl
And mans best friend is his ends, and his motherfuckin' benz
But chall can't get in just cus you all say you chall down wit us
And try to get around wit us, and hang around wit us, and clown wit us
Hold on, this shit here is for the establishment
Niggas that's havin' shit, and if you ain't roll on and stroll on
This is the spot were the bangers at, the slangers at
Were red and blue equals green, and we probably be black
In fact we stack G's for them keys, so when we finished doin' deeds
You all can't believe what we did 
Provide an opportunity in the community,
Tryin' to spread a lil' unity between you and me
Since IM the mayor, I think I gotta say-ahh a lil' something
Lets keep it jumpin' playa (playa)
Ain't too many places that you know about
So everybody in the world, welcome to the muthafuckin dogg house

Picture me ballin' (ballin')
3rd world hustler out the ghetto of New Orleans
Some say life is like a fairy tail (fairy tail)
Did a song with Snoop Dogg, and it turned into a business deal
But it ain't bout da ends, cus we all got matches and we all got benz's
It's about riddin' with the homies (homies)
Gettin rid of the fake and lookin' through the phonies
And the haters can't stop this, check billboards, number one
The only company with a profit, So say and How You Do Dat There

Eyes hella red, Kane and Abel sessed out
Respect the tank, nigga stick my chest out
And this how we do it in the dirty south

Woah, please somebody tell me where the party at?
I'm tired of holding back, I wanna shine in my Cadillac
I'm here representing a soldier named Slim
See the tank on this neck, see the ice on this wrist

Picture this, I'm riding with Snoop Doggy Dogg
And so y'all don't worry 'bout the corners, we smokin' till the morning
Y'all just keep the bitches, now we on the way
Hold on man, I think Snoop got somethin' to say

Think fast when you dunk, 'cause I won't front
And when it's time to dunk I won't be no punk
I'll just pick the heater up and bust a shot
I'm the last nigga up to rock the spot

I'm represent a nigga to the fullest cause
And if y'all wanna trip, we tear this club up

Never knew how to treat life
Knew once I get my shit right, it was gonna be right
I see life, and I'm livin' up to my dreams
It was a hard struggle
But that was only just for a nigga to bubble
Some of my people made it, and some of my people didn't
But I'm gonna ball for why'all, big baby
And ball actin' crazy
And watch my back, for the shady nigga tryin' to do me somethin'
I'm ballin' cause my rhyme done threw me something
Hard labor, and hard times
After hard rhymes
Glad I ain't got the glock no more
Takin' what's yours and call it mine
I called my moms' today,
She asked me did I pray?
I told her, I got to, cause the streets I'm roamin' on is one way

[Chorus]

See the street life be shady
I wonder, if my parents knew before they made me?
That shit's crazy
Will I survive this shit?
Maybe
But see, I've been strugglin' and hustlin'
Ever since my, grandmother was a baby
You think I'd be sayin' to myself
How many more days you leave jail?
When I can be on the street with my peep nigga
Countin' some mill
Hypnotized by fast thangs, fast cars and fast bitches
I'm tryin' to have fast things, can you dig it?
(What's up?)
Hopin' outta 4 doors
(What you mean?)
Sittin' low in low-low's
Never fuck with, no I don't know hoes
For sho' hoes
Come from the South and no doubt I wear jibo's and polo's
Everything I ride is chrome and mo-mo's
can't' trust a few, cause that's a no no
You gotta watch your back, cause niggaz will jack
That's why I stay strapped with 4-4's
See, I'm tryin' to have enough money to turn every project into a condo
Every nigga I don't like, to wino's
and every girl that alright, to fine hoes
And my next contract
Negotiate for 89 O's
Now see, the street life be hard, but I still drop the top
And niggaz be lookin' at me all mad, so I cock the glock

So I'ma keep mines out here with this weed and coke

House full of floors that's marble, a brand new Ferrari.
Parked it, when I bought it, see, I'm a no limit soldier.

I just put a million dollar reward up 
For any information or anybody who know who killed Kenny 
Ya heard? 

[Chorus] 
(Kenny's dead) 
We got to ride tonight 
My little homey Kenny died tonight 
(that's what I said) 
Unh! 

Kenny strated messin' up  hangin' with the thugs 
Cutting class  in the fast section  see weed and drugs 
And I guess that's how it is, when the ghetto got you trapped 
But Kenny ain't scared, he seen his pops get his neck snapped 
People lie in they sheet, on South Park streets 
Where the hoes chill and everybody run from the police 
But what I liked about Kenny, he wasn't no crip or no blood 
And he mumbled when he talked, but he loved that bud 

[Chorus] 

A lot of hopeless nights chasin' nickels and dimes 
Kenny rode the other bus to school, but at night, he did crimes 
Two eleven, one eighty seven, it's like a hobby 
Kenny slowed his roll, he did three years for a robbery 
Some say Kenny was the poorest kid on the street 
But picture this, Kenny with about ten g's and a couple of keys 
Huh, servin' the dope fiends, standin' on the corner 
Moved and worked from New Orleans to Arizona 
But it was a trip, Kenny always wondered how he would die 
Would it be a car crash, a plane, a gun, or suicide 
He knew one day that the rats would come 
But he didn't know they was gonna scream ""'bout it 'bout it"" 
And hit him with a shotgun 
Unh! 

[Chorus] 

A lot of wasted deaths, a lot of senseless crime 
But everybody think about what you do out there, because uh 
Judgment day is for everybody

Master P,"Hey dad I got in a fight with this white kid today at school
Son, didn't I tell you I don't want you fighting?
But he called me a nigger

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world 
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

Its a shame when you can't send your kids, to decent schools
We live in the world for the laws and no rules
Gang-bangers, crease sides, and chalk lines
Correctional facilities full of juveniles doin' petty crimes
In this ghetto, got me crazy
Sometimes I wish, mama wouldn'ta made me
But its a shame when you gotta raise a baby
And the color of my skin might taint me

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

And all the money can't change the color of your skin
Why so many blacks and Mexicans in the pen?
It is cause we VIOLENT?
But why Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and started smilin'?
So many people have dreams
But why society eliminated Martin Luther King?
And they tell us to be proud to be black
And at the same time Uncle John shoot us in the back
Independence, its a free country
No jobs, most blacks turn to street money
A bunch of ghetto full of drugs and alcohol
Where found history books about white laws
And Tommy Hilfiger discriminate
And sell us clothes
But we can't blame him cause
We don't support the black stores
And only God can judge or point the finger and what's
White or black and red and blue equals gang banging

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

(I'm just a black man
Trapped in this white world)
I'm colorblind, so Lord won't you feel my pain
(Hold on, hold on
Trapped in this white world)
I'm colorblind, so Lord won't you feel my pain

P pray for your little brother
Silkk, keep your head up

I'm tryin' but sometime I get fed up (Damn)
What about all of the people that died in the past?
Peers I can't get back with too many found guilty
And I know they didn't do it
But still they can't get back
I see the copper be tryin' to nail me
Police constantly trailin' me
Cause I'm young, rich, and black
I'm always under survelience
Dash me out the car
And wanna ask me who the car fuck
Thay allowed to carry guns
Can't never be convicted
Who that law fuck?
I'm guilty till proven innocent
Still we all equals, how do you figure?
Cop told me
""you weren't speeding but I'm gonna give you a ticket cause you a nigger""
I seen the hardest of my homies
Break down in tears
A white judge looked them in the eyes
And gave them 35 years
Now its a everyday struggle
I hustle just to live
To raise your kids
When they got them teachin' them
Their parents better than them
They got me thinkin'
The color of my skin
Is a sin
I'm a black man in a white man's world
Where its set up for me not to win
Lookit, ain't that about a bitch
They look at us like we ain't shit
But lookit, I ain't racist, but face it, it exists
I'm a black man (Ungh)
I'm just a black man trapped in this white world 
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

Check this out (check this out)
Underneath (underneath)
Ain't no black or white (there ain't no black or white)
We all equal (we all equal)
We all equal (we all equal)
We all (remember that)
Got the same opportunity
Whether we wanna be judges, doctors, or lawyers
Ain't a black or white thing
Pick the best man for the job
And there shouldn't be no hatin'
Where you live, if you can afford to buy a house
Should be able to live wherever you want
The same hospitality they give to athletes
And movie stars
Should give that same hospitality and companionship
To your neighbors
You heard me?
Y'all know it ain't a black and white thing with me
I just make music
For the reality
Only the real could feel this, huh
Only the real could feel this",Black and White,1998

Yea Area all day everytime. 
Like dis here. 
Element of surprise. 
Da Last Don  
Charlie Hustle. 
Check it out. 

Let it be writ and said, done and published 
That on the sixth month of June 1998 
E-40 Fonzarellie A-K-A Charlie Hustleezy 
And my Third Ward weepilation 
From the No Limit Records Headquarters and congregation 
Plugged up and did a rumble together without no hesitation and erased 
Any Old School classic memories of Northern California 
Godzilla ballin' and Bay stranglin' and hustlin'
Morning, night, day in Norleans 
And dang near fallin' asleep on the freeway 
Bobbin and weavin' and ditchin' and dodgin' po-po, Penelope force 
Tryin' to convince em that me and the dope game wasn't gettin' along any how 
We had been went our separate ways 
Shit, we been had a divorce 
In and out of court, betta' yet 
Neva was married any how and engaged 
Pushed in the game at a young age, trapped in a ghetto cage 
Went from hardly any to, uh, plenty of cash 
To, uh, high speed chases to, uh, makin a dash 
Uh, excuse me sir can I have your autograph 
And, uh, when your new album droppin fool 
That other shit was cool 

[Chorus]
Get your money man, get your paper 
Get your paper man, get your money 
Get your fettie or your scratch, get your skrill 
Get your revvies man, get paid 
Get your mail man, get your marbles 
Get your marbles man, get your mail 
Get your grits, get your chettah, get your chips 
Get your snaps man, get paid 

Ugh! Ball wit da real, hang wit da Gs 
Started from Richmond, California to New Orleans 
Game won't change, these niggas can't fade me 
Mama still pray for baby 
Ghetto got me sick, dope fiends and crack heads 
Niggas on da front porch wit tech nines and lemon heads 
And all I want be is a soldier 
Cause I'm tired of runnin' from da rollas 
Jumped in da rap game and now dey can't hold us 
Ghetto millionaires and still blowin' doja 
Keep my composure when times hectic 
Now I own a house in California, Orlando, and Texas 
And still run wit the thug niggas 
And made tapes for bitches and drug dealas 
And push 600 wit a bulletproof 
The ghetto Bill Gates 
The only president wit a gold tooth 

[Chorus]

Uh, n-neva let your guards down 
Always play defense neva offense 
Cause suckas a try to make your kindness for weakness 
And damn sho try to shake your hand up unda falsified pretenses 
Sequence this
Paint a portrait of these next events 
See if you can predict what I was about to say 
Within the next couple of sentences 
Technically impossible 
To hard to call 
See right when he thought I was gone throw a slider 
I threw him a knuckle ball 
Back against the wall, knockin' niggas out (knockin' niggas out) 
Hemmed up in da corner nigga that's what I'm about 

Feel my pain, sometimes I feel trapped 
Nigga tired of hangin' in the ghetto takin' food stamps 
Cause this street life got me crazy 
But I hustle cause I gotta feed a baby 
And only God can take me 
And ain't no nigga in this hood gone play me 
So when I ball I'm a ball til I fizall 
And when I'm gone put my name on the wizall 

[Chorus]",Get Your Paper,1998
Master P,"I was born... coming up from the ghetto
Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin I had to know
Had to be real sneaky
Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I never knew what my life would be, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'll show what I'm talkin bout, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
When ya comin from the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I see you takin bills

I'm ready to ride, ready to roll
Ay check this mack I bet you're boyfriend aint knowin
That I'm steadily blowin your back out
Watch me track out on these niggas and bounce out on these hoes
Get at em like ""what's up trick"" you know how it goes
It's Friday night, the club is about to close
And I was lookin fabulous
So I,  got up to stretch 'bout to catch me one of these stragglers
True eastside dogs, and we barkin not simpin
Yo holmes 'bout that time to start this parking lot pimpin
I keep that thang, huh, posted in the same spot
Nothin but my khaki shorts, house shoes, boxers and my suede shine
I'm from the home of the riots
That's before the peace died but I'm still hollin out eastside

Uhh, what y'all busters gon do
When the pimps, bangers, and hustlers smash on you
It aint about who's sellin the most caine
Put us all together nigga see you run thangs
If you can't hang, stay the fuck out the kitchen
Bitch I'm ghetto fabbed out, so fuck politickin
Waitin for a chance and the shit it never happened
Time is money, and when you get it keep it clackin
All you hear is, with my two inch twist
I keep the goodyear grip, so the dubs don't slip
If you want my claims, I think you besta make a change
So close your eyes when I let my back end hang
I ride til the motherfucking wheels fall off
Domie's got daytons, Goldie's got daytons

All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I sopt
Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin
Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin

Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he downposed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most
Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin with some government cheese (government cheese)
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin dice on his knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello
Livin it up is livin life in the ghetto

I was born... coming up from the ghetto
Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin I had to know
Had to be real sneaky
Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I never knew what my life would be, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'll show what I'm talkin bout, ghetto

But I ain't tripping cause I knew one day girl you'd be my lady 
Probably have my baby I know it sound crazy 
But thugs need love and if you real girl save me 
Your loyalty got me a sucker for love 
And when I went to jail you sent kisses and hugs 
And I could feel your lips through your letters 
You said you wait for me, 'cause you down for whatever 
Now I'm out girl and we balling 
Mansions, 600 Benzes, Lex Luther, trucks and Ferraries 
Rolex watches and bracelets 
Diamonds on your ears and fingers and taking trips to foreign places 
Now we be hooked like drugs 
But you been there from the beginning, that's why we call it ghetto

Trying not to ever stress ya take the pressure off ya mind 
You my kind of nigga ain't nobody else gone do 
I can't see being in love without you 
Beside me, inside me, nothing can divide you and me 
That's why them other broads know we gone be

With a swoll bank account living in a million dollar house, but don't

Lord won't you wash away my pain (this ghetto's got me trapped)

[Master P]
found me on the street corner hangin' with the big niggas
playin' football in the ghetto we call it flea flicker
and ain't no rules 'cause niggas get shot 
and every fuckin' day niggas runnin' from the cops
nigga won't change mama 'til you bury me 
but make sure six TRU niggas carry me 
but if they miss know (nigga) you a goner 
'cause there ain't gone be no family members to mourn ya 
I wasted sperm for the ovaries drug dealin' to penetentaries (Ughhh)

[Silkk the Shocker]

its a cold and cruel world sometimes it gets shady
I ain't been the same since my auntie gave birth to a crack baby
want to know why I'm rowdy I be clutchin' my glock 
'cause if I have P and see come over and tell mama young Silkk just got shot 
I couldn't even close my eyes and not feel the pain 
I could re-open my eyes and realize 
all the niggas that lost their lives in this game 
I lost a lot tryin' learn the facts of life fuck color nigga we all struggle
with this black or white to all my niggas in penetentaries 
I received ya'll letters 
and I swear to hang in there if things don't get better 
now picture this I got Auntie diein' of overdose uncle diein' of aids
realize that I got a little money but there's somethings money can't save
is there a heaven for gangstas is there a heaven period 
and based on the fact that things did wrong probably 'cause I hang with
too many killers and niggas diein' over wars shits hard where I'm from
that's why I spit it how I live it and I get it how it come 
on top of that I had a fucked up day 
to god look couldn't find the words to explain so I'll tell you
tonight when I pray feel my pain

RIP homie  RIP 

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 

How do I say goodbye to what we had 

The good times that made us laugh outweighted the bad 

I thought we'd get to see forever 

But forever's gone away 

It's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 

[Master P] 

y'all niggas smile for my ghetto heroes 

So many homies gone  trying to ball till they fall 

Now I'm left with nothing but old cards 

and a bunch of pictures on the wall 

RIP tatoos nigga, just to show you that we real 

But I still can't believe that your dead fool, and how you got killed 

And on your birthday me and my boys visit your grave 

And I remember when you first got high 

and the first time you got laid 

And I'm going through a thing, Kevin nigga, what should I do 

I never imagined living life without a nigga like you

Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 

Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies

We shed so many ghetto tears, see time is crazy 

And every sunday grandma go to church 

she said she gotta pray for her baby 

And ah, your little son, he look just like you 

And momma going through a thang, but she gonna pull it through 

And ah me, see and Silk we got a little money but that don't mean shit 

Cause I burn all that shit up nigga, just to have you again 

And it's real out here, all you niggas that's goin through some pain 

Keep your head up, and this for everybody 

that lost a relative in the street game

Chorus 

[Silkk The Shocker] 

Now look, I couldn't imagine life without you 

I just sit here wonderin why 

But the law of life, and god placed us here 

and said everybody must die 

Ended hard trying to move on but still I try 

Even though we got money, judgement day 

just some things we can't buy 

Even though you gone, I never let you move on 

Cause every time i think about you 

I sit back and write your name in a song 

Now ashes to ashes, and dust to dirt 

It's kinda spooky when one day I see your face on a t-shirt 

I just pray to god it's hard wishing it would get better 

And why it take a death or a funeral to bring our family together 

Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father 

Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them 

You'll never know whether they'll be here tomorrow

Master P,"Chorus:Master P
Daddy wasn't home so mama raised me
I'ma thug but still mama bathed me (4X)

Verse 1:Master P
I live my life as a thug, roll wit' some killas
Slang crack to some dope fiends, ride wit' some drug dealers
Find me in 3rd ward pullin' all nightas
Keep a tech 9 cocked for any nigga that don't like me
Throw up your soldier rags if you rowdy
I represent a million muthafuckas that's 'bout it
Mama couldn't control my destiny as a street thug
Find me in the Range Rover buyin, sellin street drugs
Even though, this ghetto got me crazy
Everytime I go to jail mama get me out cause I'm her baby

CHORUS (2X)

Verse 2: Snoop Dogg
I'ma gangsta, located in the alleys and Cali
Shoot dice wit' killas and smoke wit' the dealers
You can't tell me shit 'bout these streets homey
I don' seen it and done it and lived the real from the phony
Out for this money, homies maintain they composure
Since kids on the streets sellin' dope by the police
Now I'ma a soldier muthafucka for the chips
When I dips the trips, GP straight for DP
But the scripts how mama raised me 
Pops wasn't home, left us all alone
Wasn't no thang, cause my mama had game
She showed me everythang except how to be a man
I understand, for all the streets and the jail time I caught
The pain I brought, that wasn't what you taught
It's probably pops fault how I ended up
Gangbangin', crack slangin', not given' a fuck
Two strikes in my life, a nigga fed up
Mama said don't let up, and baby boy keep your head up

CHORUS (2X)

Verse 3:Soulja Slim
Now picture me a ghetto child, runnin' wild
Maybe if you emphasize, niggas supposed to pick us
The world wouldn't be like it is now
I made moms proud, when you mention me she smile
If feels good buyin' moms a car and a house
And my pops been locked up for ten years
Life was a struggle moms shed so many tears
That's why baby ain't got nothin' that I love so much
The only one can hurt my feelings, when she fuss
Momma I love you cause you brought me hear
But niggas startin' to hate and it's gettin' dark in here
But I remember what you told me, and what ya' showed me
Take it slowly

Could you imagine me with no stash?
Like a bank with no cash
Tryin' drive a car with no gas

And fuck one day with no tag?
Shotgun with no class
Window with no glass
Or all you girls with no ass

See I'm a risky rider
Caliope crawler
A Down South Hustla
Plus a head buster from New Orleans

See I gotta be a paid nigga
A made nigga
Be the nigga to bust yo' shit
And the nigga the be the grave digga

See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did
But the move of other niggas that bout it
Feel the shit I do just tah live

I done shot my rifle, trained to kill
Got blood on my fatiques
Once you in ain't no turnin' back

Be on yo' Ps and Qs nigga

Don't cry like no bitch
You see a weak nigga, that's a beat nigga
And fuck a stead nigga, that's a dead nigga
Tell my mama not to worry bout me why I'm gone

If I die bitch, box me up and ship me back home
Bury me in the N.O. with my stripes on my chest
Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best

Master P,"Ghetto niggas remain violent while the killers remain silent
Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all warrin'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggas do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makes music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause it's deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
He came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggas

This is for my homies and my thug niggas 

'face, picture us working at McDonald's
And me and you selling fucking toasted up ?
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggas
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
We ghetto niggas can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggas off from New Orleans to California
Rowdy like a hurricane
Independent, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see c in a suit and tie
But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

[Chorus: x6]

What do you get from boosting?
Niggas coming out from California to represent them niggas from Houston
And now we rocking keep this shit popping
And all my niggas across the bay know l.a. keep the shit hot
I keep my glock inside my pants , don't give niggas a chance
To put me inside a casket you dirty bastards
Until the day I die you catch a nigga high off weed the police can't find me
My shit will drop and I'll sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game get caught up in drug dealing
How can I fall? how can I ball, how can I catch my enemies and murder them all?
My word of flame burn niggas inside their brain
Niggas can't hang with me, and like it changes, uh
Scarface got me on this shit
We laced it motherfuckers in their body and face, uh
Growing thicker, liquor made me daddy and nigga
Niggas don't wanna see me world wide mob figure
M.o.b. and the leaf keep me weeded
Them niggas don't wanna see me when I got weed in my system
Catch another victim, capture bodies
Bring a shottie to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit cause it's wrong but we were born right
And to the niggas in my zone we do it long ways
Till these bitches understand nigga my song pay; cause I'm the man
Now these are my homeboys, we outlaws till the day we die
Keep this shit rough and raw my 45
Make sure that I survive to another day
To bust rhymes which from I get paid
Now that's the end of my freestyle but it was left for dead
But the shit away you can hear it playing, west side

[Chorus: x8]",Homies & Thuggs [The Original][Version],1998
Master P,"[Scarface]
Ghetto niggas remain violent all the killers remain silent
Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all rome'
The lake we build houses but its the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggas do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that making music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause its deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't circle
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggas

[Chorus: x6]
This is for my homies and my thug niggas

[Master P]
'Face, imagine us working at McDonald's
And me and you selling fucking tapes in the Bahamas
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggas
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No Limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
Real ghetto niggas can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little J down at Rap-A-Lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake its for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggas off from New Orleans to California
Rowdy like a hurricane
Independent, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see C.E.O.'s in a suit and tie
But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

[Chorus: x6]

[Doracell]
It's alive, and I'ma be tha motherfucking one
Make these niggas want some
Here I come
Da Last Don
Niggas steady claiming this
Tatted on my wrist since 86
What the fuck?
I'm sitting in my cell block stuck
Listening to this shit my radio did
Shit, gotta change the situation
Write a letta to the warden motherfuck all this time wasting
Chasin' niggas wit my occupation
Clean across the nation
Lookin' for two-facin
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope-dealer all in one
Now past me my motherfucking  gun
Niggas feelin' they invincible
Til' they dealin' wit tha motherfucking principle
Doracell nigga
I ain't scared cause 2pac got kilt
I'm on tilt
Feelin' the motherfucking guilt

Sometimes I think the Lord is testing me 

don't want to go to jail 

I'm tired of getting arrested G 

I know i'm spitting when i'm sell crack 

but to a young nigga like me 

a G ain't no turning back 

trying to settle down is hopeless 

when a nigga and a old lady and a baby 

I can't cope with it 

a chance is something that I never had 

I'm standing on this corner 

I got my rocks in a skittles bag 

can't make a move without my boy 

I wear a bulletproof vest 

and watch my back because i'm paranoid 

you know the ghetto is a trap 

i'm not Tupac but these jealous niggas got me strapped 

raise like a criminal but born a bastard 

visions of a jail or a grave 

a closed clasket 

reminizing about my murder friends 

but i'm proud of selling drugs 

providing my family with these dividends 

my nose bad nigga like a rock star 

tired of swolling dope 

everytime I see a cop car 

can't leave this spot 

till all my fuckin crack gone 

six rocks never asked the Lord to let me make it home 

cause i'm a nigga on the run

Even when there's no food in the fridge, you say you're lucky to have me 

Never tripped on the life I live 

You had my kid, you held my strap to prove it's for life 

You got Lady Assassin tatted on your back, sometimes I don't act like I should 

You still understand what I'm going through, the pressures from the hood 

I'm trying to make it all good forever 

I can't see living life without me and you together

It's real out here 40 (It's real Pee!)

I'm out here in the slums where thugs be using, ghetto tactics
Like, chopping up candy canes
Sitting on top of a dried up JC Penney day mattress
Whatever it takes to survive, see that's what I supply
Like slipping and sliding in the grocery store
And settling out of court
Soft white coke a black turn into hard solidses
Thirty-eight snub nosed pistol grip lay ninjas on they 
The saga continues, the struggle's just beginning
And it's hard to look up to snotty folks, cause THEY be sinning
'Pac gone, Biggie gone, Seagram gone and we also lost Eazy-E 
One of the first gangster rappers of all time
To the most vicious and deadliest disease in history since cancer
To Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, tombstone
From the graveyard shift, RBL's Mister see
One love, to Rapping Ron and Plan B

Everything must change, it's getting shady

Seen bloodshed by crooked cops, and gang bangers
Feel my pain only time'll change it
And fast money, cars, and bitches got me trapped in this game
And my lil' homies balling, picture me falling
And momma in the funeral screaming and crawling
Is there a heaven or hell?
To ghetto kids in the anky only time will tell
And jealousy, and envy, come with money
While crooked, politicians, run the country
And it's a, damn shame to see my, weeples vanish
Now they teach us ebonics, what about English and spanish
I couldn't, live my life behind bars and gates
While the government play a game called process to eliminate

But they ain't never been evicted, or convicted
They ain't never been subpoenaed to court, or arrested
Shackled like an animal for pushing rocks
Dang near choked to death by motorcycle cops
Pepper sprayed and laughed at like that shit was funny
Pregnant breezy threw down on her tummy
Do you ever think I'll ever be able to get
A chance to repent and ask the lord for forgiveness
Before he close the casket, will my son end up growing up
Without a father will he end up being a bastard?
A bastard, that's a good question
I don't know, I don't know

I only fuck with a few
You never know what these niggas'll do
You better choose careful who you call your crew
And do a review on these bitches, before you call em your boo x2

You never know what's goin on with
Some of these hungry ass niggas arrested
And what you got, never allowed the chance to touch it
Was it obvious that nigga ain't die
He was in from the begginning had a piece of the pie
Cause in his eyes, cold like chicago weather
Birds of a feather fuck over together, that's forever
The only change, they accepted when I got him killed
Well they all a time for real over a dollar bill
So now you feel that all street family ain't yours
Receiving cuts and sores because you opened your pores
These niggas ride like volvos, and we ain't talkin bout these whores
Give a section of the beach, nigga surfers gotta swim ashore
If you need more, then take this notion with my devotion
Remember jealousy is a wasted emotion.

I'd rather die hustling then be broke and lonely
Cause most of these niggas out here be phony
Find me on the street corner living my life fast

See this tru shit nigga I'm a kill for it
When the rents due, ya know I'm a steal for it
Take a ride with my homies if I have to
Keep your eyes on your enemies cause they'll blast you
[master p]
And momma sheds tears cause my homies seen that
Nigga gangbang seen tru up on my chest
To my niggas in jail, stay strong doin time
I thank the lord for taking me out the ghetto with these rhymes
Blood stains on the street cause this ghetto life's a bitch
And that's a shame cause it's bound to change once a niggas rich

Chorus x2

[silkk the shocker]
Come take a ride at, before the game begins
I seen niggas die bad, and they die for pennies
Can't trust nobody seen around my way
Niggas dead, and that's why they ain't around today
See penetentaries, they ain't no place for me
I tell my mom don't trip, just pray for me
And to all the slugs from niggas that have hate for me
Tell my lady I'll take two years don't even wait for me
And see, you never get a second chance to live a first life
That's why I ball till I fall and live the first right
So even though I thug with them, I still ask these niggas
I've seen a lot of cold shit, ? ? ? ? ? been home test if I get ya
I only ride with niggas that I test the water with
Niggas I slang quarters with, slaughter shit, spent the hardest shit
Only trust a few, only trust a few

Lose someone, how you gonna take that feelin away? I got sons of funk,
An me fiend, an my people, master p an silkk
They ready to tell you how I feel, trapped, everyday life.

Verse 1- (fiend)

Everytime I open my eyes, I thank God for wakin this soldier,
'cause in this cruel world it's hard to walk these streets bein sober,
It hurts, tryin to get over all the weight on my shoulders,
Mom used to be babysitters buyin boulders,
It's all on me to really except that I lost my brother,
An to be stong an juss to go on since we shared the same mother,
Pillows an covers can't smother the pain that I have,
Sometimes I feel like I lost my better half, so sad,
But that's the way of the ghetto,
See yo life is already made, it's an accomplishment to pass ""a"" grade,
See they hate my city, givin us the pushers an tramps for our highs,
Sellin they book of food stamps at night,
I light the porch lamp, until my lil cousin came in,
'cause I can't afford to lose another gender life,
But livin this bend you could lose it if it came today,
It rained away, you be wonderin how to take the pain away.

Tell me what we gonna do? the world ain't the same man,
The way we live is a shame, I can't hide this pain. (x2)

Ughhh! lord the world ain't the same, from the cradel to the grave,
Dear mama keep yo head up I'm tryin ta get paid,
These ghetto tears got me out there wantin to scream,
My auntie 35, but bumpin 17 off a dope fiend,
I live my whole life to stack some chips,
An it's a shame when yo own homie, sank yo ship,
An mama cryin......'cause church's be packed,
An all yo family an friends dressed in black,
An it's a shame, to see homies leave this earth,
Some say ball, til you fall, now it's ashes an dirt,
Sometimes, I feel like I'm trapped between heaven an hell,
In the ghetto's ? ? ? tory, wit fiends an crack cells.

(chorus x2)
(master p chorus x4)

Verse 3-(silkk the shocker)

You might catch me, walkin wit my head down,
In the pourin rain,
Tryin to find answers to questions, no one can seem to explain,
I coulda been born son of a king,
Instead I was born son of a, killa, surrounded by dealaz an fiends,
Dear God I got some questions, that maybe you can answer,
Why my brother got shot, an my grandmother died of cancer,
Now through it all I tried to ball an keep it real,
They say they don't feel what I feel,
I guess 'cause they don't live where I live,
See my mom tried to be strong, my brother died
Didn't wanna see her cry,
But I seen her through the face of the mirror
Wipin tears from her eyes,
An my next door neighbor committed suicide, was it 'cause of stress,
An if it was, was it that bad that he had to choose death?

Sittin here tryin to take the pain away, see this one here
This for all my ghetto fiends out there

To everybody in the penitentary, I feel yo pain

Got a story to tell
Which is, the life of the baddest
Born from ashes, the smoke of dead, of an addict
Got to have it, cause baby boy, it's a habit
Puff it and fuck some pussy, and see which one I grab quick
I'm that sick, I need weed to proceed
Like a band-aid for a cut, hopin to stop the bleedin

I'm smokin green with a fiend by the age of eighteen
I chop a pound to the ground, went cavi on the triple beam
Once upon a time, before I used to bust rhymes
I had to scratch to get a nickel, in order to get a dime
But times done change, now I'm havin mines
And I'm protected by the tank, No Limit, and plenty nines
I grinds to the fullest, so when I'm finished I gots to pull it
I'm lookin for that green shit, boy you bite the bullet
For tryin to sell me bullshit
You know I'm lookin for the bombest weed in your town
Now, I'm a smoker

I wanted the house, so I got the house 
I wanted the car, so I got me the car 
Don't start, cause no heart is what got me this far 
I the type of nigga that don't give a fuck 
Just walked up and laughed at the cop 
Type of nigga to go up in traffic 
and start blastin the glock 
Rap's still down, see huh, pass me the rocks 
I don't be playing it serious 
I'm actually looked after he shot 
It's no love, for y'all 16 bullets 
Four slugs peace, ain't no bigger thugs than me and see 
So you got the mightious touch,

My adversaries hate me, this ghetto got me crazy
I hope these streets don't play me, mama why you MADE me?
I'm a No Limit thug nigga
Live the American dream, so society think I'ma drug dealer
Cause I hang with the MADE Men
600 Rolls Royce's and Ferrari's on the PAVEment
Ghetto fabulous, Rolex with the pearl face
Million dollar mansion, imagine livin like Scarface
And then the Feds started watchin me
Johnny Cochran's clockin me
Can't depend on black, not no stoppin me
Started from the bottom, made it to the top
I told you No Limit just came to make the CLUB rock

and nickname me The Last Don

Profusely, spendin lucci, extravagant cuisine

Trips to the Caribbean, in a jacuzzi, with a uzi
Try to bruise me, then I coolly, pop pop shots like a juve'
How your crew be? For the 34th, it's Nico, take the meek off
While we floss, hit the weed spot, then freak off, in the sheik long
Got three glocks, niggaz don't want no drama, lyrical Unabomber

See momma don't understand how you died in tha game
And grandma get older, Little Kevin he's a soldier
We done made it out da ghetto ain't no more run'n for tha rollers
Tattooed your face on my arm so you legacy could live on
You said ""P be strong"" with out you we all alone
I know its been a few years you your birthday we shed tears
And I don't wanna question you God
But why he took you and left us here?

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)

Look, just thinkin about you my nigga bring tears to my eyes
I mean I'm hard and all but even tha realish niggaz cry
And when you left, part of me died too
And who ever knew Kevin like I knew Kevin shhh ya'll would cry too
Just think'n about you, if you were still here
How much different remenisin on one of your pictures
Lookin at the family thinkin we always got one miss'n
And I can still remember tha last words (and mine ain't even started)
Look your never forgotton 'cause on your birthday I go and put flowers on your
Grave
I still remember when P and see broke tha news to me at school about your death
Told me ""Silkk time would heal our wounds""
It's been oh five years and I ain't healed yet
Now I feel somthing I'm tryin tryin to be strong
I know moms tryin to hold on
Even tho your here and your gone
I got so many questions, that's why I can't move on

A couple of months before December (December)
I still can't take tha pain
We all are stuck in this ghetto rain
I learned my lesson, could your blessings
Watch your enemys and watch your friends
And if it ain't your blood don't show that man no love
'Cause kindness make you weak and cause blindness in tha streets
And the vultures commin to get you
When none of you're real homies is wit ya
And its sad can't break the cycle
And take a drink wit my uncle Michael
And my momma question my silence
But I blame this sinceless violence
Don't wanna wake up 'cause when imma asleep
You still alive up in my dreams
A few seconds of happy thoughts to keep my mind at eaze
And then Kevin its like you ghost my body freeze when ever I see him
If anybody got yours ways, you know it'd be him

Check this out, boo
The only thing that matters is if you happy and I'm happy
You know what I'm saying?
We know this real ghetto love
After the fronting and fighting, 
That's where the love making begins real good baby
But our friends ain't our friends
Your mama in our business, 'n' your sister in our business
The media in our business
These motherfuckers don't understand

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson:]
You said you're a friend of mine, it turned out you crossed the line
I forgive you I don't know why, you said you're a friend of mine
You said you're a friend of mine, it turned out to be a lie
I forgive you I don't know why, you said you're a friend of mine

[Master P:]
Call the cops for nothing, all the jumping and stunting
It should be kissing and hugging, I mean loving and rubbing
I'm on your team, you're on my team, I'm your king, you my queen
I'm the ice, you the cream, but your friends love the scheme
Even I told you you was special, see these hoes will sweat you
The niggas will wet you, but the ghetto is pressure
No more fighting in front of the kids, it's time to live big
Build a family tree of figs, and let the haters dig
You my rose I'm your flower, I think about you ever hour
Keep them hoes out our business, if you need me just holla

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg:]
I tell you all my problems, share my deepest secrets with ya
Hit ya on the side, girl you down to ride
I feel so safe with ya, get cha what you need
A condo in the valley with the keys, palm trees, jet skies
Fly you over seas, it's silly how we did it
Really we committed
I'm dippin' out the studio with the too faking 
My heart just uh aching, while I'm shaking and snaking
You tell me take a chance, so I dance with the devil
I kiss you on the cheek, and now we sneak into the bedroom
Tossing and turning, burning, yearning for love
And you supposed to be in love with my young 'cause
What's love got to do with this? And it's all based on friendship
Ain't that twisted, somebody told my boo and I think it was you
Had to be, 'cause I ain't heard from you or seen you, so it must be true

Stressed out days

And some times I say "" UGGGGGGHHH"" To release my damn pain
Or pick up the phone to call my grandmama cause she kept me in the game
Before why'all say nothin prama , can't emagine life with out big mamma So many 
Snakes and killas, jackers and piranahs. 
See This game Got me way Deep,I pray the lord I wake before I sleep
See some say your friend be your emney,
Don't trust no one but your family
But All the love I show when I'm around
I wonder if they show us that when I'm down
See you a king when you sittin on top
But you a fool when you finally drop

Take me out the 9th ward and mabye I'll change
Call me a bad seed cause I smoke my trees before I Brush my teeth I'm Allways 
In black Ready to ride
No Limit is my only reply
I'm screamin it when I'm leavin see the fire in these foolish eyes
Don't Give a Damn about the Po-Po

And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die.

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.

I know its hard to stride.

Niggaz ask how much money I got do math
You know how to add I'm P little brother
Shit, I can't tell y'all nothin I gotta show y'all
Real in this, I'm as real as it gets I told y'all
Yo I sleep through the rain, sleep through the pain
Would have knew about me but you don't
Cause know why, cuase you was sleep when I came
But I'm here now, y'all suckas fear now
Look, plan on bein on top, don't stop, plan on bein hot year round
I don't do it for no love, I do it for the thugs
Do it for my block, do it for the VIP spots in the club
It's hard to stop this life like it's hard to call cocked dice
We ain't nothin but some bout it, bout it niggaz
That live the ""Hard Knock Life""

[Chorus]
From my block to yo block, it's a sho' shot
We out the door, out the most, and the flow don't stop
You know what we do, you know what we 'bout
You know what we do, you know what we 'bout

From my block to yo block, it's a sho' shot
We out the door, out the most, and the flow don't stop
From the ghetto to the suburbs, from Marcy to the 3rd
You know what we do when we come through, ya heard?

In the south nigga
Deep in the four door, watchin that old dog
Or in the club nigga, shakin' them hoes off
Poppin my foes off ain't nothin changed
Or catch me on the block with thugs knockin the o's off
Baggin that 'dro nigga, stackin that dough
Clappin at foes and I'm laughin at hoes
Holdin them dice and I'm breakin yo bank
You see the shit Roc-A-Fella make wit The Tank
Even without the airplay platinum off of heresay
It's your year Jay get off my dick
Been my year, you talkin to a winner here
Iceberg winter's wear, linen chair
My style intact, money ain't come from rap
And we can take it right back if it comes to that
Block or Billboard, you gotta feel dog
I stay real y'all, that's how I kill y'all

[Chorus]

I used to rap, now B-ball's my life
Move that house on the lake for the kids and the wife
Check the bank account, it's seven figures
Who that Rolls in the video for, it's mines nigga
I got game, ask the players in the pro's
Who got shot, it ain't my fault 
(Ohhhh it ain't my fault) he owed me dough
Independent, black-owned, my world, my country
No Limit and Roc-A-Fella run this like drug money
So can I get a huh, huh? A what, what?
Pass the weed cause soldiers like to puff, puff
From the South to the East baby, baby
A couple of unggggh's now they gotta pay me
And flip bricks with ghetto chicks with no bicks
And nine's with no clips and sides wit no chips
Come fast or slow, from cheddar to dough

Fuck them niggas and I'll finish it
Now holla if you with me
Tell them hoes come and get me

Just a bunch a niggas lying around the first of the month
Getting paid getting high off of weed and blunt
That's how we ball from the south to the bay we don't play
Riding dirty with tray

Oh shit he's got a strap in his hands does he know what to do with it
Well yet and still you gots tokill for there's much to kill
Hands to experience been caught up in a raw deal
Flex my weight
From cans of beans to potato and steak
In got hungry and couldn't wait to demonstrate
Oh sucky now

Check therecords to see how many patterns that fell down
See I got hungry enough to go get it
'cause my family was doing bad
Who without it

Damn that beats by the pound I want the whole enchilada
He don't need no ambulance God knows he don't need no doctor
Dig a deep enough hole and throw his body right in it
And they pay us to send a message and we gonna damn sure send it
It's the X-files top priority risk
'cause you might see out of that type shit
From hoeing to jacking to macking (macking)
Dealing to looting that's really what's happening
Player don't know nothing about getting his hands dirty
Up early in the morning cooking chicks to birdies
No sense to no dollars ( no dollars )
Nohustle than why bother? Huh?

Is it true? (Y'all be whylin in the club too much)
Is it you... Made Men, Made Men
Is it you or is it Deja Vu?
Is it you? (Y'all the ones with all the money and all)
Is it true? (Y'all the ones that show the honies a ball)
Is it you... Made Men, Made Men... c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

[Made Men]
Yeah, two thous', new styles, fly as fuck for days
Fry chocolate thai, high and shit for days
Benz 6, V-12, 19's for shoes
Mens thick with a team known to squeeze the uz'
Cute girls, jewels whirlpools and champagne
I ran game, Made Men's on they brain
Afficianado, cigars and Henny bottles
Frijole corazon gatos with hot glocks though
Twist you like a braid, canary glaze that's made
Baguettes don't shine? Then get it appraised
Perform for MC's with Bentley's and M3's
Burn bomb trees with mamis, sit under palm trees

[Cardan]
Some niggaz talk like P Cardy, won't grab, three shotty
Let off three bodies, platinum three parties
I move quicker than, half of the niggaz that's witcha and
move swifter than, cats who Jack the Ripper so
when I say check this, respect this
If you ain't with me and Made Men, get off the guestlist
You see I'm from a place where it's nuttin but beats
Nuttin but cee-lo where pushers pay the dice off defeat
I got the Rove' out the shop, take the Chrysler off the street
Too much light and too much heat, pick a fight with these freaks
Got a hundred Harlem brothers that'll daze y'all crew
But this is the remix to the Deja Vu

Je-sus with Mase, pass hay, watch us blaze it up
If you don't give a fuck, take your hands and raise em up
It's the knock-right, hit from D-Dot got
everybody bouncin, steamin up ounces
Ain't no beef, just liquor, and reefer that's cheap
It's cheat or defeat, your girl is quicker to leave
I want to know can she do dat - if it's you, true dat
Meet me in the back after this track
International, money magnificence
To go against this, I think you know the consequence
I rock Kangols, my link dangles
Got more Cash than Tango, from my mad flows

[Big Pun]
Yo, yo, yo
Hey yo my shit is fatal, one blow, I make your chin to-ma-to
Don't make me run up in your crib and kill what's in the cradle
I'll make you wish you was dead, push a brick through your head
Rush my click through your set, suck my dick, lick it yeah
You the worst I ever heard, cursed with severed nerves
And my words to every verse like feathers to a bird
Rhyme compatible, my nine'll rip the spine outta you
Why should I battle you? You couldn't define one parable
I'm thug animal, Hannibal Lect', real cannibal
Eatin that ass like fire and gas, my shit's flammable
Frightenin in fact, you know niggaz is bitin my raps
Writin exactly the same like they recitin my back
Niggaz carbon copies, always mockin my shit
But can't nobody stop me, get up on top of me dick
I'm surprised if you thick, and I ain't with gettin caged in

Had to get my foundation mo' stable, and tighten up on my PAPER

Is there a heaven 4 a gangsta, that what my pah said
I learned to, double it up for some dollars
Hooked up wit a dopefiend term I sawed shit into hard powder
I'm on the block slangin amphetamines
I'm thinkin about my ghetto dreams on a triple beam
Ain't no, turnin back I'm way too deep
I got prices on my head by niggaz in the hood and the police
A young nigga tryin to make it
Twenty inch rims, candy wood, that's why they hate me, Soldiers

They tryin to catch me for steady stackin confedi it's heavy
But let me explain the game to break the chains of pain and, misery
Playin my fame throughout this game and, remain a, mystery
Is you peepin my skill? Is you seein is it real?
Is you hurtin from hatin makin me reach for my steel?
Knowin I'm runnin with ballers and steady clickin with killers
Graveyard peelers masterminded drug dealers, and bitches love

Actin a fool the savage style from New Orleans to Baton Rouge
I'm the cool out, makin it pop, it don't stop
til I stack a million chips that's off the top, is you feelin me?
I'm willin, it ain't no killin, I bet

In '89 I had a Benz, you ain't had a buck
I bought your only fuckin house, and your first fuckin truck
You pawn your rolley boy?
Oh...you doin' bad?
Stop trickin' to them hoes, and you wouldn't be on your ass
Now when times got hard
You ran your mouth like a bitch
Sold your soul to the devil, when you ran with other cliques
You ain't no soldier boy
Take that tat off your stomach
Nigga talkin' bout he love me
But bitch you love my money
Now if greed come between me and my niggaz
May god bless his soul
And I hope he forgive me

Chorus

[Silkk The Shocker]
These fake niggaz gon' fall off
We gonna be around for a minute
that's why niggaz, shoot shots and run
We stick around and finish
Now...see me dogg?
I'm around to win it
And I don't fuck around with you niggaz
Stop step the fuck away from around my Bentley
I'm bought to blow off these fake niggaz head
Sayin' ""what's wrong with Slim?""
Them niggaz fake P
That's why there's no fuckin' songs with them
We put our money together
Just like we started with crack
We let a couple niggaz shine
We bought to take it back
You know its mic's now nigga
We started with gats
Let a nigga play me on the streets
So dogg, I ain't gonna start with this rap
Gonna let them fake niggaz go
that's how we gonna settle down
If we hustle we stil be rich bitch...if we never rap

(Master P/Nino Brown)
Now when you shake that ass, I get rocked up
You got a boyfriend boo (Wodie, my man locked up)
Everytime you wobble wobble it gets me horny
So I can ride that ass from the night until in the morning
I could respect your mind, if you could respect the game
Is it cool to fuck, or is this about some change

hook

(Magic, Silkk/Vito)
I like it when I see 'em at the club, shaking that thang
Girl you really got me thinking 'bout taking that thang, come here

Got a nigga saying ""Ohhh girl""
Come a little closer, I'm trying to make you out my boo girl
Don't move girl, I'm on my way to the floor baby
Coming for mine, want to see if you can really shake it
Let's bump and grind, girl you did that

I like freaking at your man's house, when he leave I toot
What would he say if he knew that I was sexing you

Let me see you wobble then shake it, then baby pop it, don't break it
You want love let's make it, I just can't wait 'til you naked

You wit it? (yeah I'm wit it)
Then let's ride then (alright)

[Chorus: Master P (Souya)]

If I go to jail (I'm a wait for you)
If they question you (I ain't gonna say nothin')
If I need bail (I'm a bring the money)

[Master P]
I ain't checkin' you shorty
But it's somethin' I need to know
How serious this relationship is
And how far can it go

See, love and respect is somethin' you gotta earn
And if we don't keep up with each other, then somebody else get a turn
Would you ask me why if I told you to carry a gun
And do you know how to spur me if I just wanted to have some fun

Can a thug get a massage if I needed your hands
And would you jump in the ride if I told you to bring me them thangs
If a nigga tried to get at me would you ride for me
And if you couldn't swim would you take a dive for me

I know you like gifts, so I could buy you things
Like Benzs, Jaguars, ?? bubble-eyed Range
No obligation, I'm just tryin' to keep it real
Would you argue, fuss and fight when I need you to chill

Can you be cute and still be freakin'
When I leave out the door you ain't gonna try to be sneakin'
If I go to jail you can ?? my people
I need you Lord till I come home and be the sequel

[Chorus]

[Curren$y]
I been through a lot of girls in my life
But never found one who down to ride like you ride
If it's a problem then you gon' be right by my side
Even if I got a couple keys I need you to hide

'Cause you a real chick
One that I can chill with and bill with
Help me get my hustle on, climb up on the mill with
Even through the trouble you don't want a nigga still with

When it's said and done gon' be the one I have my kids with
Yeah you my baby girl, livin' in this crazy world
Wanted you a burner so I bought you a 380 girl
You understand my life and know that it's hard for me

And you the kind of girl I know my mama would want for me
And if the coppers stop us I know you'll take the charge for me
Makin' sure, stack some bricks in the trunk of your car for me
We live the lifestyle of ballers and stars and shit
And I'm out here grindin' to make sure we can afford the shit

Cruisin with my girl,even rollin with
thugs,
I need dubs 22's, 24's shinin in the
hood,
I'm the king of the car shows...

[Verse 1: Master P]
I see it I buy it, you need it I got it, I could
transform a car til' a hally berry body man
Regular wheels I banned um, don't stand um
I'm the first one to put sprewells on a phantom
Girls see me and scream!!!
I'm repin Orleans
I got toys baby flex ain't never seen
Xzibit in the game but he can't pimp
my ride,
I got everything flip from the in to the outside
Them lambo doors 50' talkin bout
I had um on a cutless befo' I brought me house
I put ice on my grill just to hurt them haters
27 diped in crome for the escalator
Put candy on the body so it glow in the dark
Put light on my rims for at night when they walk
Can't roll like no scrub, man on no hubs
Ghetto bill up in here...
y'all know what's up!

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2: Master P]
From the streets to the pin
You know the soldiers gon' win
When they see me on t.v. they say
he did it again,!
From his shoes to his clothes
he's ballin outta of contol,
From the bentley to the beamer to the
hummer with 6 doors...
But wody don't stunt, make them 6
fours jump,
Like reebox pumps,
P miller amps in the truck louis vettan
Ferrari, 360 is so clean.....
Ashanti rims, that really bing bing
And girls trip when they get in the ride
I got see-L 5, steering wheel on the other
side,
And I'm gangsta man, whatcha thinkin man?....
Shawty want to roll cause I'm on them Twinkies man

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3: LiL Romeo]
Now I'm know I'm kinda young but I keep my dubs clean...
Nick name my rims deime (d-e-i-m-e) cause they older then me
At the age of 15 man, doin big thinkgs man,
Don't hate dog! (why) cause you ain't me man
Some say I'm ballin cause my crome stay crawlin
Took the phantom for a ride, now they stay I'm night crawlin
Never get hungry cause I keep them deep dish'es
The people you saw, then they take pictures
My hummer sit clean on the shaq's minus 8
White, gold and purple, just like them old days (man...)
Now its kinda crazy cause Mercedes getting jeolous (what?)
Range won't asanti's but they can't have it
All for less its my baby, my boo, if I ever need help!
I just scream whoodi whoo!,
P miller speakers match my p.miller sneakers
The ones on my feet and the ones on my beamer!

I'm too strong to lose, I mean
My hustlin skills keep me in the game
I've got too much paper to fall off
Man you can take all kind of shots at me I'll bounce back

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You only get one life my nigga
And they steady throwin stones but I'm alright my nigga
The same way they did Christ my nigga
But I ain't mad at 'em, they hurtin and I'm alright my nigga

See ""I'm a Hustla"" homey and you a customer homey
I ain't Cassidy or Jigga but you can't touch me homey
I get my money from the block nigga the Ghetto Bill Gates
I got niggaz on my team from the South to the Bay
I didn't change when I made it I kept stackin my bacon
I'm on the block hustlin hard like I'm black and Jamaican
First they love you then hate you, man these bitches'll break you
From the streets to the pen, man these niggaz'll fade you
Man yo' mother could take you, man yo' brother could hate you
I got cousins tryin to kill each other, catchin the vapors
Disown ya mayne, run up on ya mayne
Pops said what don't kill you make you stronger mayne

[Chorus]

[Master P]
Niggaz rattin for cream, rappers switchin up teams
I'm like Michael Jordan nigga I'm tryin to follow my dream
Real niggaz gon' feel me, see these streets'll kill me
But I'm out here thuggin tryin to feed these children
Turn my family against me, man these cops'll flip me
Play my records if I die, like radio miss me
Ghetto niggaz made history, then the media hit me
I guess I ain't controversy enough like Game and 50
I'm from the streets my nigga, pack that heat my nigga
I'm a boss but suit and ties that ain't me my nigga
I'm from the hood my nigga, what's good my nigga
Uptown, Callope, I'm a bull my nigga
I'm on the block gettin paper nigga you can't hate me nigga
My son worth seven figures you can't break me nigga
I'm on the grind gettin cheddar and cheese
And I started in the ghetto back in New Orleans
I'm a hustler homey

And I, don't wanna see my baby cry
Anything happen to you I'm down to ride or die
And, I know the kids come first
But I love puttin' money in your Louis Vuitton purse, can you feel me?
Girl you lookin' beautiful
Let's get your nails done, on a plane or a boat
You deserve the finer thangs
Like Jaguars, minks, and diamond rangs
A mansion with a big piano
We can live like the Black Sopranos
They say all good girls love thug niggaz
I guess that's why I'm so in love wit'cha
Let's ride, let's ride
Me and you we can thug to the other side

Put you in a bubble I Bentley with the matchin' top
Hit the mall shawty, you can shop 'til you drop
I told you I'ma change your world
Designer names, you that kind of girl
Diamond rangs with the Rolex
You need a dress, Liz Claiborne can drop into the pro-jects
You put my name on your body and I'm feelin' that
You told me never let the hood hold you back
You was there when I needed ya
Now, I don't mind {?} pleasin' ya
Girl we used to thug together
On the block, even hit the club together
Wakin' up to cool-Aid and Crist'
Now you got the ice the size of Hershey's Kiss
I went to jail, youse the first to come visit
Now I'm home, anythang you want, girl go get it

-well, let's find a way out this shit
-well, let's do dat there

[master p]
Niggaz dat want to space age hustle
Catch that rocket to the fuckin moon
That be yo final ship, bitch, cause yo ass is doomed
Ain't no comin back, livin in the dope game
Cause once you die, nigga you slangin rocks, then that's yo name
On the wall when they run up,
I got killas coming trough with bubble ups to pick up double ups
And put him in that muthafuckin long black hearse
I mean, once you gone nigga you layin in the dirt
Ain't no love in new orleans,
All the way to richmond, california
Niggaz livin for ghetto dreams
And the ghetto get so crazy
I seen a little bitty baby suckin on daisies
Caught two to the chest, one to the head
5 niggaz walked behind him dressed in red
With ski masks, but niggaz thought it was a clown show
Witches in the st. bernard projects, downed a hoe
And it's sad cause niggaz claimin 3rd ward
9th ward and niggaz claimin 10th ward
All my homies be dyin down south
Run around, talkin shit, killas with gold in they mouth
But I'm a soldier, a rolla, give me ten
I'd rather die than go to the fuckin pen
My partna bos looked to my eyes and said, ""nigga
Is it time for change, niggaz ain't livin in this dope game""
So we jumped into this rap game
And laid it down to all my killas
That tried to teach my nigga the game
Cause once you gone, ain't no comin back
Talked to randall and t-dove
They say, ""p, the streets ain't all that.""
I mean the calliope projects done change
Right from roges tablet you find the fuckin police man
And niggaz still servin bubble ups
Big mo in the projects rappin, and niggas=z tryin to come up
And with this new wave dope game,
I mean this rap game, niggaz tryin to get out to make some change
But down south my homies dyin, niggaz fryin
But stories we ain't buyin

Chorus: repeat 2x

Who (2pac gone, but what rapper) gon be next
To take that final ride (I hope it ain't me who)
Get cashed like a bad check (slammin cadillac doors)
Black hearses when they should be 6-0's

[silkk]
I often wonder wonder if there's a heaven or a hell
Rest in peace to my niggaz that died
Too bad when they died they couldn't come back and tell
If they really is another side, I seen his mother cry
I just wanna know where he went when my cousin died
That last step, then it's yo debt, yo last breath
Then it's the moment you fear
Just think, by the day over, one of us ain't gon be here
Used to ride with a bunch of niggaz, now he's ridin solo
He's dressed up in a suit, when he used to wear polos
I wonder if there's a heaven for a gangsta, a killa, and a shoota
I wish some nigga gunned john gotti had went in the chamber
Moms say my days are numbered cause I live wrong
Even scarface made a song, gangstas really don't live long
I'm tryin to live to a rock candy painted cadillac like outkast say
Ride on them thangs like mack 10, from back side to side like u.g.k.
Convertible lexus like eightball, mjg
500 like my brother master p, I'm a shock the world if I see 23
Maybe not today, but tomorrow off into the funeral parlor
Take pause to bury my boy, as we roll up to the grave yard

Who gon be next...to take that final ride?

Chorus

[c-murder]
I done seen mo crime than a crime lord
Sometimes I sit back and think I seen more death than god
Just last week a nigga got shot up and burned
But me I take heed to shit like that, and I learned
How can I not end up like that nigga?
What the fuck I got to do not to get banged up by that trigga?
Cause in the projects, ain't no love
Niggaz will split yo wig cause they gon on drugs (her-oin)
I hope you feel me, cause I feel the pain of others
I feel for every nigga that got to go on without they brother
But like the game, what goes around comes around
Next week that could be your muthafuckin hearse ridin through that town
That could be yo mama cryin in that steeple
Better yet, that could be you mornin the death of yo people
In the hood, I'm known for peelin caps, so I'm a cap peela
The police know me for sellin drugs, so I'm a drug deala
I reverse the game cause ain't no love for a black man
13 years old, my little cousin got juvenile life for takin a stand
It's a never endin game of death, do or die
So if you kill, be prepared for that final ride

Chorus (2x)

R.i.p. 2pac, nigga, eazy-e, segram, mr. see
And my little brother kevin
Miller, and all y'all tru niggaz and bitches
That done died out there on these streets
And took that final ride

And I betcha thought that it was just another dog a bitch rhyme
But mia keeps it on her mind and I don't mind tryin'
A whole heap of niggas runnin' off at the pussy eaters
Sisters don't give a fuck about you and we damn sure don't need ya
Frontin' ass always tryin' clown
But be the main mother fucker havin' dinner downtown
Mounds of niggas talkin' 'bout who got a funky cat
But that's because the fact is that their nose be in the crack
Yeah reppin' on your dick bitch you needs to be smacked
Cause doin' that ride is like sittin' on a tic tac
Black mother fuckers always quick to trip
But know they came up on welfare and shit
Food stamps, medicade and commodities
Section 8 in projects so how you knockin' me
And claimin' you don't trip bitch you know you breaks me off
Before you give your boys or your messy ass moan
At salon shoppin' mall and nail shop here I go
Once my pussy hairs leave your teeth lookin' like a piano
So, I don't give a fuck about them niggas
Talkin' that shit cause you know you gonna pay a bitch
So playa you can talk what you want to yo niggas

[silkk]
Hah! I live and die, so I'm a die by the 9
Fuck the dumb shit, I run this, a whole life of crime
Ain't never had shit, but always had my pistol, bitch
187, don't make me whistle, bitch
I never know, for sho, picture this
Never die, bitch, never die, say a damn thang
Canes in the chains, became the dope thang
Snortin some cane will make you do some strange thangs
I don't know why I idolize gangstas like tony montana,
Lucky luciano, probably cause they went out bangin
Gangstas like machine gun kelly
Rest in peace 2pac, aka makaveli
He run the chamber for danger, can't understand why these strangers
Wanna ride with us killas, but they can't fuck when we hang em
Gangstas like kadofy, john fuckin gotti
Ain't fuckin with these snitches cause they got em for his shotty
Gangstas

Chorus

[master p]
Uuuunnnngggghhhh! just a young nigga hangin with the thugs
From the ghetto so a nigga learned to slang drugs,
From ozs, to flip keys,
Eye blood red shot nigga smokin dank weed
And quick to slap a bitch in a minute
Fiends better have my money, I mean every penny
Youngsta, kickin with the hustlas
Fuck school, tryin to serve a clucka
And moms, wish she never had me
Cause I'm a nigga on the block slangin candy
Ready to die for this true shit
Takin penetentiary chances tryin to get rich
My role models frank nitti, scarface, and john gotti
Real gangstas, that's bout it, bout it

Ready to turn your muthafuckin body numb
And fuck the pen, cause if I go to jail again

A nigga talk shit so I banged and I step
Another notch upon my rep (killa)
Like the last tape a nigga say fuck you hoes,
Now I'm turnin bustas, into john does
I'm the nigga with tru upon my back (c-murder)
A gangsta that's strapped so you can't jack
Ain't nuthin but killas on my team, (soldiers)
And I'm hangin with the shocker and the ice cream
Beware, my mental status is flawed, (crazy)
Start bangin and muthafuckas get lost,
You got drama with this muthafuckin tru click? (uh-oh, uh-oh)
Big worm, this nigga need his wig split
Take him to the river, cut his head off (cut it)
Target practice for my goddam sawed off
That's how we handle shit, in my town
Cause gangstas make the muthafuckin world go round

[mr. serv-on]
Round and round you go,
Now tell me who's the realest muthafucka that you know
Black lucianio, hangin niggaz out the window
Like a fat pig and ? ferejano?
Winnin gun battles like geronimo
Say hello to my new friend, mr. mac-10,
With the infrared grin, I can't pretend,
Who I be, the s-e-are-v aka billy badgate
Jack you for your safe, with guns in your daughters face
Catchin chase for my case for murder, you ain't never heard of a
Nigga, with nuts big like bison,
Unified, gangstafied champ like tyson, world introducin
Young billy blast em up, I gives a fuck, all about my double up

Y'all niggas on the rope, got your ho on da scope
Bitches watching me, jockin me, nigga blockin me, cockin me
Cause I'm the HARDEST motherfucker, out here rockin
I got the game in shades, got the niggas in blades
I got them hoes on a raid, because the nigga gettin paid
I've got, niggas from coast, slangin my dope
Got niggas and G's, and rollin keys keys to record sto's
Get paid wit fatals, niggas harder than Cato
Nigga turnin the tables, but niggas livin like potatoes
Get chopped up in game, niggas runnin my name
Master P up in chain, is he dead he's a man
But I be bustin, hustlin, niggas ain't trustin
I'm a soldier, that's why niggas ain't trustin
No bitch or no nigga, ho or no sucka
Fiend or no clucker, but ready to hustle
With boulders, bigga than yo' shoulders
Runnin from the rollers, gone on that doja
Cause cowards despise, soldiers we ride
Killers with attitudes, but ready to die
Cause chickens get plucked, hoes get fucked
Turkeys get stuck, and niggas get cuffed
Ready for combat, my gat with my hard hat
Strapped with my crew and my niggas and all that
Down for whatever, niggas straight rowdy
Ask any motherfucker in America they'll tell ya, we bout it
Soldiers out there tech, bustin don't think
Lose ya life if you blink
Fuckin with them soldiers on the tank, cause

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Let's get ready to rumble, them niggas stumble
Hit em with left blows
Fuck it got death blows
Ready to got to war? Let's go!
We killas and realas, drug dealers and killers, fuck it
No Limit soldiers, close your eyes
Now picture me foldin dollar bills
I stay fuckin Tru, nigga fuck it, nigga do ya
Nigga I come to life and I scare all y'all bustas like Freddy Kruger
Gangstafied nigga, true to the game nigga
Stay fuckin pullin triggas, fuck up all y'all niggas
Cause I'm so fuckin T-R-U, representin I thought you knew
Cause killas killas killas
That's all I be around, nigga fuckin fool
About face, this No Limit soldier
One to the two to the three (hah hah)
Nigga I tried to told ya
Everybody quiet, while I load up this rifle (attention!)
Now all my soldiers start fightin
It's time to go deep cover
Lethal Weapon like Danny Glover, smother like jelly
Really, go deep like Jim Kelly
Fuck it, all y'all bustas open up y'all belly
Think we playin bitch, well we ain't
I heard we had drama motherfucker
Put up the Benz and now we drive the tank
Cause all I want to be was a soldier
All I want to be was a soldier, soldier

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

I'm a No Limit motherfuckin soldier till I die
We run this place, and I say the same shit, with a gun up in my face
I ain't scared to die, bitch like I said before, ho
3rd Ward, I'm from that motherfuckin Calliope
Projects supported worldwide by drug dealers
Transformin wimpy ass niggas into killers
Taking over, worldwide, doin shows oversea
Bringing bitches to the telly, put them hoes upon they knees
Gangstafied, like my motherfuckin homies Kane and Abel
No Limit, the world's number one fuckin rap label (worldwide)
Competition get smoked like we smokin blunts
I take a playa hata and knock out his fuckin fronts
Dope slanga, now I'm slangin CD's
A million records (platinum), it used to be some quarter keys
TRU tattooed on my back bitch thats my click
Ready to hop into some motherfuckin gangsta shit
I say No Limit loud, cause we ain't scared of nobody
Organized by P or should I say, John Gotti
Real niggas, put ya guns up if ya feel me
But if ya talk shit, bitch ya betta kill me
Like Skull I'm a hoodlum 4 life, I told ya
We be some motherfuckin No Limit TRU soldiers

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Hard times got my mind on cock, and massive thoughts be the plot
Top priorities the family dope and royalty
My loyalty, fiends with a gang of true niggas
No colors, just a bunch of ignorant motherfuckers
Trust my pen is an infa-red
Hollow-tips be my lyrics dipped in venom when I send em
They split ya head (pssssh) wide open
My rhymes on fire blood, but you can't smoke ne'er a one
Don't try to come, don't even touch the mic
My shit so tight, it's more correct than right, when I recite
Absolutely, you booty-ass hoes and niggas
Perpetratin behind water gun triggers
Hurry up and figure out that studio Gotti's catch hotties to the mouth
Who got that clout, don't act surprised cause it's that bitch from the South
Mia X hoes, you don't want no problems
Get so much respect, even yo' niggas call me momma, the biggest one
To come stompin out the N.O., the crescent
Testin, chin-checkin, wreckin when I'm flexin on your WHOLE crew
Who wants to go to war with this lyrical arsenist
Ya talkin shit, I'll having ya runnin for the thesaurus, cause I'm walkin wit
The big dogs without hesitation, Unlady Like as ever
Full of, verbal annhilation
Escaping, po-po's chasin, want ta catch me but they cain't
I made em think, and now they too scared to run up on the tank
No Limit, you can start it, but we niggas is the hardest
To deal wit, keeps the steel, and the plastics to peel wit
In reach, so we can touch yo' ass
And leave a bout it scarf on ya face, we soldiers

My little homies posted up

Others gang bangin' 

I'm tryin' to make it out the hood with this gangsta rap 

And stay TRU to the game, and put the town on the map 

But haters hate me and niggas try to talk shit 

Cause I done made, a dollar out of 15 cents 

On the curb, posted up with them bouldas 

And servin' fiends, A-1 yola 

And still tryin' stay true with my frist meal

'Cause tru villains throw nothing but boulders
My click assist of hard hitters
A bunch of use to be thug villains
And nobody don't mess with nam' one of us
'Cause we make a lot of bustas run from us.

But my whole world changed when I put tru on my stomach
And nigga tru stand for keeping it real
And that's why we ride for our homies when our people are killed
I love my momma and my daddy for planting my seed
But me and my homies reminisce over hennesy and weed
And all my loved ones lost trying to hustle and bang

'Cause everybody gotta go, even if they touch just one of y'all
They say silkk you might die, but that's my call
Wrong or right, they right 'cause that's my dawgs

Form with ex-cons, people on bonds waiting to get sentenced[you know what I'm

And damn it feels good to be a soldier

Talking shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so!

Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the president
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch (bitch)
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the top dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive 'cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C.
Smash motherfuckers thinking they goin' smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the ""world's most dangerous group""  N.W.A.

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talking shit
Best move 'cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low 'cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whats up pimping?  It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million dollar hitta
It's, no limit til I d-I-e

Master P,"Verse 1:
(scarface)
Ghetto niggaz remain violent all the killers remain silent
Niggaz strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all rome'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggaz do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makin' music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause it's deep
Some niggaz make it out the neighborhood and won't circle
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintian me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggaz

(chorus x6)

This is for my homies and my thug niggaz (uuuuugh)

Verse 2
(master p)
'face, imagine us working at mcdonald's
And me and you selling fucking tapes in the bahamas
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggaz
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
Real ghetto niggaz can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggaz off from new orleans to california
Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)
Independent, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see c.e.o.'s in a suit and tie
But we young niggaz in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

Chorus x6

Verse 3:
(doracell)
It's alive, and I'mma be tha muhfuckin' one
Make these niggas want some
Here I come
Da last don
Niggaz steady claiming this
Tatted on my wrist since 86
What tha fuck?
I'm sitting in my cell block stuck
Listening to this shit my radio did
Shit, gotta change the situation
Write a letta to the warden mothafuck all this time wasting
Chasin' niggas wit my occupation
Clean across the nation
Lookin' for two-facin
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope-dealer all in one
Now past me my muthafuckin' gun
Niggaz feelin' they invinsible
Til' they dealin' wit tha muthafuckin' principle

[Intro]
Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

(Chorus)
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there
	(repeat)

(Silkk)
Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??",End Of The Road,2013

I lost something in the past that was special to me
You can't feel what I feel cause this shit's to deep
So give love to your motherfucking thugs alive cause
Ain't no seeing when your motherfucking loved ones die
Don't point the finger and criticize what he did
Invest all your thoughts and all the times he hid
Will I ever see my brother again time will tell
I feel like I'm trapped between heaven and hell
I turned on the radio to forget the fun tears
Coming out my eyes cause I  hear I miss my homies 
On top of that my court dates tomorrow
Facing ten years added to my pain and sorrow
Baby momma don't want me to leave my kids
We can move to the country and forget what I did
But reality keep tellin' me that ain't cool
I want to see my kids go to school

Nobody knows when your time gone come
I live life to the fullest, true niggas don't run
Anticipating your death make you soft and sick
I leave my worries at home when I'm hanging with my clique
I reminisce about all my niggas that's dead
A lesson was learned when they put you in the grave
It don't matter what you got when a nigger gone get cha
Cause when a nigger gone hit ya a nigger gone hit ya
Bulletproof with ak's with hundred round drums
Can't stop one bullet penetrating your dome
That's why I value nothin but family and friends
You lose material shit you can get it again
But ain't no coming back when you meet the reaper
I done lost to many thugs to the permanant sleeper 
Cause ahh everyday a nigger taking a chance
Only thug niggas feel my pain ( feel my pain )

Only thug niggas feel my pain I'ma ride for my homies

I got it made plus I get paid and paid 
You wanted No Limit so I brought the brigade 
I'm true to the game so I'm draped in tats 
The most valuable player because of my stats 
all the Platinum sales because I'm so gifted 
ya I used to slang I even shop lifted 
When I went to jail and went upstate 
I beat a charge cause my paper was straight 
I wanted a truck so I bought me a Nav 
an I wanted some pussy so I paid for the ass 
I got it made so they call me a made nigga 
If rap was dope I guess I'd be a drug dealer 
I got the feds all over my dealy 
You infiltrate my click, really 
Mothafuckers must like to see theyselves get played 
Cause TRU niggaz gettin' paid

Nigga street smarts, my game stay sharp just like a blade

I'm trying to be the first nigga out the projects worth more than a 
mil 
I smash something think about the future so I stash something 
Don't think the money will change me I'm still down to click-click and 
blast something 
See I gots to get cash but I guess it be in time 
now see you gotta get yours I gotta get mine 
And when I get something for niggaz its the most popular kind 
And when I buy something that's for me nigga its top of the line 
Now nigga on the real I gots to fulfill my own dreams

You know who get ready bro 
It seems like they don't want a young nigga to get rich

I ain't trippin' life's a bitch 
You know we was dealt some bad cards but
You know
We gotta deal with it 
Life's hard so lets show em show em show em what's up

My gate way tuh hell seems like its constantly open 
The reaper is callin' so I'm constantly smokin'
See-Murder ain't gonna die in vein 
My ghetto ties got me livin' my life in pain
See the world knows we gonna be thugs forever 
You can take me out the ghetto
But you can't make it better
See the status of your money done changed 
But the status of your danger remains the same
I need to clear my head of these evil thoughts 
And teach magnolian' gateway the shit I was taught
Take a ride wit me nigga to eternity 
And watch you live tuh see anotha century
Life's a bitch who do you trust I put my faith in my glock 
Cause I know its gone bust
I used to think the hood was cool 
But my ghetto ties keep my checkin' in my rearveiw

Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch 
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich
I was thrust some bad cards 
Became a thug with no love cause life's hard

If he don't have none of my paper man 
If I let him live 
He might take me for a faker
He might try to do a jack and that might cost me my life 
If you ever jack its real nigga 
You best kill me or pay the price
Ain't nuttin' I ain't fallen behind
No street machine tell me what you seen
Then tell a nigga about some stoned ass 
Left the murder scene disguised in army green with a infra beam
Own self tryin tuh gum nigga run as soon as he heard the blast fool one
He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight
Witness that murda the first degree my ghetto ties fuckin' round wit me
Don't do that

How many times have you seen a family nut up and the mom was cut up
I see now but later on I'm gonna be seein' now 
But see how us niggas get caught up 
Quick to go underwater niggas take advantage of the way
Life sold us
I'm full of that freeze I'm fulla them weeds and them v's

Now tell a nigga please 
Soon as we drove up fuckin' doe was about to close up 
Knocked on the doe 
Nigga hold up you didn't see us rool up
I forced my way in I put my seven to his stars 
No time for thankin'
Is what I'm thankin' kill a bitch what you fittin' tuh say
I went to the kitchen I'm flippin' pans and pots and spoons 
I heard foe glocks
Sounded like foe shots commin' from the other room
Its bout that time for us hounds to get 
Gonna get the dilly for a milly
Went to the next room john jones was in the zone
Its over 
I come to lay ya eyes buggin' out his head 
Nigga bleedin' from the mouth

guess we were both like phony
jumped in too quick
ideally cus we both was lonely

Treat you right had a bad day i just greet you with ice
you know Silkk The Shocker hang with the thugs and the dealers
wasn't the realest Never the type to get in to expressing my feelings
I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad
Some was good
matter fact it was all that'
Sometimes i feel like we just didn't match
Found a friend
But only friend till then you alwayz came first
Never type to creep Alwayz tried to make things work
What What

I want to be with you but i can't hope you understand and all
Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?
God tell me what's a nigga to do
What What What

Oh 
It's life or death in my town 
And I'm standin' on deadly ground 
I just want to live my life 
All by myself
 
Life is full of debt 
And life is full of cnflict 
I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick 
Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder. 
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z 
The can't shake it 
They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal 
Ralph Sten said money runs the country 
Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another. 
Even make each other split the other's wig 
Animosity 
Least of all tops is ta watch ya back 
Life or Death 
'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath. 

[Chorus: x2] 
 
I'm already dead 
So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil 
Thoughts 
'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death? 
See me? 
I trust nobody 
Money is the rule to all evil 
Better watch yourself boo

Get rid of the murder weapon get a new gun

[Chorus x2] 
I'm on the run, so all you bitch niggaz leave me alone 
I'm on the run, ducking 2 shots to the dome

It ain't no limit to the mothafucking bitches we fuck 
My tank niggaz bout to make the world blow up 
We get rowdy in the club, so show me some love 
Its been 2 years since I possessed some drugs 
Nigga hard times is a thing of the past 
Give me 2 keys and I'm gone give you back cash 
I'm a hustle til I'm dead, ball til I fall 
I won't rest til they put my name on the wall 
TRU niggaz gone ride, playa haters gone die 
Cause after dollars and cents only the strong survive 
With bulletproof Hummers and multiple pistols 
With solid gold tanks and multiple missles

Niggas (what?)
Would you ride for the cause? (hell yeah!)
Would you die for the cause? (fuckin right!)
How many niggas would ride and die for you? (we riders!)

My name manifest pain to my enemies 
Holler see-Murder and bring bitches to their knees
Violent killers ready for blood marches 
Convicted murderers with open drug charges
Strapped with semi autos and po-po's
And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in their shoes
We TRU niggas, bounded by blood and tatooes
Infiltrating my click, fool it ain't gonna happen
Us niggas been gettin paid before we started rapping
Situation getting sticky, cause the ???? the phone
Here comes the brigade, aiming straight for your home
ain't No Limit to the motherfucking thang, we a click
We rowdy, many niggas in the TRU click

[Chorus]
We riders
No Limit niggas
We riders 
We TRU niggas
We riders
We real niggas

We thug niggas (2X)

How many niggas want to ride and get paid
I plan to sell a hundred million records in four days
Gangstas make the world go round
But TRU niggas make gangsta shit go down
We come in your set flip your dope and get rich
Take over your block and your spot with number one hits
Money and power, ha, give me the world
Cause after dollars no cents, only time will tell
Ha, I'm goin through somethangs, fool, so stop hatin
You live for weed and money, I live for greens and bacon
And I ain't takin no shorts with my ghetto d
I stick to plan be	 and keep my eyes on my enemies
And if you want some nigga come and get some
We ride bourbans and llacs when its time to attack
So throw em up if you a real soldier
I'll make you say uhhhhh, I thought I told ya

I'm at the Soul Train awards representing my court 
I did a show up in Texas with facing the boys 
South park, fifth ward, nigga bringing the noise 
Front row, nigga tatooed with TRU on his arm 
That's props, that's why I put it in this song 
Went to Cleveland for a three day tour 
At the party at the tele couldn't take no more 
My autograph sessions at the main event 
Thanking all my friends for the money they spent 
At the radio they loving my beats

As a matter of fact he slept at my house the other night 
It's cool I let a lot of shit go cause I'm ambitious 
When I'm fed up, nigga, I'm vicious 
Hard to stay focused around these motherfucking locusts 
And not to mention all the cochroaches 
Crab ass niggas hate to see you lead a barrel 
Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro 
And now they acting like I did them wrong by progressing 
I'm guessing that they wanted me to stay up in sections with little 
pocket 
money 
To get a nigga who was going my way

Master P,"[Silk]
For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

[Silk]
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

[Silk]
You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

[Mya]
It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you
So now I try to sneak away to be with you

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2]

Every woman need a down man
[Mya]		
Every man need a down chick
[Silk]		
Watch your so-called friends
[Mya]		
Watch them niggas you hang around with
[Silk]
I need somebody I can be serious with
[Mya]	
I need somebody I can clown with

It's thug love and I think I found it

Will I fall for a thug like you",Somebody Like Me,2013
Master P,"Yo, yo, what's up nigga? You know the streets is a jungle
You gotta survive out here
You need a strong mind to do the shit I do
You ever seen something blown up before
See that nigga cross the street in that Cutlass
Check this out

[Chorus x2]
Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

[Chorus x2]

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

When I show you how make it hot, little chickens flock
Butt naked buttocks make niggas act unorthodox
Not trying to get in please, half of ya'll got some sort of disease
Got and STD before your GED
Shaking, what your momma gave you back breaking
In one week got more strokes on your ass than cash them players be making
Smells like bacon in the room when you finished
Toxins in the air Mrs. laboratory chemist
Mixing poisons in your loins and
Letting boys in like they toys you bent over
Pick up my words like 4 leaf clovers
X-files false under your Skully like agent Mulder
Tarik Holder name written in government folders
Golden mind swollen multi-dimensional zoning
On a cosmic level boning making stars for the zodiac
At 10 years old known in my hood as a brainiac

I jam like traffic so watch me rock your whole intersection
And have your crew running in 4 different directions
At 90 degrees angles that connect at no point
Til the missino is completed every sipher I anoint
With my whip appeal as I whoop your crew single handed
living proof that the universe expanded when I landed
On every continent island and water body existing
On any planet in any galaxy I enlist in
When I decide too be born into a form that is tangible
Only because I made it firm enough to handle you
Other than you be looking up in the sky waiting for mysteries
While I'm steady creating history
Picture me rolling like ome of these cats I'm aware of
Without certain bodily parts men have a pair of
Never happen, whether we rappin or we scrappin

We bring it back to back like Siamese
that's attached to the back of the knees
Most labels lacking the fee
To back a nigga like me one of the livest Mc's
Out of the NY, capital K see when I
Drop the semi-automatical, lyrically dramatical
Grammatically written to leave a niggas head splittin
Splittin rhymes to slice minds like enzymes in centrifuges
Busting mines then lay back like the luge
We upped the ante, bounced from the penthouse to shanty's
And now second coming got believers quickly running for the
Wax racks to pack stacks of black facts on fat tracks
On black wax in knapsacks
In back Ac's dipping with the volumen on 10
Down the Ave with my joint on your blend
See ya'll need to comprehend every time this brother pick up his pen
And thought you emerge many niggas get served now that's word 
we got you

Ey Yo I'm slippin down a dark hole touchin my soul
Think I'm rushin to the stars flash forward to zones
Can't move a single bone so I let out a moan
Would burn every single poem I wrote just to reach home
Feel a rope around my neck tight wrip grip no slack
then I hear a whipe make a loud crack
Then feel the flesh on my back split allowing blood to drip to the floor
Then I hear a whole crowd roar
With my last bit of strength open my eyes
To see a pack  of rednecks straight from 1905
Could tell by the clothes thery wore and their broken grammar
That I was the main event of a lynching in Alabama
My body started shaking stamina breaking down
I screamed take me down they started laughing like clowns
I wish I had a 4 pound or any automatic gun
Just to see them crackers run like Satan had come
Then I heard the sheriff say  ""Hey, bring me his son.""
Now picture that want my little boy to see his Daddy get hung
Then the sheriff turned to me and said ""Ain't this fun?
Well this is what you get for florting with a white woman""

[Chorus] 2x
Ey yo from day one you see they try to take us under
Police with guns, and clans hanging us from lumber
the shit don't change no matter the time no matter the place
it all stays the same

1963 and now I'm trapped in a Birmingham jail
Next door to King sitting hand cuffed to the rail
I sailed through 3 generations of time but same predicament
Cause now I'm deep in the thick of it, sick of
I started downtown shopping at Montgomery Wards
Where my mom sent me to buy a new ironing board
>From down on Main Street, trooping through the summertime heat
Sweating bullets, came to the colored door and I pull it
Seen this white girl in late teens, blond hair and tight jeans
Shorts who stopped to ask me  if I like to play sports
I replied yes, told her basketball was my best
but all these lip reading white folks got confused with ""nice breast""
Now it's one mess after another,
get booted from out the store, still no ironingboard to give my mother
Hovered outside on the grass where it seems that news travels fast
Everyone that past said ""that's your ass!""
So I run home to tell mom, to just chill and stay calm
But two hours later they burned a croos on the lawn
Until dawn we stayed frightened my first instinct was fighting
But 10 hooded crackers against one, and I'm done
So I run to keep my family from any more calamity
Right before the riverbank is where I got janked
About to get hanged when the sheriff made his interjection
And now I'm sitting in jail for my protection

Master of mainstream disaster
And now that you know, no doubt you've been captured
Caught buy pay attention and we'll let your thougts roam free
The underground liberty

[Oracle]
A high chance you'll get damaged in this life challenge
Though it's hard to manage like scales that are off balance
Ay yo niggas are nuts riding my phallus
They're trying to compare my rap ballads
While they're spittin' hot shit 'cause they toss salad
My people travel upstream like salmon
Got water flows powerful like a firehose
Connect it to your stereo and feel the Water World hysteria take you over
Don't matter if you're drunk or sober
Got you entranced like Indian dancing cobra's
Our melodies are solar so you can see the light
Our only claim is we're the brightest
Don't want to be the nicest lyricist
'Cause thruthfully words are primitive
You get amped when we jump start your party and make you chant
I'll enhance your motion with electric shocks ferocious
It's trance music hypnosis
We're moving crows like water in front of Moses
You're wet before you notice
This workout like Tae-Bo aerobics
With punch lines and drum kicks and all sets get flipped
High and low decibels hit and whole crews get split in half
And no doubht you know the math

You know the way the shit goes money for nothing and the chicks for free
But I swear sometimes when I be watching MTV
I'm catching visions of violence, sit in silence
For 120 minutes before I raised the black flag like Henry Rollins
Calling up to loveline ""hello? Wel..""
I got a story to tell to do with they ky-gel
I speared Brittany in the back of a Caddy with 9 inches of meat
Talking on my cell phone to Puff Daddy at the Grammy's
Told him ""Put me on the guestlist!""
Got backstage and hung Brandy with a rusty ass necklace
They went back for the street boys, I gut off the street noise
By breaking their necks on the floor like a be	-boy
Then destroyed the whole program
Had a vision where the wizard was N'sync and I was Conan
I sliced 5 necks at the stem
Laced the mic with see-4 set to blow when Usher Raymond begin
Then stuck my Tim's in the white flabby ass of Marilyn Manson
Gave him a gat and had him bucking at Hanson
Now I'm phantom like the menace, whole crews get diminished
When I'm screaming out loud like No Limit
Present the best rap performance to me, R&B vocal
Hard rock, classical, and country
They're all mine, I'm sort of like the greatest all time
You're sweating me more then Jennifer Lo's behind
While I'm here player hating on most
Grandiose MC's I be turning your bread to burnt toast
With John Blaze shit the type to amze with
I rap tight like Africans packed up in a slave ship

You pretended like we were friends
I was blinded by sentiment
You complicated what love should be
And I could swear that you're using me

I keep seeing things I shouldn't see
I've been watchin' you 
Are you using me?

Are you, are you
Are you using me?

Listen, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Ooh, come on now and talk to me, talk to me
Hey talk to me, talk to me
Hey talk to me, talk to me

It's gonna keep you coming back for more

I want to get down when I use it

I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Yeah soak it up kid now mix this in

Now switch that pan button, send me on a vocal rotation
Bounce from ear to ear there, and talk to those that ain't here
But wait, there's major non-believers in the midst
I got solver, for those who zap my style is gon' piss

Round after round after round after round after round

Instead, I'm buckin off a shot at yo' head
I talk to pimps, players, mack daddies, all areas
Free said, rhymes'll straight up sharpen yo' head
Baldheaded or dread, don't let yo' ego write a check
That yo' ass can't cash, slide my whale down the track
Like that was hundred yard dash, sneak up roughly overnight

No matter how hard you are, I still paint that back
Then draw some pictures of Space Ghost on yo' ass crack
With Scooby Doo, Fred and Wilma watchin' Dino doo-doo
Your style is no flake, them beige boots are kinda weak
You suck nuts and lick my balls every time I speak
You at the Apollo, you whack easy act to follow
You get no props, for skirts suckin' Charms pops
You on my penis, still wearin' shell-toe Adidas
I'm in your building, like paint chips off your ceiling
Fake face, yo pack up, start watchin' Scarface
I strike your tour bus, catch you naked smokin' dust
Rip your papers at halftime, your rented rhymes are rust
You got no wins, for crabs in your used Benz
Extra mic stands for Taco Bell burns yo' friends

From here to Texas playin Master P, in the Lexus
Speakers and rearview, comin to, bangin through you

And bitches can dance here's yo' yip baby suck my dick

Nigga how the fuck you comin out with this scalliwag?
She ain't ridin in my love
With that kitchen and that kinky purr, or belly rub
And take that other fat hoe with the blubber, I roll like Daytons
Very expensive for you ones on budgets, my name is Clifton
Capital see-lift off, giraffe jacket
Puma jeans, trout shoe, elk hat
Yo rub my back 'til my penis bulge out of my slacks

Uncle Harold lightin ass with the double barrels
Winchester sawed-off, blast a motherfucker's neck off
We blow yo' leg off, the shirts and yo' whole head off
We called the ambulance, paramedics in yo' progress
My cousin Ricky, with jheri curls through yo' vest
Double ocks catch crews out there in many spots

My name is Keith
We got some nice things for the ladies
Go get the ladies some flowers and stuff
Other people don't love them like we do

I never hurt you talk to you decent at night
And in the daytime I watch you while you sunbathe
And if it rains I bring you straight abouve the water girl
Let me bring you in the house and make some cope of your back
I am stupisfied you know I got my way up
I push you over a 300 just to keep me in the dirt
I love it when we hit the city you got the fireplace
I bring you fire in the a place
Why can't it be me and you
I see your chocolate brown skin
I see your peanut-butter skin breast make me feel like a child go feed me
I bite your rigth cheak and leave a monkey bite
Why can't we be one 'til we die
And if we die why can't we multiply
And if we cry I make sure that a wild kid like me takes care of home while
we two are take

(7x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

I'm not Babyface Jimmy Jam of the Lewis
When I look at you the sex male want to do this
Taste you up and down
Bite the honey brown
Takes you hand up so we can go and have fun
Pope the grill out and everybody chill out
Got to play the little prince
Marvin Grey, sexual healing
You on the blanket I'm ready for fingering
Holding you in the grass whith your so bra jingelling
I got a fruit cocktail for your stomach
Some jellies and juicy fruits from Bellies when I rob it
I lick you there where he won't we lick you there where he don't
Bringing extra underwear to the picknic
Amen to excesy we can get love sick
so quick mick and hunble my ohhhhhh

(7x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

In the bathter looking for your bubble bath
With a condom you bout to make me wonder
Woman I drink your bath water like a beaver art
And pop the bubbles of your bath with my indexfinger
Drinking cups and teas in the fireplace
My hand is slight, touching on the right place
The G-spot I know you got a lot of loving hugging
Your juice is ooze how can I loose
When a woman loves a man
she'll bring her best friend with laundry over to your house
When a woman loves a man, she'll clean the grind off your feet

(4x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

Yeah baby you know I respect you for
Brought me to Burger King

Yeah you know light castles be emotional

Rappers are weak, most of them belong to Romper Room
They talkin bla bla, baby stuff a lot of rah rah
I close my ears out, windows down, I don't hear 'em
Commercial raps turn pop, two years they get dropped
Stop makin facts, factories stop they vinyl wax
That's on the pressin plant, break 'em down, to a compound
Most of these acts get tough while labels hate they buttcrack
Rip out your rectum, your spinal cord, I dissect 'em
Stop your limit, your style old like Dodge Plymouth
Chevrolet, Cabrolet, your mic sounds in the hallway
Groovin you looped it, you start to write, you sound stupid
Your engineerin level, bass and kicks sound like treble
Mix on your Tascam boards, yo Keith extension cord
You're no comp for me, your corny style smell like pee pee
I ride the see-see, while girls on the train beep me
Pump up my pager, models move, style major
Workin that stage back and forth like we Chuck and Flavor
Rapamatic automatic, erratic fanatic
Fantastic measure, for your rappin pleasure (oh yeah)

I'm kind of like a {?} in the field
Niggaz gotta jump or move, or shake around
Either way they got to yield
How you gonna rap and sport a 'Ville
You walkin in the middle of a store
I cock back smack the backside of your mug
Attack and leave your ass deformed
R. Kelly believe when I perform
I'm givin you what you need to field
That funk that comes around the backside of your head
Now orbitin for real
I'm off that bomb from East bay
That smoke that'll {?} five
But I take twenty sacks straight to the head, so here's my 45
y'all know that Motion Man is live, and I'm about to make a switch
On it like a Satchel Paige pitch
My amazement will amaze them and truly daze them
Drug 'em like a fix, or maybe I'll drag 'em like a race
I don't talk behind their back
Attack 'em on the back and bring it to their face
I'm down to make {?} in the race, MC's pull up limpin
So far, no rap star, will match my lyric bazaar
I'm so crazy conceited, rhymin 12 years with no money
Yo kid check it I'm heated, all y'all niggaz blades of grass
While I'm Lawnmower Man, crankin up with a full tank of gas
Pbbbbt, clearin the field

He turned his back to me 
Because I am so cool!

Sewin' they wig skullcaps, tryin' to cover naps
P's in the back of they beanie, a rented Lamborghini
You frontin' hard on BET, tryin' to eat linguini
You ain't Italian, with six carat your fake medallions
Frontin' ass homo, rap style can't flow slow
Money for stickers, burn the kids who drew your first logo
Be duckin' royalties, sabotage, whack emcees
Your facilities, on 4 track, when you record
You never walk away with tights and a rap reward
No matter how complex, you try to make the equation
I light a match and throw it at you at a gas station
Open yo' can up, and bake yo' left mic hand up
You want to stand up, you married boy, bring your man up

Masters of Reality,"It was just a year ago on a full moon night
I was out walking on the moonshine
Fell in a bone yard in a shadow on the right
I saw naked witches dancing in the moonlight

I couldn't just say no (you see I got no place to go)
So I hid behind a tombstone fascinated by the sight
The I heard her call my name, 'J.B.' she called again
Come join the witches dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the silver glow, you see the wind begin to blow
Young angels knelt before me in the moonlight
The hands that beckoned me drew me in to see
I was dancing with the witches in the moonlight

When I was young I didn't know
The summer days seemed 25 years long Now I ain't no wiser but I know
That it's a drag to be alone

So the moon took control of my eyes and my soul
Now I'm smiling cause I know for me
No bell can ever toll
I'm dancing with the witches in the moonlight
Watch me dancing with the witches in the moonlight

Feel your breath on the back of my neck.
Where have I,
Come to be?
Is a song,
That's left for me.

I wish that I was still there.
I wanna keep on breathing.

Dig deep, kicking the bucket, turn and said
Out of this lifeless but impotent hell.
Over these mountains to the seas of life.
Leaves me to stand up for the sick and damned.",Dry Bone Valley,2011
Mastodon,"All the love I've shown
Given to the ones I've known
All the love I make
Is equal to the love I take
All the life I've known
Given to the life I've shown
Along the way

Free from it all
Breathe in the darkest fall
We laugh and cry through a brother's eyes for now

Through fire embers glow
Haunted I lift the stone
Letting go, your spirit flies

All the love I've shown
Given to the ones I've known
All the love I make
Is equal to the love I take
Life is brief as
Be careful for what you ask
Along the way

Free from it all
Breathe in the darkest fall
We laugh and cry through a brother's eyes for now

Through fire embers glow
Haunted I lift the stone
Letting go your spirit flies

His thorns are on the road
His thorns are on the road

In the morning light
The sparrow flies
When the moon devours us
The planet dies

Free from it all
Breathe in the darkest fall
We laugh and cry through a brother's eyes for now

Through fire embers glow
Haunted I lift the stone
Letting go your spirit flies",The Hunter,2011
Mastodon,"To tempt the fool into the mine
Let loose the snake with antidote

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always

I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home

I see your face inside the smoke
It's hard to scream and nice to choke

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always

I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home

Let's rest awhile inside the cave
Don't cry you'll see that we'll be safe

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always

Take your heart into your hand
Always
Take your heart into your hand
Always

I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home",Octopus Has No Friends,2011
