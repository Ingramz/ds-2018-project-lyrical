Elkie Brooks,"All you fellows, gather 'round me 
And let me give you some good advice 
What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now 
You better think about it twice 
While you're out cheating on your woman 
There's something you never even thought of, and that is 

[Chorus]
Who's making love to your old lady 
While you were out making love [(hear me now] 
Who's making love to your old lady 
While you were out making love 

I've seen so, so many fellows 
Fall in that same old bag 

Thinking that a woman is made to, 
To be beat on and treated so bad 
Oh, fellows, let me ask you something 
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of, 

[Chorus] 

I know there are some women gives the other excuse 
I'm not tryin' to run your life, boy it's up to you 
Oh, you oh, you, 

Reason why I ask this question 
I used to be the same old way 
When I decided to straighten up 
I found it was a bit too late 
Oh, that's when it all happened 
Something I never, never dreamed of 

Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady 
While I was out making love 
Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady 
While I was out making love 
Now who's making love to your old lady 
While you were out making love 
(Who? Who? Your old lady) (While you were out making love)",Who's Making Love,1979
Elkie Brooks,"Baby cried the day the circus came to town
'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
And she danced without a net upon the wire
I know a lots about her 'cause you see
Baby is an awful lot like me

We don't cry out loud, we keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud
And if you should fall remember you almost had it all

Baby saw the day they pulled the big top down
They left be-hind her dreams among the litter
And the different kind of love she thought she'd found 
Was nothing more than sawdust and some glitter
But baby can't be broken 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher, that's me

We don't cry out loud, we keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud
And if you should fall remember we almost had it all

We don't cry out loud, we keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud
And if you should fall remember you almost had it

Don't cry out loud, we keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud
And if you should fall remember we almost had it all

Don't cry out loud, just keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud",Don't Cry Out Loud,1981
Elkie Brooks,"A dying flame, you're free again
Who could love and do that to you
All dressed in black, he won't be coming back
Save your tears, you've got years and years
The pains of seventeen's
Unreal they're only dreams
Save your crying for the day

Fool if you think it's over
'Cos you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

Miss teenage dream, such a tragic scene
He knocked your crown, and ran away
First wound of pride and how you cried and cried
But save your tears you've got years and years

Fool if you think it's over
'Cos you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

I'll buy your first good wine
We'll have a real good time
Save your crying for the day
That may not come but anyone
Who had to pay would laugh at you and say

Fool if you think it's over
'Cos you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

I'll buy your first good wine
We'll have a real good time
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
Fool if you think it's over
It's just begun
Fool if you think it's over",Fool If You Think It's Over,1981
Elkie Brooks,"If you leave me now, youll take away the biggest part of me
No baby please dont go
If you leave me now, youll take away the very heart of me
No baby please dont go

A love like ours is love thats hard to find
How could we let it slip away
Weve come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes well both regret
Things we said today

A love like ours is love thats hard to find
How could we let it slip away

Oh mama, I just got to have your lovin, yeah

Weve come too far to leave it all behind
",If You Leave Me Now,1981
Elkie Brooks,"I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Lost my heart in its recipe
Made me see what I want to see
Be what I want to be

But I think more than I ought to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine, is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love

Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me, nearly here?

Lilac wine, is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that he, or am I going crazy, dear?

Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready for my love",Lilac Wine,1981
Elkie Brooks,"Pearl's a singer
She stands up when she plays the piano
In a nightclub

Pearl's a singer
She sings songs for the lost and the lonely
Her job is entertaining folks
Singing songs and telling jokes
In a nightclub

Pearl's a singer
And they say that she once was a winner
In a contest

Pearl's a singer
And they say that she once cut a record
They played it for a week or so
On the local radio, it never made it

She wanted to be Betty Grable
But now she sits there at that beer stained table
Dreaming of the things she never got to do
All those dreams that never came true

Elkie Brooks,"Everywhere I go
I see a face we used to know
I pass a place we used to go
When you were mine
Since you went away
My heart's not free
It keeps raining down on me
Will there be a day
When the sun will shine

I want to see the sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
Sunshine after the rain
Oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end

When I hear your name
I start to cry, each day's the same since your goodbye
It's like a game, forgetting you

Every night I pray
Tomorrow brings a sunny day and happy things
Just like the way it used to be for you and me
I want to see the sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountain again
Sunshine after the rain
Oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end

Everywhere I go
I see a face we used to know

Elkie Brooks,"Long ago, and so far away
I fell in love with you before the second show
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?
Said you'd be coming back this way again baby
And baby, baby, baby, baby, oh baby
I love you, I really do

Loneliness is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait to sleep with you again
What to say, to make you come back again?
Come back and play your sad guitar

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?
Said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, oh baby
I love you, I really do

Oh don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?
Said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh baby
I love you, I really do",Superstar,1981
Elkie Brooks,"Let me wrap you in my warm and tender love
Let me wrap you in my warm and tender love
Oh, I loved you a long, long time
Darling, please say you'll be mine
And let me wrap you in my warm and tender love

I will give you all this love I have inside
I will hold me you in my arms so you can hide
Yes, I love you oh so much
Come on and please me with your touch
And let me wrap you in my warm and tender love

Well, I loved you a long, long time
Darling, please say you'll be mine
Let me wrap you in my warm and tender love

I can show you love you've never known before
And if you use my lovin' up, I'll give you more
When you need me, I'll be there
Oh, love me, tell me you care
And let me wrap you in my warm and tender love

I wanna wrap you, I wanna hold you, just a little bit longer

Elkie Brooks,"I think I know now what's makin' me sad 
It's a yearnin' for my old back yard
I realize maybe I was wrong to leave
Better swallow up my silly country pride
 
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I was born
 
Where the weather's better and the rails unfreeze
And the wind don't whistle 'round your knees
I'll put on my weather suit and catch him in the rain
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door
 
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I was born

Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I was born

If anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
I'd be singing in the alley if I could 
 
And if I go away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'd be askin' you
Don't bury me here, it's too cold
 
Take me back, carry me back
To the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back
To the Gasoline Alley where I was born
Take me back, carry me back
To the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, won't cha carry me back
To the Gasoline Alley where I was born",Gasoline Alley,1982
Elkie Brooks,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember",Goin' Back,1982
Elkie Brooks,"Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say any more

'Cause I love you, yes I love you, oh how I love you
Gazing at people some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through, they can't understand
Some try to tell me thoughts they can not defend
Just what you want to be you will be in the end

And I love you, yes I love you, oh how I love you

Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say any more

And I love you, yes I love you, oh how I love you, oh how ooh
And I love you, yes I love you, oh how I love you, oh how ooh",Nights in White Satin,1982
Elkie Brooks,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'

Elkie Brooks,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1984
Elkie Brooks,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow

Elkie Brooks,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1984
Elkie Brooks,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

Elkie Brooks,"I guess I thought you'd be here forever
Another illusion I chose to create
You don't know what you got until it's gone
And I found out a little too late
I was acting as if you were lucky to have me
Doin' you a favor, I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone, and it all was wrong
Had no idea how much I cared

Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier, it's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe, you're a hard habit to break

You found someone else you had every reason
You know I can't blame you for runnin' to him
Two people together but livin' alone
I was spreading my love too thin
After all of these years I'm still tryin' to shake it
Doin' much better, they say that it just takes time
But deep in the night, it's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind

Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier, it's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe, you're a hard habit to break

Can't go on, just can't go on, on, can't go on
Just can't go on, on
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier, it's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe, you're a hard habit to break

Than to let you go alone,

'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown

'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.

We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don' you stay?

Deep in my soul, I've been so lonely

Elkie Brooks,"Out of the rain, under the shelter
I've been so long where the sun don't shine
Standing at the cross-roads, could have went either way
But now I've found you and the storm is behind

Out of the rain, out of the rain

Over the wall, I'm out in the open
Back on the right tracks, I'm feeling no pain
You took a sparrow and let it fly with the eagles
I can see a long ways I feel love again

Out of the rain, out of the rain

There was a time I was taking no prisoners
Standing with a cold hear, standing alone
It took your sweet love to pull me out of the canyon
I believe I can make it now, I feel like I belong

Out of the rain, out of the rain
Out of the rain, out of the rain
",Out of the Rain,2005
Elkie Brooks,"Ome say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a hunger
An endless, aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you, it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose",The Rose,2005

Now it's your turn to cry over me
Ev'ry road has a turning

Wondering the live-long day just what next thing to do
In those days you never thought anything of me

Es tan fuerte tu tormenta que fuera vez mojado el suelo

Y no recuerdas que tus botas nunca te fallaron
Que pisaste mil tormentas y siempre te has salvado
Solo tuviste que andar solo creer en tus pasos
Eres tú quien sabe más, eres quien saldrá ganando

Hay tanta fuerza que debes romper el silencio que abrazas
Silencio de miedos, silencio de planes
Que son posibles, que tienen llave
Si dejas atrás la pregunta de cómo saldrán

Silencio y respuesta, elige el que sea
La que te hace bien, la que no duela
Verás como se abre una puerta
Sólo tienes que entrar, entra

¿Qué día no salió el sol que día no despertaste?
Recuerda cuando creíste perderte y te encontraste
Tan fácil como que vives que sueñas que sabes
Tan tuyo que si tú entras tú también sales

Hay tanta fuerza que debes romper el silencio que abrazas
Silencio de miedos, silencio de planes
Que son posibles, que tienen llave
Si dejas atrás la pregunta de cómo saldrán

Silencio y respuesta, elige el que sea
La que te hace bien, la que no duela
Verás como se abre una puerta
Sólo tienes que entrar, entrar

No empañan lo bueno que hubo

Yo sé que nunca te olvidaré
Que aquellos días oscuros
No empañan lo bueno

Descartando esa llamada
Que creo que no debo hacer
Sólo es un capricho

Mañana seré yo otra vez

Ella Eyre,"They never have time to give you
They’re always on the run
But you keep on working for your place in the sun
When the lights go out in London
Your work has just begun
Someday you will find your place in the sun
Find a place in the sun
Find a place in the sun

Back to the beginning in fact no we’re winning
Thanks to the spectacular raps that I’m scribbling
It’s ‘Bachs that I’m driven in
Plaques in my living room
The stats match the facts man I'm back, back, back, back
Mama look we made it out the flats we was living in
Times I nearly thought I would collapse living in Britian
Smiling in pictures
Flying to fixtures
Never in denial cos the Nile is a river
Rappers on the sly try’na eye my elixir
Jealousy’s a crime bet your pride won’t resist ‘ya
To get to where I am I cried like I was injured
Bled like a soldier perspired like a sprinter
Brother said T keep an eye out from them rinsers
People that you hang with are trying to lynch ya
Never break down
I’ll be there to lift ya
You’re perfect how you are so why they trying to fix ya

They never have time toAnnotate give you
They’re always on the run
But you keep on working for your place in the sun
When the lights go out in London
Your work has just begun
Someday you will find your place in the sun
Find a place in the sun
Find a place in the sun

Away from the pain and the sadness
Soon the whole world is gonna understand my language
Everybody’s try’na find a method to the madness
Wankers hating on me ‘cos I did it single handed
Whatever will be will be even if you plan it
On the road to success but feeling like I’m stranded
Disturbing London ho, I don’t speak no other language
Started with a goal and then I ended with a hat-trick
Selling out arenas think it’s time to do a new tour
Pennies for the thoughts that I’m about to give you food for
Never show emotion even on a mood board
Sold my bandwagon then I went and bought a two door
Dizzee made me rap and rider made me get my groove on
I just wanna hit a billion views and do a tune Sean
Thinking ’bout life listening to too short
One day they’ll have a statue of me in Madame Tussauds

They never have time toAnnotate give you
They’re always on the run
But you keep on working for your place in the sun
When the lights go out in London
Your work has just begun
Someday you will find your place in the sun
Find a place in the sun
Find a place in the sun

For that spot I’ma use Cruella Deville power
Or do a Willow and Jaden and use my willpower
Victory is the sweetest defeat is real sour
Together we can move mountains rebuild towers
A lot of hurt still waiting for God to heal ours
Stand up and rebel again the real cowards

They never have time to give you
They’re always on the run (on the run)
But you keep on working for your place in the sun
When the lights go out in London (Disturbing London)

Just to start a fight

13's on my Impala, raw cone filled with chronic smoke
Homie, I got game like the Shuttlesworth fam
Milk these lames for what they worth
HUF socks, ashes on my shirt, three wheel motion all you motherfuckers
The Porsche in the garage then got a life for my dogs
I had nothing at all but now I take trips to Vegas
Rolling up, playing songs on my oldies playlist
Diamonds on my fist, Rollie on my wrist, my life's the shit

Standing over the terrace, made so much last year
These lil' niggas should be embarrassed
Claim we the same, but the difference is apparent
Copy my style so much they got me like 'where the fuck is their parents?'
Smoking so much that the public think it's scary
But I don't give a fuck, I'm rolling another one up
And giving middle fingers to you little fucks
Who get online and say I suck, long time you rolling papers and wearing chucks
And I ain't even had my best year, ten cars, 20 million, fuck I'mma do next year?

Or some little alley in town

Secluded with you

My heart and I decided
We'd find heaven, blue heaven too
Secluded with you

Up on the Prairie or out on a desert
Where tumbleweeds stumble around
High on a mountain or deep in a valley
Or some little alley in town

My heart and I decided
It's just too, too good to be true
When I'm secluded with you

Sailing over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make believe 
If you believe in me

It's a honky tonk parade

I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,

I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,

I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,
And send him on his way.

If a man don't understand you,
If you fly on separate beams,
Waste no time, make a change,
Ride that man right off your range.
Rub him out of the roll call
And drum him out of your dreams.

Oho! If you laugh at different comics,
If you root for different teams,
Waste no time, weep no more,
Show him what the door is for.
Rub him out of the roll call
And drum him out of your dreams.

You can't light a fire when the woods are wet,

No!

You can't make a butterfly strong,

Hmm, hmm!

You can't fix an egg when it ain't quite good,

And you can't fix a man when he's wrong!

You can't put back a petal when it falls from a flower,
Or sweeten up a fellow when he starts turnin' sour

Oh no! Oh no!

If his eyes get dull and fishy,
When you look for glints and gleams,
Waste no time,
Make a switch,
Drop him in the nearest ditch!
Rub him out of the roll call,
And drum him out of your dreams
Oho! Oho!

I went to wash that man right outa my hair,
I went to wash that man right outa my hair,
I went to wash that man right outa my hair,

I thrill when you touch my hand

How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will plenty implied

The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of a Southern brand
But here's what I don't understand

They got a gal there, a pretty gal there
Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say; I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas
Brother, she's the polar bear's pajamas

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight; they say an evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your B-V-D's
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah
Anytime a woman can take a great big pan
Start pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

Oh, she's sweet as sour milk",Hard Hearted Hannah (The Vamp of Savannah),1955

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring
So, control your desire to curse

I'll skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

I understand the reason why
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I

You can hear, dear mother nature murmuring low ""let yourself go""

So please be sweet, my chickadee
And when I kiss ya, just say to me
""It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious
It's dilemma, it's de limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely""

When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock

So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you

Night and day, day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room

There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me

Shake their shoulders bold.
You're bound to fall for the bugle call;

Ella Fitzgerald,"Up in the mornin' and out to school

Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring, ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunch room's ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom, open your books
Keep up the teacher, don't know how mean she looks

Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint, you go in

Drop the coin right into the slot
You're gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
With the one you love, you're makin' romance
All day long you been wantin' to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
'Round and 'round and 'round we go

On the benches in Central Park

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last, 
Are cutting you down to your size at last

Ella Fitzgerald,"'Neath the stars, at bazaars
Often I've had to caress men
Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men
Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-men

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been goin' on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat
How long has this been goin' on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into heaven I'm hurled
I know how columbus felt
Finding another world

Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break, for heaven's sake
How long has this been goin' on?

Kiss me twice, once more, thrice, make it four

Waiting for you to come around and hold me tight

Every part of me aches for you
It keeps getting stronger; I hunger, I long for you touch

I'm counting the minutes until you are in my arms
Hurry home as fast as you can, baby
I'll be here ready to hold you; don't take it slow

The way you're there to listen when I need you to

To send you to me instantly back to where you belong

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream
And every stop that we made, oh I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade, then I really felt blue
I peaked through the crack and looked at the track
The one goin' back to you, and what did I do?

And the dream we shared fell apart

So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane 
Couldn't compare to you 
You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you 
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share
Sweetheart the way we care

My love will live on and on

I'll be tired of you
When stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming

When winds are tired of blowing
When grass is tired of growing
Then I'll be tired of you

Till wrong is right, till birds refuse to sing

It's easy to lie to strangers

She'll find I let her sleep cause we talked so late last night
She'll know I kissed her face gently till my returning
And when she finds the rose on my pillow I know she'll smile
Her amazing love unending is so much more than I am worthy of
If the rose could speak my feelings she'd know I cherished her amazing love

If I call her a little late she forgives me

She softly thanks me for the rose and says I miss you

I had that feeling of self-pity

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

I viewed the morning with much alarm

Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,1957

Ella Fitzgerald,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,1957

The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights

The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""

The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals

The great big city's a wondrous toy just made for a girl and boy

We'll go to Yonkers where true love conquers in the whiles
And starve together, dear, in Chiles

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

And we couldn't have change since the last time,
To my joy and delight,
It's a new kind of love at first sight.
Though it's you and it's I all the time
Every meeting's marvelous pastime.
You're increasingly sweet,
So whenever we happened to met
I greet you 

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and 

At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.

Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
And these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
And the words in my ears
Will resound for the rest of my years.
In the morning I find with delight
Not a note of our music is played out.
It will be just as sweet,
And an air that I'll live to repeat:
I greet you 

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and 

At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.",With a Song in My Heart,1957
Ella Fitzgerald,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!
Till everything he's got belongs to me!

And everything I've got belongs to him!
And everything I've got belongs to us!",Ev'rything I've Got,1957

And then my heart stood still,
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk

When I get back to my chilly hall room, I'm much too tired to sleep

One that the palace features, at exactly a dime a throw.
Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh how they weigh me down.

Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys, tough guys who tear my gown.
Seven to midnight I hear drums, loudly the saxophone blows,
Trumpets are tearing my ear-drums, customers crush my toes.
Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance

Come on big boy, ten cents a dance.

Can pay for their tickets & rent me
Butchers and barbers and rats from the harbor

Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Your old form just like a clinging vine,
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine,
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.

What joy, a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you

It wins you at a glance,
Gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things [#],1958

To breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust when I step on the gas

For I'll be there
Puttin' down my top hat
Mussin' up my white tie
Dancin' in my tails

I just got an invitation through the mails
Your presence requested this evening, it's formal
A top hat, a white tie and tails
Nothing now could take the wind out of my sails
Because I'm invited to step out this evening
With top hat, white tie and tails","Top Hat, White Tie and Tails",1958
Ella Fitzgerald,"You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me

You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me",You Can Have Him,1958

For you're laughing at me I know

I'm longing to be in his place? 
Won't you change partners and dance with me?

While you're alone,

Of making you love me the way I love you

How many young men must I fight with
To be in right with

Ella Fitzgerald,"That certain feeling
The first time I met you
I hit the ceiling
I could not forget you

You were completely sweet

to sing his praises

The one that they all know
No use concealing
I`ve got what they call love

Now we`re together
Let`s find out whether
You`re feeling, that feeling too

I felt it happen
Just as you came in view
Grew sort of dizzy
Thought gee, who is he?

That certain feeling
I`m here to confess it
Is so appealing

I can not hide it
I must confide it
I`m feeling that feeling, too.",That Certain Feeling,1959
Ella Fitzgerald,"If I should suddenly start to sing
Or stand on my head or anything
Don`t think that I've lost my senses

Are turning into thin air
And it seems that suddenly I've
Become the happiest girl alive

Things are looking up
I've been looking the landscape over
And it`s covered with four leaf clover
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

Bitter was my cup
But no more will I be the mourner
For I've certainly turned the corner
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

Every one beams
Just because of you

Is unmistakably through

Let a million firms go under.
I am not concerned with
Stocks and bonds that I've been burned with!

I love you and you love me
And that's how it will always be
And nothing else can ever mean a thing

Who cares what the public chatters
Love's the only thing that matters

Who cares if the sky cares to fall in the sea
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!

Who cares how history rates me
As long as your kiss intoxicates me?

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic

In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way.
Bells on bob-tail ring

I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot.

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white,
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls along

And through my lonely heart demanding it, 
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it, 
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you",I Hadn't Anyone Till You,1960
Ella Fitzgerald,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Ella Fitzgerald,"Come to me, my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe
You know, dear, that I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Please, cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too

Ella Fitzgerald,"Reach for tomorrow
Today belongs to the past
The golden hopes of your yesterdays
Can all be yours at last

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your head in the sky
You may get hurt
In a thousand ways
But give it one more try

Have no regret about
Forget about
The chances you missed
In days to come
I know there's something
Better than this

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your dreams ever new
No matter how many times it seems
That dreams are not for you

Reach for tomorrow
And make them all come true",Reach for Tomorrow,1960
Ella Fitzgerald,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1960
Ella Fitzgerald,"If you've never had to count a million sheep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue
If you've never had to cry yourself to sleep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue

I know I could go on laughing and troubled
Plain trouble
But when it concerns the heart
The pain seems doubled

Never worry about a little hurt or two
There's nothing at all bothering you
If you've never had a pal who stole your gal
Then you've never known you've never been blue

Something that this life will mind is plain, honey
That's funny
When you're miles away from home
It's not so sunny

No one ever knows what I go through
While someone at home is babying you
If you've never had to miss a goodnight kiss
Then you've never known you've never been blue",Then You've Never Been Blue,1960
Ella Fitzgerald,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?

Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it too

When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending?
Darlin', I need you; lately I find
You're out of my heart and I'm out of my mind

Ella Fitzgerald,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The mystery of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The memory of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1961
Ella Fitzgerald,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
Those things roll off my knife
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small is all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A home that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I like the low road
Free from the grief and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but, yes, indeedy
Give me the simple life",Give Me the Simple Life,1961

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold

When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny

Above the world, we're not too proud

For we're together, and what is there
To fear together?

Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown

With a cheerful little earful
Of the well known ""I love you.""

A clumsy Joe who wouldn't know a Rhumba from a Waltz

The gentleman isn't bright; he doesn't know the score
A Cake will come; he'll take a crumb and never ask for more
The gentleman's eyes are blue, but little do they see
(Why am I beating my brains out? He doesn't belong to me)

He's somebody else's problem; she's welcome to the guy
She'll never understand him half as well as I
The gentleman is a dope; he isn't very smart

As if; he'll never belong to me",The Gentleman Is a Dope,1962

I get me out of bed and sing this song

Her only answer is one little smile,

Far from the crowded city

Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in
Don't let it apart in my dream

That old dad of mine ain't got a heart
Any girl who's out for pleasure
Thinks of marriage only at her leisure

When my pop said we must wed,
He kind of wowed me, still I'm read-y

I was willing to philander
But I never thought I'd have to be a bride
Now you're gonna find tough sledding
I don't want no shotgun wedding
I was only along for the ride

I'm telling you plain
Just be a dear
And scram out of here
I'm gonna raise cain

And you're in the bag
Where I'm concerned

See there's no hope
I just got a dope
When I took you

I'll be living my life in bed
But they always will be twin beds
And I warn you, you'll be living like a monk
Our affair is now a past one
So don't think you've pulled a fast one
Just remember, I think you're a punk!

I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things

Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings

Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands

Now that you've got me going, what you gonna do?
Is it up to me? Is it up to you?
What kind of game is this we've begun?
Was it done, just for fun?

We have necked, till I'm wrecked
Won't you tell me what you expect?

I'm through and yet, you have a fabulous smile

Remind me
Not to find you so attractive
Remind me
That the world is full of men

When I start to miss you
To touch your hand
To kiss you
Remind me
To count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

I get my heart, well in hand, and I'm certain
That I can take you, or leave you alone
Then you begin that beguine again
And boom, I give in , again
I have a will made of steel, my friend
But when it seems about to bend

Remind me
Not to mention that I love you
Remind me
To be sorry that we met

Although I adore you
Remind me to ignore you
You're one thing I will regret

So when your charm begins to blind me
I'll simply tie my hands behind me

That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you

There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Ella Fitzgerald,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn,1964

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura [From Laura],1964

Doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man?

She'll just string along
All through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in

When a woman love a man
She'll be the first one to praise him
When he's goin' strong
The last one to blame him

What makes a fellow start thinkin' of fallin' in love?
It's not the season, the reason is plain as the moon
It's just Elmer's tune
What makes a lady of eighty go out on the loose?
Why does a gander meander in search of a goose?
What puts the kick in a chicken, the magic in June?
It's just Elmer's tune
Listen, listen, there's a lot you're li'ble to be missin'
Sing it, swing it, any old way and any old time
The hurdy gurdies, the birdies, the cop on the beat
The candy maker, the baker, the man on the street
The city charmer, the farmer, the man in the moon
All sing Elmer's tune

Ella Fitzgerald,"Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey, Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey, Jude, don't let me down
You have found her; now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in; hey, Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you; hey, Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin

And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair,

Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea,

The lure of you
The sweet of you
The pure of you

Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?

Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?

Ella Fitzgerald,"With a million neon rainbows burning below me
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar
Here I sit, above the town
In my pet-palliated gown
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal-eagle nest
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor
When the only one you wanted wants another
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life
And here I am, facing tomorrow
Alone in my sorrow
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor",Down in the Depths,1972
Ella Fitzgerald,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me

Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet

Ella Fitzgerald,"Once I was a sentimental thing,
Threw my heart away each spring,
Now a spring romance hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter,
All I've got to show?s a splinter for my little fling!

Spring this year has got me feeling like a horse that never left the post,
I lie in my room staring up at the ceiling,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Morning?s kiss wakes tres and flowers,
And to them I'd like to drink a toast,
I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours,
Spring can really hang you up the most.

All afternoon those birds twitter twit,
I know the tune, ""this is love, this is it!""
Heard it before and I know the score,
And I've decided that spring is a bore!

Love seemed sure around the new year,
Now it's April, love is just a ghost,
Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear? 
Spring can really hang you up the most!
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Spring is here, there?s no mistaking
Robins building nests from coast to coast;
My heart tries to sing so they won?t hear it breaking,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

College boys are writing sonnets,
In the ""tender passion"" they're engrossed,
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnets,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Love came my way, I hope it would last,
We had our day, now that's all in the past!
Spring came along a season of son,
Full of sweet promise but something went wrong!

Doctors once prescribed a tonic,
""sulfur and molasses"" was the dose,
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,

I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions, but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Where do they go? Oh, I don't know, don't know
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes

Oh, Dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, oh, my Dindi
Oh, Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing Dindi, happy Dindi, when you're with me

I love you more each day; yes, I do; yes, I do
I'd let you go away if you take me with you

Don't you know, Dindi, I'd be running and searching for you
Like a river that can't find the sea
That would be me without you, my Dindi

Ella Fitzgerald,"Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 

A felicidade é como a gota 
De orvalho numa pétala de flor 
Brilha tranquila 
Depois de leve oscila 
E cai como uma lágrima de amor 

A felicidade do pobre parece 
A grande ilusão do carnaval 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro 
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia 
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira 
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira 

Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 

A felicidade é como a pluma 
Que o vento vai levando pelo ar 
Voa tão leve 
Mas tem a vida breve 
Precisa que haja vento sem parar 

A minha felicidade está sonhando 
Nos olhos da minha namorada 
É como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo, por favor 
Prá que ela acorde alegre como o dia 
Oferecendo beijos de amor 

Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim",A Felicidade,1981

There's no gladness because there's no you

The summertime rapture we knew and from that day
Never more will I say, ""There's no you""

Ella Fitzgerald,"Baby, take me down to Duke's Place
Wildest box in town is Duke's Place
Love that piano sound in Duke's Place

Saxes do their tricks in Duke's Place
Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's Place
Come on, get your kicks in Duke's Place

You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat
You look around and yell, ?Waiter?
You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up
You're jetting along with your girlie

It's after three o'clock, but baby, it's early
If you've never been to Duke's Place
Take your tootsies into Duke's Place
Life is in a spin in Duke's Place

Baby, take me down to Duke's Place

Ella Fitzgerald,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissing

Lover man, oh, where can you be

I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be

That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear

Ella Fitzgerald,"Hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your makeup
Soon he will open the door
Don't think because there's a ring on your finger
You needn't try any more

For wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment that he comes home to you
I'm warning you

Day after day, there are girls at the office
And the men will always be men
Don't stand him up, with your hair still in curlers
You may not see him again

Wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
He's almost here; hey, little girl, better wear something pretty
Something you wear to go to the city

I tell you, I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I can't believe it; it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending it looks like the ending?

You know I'm yours for just the taking

You met someone and now you know how it feels--goody, goody

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet

Love that`s only slightly soiled,

Who would like to sample my supply?
Who`s prepared to pay the price,

For a trip to paradise?

Love will bloom and flower

wants people?

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1990
Ella Fitzgerald,"See see rider

Goin' away, baby, won't be back till fall 
If I find me a good man, won't be back at all

Ella Fitzgerald,"Look at me, 
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.

Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.

Can't you see that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.

Too misty,
And too much
In love",Misty [Live In Berlin 1960],1990

That I'm gonna sing to you?

Everybody's singin' the sugar blues

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop

Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Here`s to the boys I've kissed, and to complete the list
Here`s to the boys who said ""No!""

Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love

Ah, but in Pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!

It`s the rocket to the moon, with a touch of ""Clare de Lune""
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berserk for love

People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love

Ella Fitzgerald,"I never traveled further north than old Van Courtland park
And never further south than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of Jersey City, but first let me remark
I saw it from the Empire State Solarium

But we've been putting nickels in the postal savings bank
And when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin deluxe tour

Someday we'll go places
New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant
But at present

I want at Grand Canyon
For throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have`ll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block

Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map

To London in may time
To Venice in play time
To Paris in time for a frock
To Boston in bean time
Darling, meantime
Let's take a walk around the block

In winter at Christmas
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in Caracas, on a jackass
We'll take a ride around the block

We'll keep to our promise
To visit St. Thomas
And then at Jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling
Still I am willing
Just now to walk around the block

Onward, to Cathay
Then to Mandalay
Boom on to Bangkok

Accumulate labels
Buy souvenirs till we're in hock

And each second in it
Will leave a glow upon the sky

Go on and dance my heart

Is to forget it

Should you despair my heart

And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane

Ella Fitzgerald,"Ev'ry time we say goodbye
I die a little
Ev'ry time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little

Why the Gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it

There's no love song finer
But how strange the change
From major to minor
Ev'ry time we say goodbye

Ella Fitzgerald,"The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadowland toward a closing door

Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

Ella Fitzgerald,"Though you vacation in Hawaii
Or go to Switzerland to ski
When you're scanning the snow-covered mountain
Or fanning yourself by the sea
Don't dream of anybody but me

Though you may fly the Scottish Highlands
Or take a trip to some isle near Napoli
When you're whistling ""The Campbells Are Coming""
Or humming ""The Isle Of Capri""
Don't dream of anybody but me

In a cafe on the Rhine
Any place along the line
I'll forgive you when a stranger
Puts your little heart in danger
If his face resembles mine

When a guy at a mike in a nightclub
Begins bellowing something off-key
Won't even mind if suddenly he reminds you of me

No matter where you care to roam
Doesn't even matter whom you choose to see
Whenever your head hits that pillow
Whatever the hour may be

Of the jazzy fiddle under his chin

A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes

A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We two should be like clams in a dish of chowder
But we just fizz like parts of seidlitz powder

Yes, a fine romance, with no glitches
A fine romance, with no beaches
Just as hard to land as the Isle de France
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion

A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance

Yes, a fine romance, my dear judges
Two old fogies who need crutches
True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
Oh we don't have the thrills
That the march of time has

My strong aged in the wood, woman
You never give the orchids I sent a glance
No you like cactus plants

True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
You know Louie we don't have half the thrills
That the march of time has

No I prefer cactus plants

That's your red wagon, that's your red wagon
So just keep dragging your red wagon along

So the chick you left me for is tired of you
Baby, why call me 'cause I'm tired too?
That's your red wagon, that's your red wagon
So just keep dragging your red wagon along

Now you've finally learned
That you get burned when you play with fire
Don't come running to me
You can't use me for your spare tire

If you don't have love songs to fit my key
Baby, don't sing your blues to me!
That's your red wagon, that's your red wagon
So just keep dragging your red wagon along

I hurry to the store

Is the one that I adore

For soda water

She went peck, peck, peckin' all around

Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine

Traveling south so wide and high
Sailing through the wide blue yonder

She is streaking through the sky
Like a bird that's flying homeward
It's that air mail special on the fly

Over plains and high dark mountains
Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California

Hear her moan and cough and sigh

Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand me down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
From 1 o'clock til 4
And lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry

Now a man is born to go a lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moaning all the morning
And mourning all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around... around
I'm waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

My nerves have gone to pieces
My hair is turning gray
All I do is drink black coffee
Since my man's gone away

Who`s colder than an artic storm

Is like travelin` through Alaska in your BVDs

Ella Fitzgerald,"Throw out the life line across the dark wave;
There is a brother whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother! O who then will dare
To throw out the life line, his peril to share?

Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
Someone is drifting away;
Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
Someone is sinking today.

Throw out the life line with hand quick and strong:
Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; oh, hasten today
And out with the life boat! away, then away!

Throw out the life line to danger fraught men,
Sinking in anguish where you've never been;
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift to eternity's shore;
Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay,
But throw out the life line and save them today.

This is the life line, oh, tempest tossed men;
Baffled by waves of temptation and sin;
Wild winds of passion, your strength cannot brave,
But Jesus is mighty, and Jesus can save.

Jesus is able! To you who are driv'n,
Farther and farther from God and from Heav'n;
Helpless and hopeless, o'erwhelmed by the wave;
We throw out the life line, 'tis 'Jesus can save.'

This is the life line, oh, grasp it today!
See, you are recklessly drifting away;
Voices in warning, shout over the wave,
O grasp the strong life line, for Jesus can save.",Throw Out the Lifeline,1993

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again
on that bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three

He must make life a romance.

Oh, I`ll be ready when the right one calls,

He must like musical shows,

Yes, that is my story,

Verse:
I`ve just finished writing an advertisement
Calling for a boy.
No half-hearted Romeo or flirt is meant;
That`s the kind I won`t employ.
Though anybody interested can apply,
He must know a thing to qualify.
For instance:

Refrain 1:
To have a ghost of a chance,
He must be able to dance.
The sort of boy wanted
Must have a smile
Boy wanted,
Lovable style.
He must be tender and true,
And if he knows what to do,
I think I`ll learn to love him very soon;
I`ll want him morning, night and afternoon.
So if you know of one who`s wanting employment,
Just tell him that
I`m wanting a boy!

Refrain 2:
To be the boy of my choice,
He`s got to own a Rolls Royce.
He must be quite reckless
Buying me things:
Pearl necklace,
Diamond rings.
He must be ready to pay
A dozen bills ev`ry day.
I`ll simply smothing him with tender care
If I could find a multimillionaire.
So if you could seen one dining at the Savoy-oh!
Just tell him
I`m wanting a boy!

Refrain 3:
I won`t have anyone small,
He must be handsome and tall.
I said a boy wanted,
Beautifully dressed;
Boy wanted,
Trousers well pressed.
He must have wonderful eyes;
He must wear wonderful ties.
I want a boy who`ll always look as though
He`s only just come out of Savile Row.
So if some Paris wants a Helen of Troy-oh!

Originating a native strain
With folk songs plaintive and others gay
In their own peculiar way

American folk songs, I feel
Have a much stronger appeal

The real American folksong is a rag
A mental jag
A rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues

The critics called it a ""joke song,"" but now
They've changed their tune, and they like it, somehow

For it's inoculated with a syncopated sort of meter, sweeter
Than a classic strain; boy, you can't remain still or quiet, for it's a riot

Is like a fountain of youth
You taste, and it elates you and then invigorates you

They've changed their tune, and they like it, somehow

For it's inoculated with a syncopated sort of meter, sweeter
Than a classic strain; boy, you can't remain still or quiet, for it's a riot

The real American folksong
Is like a fountain of youth
You taste, and it elates you and then invigorates you

Ella Fitzgerald,"Delilah was a floozy
She never gave a damn
Delilah wasn't choosy
Till she fell for a swell buckaroo
Whose name was Sam
Delilah got in action
Delilah did her ""kootch""
She gave him satisfaction
And he fell 'neath her spell
With the aid of love and ""hootch""
But one day, so they tell us
His true wife, he did crave
Delilah, she got jealous
And she tracked him, and hacked him
And dug for Sam a grave
It's always that way with passion
So cowboy, learn to behave
Or else, you're liable to cash in
With no tombstone on your grave

She'll do you no good",Sam and Delilah,1993

Bringing heaven in view
And so her courage, she must keep
As she sings herself to sleep

Will appear someday
I don't know just from where
But he's on his way

I'll just keep on waiting

A man's gonna sweet-talk and give you the big eyes
But when the sweet-talking's done
A man is a two-face, a worrisome thing 
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

Now the rain's a-fallin'
Hear the train a-callin, ""whoo-ee!""
My mama done tol' me
Hear that lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, ""whoo-ee!""
My mama done tol' me
A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's
A-echoin' back th' blues in the night

The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide it's light
When you get the blues in the night
Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong, and he's right

From Natchez to mobile,
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I been in some big towns
An' heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A man's a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide it's light
When you get the blues in the night
Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong, and he's right

From Natchez to mobile,
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I been in some big towns
An' heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A man's a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night
Yes the lonely, lonely blues in the night",Blues in the Night,1994
