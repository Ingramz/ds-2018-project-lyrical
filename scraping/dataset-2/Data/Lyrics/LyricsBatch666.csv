Marsha Raven,"I spend my whole life searching

And thought I found someone
Who's love I could mend
I don't know what to do, 
I need a helping hand

Catch me (Catch me), 
I'm falling in love
Catch me (Catch me), 
I'm falling in love
Catch me (Catch me), 
I'm falling in love
Falling in love with you

Catch me (Catch me), 
I'm falling in love
Catch me (Catch me), 
I'm falling in love
Catch me (Catch me), 
I'm falling in love
And I don't know what to do, no

Hold me in your arms, 
You got control in me
Only can save me, come, 

Rescue me
I'm falling, I'm falling! 

(Catch me, catch me)
Because I'm falling in love
(Catch me, catch me)
You know I'm falling in love
(Catch me, catch me)
You know I'm falling in love
Falling in love with you

(Catch me, catch me)
I'm falling in love
(Catch me, catch me)
You know I'm falling in love
(Catch me, catch me)
You know I'm falling in love

Squeeze me
Touch me

Marsha Raven,"Yeah, everybody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me, nobody but me
Oh, everybody wants my baby
But my baby don't want nobody but me; that's plain to see

Yes, she got a foam like Venus
Honest, I ain't talking Greek
No one can come between us
She's my Sheba, I am her Sheik

Yes, everybody loves my baby
But my baby love nobody but me, yeah, nobody but me",I Like Plastic,2013
Marsha Stevens,"[Chorus:]
No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 

No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know  no matter what 

If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say 

[Chorus]

And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren 
A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us 
I'll be everyone you need 
No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is 
My life began with you 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know, I know 
I know this love's forever 
That's all that matters now 
No matter what!",No Matter What Way,1998
Marsha Thomason,"Do the rudebox, shake your rudebox
Do the rudebox, shake your rudebox
Do the rudebox, shake your rudebox
Do the rudebox, shake your rudebox

Okay then back to basics
Grab your shell toes and your fat laces
A little hand clap for some funk faces
And make your body move in the following places

Goes up your back and then down your spine
And when it hits your head

Okay then back to baseheads
Dance like you just won at the special Olympics
I got the rudebox of the back of a spaceship
So sick I just had to take it

The R.U.D.E.B.O.X.
Up yer jacksy, split yer kicks
Sing a song of Semtex
Pocket full of Durex, body full of Mandrex

Are we gonna have sex
Will you wear your knee socks, back to the rudebox

Got this double fantasy where we just never stop
I got one design and that's to funk you to the top
Know what's on my mind there's only one thing you will find
I got one design and that's to bump you 'til you drop

Rudebox, do the rudebox, 'cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox, why you so nasty
Rudebox, do the rudebox, 'cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox, why you so nasty

Okay then back to spaceship
Take both pills fuck the Matrix
Jack those jills shake your Playtex
Rock 3 stripes not the asics

A.D.I.D.A.S
Old school 'cause it's the best, yes
TK max cost less, yes
Jackson looks a mess bless

Okay then what to do
If you try to jack me I'll rudebox you
If you rudebox me I'll rudebox your whole crew
'Cause it's what I do ain't that right boo, true

I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
'cause the sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this, you did it like that
I love it when you double clap clap

Got this double fantasy where we just never stop
I got one design and that's to funk you to the top
Know what's on my mind there's only one thing you will find
I got one design and that's to bump you 'til you drop

Rudebox, do the rudebox, 'cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox, why you so nasty
Rudebox, do the rudebox, 'cause you so nasty
Rudebox, shake your rudebox, why you so nasty

Okay then check the tan line
Make your body shape like you're stood on a landmine
Call me on my mobile not the landline
And the jack the mainline at the same time

Okay this is what we do
Got a jam so fresh it's nice for you
Okay give it what you got
And dial 808 for the bass to drop

Okay then what's the fracas
Grab your cardy your lead hat and your bus pass
You don't sweat much for a fat lass
Grab your rudebox 'cause your box is righteous

Okay bum rush the show
I got high speed dubbing on my stereo
And all the tunes in the box are the cherrio
I know I told you before, did you hear me though?

Marsha Thornton,"A bottle of wine and Patsy Cline
And everything's all right
Time after time, these old friends of mine
Help me make it through the night

And when I'm falling to pieces, goin' Crazy
With a heart that just won't mend
A bottle of wine and Patsy Cline
And I get by again.

Toss and turn on my pillow
Till my eyes fill with tears
I still feel you so close
Just like you were here

Night time gets to me
When that old movie ends
Then I reach for some comfort
In a couple old friends

A bottle of wine and Patsy Cline
And everything's all right
Time after time these old friends of mine
Help me make it through the night

And when I'm fallin' to pieces, goin' Crazy

Marshall,"Merry Christmas, baby, you really did treat me nice
Merry Christmas, baby, you really did treat me nice
Bought me a hi-fi for Christmas, now I'm living in paradise
Well, I'm feelin', mighty fine, I got good music on my radio
Well, I feel so fine, I got good music on my radio
Yes, I want to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe

I will always love you baby
Now I'm happy as I can be",Change,2004
Marshall,"When love runs out and it takes us down
It’s like a sparrow falling to the ground
We never saw it coming didn’t make a sound
I never knew that it would end like this
The great unknown it’s always a risk
I need to let go but I can’t forget

You put me in a tailspin
I don’t know where I’m going or where I’ve been
I told myself I’m never gonna do this again
But now I’m livin’ in a tailspin

When one door narrows another goes wide
I still remember the very first time
I looked your way and I met your eyes
I never knew that it would start like this
We kept it going it was pure sweet bliss
The sweetest kiss that I’ll never forget

You put me in a tailspin
I don’t know where I’m going or where I’ve been
I told myself I’m never gonna do this again
But now I’m livin’ in a tailspin

Love will take you down like a hurricane wind

You’ll end up in a tailspin

Marshall,"I’ve been thinking about the last six months
And how we’ve had the best of times
But every time I start to open up, it’s not enough
To see what’s locked inside your mind

You always seem to find a way to turn the conversation 
To something light but I wanna’ go deeper

So tell me a secret
Tell me something I don’t know
There’s a part of you that you don’t show
A little hidden piece of how your story goes
So baby lean in close, I promise to keep it
If you tell me a secret

I know that you like the taste of red wine over white
And you curl your lip when you get mad
I know that every time you think you’re right, we’ll have a fight
And you call your mom when you get sad

But all these things I know don’t show me what’s left inside
I’m trying hard but I can’t reach it

And it don't count for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan

What I needed was someone to show me

I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on

Marshall & Alexander,"Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
For once she was a true love of mine

Have her make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seam nor fine needle work
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all with a basket of flowers
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Have her wash it in yonder dry well
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
where water ne'er sprung nor drop of rain fell
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Have her find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the sea foam and over the sand
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Plow the land with the horn of a lamb
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Then sow some seeds from north of the dam
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And then she'll be a true love of mine

If she tells me she can't, I'll reply
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Let me know that at least she will try
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Love imposes impossible tasks
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Though not more than any heart asks
And I must know she's a true love of mine

For thou then art a true love of mine",Scarborough Fair,2006

Pues fueron alma y corazón 
A las que un día amé 
Siempre recordaré 
Con la ternura a flor de piel

Tenerme en jaula de cristal 
Tendrán que comprender 
Que quiero libertad 
Aun que termine en soledad 

Que ha sido hoy de nuestras vidas 
A donde fuimos a parar 
La soledad es el castigo 
Por no cansarnos de jugar 

A las que me hicieron sentir 
Lo hermoso y bello que es vivir

Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.

Marshall Chapman,"Jesus was a Capricorn
He ate organic food
He believed in love and peace
And never wore no shoes

Long hair, beard and sandals
And a funky bunch of friends

'Cause everybody's gotta have somebody to look down on
Who they can feel better than at any time they please
Someone doin' somethin' dirty decent folks can frown on
If you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me

Hippies for their hair
Others laugh at straights who laugh at
Freaks who laugh at squares

'Til that moment baby baby you're mine 
Some people love money 

Some people are in love with war 
But I'm in love with your brown eyes 
Yes you are what I'm living for 
And I still remember it well: 
I saw you standing by a big hotel 
Just then the clock on the corner struck five 
'Til that moment I was half alive 
Then you smiled at me across the crowded avenue 
Right away my temperature started to climb 
'Til that moment I was marking time 
It's true 

I'm drawn to you like a moth to a candle flame 
But here is something that I've got to know
How come you never call me by my name?

Marshall Crenshaw,"A city of bright lights under a foreign sky 
A full moon shining, a cool breeze blowing by 
A fine one beside me, this is what I dream of 
I've got a hundred dollars, let's fall in love 
When I'm down with a worried mind 

I walk around and wonder, Why is life so unkind?
But in this place at this moment 
I cannot feel blue 

I've got a hundred dollars to spend on you 
A hundred dollars and a doll like you 
So many things to go and places to do

You're pretty as a dream",A Hundred Dollars,1987
Marshall Crenshaw,"She came into my life like a bombshell 
One look and I fell for little Mary Jean 
She walked cool with her head always held high 
The glow in her eyes made her look like a queen 

A little queen, Mary Jean 
She took a hold of my heart and held me under a spell 
I guess she knew me real well 
Just why we hung together through all those tears 
I couldn't tell you now in a million years 

I didn't think that the cause of my downfall 
Would be pretty and small like little Mary Jean 
And I couldn't know when I held her that first night 
(feeling ever so right) that one day it would end 
In a scene. Mary Jean 

Now she's gone yes she's gone and I think I'll be alright 
But then the phone rings at night 
She's on the line again and it's just no fun 
We've got a bad connection, Mary I've gotta run 
Hey now I just had to tell her to go away 
It's so unexciting around here today 

I'm standing here looking down at my shoes 
With a case of the blues over little Mary Jean 
She was so pretty and small 
She was the cause of my downfall 
We used to fuss and fight 
And I dream about her every single night",Mary Jean,1987
Marshall Crenshaw,"(peter case)

Well all those nights they hit rock bottom
The songs they sang, well, we forgot 'em
You could hear them play with shaky hands
Guitars strung up with rubber bands
Singing do you want a man of steel?
Or do you want a man that's real
They used to play in the courts of kings
Now they're only made of steel when they're
On steel strings
They used to be on every schoolgirl's wall
And they never dropped the beat at all
They could make it soar, they could make it hot
Once they got started they could never stop
Singing, do you want a man of steel or
Do you want a man that's real?
Some of them hide when the doorbell rings
They're only made of steel when they're on steel strings
Playing the man on steel strings
Were you expecting maybe superman?
The best they do is the best they can
The manager's doing time in jail (applause)
And the pink cadillac is up for sale
Singing do you want a man of steel
Or do you want a man that's real
They try their hands at a thousand things
But they're only made of steel
When they're on steel strings
",Steel Strings,1987
Marshall Crenshaw,"Yes I see we're moving on 
Over unfamiliar ground 
Wait a minute look around 
This is easy
Yes I see we're moving on
Maybe trouble's all we'll find 
But compared to what's behind 
This is easy 
And there were nights when we knew 
The sunshine would never ever reappear 
It's not a good time all the time 
Baby let's grab hold while it's here 

Baby baby do I need 
To explain or can you tell 
That I'm feeling oh so well 
This is easy 
And I know there's not one thing 
That could ever drag us down 
Wait a minute look around 
This is easy 
Remember this when the dreams you treasure 
Are scattered like bowling pins 
It's not a good time all the time 
Nobody always wins 
This is easy oh so easy

Like falling falling 
Falling thought empty air",This Is Easy,1987
Marshall Crenshaw,"Music and screams on this street of twisted dreams 
People staring (into space) and talking (to themselves, get it?) 
Baby let's keep walking 
Pretend I'm a king and you're a queen 
This is our parade and it goes on endlessly 
And then it's not so bad, you see, to live 

On This Street 
I turn my eyes to the passing scene 
Old and young and in between 
Driven along by the pounding beat 
All hurrying by 
Down this street 

Sorry old man well I guess I didn't see you there 
Baby take hold of my hand 
It's like a surreal dream in three dimension(s) 
Always pay attention out here on this street 
When I'm restless for no reason or rhyme 
I wander away from time to time 
The roar of my wheels always sounds so sweet 
But I hurry back to this street 
This street 

Won't you come on down with me 
Can't find any place where I'd rather be 
This street 
Hope my luck is still secure 
Never know what's waiting by the door 
Come take my hand

Don't stare at the ceiling 
Feel this feeling of wild abandon 
Roll on in wild abandon 
Well I was minding my own

Walking alone at the end of a Monday, a dreary old Monday
No moon hanging high in the cold grey sky 
I saw a light in a doorway 
I walked on slowly and then I heard a 
Screaming stomping sound 

Next thing I knew I was jumping around in 
Wild abandon, yes wild abandon 
I want to smash through my cares and 
Dance over chairs in wild abandon 
Wild abandon, yes wild abandon 
Now it's long overdue for me to rock with you 

In wild abandon

She doesn't slow down 
Uptown downtown 
I'll tell you what the reason is 

You see 
She hates to go home 
After all the parties are over 
She hates to go home 
Where there is nobody to hold her 

It's plain to see why it's so 
Why does it ever have to be time to go 
And face the darkness cold as stone 
She really hates to go home 

All alone 
Her room will wait 
No matter how late 
Knowing how to lock her in 
It won't set her free from what used to be

For a while I've been so unlucky
Always stumbling around in circles
But I must've stumbled into something
Look at me am I really alone with you
Now I'm loving the life I'm living
Can't recall when I last felt that way
Guess it must be all the love you're giving
Never knew, never knew it could be like this
But I guess

Some hearts seem to have it so easy
Some hearts have all the stars on their sides

All those days that seemed like years
The silence roaring in our ears

Then at night a ticking sound
The time bomb of the life we'd found
I watched her leave, my heart in flames
Fanned by all her other lovers' names
And I could feel my restless mind

Whiskey, wine and cheap perfume, all those crowded bars

And hotel rooms

It's gonna be more than fine

Simplest thing under the sun 
I know some time will be our time 
Somewhere down the line 
I said it with all my heart 
As though I had a guarantee 
Mainly because I thought 
That that's what she wanted from me 
Though I don't really know 
That it isn't all in vain 
I looked into her dark eyes 
And said these words again 
Somewhere down the line 
You get yours and I get mine 
We can't give up I know we'll find that it's 
Somewhere down the line 
We won't be looking back 
As we move on down the track 
We'll leave our broken dreams behind 
Somewhere down the line 
Then she said, though we try with all of our ability 
We can't always rule our fate or determine our destiny 
Right away I understood what was going through her mind 
We're sitting here wondering what's waiting for us down the line 
These blues will fade away 
And I believe it's safe to say (that) 
I'll still be yours, you'll still be mine

And they all said ""its no lie

I had made up my mind
It was time to let familiar things fall behind
I was glad to be all alone
In the middle of the wide unknown

Through lost empty towns
Across miles of burning dessert sands
And fields of green and gold
I began to feel and understand

The wonders great and small
That this world has to show
Like the promise in a new sunrise
A few thousand days ago
A few thousand days ago

It set my heart and soul at ease
To hear the silence and the wind through the trees
I was glad to be all alone
In the middle of the wide unknown

I fell asleep on the train
With the towering mountains rolling by
And woke to the sound
Of thunder crashing in the sky

The air was ghostly blue
The mist was rising slow

And it was good to us, more than good to us

This was our place in the world
When life was new and untried
When every wild dream seemed possible
It felt good to be here, it was warm inside, yeah

I have to say, I'm amazed
Even though I learned long ago
That sometimes good things get thrown away
I wish right now that it wasn't so

Those days are good and gone
Around here it?s plain enough, yeah, yeah
This is where home used to be
Where we lived and loved

We were only here for awhile

A minute from yesterday
They said to me ""Son be strong
You're going to be something someday.""
They bought me some clothes to wear
They gave me some books to read
Took me to see Santa Claus
Of love I was never in need

But they never said things burn
Or that I would have to live and learn

I'd love to go back and undo
A few things that I have done
Got a handful of bitter regrets
Like when I betrayed someone
Who helped me when I was down
I was young and dumb at the time

They're gone now
Not to return
And we move on

Leave your dreams back in bed
Find your shoes
Walk outside
Shake the clouds 
From your head

In the newspaper read
It's your turn
Yeah it's your turn
To live and learn

Enough talk about the past
Life's just beyond the gate

We don't have to pass some test
We don't have to get with the grade

They flicker and then they fade

Out to the distant edge
And back again we've been

Or in a room with a view
Anyplace is paradise when I'm with you

Remembering when

We were halfway around the world
Running down the street in the rain
Under a ladder or two
They almost didn't let us on that train

I hear your footsteps on the stairs

Make me feel brand new

I'm glad that I've had your hand to hold
Along the way down the long hard road

No way around it, being you and me
Sometimes takes it's toll
Come lay down beside me

Where you are has been home always
Through good times and through the tears that flowed
Along the way down the long hard road

With the wind blowing wind through her hair
Something undeniable, stirred inside her
And she ran up the crowded stone stairs

With the ocean below and before us
And a strong sense of wonder all around
I can still see her now, running and laughing
And I'm never coming down

I'm never coming down, never coming down
When I close my eyes I'm there
Loving the cool sunshine in a sweet state of mind
Standing close to the edge, feeling safe and sound
I'm never coming down

And the clouds rolled
I just stood still and felt heaven bound
On an old mountain road leading skyward
And I'm never coming down

Sparkling concrete under the lights
Traffic sounds, bouncing off the steel and glass
We traced our steps from the past

Shadows in the curtains on the second floor
I used to have a key to that front door
We didn't know it then
But you and I were just passing through
Passing by

Let's hurry on
No use standing and staring, hurry on
I thought I heard you say, let's walk on
We really can't stay
We're just passing through this way

This world is moving and changing always
We'd better be about new days
For as long as we may, we're just passing through
Just passing through this way

In our old shoes we walked last night
Ghosts of old friends on the left and right
Being there with you gave me a thrill
Like it used to do and always will

When we'll be back there, I don't know
Maybe sometime before we're done
On some other trip around the sun
",Passing Through,2009
Marshall Crenshaw,"Well, someone told me, tried to tell me
It sounded backwards and upside down
Someone told me something
That really messed my head around

And I wondered sadly
I sadly wondered
Could we ever be on common ground?

Read and listen, I watch and listen
It's like a train wreck and I can't turn away
So many worlds colliding
Everywhere, every day

People looking at the same things
All the same things
Them in conflicting ways

Well, if you see me walking down the avenue
Call my name and I just stare a hole through you
Please don't worry about me 'cause I'm really fine
Sometimes I just get lost inside my mind

Someone told me, tried to tell me
He was dressed and painted like a clown
Someone told me something
Tried to mess my head around
Around and round

But I had a feeling he knew
That his words were untrue
We'll never be on common ground

Well, I know a man you can't own up to the things he's done
He's got no sense of honor and never did have one
Where would he be without a wall to hide behind?
I'm glad I'm not the one living in his mind

It's a bitter wind that's raging in you
In you so long you no longer hear it
It sweeps across the floor of your spirit
Stormy river, stormy river is you

I'm gonna get far away, get far away fast
'Cause the future looks just like the past
You can't help but leave damage in your midst
I've got no time left in my life for this

Rain comes down like cannonballs
The thunder crashes, the engine stalls
The lightning hits the electric tower
In the midnight hour, stormy river

From a thirteenth floor window

I'm here or down there
Right now it's bad news either way

Well, I can't stay
So I guess I'll go out there anyhow
What I don't want right now is
A day of reflection and solitude
With this bitter mood, I'm in again

Now I'm stir crazed enough
To go walking in the rain alone

And got the Sunday blues
For this and that and everything

That feeling goes stealing down to your shoes

I'm on the wrong side of Sunday
Can't get away from dark thoughts today
I've been made blue, been lied to

But enough's enough
I don't need this stuff ok?
Regret and rage, just go back to underground

You gotta be here, you gotta be there
You're always running, always got to be somewhere

Well, I know how you look with the wind in your hair

Ain't talking about love
Baby, I ain't nobody's Romeo
I'm talking about you and me, wild and free
Flat out, down a winding road
And I'm not sure just what we'll find
But I won't stop until you're satisfied
So climb in, baby, and enjoy the ride

Call me crazy
'Cause I don't care where this will end
But it's amazing how much fun you have 
Not knowing what's ahead
And we might make it, or we might just go down in flames
But you'll be glad you took the chance, and, girl, you'll never be the same
Somewhere down deep you want so bad
To live the wildest dreams that you never had

If that girl who's lying next to me
Has left me here alone
Is she gone?
Is it too late to hear my prayers?

But is she gone?

You've already blessed me more than I deserve
And we've both seen the sinner that I've been
So You don't owe me anything, and asking this takes nerve
But You saved us once, Lord, could You again?

Mother would look around and ask are all the children in

No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day

So here I work and I somehow hide from a world that rushes by outside 
And each night when I rest my head I'm contented as the peaceful death 
But who's gonna cry when old John dies who's gonna cry when old John dies 
Once I was a young man dashing with the girls 
Now no one wants an old man I lost my handsome curls 
But I want to say when my time comes lay me facing the rising sun 
Put me in the corner where where I buried my pup 
Tell the preacher to pray then cover me up 
Don't lay flowers where my head should be maybe God let some grow for me

Marshall Grant,"My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more

It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound

And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come

Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died",My Grandfather's Clock,2012
Marshall Grant,"Well it was a time on earth when in the books of heaven 
An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven 
My name was at the top and many things below 
But I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago 
Long ago (down on my knees) long ago (I settled it all) 
Yes the old account was settled long ago (hallelujah) 
And the record's clear today cause he washed my sins away 
And the old account was settled long ago 
Well the old account was large and growin' every day 
And I was always sinnin' and I never tried to pray 
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe 
Well I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago 
Long ago (down on my knees)...

How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee?

Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise

Marshall Grant,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies

I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said

He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco

I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another

Said, ""Where did all of the old songs go
Kids sure play funny music these days
They play it in the strangest ways""
Said, ""it looks to me like they've all gone wild
It was peaceful back when I was a child""
Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys
Are trying to be heard above your noise?
And the lonely voice of youth cries ""What is truth?""

Looks up and says, ""Daddy, what is war?""
""son, that's when people fight and die""
The little boy of three says ""Daddy, why?""

Being taught the golden rule
And by the time another year has gone around
It may be his turn to lay his life down
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking 
""What is truth?""

A young man sittin' on the witness stand
The man with the book says ""Raise your hand""
""Repeat after me, I solemnly swear""
The man looked down at his long hair
And although the young man solemnly swore
Nobody seems to hear anymore
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
And the lonely voice of youth cries 
""What is truth?""

The young girl dancing to the latest beat 
Has found new ways to move her feet
The young man speaking in the city square
Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
Are going to be the leaders in a little while

May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,1960

Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand me down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
From 1 o'clock til 4
And lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry

Now a man is born to go a lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moaning all the morning
And mourning all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around... around
I'm waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

My nerves have gone to pieces
My hair is turning gray
All I do is drink black coffee
Since my man's gone away
