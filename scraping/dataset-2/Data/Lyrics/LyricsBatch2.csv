A Tribe Called Quest,"Classic, classic
Classic example of a, a date rape

Listen to the rhyme, it's a black date fact
Percentile rate of date rape is fat
This is all true to the reason of the skeezing
You got the right picking but you're in the wrong season
If you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break
Especially if a squad tries to cry out rape
You be all vexed 'cause she got it going on
You don't want to fight 'cause you know that you're wrong
So instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch
Envision in your head of a great sex bout
Worthy opponent, all you want to do is bone it
You ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick
This is the case, the situation is sticky
Should you try to kiss or head for a hickey
Not even, you can ask Steven
If the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leaving
Hit the road Jack and all of that
But if she offers her abode, to drop ya load
Right smack dab in the middle
Get the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles

Uh huh, you know science, you get buckwild
Running mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles
Or better yet Magic or even Karl Malone
Regardless who it is, your aim is to bone
If she tries to front, then you start to dis her
If she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her
Might as well get to the point, no time to waste
Might as well break the ice, then set the pace
You start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone
Step out of the shower, throw on cologne
All of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho
She's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abendego
You listen to After 7, break fool after 10
Do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again
There goes round 1, ding, there goes round two
Now tell me what the (fuck) are you supposed to do
What do you know, when the meow is completed
Girly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it

Sweetheart, we ain't going out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't going out like that (zulu)
We ain't going out like that (zulu)
We ain't going out like that

Now baby bust it, if you want to groove
Me and you can do it, it will be the move
I won't cry over spilled milk
If you won't let me take you to the Hilt
I don't want to bone you that much
That I would go for the unforbidden touch
I'm not the type that would go for that
I'll have to fetch a brand new cat
Baby, baby, baby I don't want to be rude
I know because of your bloody attitude
I know why you act that way
It usually happens on the 28th day
I respect that crazily
When you're done with the past can you come check me
This ain't a joint to disrespect you
Because one head ain't better than two
Check it out

It's a classic example of a, a date",The Infamous Date Rape,1991
A Tribe Called Quest,"It's a fly love song

To the effect of nothing, effective fronting
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
I am a bon-a-fide
Not too modest and not a lot of pride

Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my momma is sick I'm by her beside
Used to watch the show on channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in-Tide cause it's too damn cold out-Tide
That's how the running's go
If there ain't no dough, then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter (ass)
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash

If you want to see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest you ask the Quest you ask real fast
Cause I don't want to see em, start buckin'
Throwin' chairs in the air while you be duckin'
What what? Don't step to me with that
If you promotin' the show make sure it ain't wack

Or else I'm leaving (let me tell you)
I'm leaving (let me tell you)
I'm leaving (let me tell you)
Your wack show

Yo man whats up with that?
Yo don't sweat me
C'mon, five hundred, that was the deal
C'mon man, don't try to play me out
We don't need you, sorry!
You know you need me

And the Abstract rapper says

I want chicken, and orange juice, dat what's on my rider?
And my occasional potato by Oreida
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Ain't takin' no shorts no more, now

Please act proper 'fore I call the Crime Stoppers
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no
Make sure you count your money real slow
Be alert, look alive, and act like ya know
It's, the 90's, time to make moves
Not, the 80's, do away with cha womb
So what? You got a crew
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zoo

Don't break fool, let's be reserved and cool
We don't have to act like we in grade school
Just make sure that we're taken care of
And we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out

So what so what so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what so what so what's the scenario

A-yo Bo knows this (what?) and Bo knows that (what?)
But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg, is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye, to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah!)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

Yes yes y'all (yes y'all!)
Who got the vibe it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all!)
Real live y'all (live y'all!)
Inside outside come around
(Who's that?) Brown!
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve rotate the gates
(Contact!) Can I get a hit? (Hit!)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow how now wow how now Brown cow
We're ill till the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me! Yo, what's the scenario

(True blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape plush Grape Apes to play tapes
[Papes make drapes] great for the wakes
Of an L-AH, an E-ADER, simply just a leader
Bass innerspace means peace see ya later
Later (later!), later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflater
So yo the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound? (oh!)

It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here!)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test, the water little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked
Then they rebuked then you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The Hip Hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Watch, as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact - boom! - from the cannon
Not bragging, try to read my mind just imagine
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary
When digging into my library
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh! Uh! Uh! All over the track man
Uh! Pardon me, uh! As I come back
As I did it yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!) the rhymes are on time (time!)
Ripping up this dance just like a radio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario

A Tribe Called Quest,"Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies
The highs at all of these industry shing-dings
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checkin' for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out!

Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
The ups and downs with the hoes (The Business)
Always gettin' fronted on at shows (The Business)
People gotta stick their nose (In the Business)

Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speakin' to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the games just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real

They're givin' you the business and puttin' on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say Where's my loot?
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're makin' fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cos you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, more soup wit' ya meal?
Cos this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say

Shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'bout these no-talent artists gettin' signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Goin' out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flyin'
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers makin' albums when they know they can't hack it
Cos they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cos your lyrics is butt

Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)

The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and ridin' high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
""Oh, he's a cutie"", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The born cipher, cipher master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game
And I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters' not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefin' (Boy, get a job)
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willin' and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
(For what?) That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbin'
When it comes to rhymin' you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild",Show Business,1991
A Tribe Called Quest,"Do you know the importance of a skypager?

Those who don't believe, see you're laid behind
Got our skypagers on all the time
Hurry up and get yours 'cause I got mine
Especially if you do shows, they come in fine
If you're with a G and you're sippin wine
Eating caccatore with a twist of lime
Gotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9
Joint by base, then you get your high

If you get your then high, mine is next
The 'S' in skypage really stands for sex
Beeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks
Keep my bases loaded like the New York Mets
At times I miss the pager so you don't get vex
Having bad days like a voodoo hex
Conceptually, a pager is so complex
'Cause I be standing by the phone ready to flex

Uh, so funky, uh, so funky, uh, so funky

The batteries I use are called Duracell
They last for three weeks so they do me well
Don't be going through no phases my joint stays on
24-7, from dusk til dawn
If you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach
You greed for the Phifer, I can be reached
A number of importance, I just put it on lock
You leave code '69"", that means you want some (cock)

People tend to think that a pager's foul
Well it kinda is, 'cause it makes me scoul
But it really hurts when you're on the prowl
Brothers know it hurts when you're on the prowl
Grabbing on my joint 'cause I'm an eager owl
Get paged by a G or a business pal
My shit is overflowing, they won't allow
Another page, so I'll just end this now",Skypager,1991
A Tribe Called Quest,"I had a dream about my man last night
And my man came by the studio
And his name is
Busta Rhymes in effect, Shaheed is in effect
Phife Did-awg is in effect
Check it out and give me my 'spect

I'm moving, yes I'm grooving cause my mouth is on the motor
Use the Coast in the morning to avoid the funky odor
Can't help being funky, I'm the funky Abstract brother
Funky in a sense, but I play the undercover
Once had a fettish, fettish for some booty
Now I'm getting funky and my rapping, that's my duty
Brothers tend to jock on the style in particular
If you got the ego like some brothers, then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck)
My motto in the 90's is be happy making bucks
Girls love the Jim, 'cause it causes crazy friction
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I still understand the 'cause that's what I met her for
I'm hooked on the swings, so just call me the music whore
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
Quest the people's choice, we thrive it for the spirit
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensils
Write my rhymes straight up, don't get with no fancy stencils
The rhymes we get is sweet, we stay away from tart
Our perfection is at work, perking up the art
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock
Your demise is coming up and I want your man to watch
Be the prime example, I deep instilled the sample
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a claker
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker?
The crazy move faker, I used that to break her

Phife is in the house, Uncle Mike is in the house
Bob Power is in the house, Tim Latham is in the house
Wise Men is in the house, Brand Nubs is in the house
The J Beez, they in the house and De La, they in the house

I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
Please don't be deceived by ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action
The ladies of the '90's want more than satisfaction
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring
I keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
With the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
My people been up on Quest to long, no more will we be down
People tend to riff 'cause they don't know the mental
People tend to bug 'cause their beats are hard but gentle
Afro kinda lurks through the body of this youngun'
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and your coming to
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival
If flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival
The Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching
The Black and Puerto Ricans
'cause their butt naked, streakin' through the ever murky streets
Of the urbanized areas
Blastin' out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria

Craig is in the house, Pete Rock is in the house
CL is in the house, Ultra Mag is in the house
Nice and Smooth is in the house, Big Daddy Kane is in the house
Beatnuts is in the house, Special Ed is in the house

Yeah
This one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass

A Tribe Called Quest,"Let me flaunt the style, I think that the time's near
That we drop Scuds, there won't be no duds here
Rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip
But when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick
Now I'm not for the rock, I know the territory
Go ahead and try, that's a different story
Similar to Grimm, I could tell a better one
All about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run
Stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
Resorts to bagging Billy, asking could he have some
No never ever, go back and try again man
If you come back, I'll be the first to shake your hand
Competition's good, it brings out the vital parts
The Abstract Poetic, majors in recital arts
Do it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers
We know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers
Gotta feel the vibes, real from my creation
If the hands clap I'm filled with elation
Here I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam
Think I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream
Cause that's how good it feels child
Let your hair down, so we can get buckwild
Do your ill dance, don't think about the next man
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan
Division we will fall, we must stick together, see
I'd like to take this time to say what's up to Kool G
The name is Q-Tip, the Midnight Marauder
Giving nuff respects to Afrika Bambaataa
As a man in the world, I must do my job
Take care of Mama Duke, I won't resort to rob
Bob you'll get your dough, Mase is my witness
Obsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness
Like shooting Cee-lo, and always hitting head cracks
The industry is luck, winning with the fake raps
Peace to the crews who pump the real hip hop
Not selling out, from hardrock to disc jock

I don't know what to say, but here I go freak it
If the papes come, then you know I'll seek it
I'm just a short brother, dark skin face
Weigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist
Hair is crazy curly, flip like Mr. Furley
To this day I still believe that no MC can serve me
Brothers try to front, but everybody know
I get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show
Party animal I was, but now I chill at home
All I do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit and bone
Found my thrill in Amityville, I'm always in the Island
Fudge and Lucky know the time, they know who keeps 'em smiling
Go out on my own, something that I gotta do
Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double
Yo, I'm out like Buster Douglas, I say peace to MC Trouble
Rest in Peace

Word Up, rest in Peace, and you know what else?

Of rap I'm a fan, I've seen a whole lot of slums
Good with the girls, I get a whole lot of 'em
From fat to skinny, Freda to Winnie
Emma to Cindy, Constance to Wendy
Cause I be real friendly, never on the snotty side
I don't brag to brothers about the little papes I got
My vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary
It's only legendary, my father well prepared me
My job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot
Better yet the long term, I don't have a perm
In a way I do, call 'em the perma-naps
I'm crazy slap-happy and I'm scrappy and I'm nappy
When I get the mic in my hand with the crowd in stand
It's as good as grand like that

I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC Trouble
And to uh, Trouble T Roy
And to um, Scott La Rock
And to um, Cowboy, you know what I'm sayin?
This is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers, you know what I'm saying?
This is a special, special, special, special, special dedication

Hey yo who want to pull on Phifer long time no hear from
Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some
But that pop is non cypher, no can do
And if you think I'm a dope, then ask the other crew
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just step off with the hoe
Oops my mistake I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of the all the kids that done hit her
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
I heard she likes to do one-one my man John Ritter
But back to the subject you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could herb me 'cause know I where specks
You're full of jokes, but you your name ain't flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that but you're girl's quite doable
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me
I'm not a mad cohort, but I'm not Mr. Softee
Rappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart
So forget the chart because the action can start

Hot sex on a platter

Where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk
I'm the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas step up it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paper back books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excelling cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo I gets the pickens, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link on the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mardane
See I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah I can do that
I can also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind
Makes me pick up and go when it's time to drop a rhyme
My title is locked, the Abstract poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, especially for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear 'cause it's evident and clear
That I will rock, rock, rock

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, we paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high
I pulled over to ask were we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
""El Segundo,"" he said, ""my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto""
Needed civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south, there's a fast food station
Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor
Ali said, ""Damn, tip, why you drive so far for?""

(Well describe to me what the wallet looks like)

Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said, ""Pay for lunch""
So I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed,
""Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step
What do you know, my wallet I forget

Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me
I fell bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter
Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound
Jettin' on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""All right, Tip, see you tomorrow""
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack
Of Shaheed, ""we gotta go back"" when he said
""Why?"" I said, ""ee gotta go
Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo""

Yeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo

A Tribe Called Quest,"Went to Carvel to get a milk shake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin it
But I'm goin to stay strong cause I ain't buyin it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

Problems, problems, problems, woe is me I'm having
Problems, problems, problems

Just last week my girl was stressin me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we look cute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you got put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your botty face!

Problems, problems, problems, Lord knows I'm havin
Problems, problems, problems, Jesus Christ I'm havin
Problems, problems, problems, pray for me I'm havin
Problems, problems, problems

Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside

Hoes to be laid, punks to be sprayed
Chumps to attack, so my man watch your back

That can mend you, my fee is a shower
For you, I scrub the back and I floss the butt crack
Make you shiny, spiffy in a jiff

Adjust the bass and treble make my shit sound clear

Move back yourself man, come watch me drop it
For sure me a go do it, for sure me a go rock it
Me not deal with no changaram, bangaram business
I got soul on the end, like Jehovah's got the witness

The enchantment on the airwaves, kids just fade
Obey the MCs, cos the MCs say
We flipping on niggas like we Super Dave
But noticing my stature, y'all niggas know we gotcha
Moving to the rapture, listen how we catch ya
Moving with the grace, here we go, let's begin
Making people jump out their goddamn skin
Lyrically, we bite like we Rin Tin Tin
Peace to Grand Pu and his many many skins
Don't mark us for the 'L' cos you know we get the wins
It's the Ab, Shaheed, and the Dawg for the blend

And I wanna say peace to my man Bob P, my man Jerod
And Skeff Anslem on the help out - and we out like shout

Walk past MCs like that girl did to Pharcyde

I'd eat that ass like quiche, crack a smile like Shanice
Straight outta Jamaica, seen? Jamaica, Queens
But you could find me out in Georgia, or anywhere in between
Now if my partners don't look good, Malik won't look good
If Malik don't look good, then Quest won't look good
If the Quest don't look good, then Queens won't look good
But since the sounds are universal, New York won't look good
Picture Phife losing a battle, come on, get off it
Put down the microphone son, surrender, forfeit
Did I hear something 'bout a crew? What they wanna do?
You better call Mr. Babyface so he can bring out the cool in you
Or it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton
And I'll dissect you like a fraction
Oh, you wannabe top cat MCs, I'll pop you like a zit
You wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit
Big up myself every time when it comes to this
MCs be running scared as if they're watching the Exorcist
I kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead

I dedicate this to all the MCs outta Queens
That goes for Onyx, LL, Run DMC
Akinyele, Nasty Nas and the Extra P
You need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other
Nuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover

We got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit
So recognize me, kids memorize me
Everyday, I be scrounging, really I be lounging
I play the down low, very very incognito
Aries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme
Sometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the honeys wiggle
Intellect is the major, some heads like to wager
The skills on the hill, overlooking dollar bills
Man, you're crazy, thinking you can phase me
The Ab doesn't study mere nonsense, money
Life seems to need me, MCs seem too cheesy
With their doody ass renditions of defeating competition
I rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man
Bet your bottom dollar Vinia will make you holler
As you stand at attention, did I forget to mention
MCs will give me twenty if I sense that they act funny
Lyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant
Just mentioning the fact that the area is fat
I dwell in the under, so honey it's no wonder
That I get plenty of tail, well I even get white
I'mma bet hitting head crack, there money, take that
Breaking niggas off, cut their bank, then I'm off
While my Nikes match my Lo hat, beat joint is mad fat
Got the cutter of the box if a kid think he's ox

Cause when the shit hits the fan, that ass'll get dropped
MC's want to attack me but them punks can't cope
I'll have you left without a job, like Isley from The Love Boat
So money watch your mouth, or I might have to bust ya
Battling MC's, from JFK to Russia
Back down to London, Sweden and Brazil
Do a U.S. tour for three months and then a chill
Styles be fat like Jackie Gleason, the rest be Art Carney
People love the Dawg like the kids love Barney
""I love you, you love me""

My fist stands firm because I'm, black and solid
I open up your pores like a plate full of collards
C'mon take it easy wouldya, easy easy
I'm up in the gulley, that's when I am her Buddy
She told me pull her hair, I did, it drove her nutty
Filled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty
When we over joints like this we never cruddy
Extra P hooked the beat, and kids it feels lovely
Check it out, cause my conception is immaculate
A bachelor, looking for a bachelorette
Back to you MC's, this is what your gonna get
A first degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette
I hope you like Malboro, Paul you know we thorough like Denver
The beat feels like a never-ender
But all things good must, so I won't sweat it
Drop the see's for the youthful crew, I hope you get it

Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over (original, uh!)
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor
Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa
Representin on the mic it seems to be my daily
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey

Would have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin
The mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin
Walkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it
The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly (bust a rhyme)
Today's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? (uhh)
Worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded
Steady kickin styles so I can reach that other level (uh)
Don't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal
Always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble (right)
I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble?

Please proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato (yes dread, uh)
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh (right)
Calm and serene like the study was Tao
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease I defeat organisms
That are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters
Quitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangling my cord with hopes that I’ll stop rockin
Never will that happen only if it is permitted (uh)
Wait, I think somebody shitted (come on)
I guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin

A Tribe Called Quest,"The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But the night is on my mind

So parlay while I drop this rhyme

See, Jake be gettin illy when the sun get dark
He be coming out for heads but shit don't let me start
There's activities a-plenty in the nighttime
For the ghetto child it seem to be the right time
See, kids be getting stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks
Shorty see the action and then start to mimic
Running to the corner, the dice game is blazing
Looking at the loot, it seems so amazing
Puts the short down, to be exact one pound
He shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down
Scared money don't make none
He threw a trick on the ace now he's out son
Hits the local bodega to wolf down a gyro
Son is on a midnight run like De Niro
Spots a shorty rock standing on his block
The fiends be hounding him to pump so he asked it it's not
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
Increased intensity, cause damn she was a fly one
Took her to the crib there she ran her jibs
About mind upliftment and being positive
He yawned and he sighed til 1:05
Then he finally realized that honey wasn't live
At least he didn't plan on building for the evening
Threw the Fila on the dome and said 'Come on yo, we leaving'
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
Saw his man Stan with the blunt in his hand
(Ah sh) You know the transaction
Brothers gettin lost in the weed satisfaction
Coming down the block man loud as 
You would swear Redman was inside the truck
As the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt
They interrupt your cipher, and crush your blunt
See you left your work at home so they pat you down for nothing
Why in the hell does 10-4 keep fronting
You push to the park even though it's still dark
The kid is nice on the hoop, he said 'I'll spot you troop'

The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But now the night is on my mind

The night is on your mind
Ayo the sun'll still shine
But now the night is on my mind

As for me I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates
On a young black man who makes the niggas speakers shake
The nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy
It's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound
The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
The night makes the aura and the Jake can't hack it
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
And the stars dance around, a-yo I think it's fly
Intensity, most rappers don't see it
Spirit wise, musically, you gotta be it
Serenity and silence of the sounds and emotions
In the concrete jungle and the sun don't bungle
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel
I paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel
But let me slow down, I think I ran my jibs enough
Peace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough

The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
The night is on my mind

The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But now the night is on my mind",Midnight,1993

Trini-born black like Nia Long's grandmother
Tip and Sha they all that, Phife-Dawg ditto
Honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow

The Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar
Hip-hop scholar since being knee-high to a duck
The height of Muggsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip

When we coming through get tickets to see me
We work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie
Lyrics are abundant cause we got it by the mass
Egos are all idle cuz the music is the task
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it

I let my lyrics flow, and juxt your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after
Yo Tip settle down, whats the reason for the laughter?

I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying
So much going on, people killing, people dying
But I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental

Why they dodging bullets, you should be dodging Quest
Dont get me wrong, violence is not our forte
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pele
Tip educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo
Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo

Ok, I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all as we mingle at the ball
We welcome competition cos it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card

Try to be the phattest also to stay alive",Steve Biko (Stir It Up),1993

Beating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-Seventy-Three, and C-Seventy-Fo'
Do a little something when I'm out on tour
Coming through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flapping shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll, cause we in control
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times toll
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll

Question Why is that, MC's be wack
And major labels wanna sound like crap, hey yo Funk that!
Word to life I'm coming rugged
Cuz once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks Refuse it
Put down the mic kid, cuz you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg, and I got nuff styles
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swingin when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle
Rude boy official coming with the ill grammar
Coming back on kids, like Joey Montana
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty
Mad play, on WKRP in Cincinnati
So lord send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself
Cause all deez biting MC's, lawd them something else
See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer ripping parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about feelin what with lead
NEVER MIND DAT MON HERE COME DE DREAD

We coming far far far
Busta Rhymes is coming far far far
Ya know ya hear me Star! Bet your bottom dollah
Right after this jam about one million one two niggaz go follow
Whether it be to-day or to-morrow
Niggas be collaborating sickening you beat them like they father
Oh shit check out what I saying
You know my niggas don't be playing
Once upon a hacking time
I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot Just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops,
Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings!! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings
But before I be face to face
With my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race

A Tribe Called Quest,"We got the jazz

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose is profound

Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends

So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make ya unball your fist
For we put hip-hop on a brand new twist

A brand new twist with the homie-alistic
So low-key that ya probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed

So raise up squire, address your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed

Then cool out to the music cause it makes ya feel serene
Like the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk

I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

We got the jazz

Competition, them Phifer come sideway
But competition, they mus' me come straightway
Competition, them Phifer come sideway
But competition, they mus' come straightway

Hows about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mike has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phifer really kick it?
Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?

I'm all into my music cause it's how I make papes
Tryin' to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another?  I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing

I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack

I take off my hat to other crews that intend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare

So jet to the store, and buy the LP
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skiff Anselm, he gets props too

Make sure you have a system with some phat house speakers
So the new shit can rock, from Mars to Massapequa
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done

So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theater nearest you

We got the jazz

Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut

Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline

The jazz, the what?  The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feelin' of pizzazz
It's the universal sound, best to brothers underground
In the one-six below, ya didn't have to go

Some say that I'm a sinner cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a stink, I ask
""What? What? What?"" now check it out

All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx a' Harlem ya don't stop

Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I say because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop

To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop

Everybody in the place ya don't stop
Ya keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop

People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine
Niggas, take off your coats ladies, act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the mo-mo
Ludicrous, we speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J Beez on the promo
On my never ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers to invade the way
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and blue but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and dolo
Of delf for self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do do that that that(come on)
Do that, do that, do do that that that(OK)
Do that, do that, do do that that that
I'm bugging out, so let me get back 'cause I'm wettin niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothas

Back in '89, I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case
I have a quest to have the mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's the dance floor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can the steps
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when the Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an over sized Bam-bi
The wackest crews try to dis, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want something here
Make something deffer, take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone macking, master as in great
I'll have your brain going in circles as my style tends to modulate
I'm making moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so your stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flavor, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks
While you playing hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissing around with wack rhyming
You lose your grip from chalk climbing
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't want to see me, cause all MCs are getting served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cypher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
Cause rapping ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushing any beef
Ain't nothing sweet, the bakery's across the fucking street
Phife Dawg, swinging it back and forth just like Aaliyah
Making moves on your heart like that trick Tamia
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losing my breath

A, yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene

My mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism
My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism
As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smoking izm
Now, when I'm with some cheese, I be letting off gism
Writing rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism
I gotta brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him
Got the Lightro in the back talking bout (come on, get him)
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em
Sucker MC in my path, hey main, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is tripping
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slipping
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitching
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walking through your projects in your birthday suit
Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If you'se a sucker MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, everyday all day, similar to water
Crushing MC's as if my name was Sargent Slaughter
Keep shit hotter, than a sauna
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter
Hey, I tried to warn her
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill
So all ya sucker MC's, y'all best go chill
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Singing good stuff in my ear, running fingers through my hair
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations
Chilling with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians

Two people thinking as one so now he split
Remember what I said to you, you bleed, I bleed
C'mon, you know how we get down, if you're down, you need
And I'm supplying, the dynamic duo, electricfying
Everybody had to wet us, cuz no one will forget us
Son, I testify sure as God was my guide
Any petty little bullshit you did will slide
Same on my end, after all, what are we, friends
If niggas ran me this, too much grounds we defend
In the honor or brotherhood cuz it's all good
Get on some grown man shit and let's knock on wood
But now seeing you baby in this stall out position
Wondering who's the dime piece that you're kissing
You night as well take the jigger and take my life
Cuz the dime piece you happen to be kissing is my wife
Shit, I should have know not to let these crab asses
Get within the circle of my girl and make passes
Now you disrespected me and everything I stand for
(But I'm saying though, son) Shhh, say no more

You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
The coming attraction, what, the main feature
And I'mma greet ya, like a rhyming ass creature
Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts
The brother well prepared is the brother who will start
And that's me Akki, as long as the ladies move they bodies

Yo, how you doing? Let me give you an intro
My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info
Got the diamond in the back and the sunroof shit
That makes the hardcore MC's resort to being bitch
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit
Denouncing my beliefs, well then your wig get split
Lay your egos on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your clique
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
Don't try to play me, see my name's not Dick
The Tribe is the crew that makes the mics get lit
Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit
My record company be on some true jerk shit
But that's aight, now, I'm on some true work shit
And I'mma make it happen for my whole outfit

A-yo, we just getting started, got to redirect this vision
Got the beauty of a flower plus dimensions like a prism
Your minds are locked down like prison

We hitting, yo bust how we too strong to be broken
Occasional malfunction pressure time, we ain't joking
For security, yo we on this run like Logan
Kamaal's doing the hustle and you backstage vogueing
We all got faults, don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings, there's bullshit at the surface
Sometimes, I mean we rhyme, damn, we ain't prophets
And if you think so, you need to stop it
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel but next man don't get jel
Playa hate that all carries weight that we don't need
We slim with disabilities and thick with possibilities
Cause then you can't move with agility
Navigating with good visibility
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
And strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names it still ring bells
There ain't no plan B's, yo watch, we moving through with plan A

Then I took one toke, yo, I almost choked
See I never smoked before so my nerves got shot
Then he told me about the party at the spot jam rock
It was guaranteed on but I said ""son, chill""
There's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real

Let me take a shower, I'm sweaty, and then I'll be ready
Tonight is the night I get my groove on steady
And get my drink on with that Ford named Betty

On some liquor, to meet my high quicker

Cuz the brother was moving wit his eyes on the prize
I said screw it, I ain't got nuttin to lose but um
But I got to do this shit real quick so um
Hurry up kid, bust your joints and then I'll bust mine
And I be out cuz I got to see this hottie, he said ok
Now check it, check it out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's what he said
Then I came back and just fucked up his head
Cuz yo, he thought an MC who was seen on TV
Couldn't hold the shit down in New York City
Aiyyo, I showed his ass, then I went off on my task
To bless her ass Uptown, real MC's will hold it down
Yea, yea, sonny, to the beat like that
You wanna bring it to me, where you at

Yes, dread, I had a similiar situation
When this kid tried to tell me I didn't deserve my occupation
He said I wasn't shit that I was soon to fall
I looked him up and down, grab my crotch and said balls
Of course he tried to bring it on the battling tip
Ay, you know me, you know I had to come out my shit
Trying to lounge at the mall, meet Skef and Mr Walton
Finally I banged his ass wit the verbal assault
He said a rhyme about his .45 and his nickelbags of weed
That's when I preceeded to give him what he needed
Talking 'bout I need a Phillie right before I get loose
Poor excuse, money please, I get loose off of orange juice

This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your rear section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues

A Tribe Called Quest,"Yo, we all got different things we got to deal with
We always are trying to put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at
Ourselves, recognizing a lot of the stuff that happens
But if we look within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense
It's about relating back to the essence, where it all stems from
I'm-a do my thing over this drum, like a native tongue.

Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real
Complicated with the skills over reel to reel
Brown skin is what I feel, my mind and body's appeal
Is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill

Constantly, I'm hearing black americans just sneering
Looking for a leader who can fill us up with either
Hitting us up with great emotional chat
About the fact

That the black
Is constantly held back
Like 50 tracks back in a relay race
And the white team's ahead

So let's keep up the pace
And I be needing something
To feed my logical taste
At the end of the race is there a paradise place?

Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing
Material gain we put too much in pursuing
""Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party""
But we can all mardi grati

Minus that shit in our body
""What that got to do with that""
'Cause kid that's the essence
Your physical presence

Embodies every lesson
You can't run the rolls royce if the engine is busted.
Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard.
What we need to do first

Now listen to this verse
Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate.
Recognize your existence in this vast blue space
From a tiny cloud of blood

To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell
And sound
Let's deem it profound!
And prioritize this cause it was allah's wish

""Allah? I'm god""
""No I ddon't believe that. That's a mystery""
""If god is so good why does shit be happening to me?""
There's divinity within

Because we come from the divine
A force that's not seen but you feel it every time
When the wind blows, and the world turns
And the rain drops, and the baby cries

And the bird flies, and the ground quake
And the stars gleam
So many things are eident of its existence
What we need to do is link it with persistence

Once we recognize that, we can move ahead
Native tongue, common sense yo he's hip-hop bred

From the spiritual world my former life has developed
First person I lost close to me was stella
Some of my mellows
Lost their mothers and their brothers

For them I feel empathy
But I ain't pouring out no liquor for no niggas
I pour my heart out when I see dot out on the deck
Knowing two weeks ago he slapped-box with death

I hear of niggas dying in the wind-in the news
But when it's somebody you know it hits you
And emotions get bruised
I ain't been in your shoes

I won't judge you for knocking
Because the spirit of the ghetto says ""you gotta!""
They snatch you again from rock flippin'
Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin'

Stickin' stores
On the strip
I'm tired of arabs giving me my change back
Devil bomb my yesterday

My tomorrow he never gave back
I lay back, looking at the ceiling
Wondering what can I do
So my homie won't have to be dealing

Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better
Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life
That we have to put together, better ourselves
'Cause families we gotta raise

No matter how long the money
Shorter become the days
Men become like women
And no difference in the season

If you got popped five times
You breathing for a reason
Let's put the five tenure plan into progression
Before we count our paper

Count our blessings",The Remedy,1996

The switch hitting Queens, niggas liquid sword spitting
With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill

Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whip cream before the water runs dry

Yup yup yup 
To the North to the South to the East to the West 
I don't discriminate boy I bring it to your chest 
If you oppose, then your soul will decompose 
Strive to get money and I'm not no hoe 
Fresher than the air that you're breathing through your nose 
Fuller than the kicks that you're puttin on your toes 
You can ask Bo but yo that nigga don't know 
About the dominant factor the accurate rapper 
Here's the next chapter, page ninety-five 
Niggaz so hard it's a wonder they alive 
But yo we still survive through the danger that lurks 
My eyes remain wide while you ask like Urk 
and yo my Family Matters, so all you mad hatters 
Put your thinking caps on and motherfuckin brainstorm 
Cause I got the plan that wins and can't lose 
Your man knows who's nice say Tip he'll say ""True"" 
A lot of these jokers out here is blase 
I'll be rockin mikes until a horse says hey 
Some are preoccupied with glamour and glitz 
Actin all boogee and making big movies 
But I'll be in the cut call me Incognito 
Busy makin joints that will bump for my people 
You're listening to a man who was something for nothing 
Stay in me forever head, never be frontin 

Chorus: repeat 2X 
Once in a while we have fun in the mix [never ever] 
In to good living, but some be into glitz [true dat] 
Everybody knew, all the fellas and the chicks [trigga E] 
Gotta wear a shoe that fits 
...to all my peoples

c'mon word, check it out now [you out there?]

What? Uh, check it out now [louder! louder!]

Peace to my girl named Dawn Paris 
Peace to the Organzied Kon-fus-ion 
Peace to all my shorties that be dying too young 
Peace to both coasts and the land in between 
Peace to your man if you're doing your thing 
Peace to my peoples who was incarcerated 
Asalaam alaikum means peace, don't debate it 
Devouring, and towering over fools 
Your mic is broke and my shit's cool 
The black man with the understandin of 
The three wise men and the theories of Zen 
Yo I get inside the crevice like a dentist 
Disrupt, the block, like Dennis, the Menace 
Shaheed is on the needle, the shit it won't weeble 
or wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like Boggle 
Bingo! That was the damn dog's name 
But yo I know another one with much more fame 
The Phife Dawg, and that's my word to the cipher 
About to bring it to your chest and cause strife check it out 
You're doubling back, to your rhyming pad 
What I represent is MC's gone mad 
In a perfect world there's imperfect acts 
We've come like a God to redirect alla that 
So people with a gift can just flaunt and get money 
So much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny 
Money is invested in real estate and stocks 
But not inside the glamour 'cause all of that stops 

Outro: Consequence 
Yo dis the Cons to the Quence 
up in ya like a stiff one, knowhatImean? 
It's nine-five, you got to live it or rip it 
So if you step on the streets keep it movin, knowhatImean?

And all my babies 
Children of the world, no maybe's

It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swingin when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing

To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot Just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops,

The Dawg is like a overflowing rhyme from mind
Usually mess with shorties whose a 8 or 9

It seems that the devil keeps testing me
Got the illest part of the recipe
Yo tell your home girl to stop stressing me (stop it)
Undressin me is the part you really like
Brothers hold the cracks now they holding mics
The cusses you get, for letting steady rights
For writers, we did that shit at Mid-night, alright, alright

I love it when my honey dip be slobbing me
Don't take it personal it's just comedy
My comedy completely turned to tragedy
I sense some of these rappers still be mad at me
Sweating her because of her anatomy
When I bang you it'll be assault and battery
Don't make me discombobulate your microphone
Talking trash will only get you freaking head, flown

Buy em out the box, never faulty ones
Get in that ass like karate son

We manage a smile, sometimes we slip it in

My rap'll blast ya, send you to the hereafter
I push a tractor, for horses grazin' in the pasture
Ya heard I was trickin', the whole room filled with laughter
In ciphers, I'm the one you don't rhyme after
You only know half of the math, it don't add up
The lead batter, my hits make ya frame shatter
Watch me now! Just begun like Jimmy Castor
I'm bad luck just like walkin' under ladders
Mad rappers, book of life, last chapter
Me and my squad build just like contractors
I break shit, you only give hairline fractures
Women flash us, don't know ya better ask us
A bastard, wit' more contacts than Lens Crafters
Tear down the rafters, venereals couldn't clap us
You need practice, hit chicks then I'm Casper

The church of scientology, feminine biology
Manic depressive psychologically, A.D.D. alive and we
Polluted by technology, the fumes and its ecology
While your thought you was out of copy I get nastier than sodomy
Probably an oddesey, started back on robbery
Was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty
Regarded as a prodigy, leery in sociology
Let the wallabees always conceal my gynecology
Rhymin' pathologically, that's how it gotta be!
Never makin' no apology, worshippin' my anthropology
Fuck modesty, studyin' microbiology
Causin' verbal lobotomy, it's in my geneology
Six months of sobriety, movin' very methodically
Like a unicorn, more ways than oceanography
Guard technology, rip shows antibiotically
True thugs bionically, give birth to criminology

Yo as a youngin', I swear to God you couldn't tell me nothin'
I swore I was gettin' somethin', clothes or humpin'
For girls with the church, slacks with some shirts tucked in
I set it up for money, my mom worked when I was cuttin'
Unsigned strugglin', for the heat I lit the oven
One would by the CD, the other would do the dubbin'
Before I met Rob, I was in the clubs frontin'
Oh yeah I know the Tip, when I see him I be duckin'
But now when I'm clubbin', those that used to dis were buggin'
Overweight chicks, spandex, they stomachs sucked in
Stay interruptin', dance and try to cut in
Told people you got in free when you really snuck in

We never get concerned about who's in the league
We just stay workin' so no one will need
An unconcerned outsider givin' niggas feed
My niggas puff weed but negotiate the seed
The family is granite and you can't intercede
I try to switch lanes at this operatin' speed
Cats in the game be gamblin' with greed
We the house, you the player and we gonna catch these
Who's the Sam Sneed makin' microphones bleed
Poker face creed while my mind just read
Shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed
That's insignificant but this take heed

They say I'm pretty like Clay is, bright like the day is
Beats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is
I'm swingin' this from Bay Ridge to where the Oakland Bay is
My game is tough to play, I'm tough to weigh like your safe is
The aim is, to make you recognize what the name is
Mos Def gon' set it straight from where the 718 is
The place with the greats who originate the flavors
An all-star block with some all-star neighbors
(Turn the music down!) This is probably some haters
Achin' cuz they hear us rotatin' on the playlist
From B-boy laces to Detroit gators
Yo Tip I got to bail, where the scale? Help me weigh this

Now which emcee feel like he fuckin with dis heah? (This here)
Word to Queens, I keep shit hot like a canish, yeah (Nish yeah!)
Malik is back, I'm here to make you look foolish (foolish)
My roughest niggas in the Apple (Apple) on Coolidge (Coolidge)
Remember White Shadow? My click stay sharper than an arrow (c'mon)
Plus in Trinidad I'm treated like the Mighty Sparrow (uh-huh)
Freestylin son, like there was no tommorrow (fuck it up nigga fuck it up)

Check it out, the original, shit, we makin it
Takin it, to the extremes, we breakin it
When we get, inside a zone then you feel that it's good
All you jelly cats stop marinatin my wood
Niggazm grab the mic with loads of malarky
I bring the knowledge and wield the anarchy
Put it on pooh-butts who's unsettled with ignorance
Give the last sentence with poignance and diligence
Eighteen wheelin through niggas like truckers
Breakin ankles, put it on like we at the ruckus
Guaranteein that shorty can move it around
In the place that gets you hot but leaves you here on the ground
Contenders don't you even think to challenge the crown
Of these brothers who so elequently hold the beat down
Fuck the rigamarole, we vyin for the control
We the musical equation of the whole entire nation

Yo Phife Dawg
Yes Kamaal
Busta Bus
What up?
Yo Reggie Noble yo it's time to step up

Yo yo
I'm just a ill nigga who don't got it all up stairs
Riding dick, get the balls til they come in pairs
Oh yeah, throw the goggles on these engineers
Cause it might, get kinda wet when I spit this here
Yo, I'm six-foot-one with a big ass gun
To carry it you'd need a waistline the size of Big Pun
But I move crowds without a gun
Like if -- The New York State Lottery is ninety nine million!
Hah-hah, yo, when it's time to flow I suprise and blow
Five hundred thousand units off a dime a trow
Forty below, I'm thorough when it's time to throw
The caboose, I'm even hard to be touched by a masousse
Whoo-whoo! Funk Doc gets the money
And best believe I went through more trees than Sonny

One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two

Yo, it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down
Yes, I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound
It go one, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two

And it's the Phife Dawg and I do the same
And when it comes to rippin' mics, aiyyo, it ain't no games
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two

Aiyyo, you know it's Busta Rhymes, every time
Oh yes, I'm comin' wicked with the new design
I'm sayin' one, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two

MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body and the health make me wiser

The tantalizing wordplay, yeah, that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come with better compositions
I write and recite to make good position

In this rap game here, we engineer
Stabbin' up the jam, yeah, son, shit's clear
And I be kickin' rhymes in my own damn way
Beatin' niggaz to the punch like Sugar Ray

Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to see Seventy Three and see Seventy Fo'
Do a little somethin' when I'm out on tour

Comin' through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flappin' shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last

Let the good times roll 'cause we in control
Take you out on your high, less you payin' a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Take you out on your high, less you payin' a toll

Question
Why is that MC's be wack
And major labels wanna sound like crap?
Aiyyo, funk dat

Word to life, I'm comin' rugged
'cause once you add the hip to the hop, kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks renuse it

Put down the mic kid 'cause you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap?
The name is Phife Dawg and I got nuff style
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild

So bust what I'm swingin', what I'm swingin' when I swing
I rap when I rap 'cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland, now he's Sleepless in Seattle

Rude bwoy official comin' with the ill grammar
Comin' back on kids like Joey Montana
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty
Mad play on WKRP in Cincinnati

So Lord, send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself
'cause all deez bitin' MC's, lawd dem somethin' else
See, I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt

Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer, rippin' parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about feelin' what with lead
Never mind dat mon here come de dread

We comin' far, far, far
Busta Rhymes is comin' far, far, far
Ya know ya hear me Star
Bet your bottom dollah

Right after this jam about one million, one two niggaz go follow
Whether it be today or tomorrow
Niggaz be collaboratin' sickening
You beat them like they father

Oh, shit, check out what I saying
Ah hah, ah hah, oh, ah hah, ah, hah
You know my niggaz don't be playing
Once upon a mah, hah, hacking time

I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowin' up the spot
Just to represent the Nations

Three dimensions, tri-clops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Mama so mama saa mamma ma kosah
Go back to the country to go check my grand mama

Eeeyah, bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings, delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings, watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings

But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Sit, dog sit
Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit

Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say What?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say What?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean (Okay)

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up
(Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love b-u-d-d-y (why)
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny
I seem (very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip
(Gotta gotta flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Oh let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)
Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas should we keep her aware

A Tribe Called Quest,"We got the jazz

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose is profound

Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends

So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make ya unball your fist
For we put hip-hop on a brand new twist

A brand new twist with the homie-alistic
So low-key that ya probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed

So raise up squire, address your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed

Then cool out to the music cause it makes ya feel serene
Like the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk

I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

We got the jazz

Competition, them Phifer come sideway
But competition, they mus' me come straightway
Competition, them Phifer come sideway
But competition, they mus' come straightway

Hows about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mike has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phifer really kick it?
Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?

I'm all into my music cause it's how I make papes
Tryin' to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another?  I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing

I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack

I take off my hat to other crews that intend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare

So jet to the store, and buy the LP
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skiff Anselm, he gets props too

Make sure you have a system with some phat house speakers
So the new shit can rock, from Mars to Massapequa
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done

So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theater nearest you

We got the jazz

Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut

Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline

The jazz, the what?  The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feelin' of pizzazz
It's the universal sound, best to brothers underground
In the one-six below, ya didn't have to go

Some say that I'm a sinner cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a stink, I ask
""What? What? What?"" now check it out

All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx a' Harlem ya don't stop

Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I say because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop

To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop

Everybody in the place ya don't stop
Ya keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot

A Tribe Called Quest,"My mother went away for a month-long trip 
Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship 
She made a big mistake by leaving me home 
I had to roam so I picked up the phone 
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down 
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around 
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74 
My mother left a yard but I needed one more 
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks 
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks 
drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit 
Came to a toll, we paid and went through it 
Had no destination, we was on a quest 
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest 
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half 
The sun had just risen on a dusty path 
Just then a figure had caught my eye 
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high 
I pulled over to ask were we was at 
His index finger he tipped up his hat 
""El Segundo,"" he said, ""my name is Pedro 
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto"" 
Needed civilization, some sort of reservation 
He said a mile south, there's a fast food station 
Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor 
Ali said, ""Damn, Tip, why you drive so far for?"" 

(Well describe to me what the wallet looks like) 

Anyway a gas station we passed 
We got gas and went on to get grub 
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere 
Anywhere would have been better 
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em 
Ali had the fruit punch 
When we finished we thought for ways to get back 
I had a hunch 
Ali said, ""Pay for lunch"" 
So I did it 
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady 
She was a waitress there 
Put the wallet down and stared and stared 
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed,
""Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?"" 
I checked for keys and started to step 
What do you know, my wallet I forget 

Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers 
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man 

Lord, have mercy 
The heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me 
I fell bad but he makes me feel badder

A Tribe Called Quest,"We are here to tell the world just who we are
Shocking female (MC's), shocking female (MC's) (Repeat 2x)

Verse 1: Phife

No need for, introductions, cause I know you know my name and
Knocking MC's out the frame and, putting them suckers to shame and
I live for hip-hop, so I have no time for fun and games and
So just come and peep the unique styles we are displaying
The beat's just ridiculous, the lyrics articulate
Feels good, as if a girl just touched her (tits)
Sucker MC's, I'm killing 'em, I'm so sick of seeing 'em
Silly (shit) when they rhyme, like that red rugby shirt worn by Gilligan
Plus the hat, they (shit) is wack
When you see me coming take ten steps back
I make usage of the pronouns, adjectives, verbs
My granny says ""You always had a way with words""
And that's because my word is bond, lyrics are laws
Sucker MC's look at me like I'm friggin' eye sore

Verse 2: Posdnuos

Heere comes a brother hipping others on the style they lack
I've always rhymed abstract, I even know the brother named Abstract
I am the earner of the soul in mine
Forget the physical cause the physical will die with time
I'm shaped to vibrate in definite proportions
Of the kids who need the fix (Just listen to the mix)
I just imagine constant non-stop for the rubbishing
Like (niggas) use the Clinton loops as if they owned the publishing
Ducks be bleeding from illegal feeding on my verb
I bring the Mardi Gras to your face
I outwit vipers in my rhyme cipher
I can easily lick them cause they're victims of the subconscious race
Tossing periods in front of false reps?
It's not the 187 when the 360 slept
You swallow the cake from the plate of elevate
Or you might get sparked by the crew who got the weight
So recessitating rap like the hicks do with Presley
It's the kid who peed the jeans in Orleans off of Nesley
Just be MC number nine, if you let me rhyme nine times infinitely I will
Climb
I let my Walkman from Sony play cassettes from Raboni
Which guarantees to put me on the narrow road
Ayo, that's it from me, Plug 3, and Ali explode!

Verse 3: Q-Tip

When I rhyme, the effect just ripples
You sound sick, I hope your cells get sickles
You formulate into real stiff (shit)
Then I bet that it cut the chit chit
Cause the Ab will, be sharper than a Ginsu
Cutter or your bum (ass) head for the gutter
This is not a game and we ain't looking for the fame
That ain't the aim, we came to rip the jam out the frame
My inter-reaction with paper is amazing
So needless to say mad trails are left blazing
A whole lot of bull(shit) rhymes start to get play
But I'm here to say real rhymes to pay
I'm the type of brother that writes until my knuckles get nary
And through the domepiece, the rhymes will carry
Then transported to my throat then the quotes hit the air
As I stand dipped with the wares
Rhymes get slot times, move back from the jack
It's the verbal constructor, some MC's is wack
I make a girl do the bogle, doo doo brown and all
Make (niggas) jump up, drink Don, and have a ball
I ainimate the unlively with the verbal combat
The Abstract, never the wack
Motivator of the many like Moses
Moving through, bringing games into the dummies that pose us
That means you the sub relator of the sub culture
Like a vulture I swoop down on crowns, cause confusion all around
Mental burdens I bring to MC's who sing
They sad songs, money, the dough's not long
Mine on the other hand is lent me tight
The Abstract gets real, real, real

Verse 4: Dove

Real down to Earth I hit the Long Island Rail
You never see me tango with the horn and the tail
I got the kid for your mind I design it like sender
Smoking made hope from my neighbors, and the
50/50 luck takes the ""S"" off my chest
Cause the ""S"" on my chest makes a mess
Settling for Superman, stupid man, put on your glasses
Now your (ass) be slow guessing like molasass
Continue the menu, next on the platter
Hey where that (bitch) at? (He's right here boy!)
I gotta see what I got and who I'm getting it with
This ain't no nickle dime game that I'm peddling with
Mikie Rose said ""Stop riding, it be dividing
Taking me out how I be vibing""
Packing hard like pistol but my pops got the crystal
Told me if I ever need it just *whistle*
Respects to Griff Dog for the razor
Much respects to Joe but for the favor
It's about a million brothers trying to make it in this world
I'm glad I got a baby girl

So what so what so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what so what so what's the scenario

A-yo Bo knows this (what?) and Bo knows that (what?)
But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg, is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye, to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah!)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

Yes yes y'all (yes y'all!)
Who got the vibe it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all!)
Real live y'all (live y'all!)
Inside outside come around
(Who's that?) Brown!
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve rotate the gates
(Contact!) Can I get a hit? (Hit!)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow how now wow how now Brown cow
We're ill till the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me! Yo, what's the scenario

(True blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape plush Grape Apes to play tapes
[Papes make drapes] great for the wakes
Of an L-AH, an E-ADER, simply just a leader
Bass innerspace means peace see ya later
Later (later!), later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflater
So yo the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound? (oh!)

It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here!)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test, the water little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked
Then they rebuked then you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The Hip Hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Watch, as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact - boom! - from the cannon
Not bragging, try to read my mind just imagine
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary
When digging into my library
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh! Uh! Uh! All over the track man
Uh! Pardon me, uh! As I come back
As I did it yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!) the rhymes are on time (time!)
Ripping up this dance just like a radio

Goin' on an' on to the rhythmic variation
Wakin' in the mornin', I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation, please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the jump sensation

Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on, so I cross communication
Boggle at the party then you got the boggle-ation
Decapitatin' foes, yo, as if my name was Jason

Makin' all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic an' it's over
A Tribe Called Quest, we on the run for whatever
Trials an' tribulations that we have to endeavor

Brothers know my steelo, it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words, I'm loco

Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly

Worked too frickin' hard while all the rest were gettin' weeded
Steady kickin' styles so I can reach that other level
Don't worry about gettin' gassed, I push the pedal to the metal

Always wanted this 'cause it surely beats a scramble
I'm Jordan with the mic, wanna gamble?

Give your ass the willies an' your moms'll get the jitters

Winners turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangle in my fore with hopes that I stop rockin'
Never will that happen, only if it is permitted

Y'all can be my witnesses
That a fella fascination with money has grown
To the point that he will shit on his own
We got to have it y'all, its not a Spike Lee cinematic
A piece of paper making niggas get dramatic
But the money doesn't come automatic
Gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it
We got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion
Some cats go about it with too much passion
We got to mediate our greedy levels
Cause the lust of currency can have us sleeping with the devil
Gotta recognize it, realize the power
that this little ma-hucking piece of paper will devour
Man can be greater than the thing he creates
See, I'ma do my thing and see how much I can scrape
Yo I'd rather have respect than money, no doubt
But listen to me y'all, I want the mass amount
That the Sesame Street Dracula cant Count
So that I can give my people when that thing surmounts
To higher levels, of being, so when I'm MC-ing

Is finding true inner peace and prospering souls

Strictly focused on what I'm in this rap game for
Not for fame and screwing every whore after whore
With all that AIDS stuff going round
Tell me how that sound
Rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound
Now, don't get me wrong I love honeys galore
But see hip-hop's my bread butter
Cause that's what I get paid for
See this is what I wanted
Allah helped me to get it
And if the beat is wicked
You know Malik will rip it
From the bottom of my heart
That's where the love starts
The love for break dancing
My love for the art
And with this love I do hip-hop from the soul
A real MC, who never sweats how many copies are sold
Yeah I want to go gold, platinum, uh-huh etceteras
But why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya
I'm staying true 'nough respect to those that paved the way
From Bambaata down to Shah, that be my DJ
With out my peeps I don't know how the hell Id make it, word
Sometimes I feel that my career is headed for the curb
One love for the lending hand and giving all your help
Believing in me when I didn't believe in my own self

Ego

I got one, you got one, and now we equal
Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people
Sometimes it has connotations of evil
Sometimes niggas call on it when they need to
It's called the ego

Ay, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated
Some may hate it and some may overrate it
It's a top story and you rarely see a trend
So all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen, it's called the ego
Come up with an idea, and no one seems to get it
Then every time you mention it, they stare like you're two-headed
But one day in your cubicle your idea really comes to view
Your boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you
She put you on the aces of all the stripper places
And has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well
You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego
She knows you need the chicken and she knows that she's your people
They call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy
They photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy
And now that inner voice, the ego, making you get wavy
Change your diet, hit the gym and say ""What were you saying to me?""
The ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music
Or run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis
It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest
Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest
It's the ego

Ooh, Jack White
Ooh, Jack White

A celebrated genius, my dick game's the meanest
I'll take the girl that's augmented, new me is invented
I'll take the biggest house in Calabases
Anyone for Michael Phelps swimming classes?
You need it when you're balling, equally when you're falling
Or when those kids in school on your locker they get to scrawling
Epithets that's racist and stupid and mean in nature
Something that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya
Ego make you violent, or govern like a tyrant
Or switch ya dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant
Fool the thirsty people, selling tap water in bottles
Fool a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models
Ego has no ending, has people pretending
Religious zealots get perilous 'cause God's will they're defending
This is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us
And closing for our ego, we know only God can help us

A Tribe Called Quest,"Winter in America, never knew white Christmas
'Cause L7 squares always making my shit list
Spring is in the air and all the flowers are blooming
The powers that be wanna devour the movement
Tears disappear when they fall on the summer rain
Bleedin' through this mic, but they call it entertainment
Running across stages is a drug
It's like a blunt, we crumple the raw papers
Call it the Lord's name cause we taking it in our veins
Like the feeding us intravenous
It's war and we fighting for inches and millimetres
Try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders
If we don't give them martyrs no more, they can't defeat us
This lack of justice got us disgusted, look at our faces
All these soldiers hate but I saw military training
The force flags fly at a half mast this morning
Take a bow, this might be your last performance

They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya

The old lady saw us on the lawn with the Henny
Turn the pool party into the one from McKinney
Might've been racist like the waitresses up at Denny's
Swore we had twelve gauges, automatics, and semis
Now they wanna condemn me for my freedom of speech
'Cause I see things in black and white like Lisa and Screech
Predators get impeached and others fill in the throne
But veterans don't get the benefit of feelin' at home
So maybe those projections out at Silicon
Over dro they getting injections made of silicone
I swear it's the killing season
'Cause killin' is still in season yea

Louder than a three pound, voices screaming mad a boot
It must be killing season, on the menu strange fruit
Whose juices fill the progress of this here very nation
Whose states has grown bitter, through justice expiration
These fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment
Things haven't really changed, or they're dormant for the moment
Marks and scars, we own it, only makes for tougher skin
Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within
Been on the wrong team so much, can't recognise a win
Seems like my only crime is having melanin
Connection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for
Causes meant to suffocate, I can't breathe no more
Settle the score sadly, need an abacus to tally
Through all the peaks and valleys, yo, I recognize it sadly
Black soul bold enough, inner city cold enough
Watch me get all my goons, watch us get soldiered up

A Tribe Called Quest,"Yea, Phife
For your life

Now, in the time when niggas wasn't supposed to be born
Best of us are left for dead in cities that looks war-torn
Vietnam going wrong, heroin going strong
Neighbors would whoop that bad ass just for running through their lawn
Walt met Cheryl, Cheryl met Walt
Trinidadian love sprouting through the asphalt
Love was consummated and the angels registrated
Two were to be born but only one of 'em made it
Inside a cloud of sorrow, a silver lining and joy
It's a bouncing baby boy, a king's name they would employ
And before he even squeaks it's decided it's Malik
Now, give him hope, give him care, raise him while his grandma there
Watch out momma, if you stare light brown eyes will keep you there
Let's progress the story just a little bit
Malik, I would treat you like little brother that would give you fits
Sometimes overbearing, though I thought it was for your benefit
Despite all the spats and shits and cinematically documented
The one thing I appreciate, you and I, we never pretended
Rhymes we would write it out, hard times, fight it out
Made grace face to face, made it right
And now you riding out, out, out, out
Damn

Have you ever
Lost somebody
Way before you
Got to dream

Never thought that I would ever be writing this song (No more crying)
Hold friends tight, never know when those people are gone (He's in sunshine)
Soul so beautiful, opined indisputable
Heart of the largest lion trapped inside the little dude
Took the grip to Granny's house, now we eat the curry food
Talking hopes, dreams, plans, leak ice, never scared
Brand new pair of Nike Airs, avenue of stairs
Mailbox mayors, all our rhymes was written there
A nigga wanna battle, you know Phifey didn't care
Jarobi with the beat, into new ass we tear
I'mma flash forward, well took a trip to ATL
Cooking in the kitchen making sure my nigga eating well

A Tribe Called Quest,"I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
Dream about Bugattis and other four-wheels
They say Illuminati and other ordeals
Is how my lawyer got me to avoid a raw deal
And now it's more real than it is for any other star
And that's enough to have you tearing up the mini-bar
I should probably get awards when the Emmys are
For how I deal with the path like Remy Ma
I get in the car like a sniper's on the roof now

I ain't surprised that they broke up on IG
I got the game on IV
Might as well have a live feed
Keep a fresh cut from IB
So I always match the picture in my ID

Damn, nigga, if you open you mouth

House of Pain, I control many
House of lies, you niggas go run, hide
Peep the way the vibe conflict with they real lives

A Tribe Called Quest,"I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
A-fixed to the earth like my feet they got cleats on

I spun around without a care, when I stopped, I felt lost
I'm two heels from the top tier, I really want to be boss
I figured out, I figured it out somewhere
Maybe the answer's not up there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere
When I stopped, I felt lost
Do you ever feel lost?

Turn a good day into a downpour

As-salamu alaykum for the bacon
And a little bit of coke I put the cake in and it's certified dope
Having anything to do with it we selling
Every rock that they can smoke so let's take a toke and Imma rake it in
Pillsbury the dough, to the dome, like I'm seeking through the soul
Like I'm peeking through the soul
But I'm reekin like our reefer, rather keep up with her, go
Straight to the dro
Creepin' on em, peeping on em, leave em in the zone
They don't even really know
Looking on em, keeping on em, taking every foe
For the love of the money B gotta reap in what I sow
But I keep it what I know
For the ending of the row gotta go will I go
When I get it Imma know to follow my known foe
My caliber lock and load alabaster box when I cock and I crow
Gotta Glock and I'm Bone Thug where you wanna flow
To the clock and the time zone
Spirit gon fly all y'all niggas dead to the life force cyclones
Right now when they hydro while what about the well known Cairo

Got em stuck in the grave
Im on the grind full time never rest to get paid
A little hustlin' muthafucka put the brush to the face
I Cut the braids, hit the stage now they looking amazed
I went from cookin the yay to hundred thousand dollar shows
Gotta bookin' today and ima split it with my bros
Gotta get it how we go come meet me with the pros
Now I'm never gonna fold, watch the bank account grow
If it ain't about dough then it ain't about jack

I never settle keep the pedal to the metal
When them haters in my rear view, hello hello

Burn, baby let it burn
Now it’s my turn
I get in a nigga's system like a hundred viles of sherm
Then I kill em with 2 thousand words in 2 minutes
You never heard another nigga spit it like my niggas
Yeah, you heard em try to get with it
But couldn’t get it quicker than the realest
Man they think they can deal with this
And knock me out my rhythm, but I’m never gonna be the fuckin' victim
'Cause I’d rather be the suspect
Haven’t I given them enough yet
Can’t they understand they ain’t dealing with a punk bitch
One quick move and it’s murder
And I’m a serve a nigga exactly what he deserving
A$AP, but wait a minute
I’m probably one of the sickest niggas that ever did it
I’m in it cause I’m a win it
I’m a muthufuckin' lyrical tyrant
Pivotal giant of this shit
And I do way more, just twist the words
You better listen and observe, how I rip the verb
Niggas get the nerve to run up on me, but my shits superb
I’ll probably hit a nigga once before he hit the curb
So get at me, I’m kinda trigger happy
When it come to shootin' my gift
I’m like a 44 magnum, Stag one
Backin' em up, body bag full of niggas
Wack raps, that’s wack, so I’m stackin' em up
Kray Jack in the cut, still got a little bit of murda for em
Murderous poet, I create a bloody murda poem
So when they run up on me nigga be ready to show em
Redrum redrum redrum rum rum

Yo, before this project
We’d like to thank the most high
On behalf of the A$AP Mob, Bone Thug and, all in attendance
Knowing that all things belong to those
For the cleanliness and the power the first in the nation
To prove who they are
Through infinity, through eternity, through time span
Standing one man, if you hold my hand, hold my hand
(Make sure its a hand)
With all things around me I will never win
I won’t win with angels
I won’t win with the brothers
I won’t win with Rome
I won’t win with Sodom and Egypt
(I keep corpse close to my home)
Let us roll tell them why we did what we did, if we did
In Jesus name, Amen",Lord,2013

Eating off a cloud, high off the haze
Feel like I was flowing for about a hundred days

Couple of bird bitches [?]
Ain't fucking text back, oh, now I'm feeling played, oh damn

Popping a molly, get feeling like Ironman

It is the way we dance when we wanna cry
It is our mind that creates the definition of the beauty

Reach for the strength within

Get the bitches all up off these streets
Wonder why you rubbin' up feet
If you got high off what I sold
How his teeth platinum when he on shit row
Big belly bottle, I could still get throwed
Leave a nigga flat 'til his body get towed
Sad that the curb got closed
Leave him with a hole in his skull

A$AP Ferg,"She questioned my lyrics
My love for your music is bittersweet every time that I hear it
Your great-sounding art helped build my walls
And pushes me away so I won't fall
I'm thinking in my head ""shit, oh my lord""
She texted me last night with all my faults
Downloaded your mixtape, it sound so good
But why you gotta say things that make me sound so small?
You talking 'bout your experience with other women
How you think that be looking?
My daddy and whole family hearing
Where's the respect? I don't feel it
And if you lose me, would you fear it?
Would you take back the silly acts that you was sharing?
About how you deceived and cheated with no caring
The honesty in music is fucking overbearing
I feel you, babe, I understand where you coming from
Just hear me out, just understand where I'm coming from
I'm not dumb, I know what I write
I don't wanna hurt you and I hate to fight
I'm conscious of everything I recite
Clench the soul through fingertips when I write
I don't really know if it's wrong or right
I feel like God put me here to shed the light

But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

My open letter to my girl who got my back
Who's affected by the real shit in my raps
What's that name of the song, the Jay-Z track?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
Still tryna figure my place in this world
Ain't mean to hurt the heart of my beautiful girl
See, I talk about the real so my niggas'll learn
Try give 'em motivation so my niggas'll earn
So I talk about how I shine and fuck on dimes
Rolling in the Maybachs, seats reclined
I know it sounds kinda harsh when I speak 'bout mine
And you'll be crying in the dark and wanna leave sometime
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

But I don't ever wanna let you go

Ah, it was all at the park
Colonial Liquor was his odor
The fragrance of a rider soldier
ODB was his persona
Oh you want the power?

I got an uncle and his name psycho
He had a dance and they scream ""go psycho!""
He would dance, work out and fight your ass at the park
(For the bills, for the hundred dollar bills)
And he got two sisters preggo
He fucked the other one to get one jel-o
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
(On the hill, shit to get really rich)

He used to have the braids with the cuts in his body
Most stucked out, kept the hammer with his mommy
Grandma had the arthritis pain in her body
Kept the burner in the mattress, so her son don’t catch a body
Gassed and he danced, smoked crack with his posse
Front flipped through a building window, land in the lobby
He was cut like Bruce Lee but he didn't know karate
He came home bloody screaming ""nobody can stop me""
Nobody can stop me, I'm the baddest survivor on this planet
Fifty niggas better kill me, nigga cause I will do damage
Checked out the psych ward, I am nothing to manage
My life cut deep, nigga I'm nothing to bandage

He fucked the other one to get one jel-o
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
(On the hill, shit to get really rich)

Where they be drinking forty ounces
With the brown paper bags for the ounces
No matter what day you found his ass at the park
(Hungry Ham, fuck around and get killed)
When he got kicked out of his bitch crib
And he had nowhere to lizz-ive
Always find his ass on the benches laying at the park
After dark

Don't get it confused Uncle Psych, I love you to death
Just wanna get a couple of things off of my chest
Growing up you always was buck-wilding with stress
And though I'm older now, I don't know how to forget
I used to wear your Timbs around the house when you left
And if you had an open soda, I would finish the rest
Pretend I'm older, I like the liquor odor you left
Then put your camouflage vest on like I'm holding a tec
Then point it at the mirror like I'm holding your rep
Though that mirror wasn't me, but it was you I reflect
Wanted to be like you, jail tat on the chest
With the rugged cornrows and a stab on my neck",Psycho,2016

You have graduated to the Hood Pope
You have made it to represent your people
Show them another way
Be the voice of the people who couldn’t make it out the hood

Make sure my family good, my ma still in the hood
I ain’t rich like they think cause I copped me one mink
They think I got me a house with a big couch and a gold sink
With a model bitch with a gold ring, big ass fish in a fish tank
Haha, you laughing, just put me in my casket
I ain’t even into nagging, it's what it is, I’m passing

And though times is hard now, your success awaits them
I’m no different what y’all are saying

You’re not exempt from the growing chain
Niggas forget who’s afraid to change
You’re the trapped lord, I will remain

Hood Pope, I’ma teach these confused folks how to maneuver
Through folks and attention, get you choked, you know
Slim model girls sniffing the coke
Fiend on the block sniffin’ the dope
I wanna help, I don’t know
Tell me the, antidote
How you hood and a pope
Conscious thinking, ghetto though
I’ll teach you how to build a grow tree
Life like a bike and pedal slow

Now you’re the voice of the guys on the corners
And the kids who have no direction, guide them
Through the trials and the tribulations
Teach them the world can be accumulated with patience

""Cocaine Castle"", ""Hood Pope"" Ferg
Got a question to ask, do you know Ferg?
Do you know that I come from where the toast burn?
New York, New York, I run for dirt
On Hungry Ham up on the corner
Fiends taste the lean, they never sober
For being in the streets to run a culture

Blackin' like I'm fresh out up out retirement
My flow still monumental
Mental, couldn't ride an instrumental but they ridin' dick
I set the standard for requirements, so call the firemen
Just me, myself and I, the world is mine, I put the ""I"" in his
His posse too clean, his diamonds like tip
His skin too clear, his bitch gon' stare
So mind your biz, how they find the time for mindin' mine

You know we run the East Coast zone nigga

In the kitchen culinary, I could whip a Bloody Mary
And I wish that blood did dent me, I'mma get your brother burried
Gangbanging with your halo, business on the payphone
Bitches pussies drying up, like Taz's Angels
Never was a client, 'cause that boy ain't buying it
And I got a bottom bitch, my top come on consignment
Step up from the minor league, double M the dynasty
No I never sold dope, I just got me a finder's fee
Following my frequency, niggas rapping week to week
Suckers be so weak to me, text but don't speak to me
You can never speak for me, see the B.I. Chemistry
Check into the crazy house, I'mma turn the labels out

Pull it off through the city like skirt
Seen that whole nigga like errr
Hopped up on a nigga like murk
Put that pussy nigga in a purse
You wouldn't be the first covering the dirt
Put him in the ground, he was down to earth
Knacked up nigga, I been down since birth
Backpack full of random work
With two bad hoes I'll teach you how to jerk
Teach you how to jerk
Swaggin' in my J's
Pop me a pill and throw that pussy a rave
My prerogative ways
Nappy chin hairs with the brand new fade
Brand new nigga with the brand new venue
Sold that bitch out
Should've made that ho bigger
Killing careers make these cupcakes remember
My objective is to serve your agenda
Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga
Equipped with a gat and the dick in your mouth
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Twisting up weed
I'm digging her out
Just filling her out
Do all that shit you be talking about
While you gone? Shit, NetFlix on your couch

Fuck you think I rap for?
Crack game fucked up, boy
Fuck you think I trap for?
Riding round with that mask on

Pick it up I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back

Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wild side
Welcome to our life

Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wild side
Welcome to our life

Come take a little walk with me through my neighbourhood
And come spend a day in my trap
Get your paper right and that yay some good
But just keep a tool in your lap
My lil' patna holding that work
Nigga want weight then keep around back
Betta not violate on my turf
Nigga yesterday just died like that
Ain't no investigation, no statements
And no witnesses, we ain't seen shit
Pull up after dark with that jewellery on
To come see a bitch, that what he get it
We on dark roads with no street lights
That pistol play after fist fights
And them geek monsters walk all night
With they crack pipes tryna get right
Midnight we shoot dice
The whole house smelling like cooked crack
You beat me, and you talk shit
You get shot bitch, and I took that
Hood rats on deck, that loud is all I blow
This shit to you it might sound wild
But this life is all I know

Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wild side
Welcome to our life

Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wild side

Can you picture me back in '93
Bumpin' Dr. Dre while I hit some weed
Cut school, made ten G
Thirteen, trying to get keys
At fifteen, I was full-grown
Get wrong, get bust on
My uncle gave me a bunch of work
And that shit was gone by the next morning
Young wild nigga runnin' with me
Homicide wasn't nothing to us
Dead body wasn't nothin' to see
That pistol play was just fun to us
I was 19 with two felonies
One of my best friend had a life sentence
How my uncle friend was just like me
And had a bunch of partners no longer living
All about that cocaine dealing
No education, no pot to piss in
Old school, on chrome wheel
Window tinted, pistol hidden
That's the shit that I come from
In my heart, fear ain't none
Stand tall, I can't run from
That wild side, that I walk on

Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wild side
Welcome to our lives

Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wild side
Welcome to our lives

All I ever did was put on
All my old friends tryna get on
Shorty fell out, making diss songs
Never talk down when I get home
Ain't the type of nigga you can shit on
Hundred spokes, brick, chrome
God body, big bone
That's hard body, Jim Jones
Niggas know the sound of how we switch on him
Finna wild out on a Tip song
Better make a toast, nigga, Tip home
First get the bread, then get going
From the land of the lead where they spit chrome
Where most kids never get to live long
They get pissed off, get pissed on
Pistol whipped and stripped, homie
Left for a minute and they switched on me
Caught them talking down, tryna bitch on me
And they snitch on me, ain't got shit on me
So my guess is death is what they wish on me
So I'm blowing on them candles
Closed lids and dark eyes
Cause hate's never part time when you on that wild side

Smoking weed, riding chrome

Is walk on the wild side

Received the word and it moulded me like Play Doh
We don't play though, we don't play though

Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling 
(I know one thing) anything is better than that 1 train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, ""Doo Doo!"" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm mmm,"" let's play ball
In a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold, I rhyme cold
My K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9 drone that banana clip,
Straight from the rip, I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta,
I might slice my wrist or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks!
And I swear it hurt me soul I try to prevail
But when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper,
Fuck it painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein',
You would be in trouble to body double or couple me
To these others 'cause comparatively speakin',
My reach is beyond the bubble that they put me in,
My vision's beyond the Hubble's I huddle with Nubians,
New beginning again you in school at 10, late,
Radioactive's goin' gold and so? Great!
Do I give a flying duck if I'm applyin' 
Love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a flying duck
Nothing but a buckshot, chck-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf!

Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this, ""Ho, I'm the meanest""
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, on shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich pot shit
Hoes on some God shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

Swiftly, I shift the Beamer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth (uh)
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse (uh)
Red roses drop on boxes very often (uh)
Confetti torture, drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton (uh)
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Grambling
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon (Sarandon)
The cloud of smoke like the phantom (uh)
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham (Big KRIT, shawty)

Spit like my last breath, casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes and cherish your wins
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, ‘86er, nigga, that’s my born year
Get the fuck from ‘round here, that’s just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma’s titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin’ hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won’t have to drop another album
B.b. King saw the king in me, so why can’t you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past fuck your Louis flag,
Popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?

For sho' these hoes was so uptight but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimpin' nigga, Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce two shotti pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the shine
Bone thugs had more thugs but that was the shit that made me rhyme
Whats up, what's on your mind? Hol' up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thuggin' like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the practice kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fist fights
And French fries and shootouts like one cig' with two rounds
And one clip left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one missed, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscious back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook, connect, named Sosa, Spanish chick by Ola hit it in the chocha

The baddest bitches on the block be even speakin’ bout me
I’m so thuggish ruggish bringin’ ruckus, knuckin’ if you buckin’
Young and thuggin’, buggin’ showing out in public, but you love it

I only got one vision, that’s for kids in every color, religion
That listen, that you gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all got children and siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

Back once again
Chilling in the back of the ‘Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I’ll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the ‘Lac when I spin
Then it’s back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn'
And a crap when I tap that that then attack
Never tax, never that that, max on the ends
Spend ends, I remember way back when
A motherfucker used to have to borrow cash from my friends, friends
Just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I’m on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me, them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what’s up to me, from ugly to comfortably, suddenly

A$AP Rocky,"Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my in-laws, they outlaws with no laws

We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, ""DOO DOO!"" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm mmm,""
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?

Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided
Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix ""Purple Haze""
A 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy, I'll be on my way
But grab the jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!

Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
We come Gods, come Lords
Lords! Lords! Lords!
Oh Lord! Toast to the Lords!
As we ? this day, please pray for us
When comes the saints, comes the evils, brings the Lords",Jodye,2013
A$AP Rocky,"Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down
In an elevator at 90 miles an hour
And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
My forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't goin' make it
Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm trippin', I'm slippin', feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
And I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smellin' like rose petals
Zoning out, two-three like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma and my brain going on vacation

I could start a motherfucking phone book
Know all the fly bitches gonna look
Like I'm on something, tell 'em roll something
I'm that one nigga, bumping two pots
Be like three hoes, that's a foursome
Fuck niggas always want to hold something
Young hot nigga done froze on 'em
Went cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em
And clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?
Only fear God, never sold on Him
Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him
Life's a bitch, but she chose on him
Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em
In big shades, fuck the hypocrites, die
Time let the tats, for the tick, tock
Clocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch
Pause, let it stop, hope we get by
Bye when I zoom, let it vroom
'Bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it [?]
A hundred miles an hour on the booth, better let it loose
A hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms
That's real rap, I'm stating facts
Contradictions, can't take it back
Mommy's stripping, make it clap
In a kush coma, finna take a nap
I'm out

Same shit gon' be still in my way

Wanna pass out, but we stayin up

Cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn
Nigga roll up, then we starting smoking
I'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos
Sippin' on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo
Dipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley
Tell your baby mama sorry, that was one night and please don't call me

When I seen this bitch in Venice, Tommy and some mean Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture
Changed Hip-Hop on ya, smoking like a rasta was my pops culture
I be damned if I die sober
I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt, or is it too late?
I'm a man of my law, I gotta keep my weight up
But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

And shout outs my pretty women in the spot tonight
Let em see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Beamers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
Cause I be playing with these womens like they're sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, ""I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden""
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher, grab your lighter fluid
Might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how he do it
Sit back and watch me do it

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt, or is it too late?
I'm a man of my law, I gotta keep my weight up
But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

Okay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rapping bars it get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap with fashion four way, yeah I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ay just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away one day just like some love birds
Only one word I'm afraid of is the ""love"" word

More power to you, more power to you my lovely one
What's up bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who needs friends
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Man remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ay bitch you missed out, hashtag #Fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male

Behind prison walls, nigga lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit, like the hard headed never listen, Lord

If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap

Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck

I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga bigger back

Am I still too young, am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up, did I fuck it up?

It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, mother fuck cops, what a blood clarts
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, bug shots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em switch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this

And I can't face it all I need is right where I belong
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face it all I need is right where I belong

My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places, like apartments, basements
Garbage vacant, lots, garages, spaces, Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Mason Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my eye and lung 'til later die at 71

I lay down now
This someone's journey in the streets who gotta keep a, peace, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs who bang and never stood a chance
Some boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement
And my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the high in me
Used to never give a damn now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me, it's gotta be
A whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I've given

Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face it all I need is right where I belong

Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sisters daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Whore without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines, 'bout the section lines, I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact

The root of why most relationships is startin' break ups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen inshallah

All my double cups purple like the soul plane (na-na-na-na-na)
Diamonds on me loud, got you silent
Got her bouncing on this dick like hydraulics

'Cause you know me, you know me
You know me, you know me
You know me, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go Lo Mein

Young, young nigga , same OG, stayin' low-key
Stayin' ten toes deep
Both feet says G (says)
Maybe B says I'm a G
I'm a weakness, like The Weeknd, on the remix
I beg your pardon
It's true, the rumors that they start 'gone make us break apart
Assuming they've influenced all this sudden change of heart (change of what?)
The voice recording take off with the whole thing
'mind them that they know me
No way you think if ever I decide to cut my hair like Abel did
Like Jaden Smith, I'll probably walk around a day with it
Okay, you lame, I'm a-okay with it
Might take the paper around my old ways

Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim, raw dogs
You other rappers mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mats off, till I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr Miyagi and Issey Miyake
Ass hole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head so good on that girl that I might pay her, or no
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home

Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long

Roll through the city, that Joseph is in me

On plenty, any, [?]
That ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated (all of the wrong) they did me
You stored in my memory all of the doors that I thought of
Means walk from my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis
Bitches been sniffing
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on em
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends
Bronson told me not to eat ham, rest in peace Yams

Rest in peace Yams, RIP A$AP Yamborghini

A'ba-Cus,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All,2002

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go

Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

The feeling right, the Paris night
Did it's best to please us
And strolling down the Elysee
We had a drink in each cafe
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy and I
Smiled like Mona Lisa
We had our chance

It was a fine and true romance
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass

By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance

Like we were dancing our last dance
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants

Living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play
And now you're working in a bank
The family man, the football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

Well he just might like to know

Quickly cover up your head

You know that sweet Santa Claus in on the way

Well I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day
So let the bells ring out for Christmas

When we're skating in the park
If the snow cloud makes it dark
Then your rosy cheek's gonna light my merry way
Now the frosty paws appear
And they've frozen up my ear
So we'll lie by the fire
'Til the sleet simply knocks 'em all away

Well I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play

Then I got your number
Seventeen and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know 'cause there's things I got to show you

Unlimited type style and we be rippin shit
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style

Welcome to the PSG I represent
The littlest in the crew but first one to get up in em
I straight up skin em like wolves 
I wish you would have been 

Fakin' jack and get ya whole hood hit
But it's all good 
We do the things y'all wish y'all could
And play the bat yo and watch the brothas bark like wood

So knock on it
Go head you want it
Nobody want it 
You turned in for it pulled nine stingers like a brown hornet

While y'all was droppin' I was underground shadow boxin'
Layin' low puttin' final touches on the flow
So here we go, tryin' to snatch that dough
Got niggas breakin' camp like Dre from Death Row

From the streets to the jail, I represent well
Touch a nigga like brail, jacks are hotter than the third rail
Scale to tip in my favor, the livest save 
Grade up in the U.S. now let?s get this paper

[Chorus]

I'm yawnin' while I wake up to the early morning gun-fire
Another day another scar to acquire
Jumped out my bed tried to break my alarm
Took a shower and then I strapped on my firearm

Grab my Pelle Pelle 'cause I want to look fly when I die
But it ain't my turn to say goodbye
How do I know? Some people call it instincts
I like to call it my luck who gives a fuck

I'm stuck, in this environment can't depart from it
And if I try I always end up back where I started 
Plan A square one there's no escapin'
So I pun and realize my too

I'm tryin' to live a full life before my time is through
Clock's tickin', so I don't got no time for you
As I head outside amongst the rest of the animals
Where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand it

(To all my kiko's)
It's sort of like a family brawl
We gather up all the soldiers and form into a invincible
Swarm of kids, now it's on again

Drinkin' straight from the bottle warm gin drippin' down my chin
For the crippled children you can't win 
Against 25 niggas bent up with mac-10's
Semi-automatic, fully addicted crime addict

So long as there's cash involved I gotta have it
There's many different levels of the criminal mind
Either you're in it for the gusto or I'm wastin' your time

[Chorus]

Now is you ready for men, 'cause they your peeps that you saw
You probably heard about me and my crew doin' what we do
For my nigga True and Smif-n-Wessun
'Cause I be wreckin' mic-checkin' fools that come around second-guessin'

I sparks in the dark like stars in the sky
Spiritually, lyrically, since knee-high
The cradle, I represent my peoples and my label
'Cause when you take a ride through Parkside it's fatal

What's my time to shine my design you can't define
It only takes a line and a rhyme to blow that mind 
To have you buggin', niggas got they tapes dubbin
Where ain't no line for me to kick a rhyme pushin' and shovin'

Now it's over, walkin' like a soldier I told ya
Shorty droppin' bombs and shit, like Oklahoma
Kinda soul, comin' wit that bomb for sure 
Run for shelter little brotha when it rain it pour

[Chorus] 

First of all the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The cream'll have you shittin' on your people
Livin like lotto, everything is everything

Ain't nothing change but the clothes that my money bring
I'm makin' figures that I never thought possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army in techses

And them Acuras that made you get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been tryin' to blow for years
Gettin' bent off Moet spend a G on beers
Livin' life to the fullest, my story ends wit a bullet

To the chrome-oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you're lookin, you can find me risin' to the top
I'm a classic approach my level and get your ass kicked

Floatin' in a river wit yo body rapped in plastic
I'm tryin' to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky

While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at 
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen 
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

[Chorus: 2X]

Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something

[Chorus: 2X]

Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep 
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

I'm the true son
What you wanna do son
Yo this a story about me and my first love nah mean?
Yeah son hit it off

We hooked up at a party it been then ever since
When I first stepped to her I was nervous and tense 
Didn't know was bout to kick, I went freestyle
Straight off the top, with suckas on the side just clocked
She musta liked my flow, 'cause after that we got close
Spending long weekends freakin' up and down the east coast
We got intimate, deep as the pacific
The chemistry was meant to be so then we ran without the ministry
Up in this industry tryin' to get this platinum
Many rappers tried to tap her, it wasn't happenin'
I watched her from afar, starin' at her like a fan
And now I got her in the palm of my right hand
Forever, as long as we can stick together
I guarantee you we blow up, 'cause with 'em I'm a trend setter
We signed a contract said yo, its me and you
Meet you at the top of the charts, where the skys blue

[Chorus]
Yo yo yo God bless a child that can hold his own
Its just me, myself and my microphone
Yo you gotta stick with it dun you cant leave it alone
Its just me, myself and my microphone
No matter where you plug it on the road or at home yo
Its just me, myself and my microphone
Yo God bless a child that can hold his own

My girl cant understand all this time we spend together
I tried to tell her
Its strictly business, she said she had a witness
Who saw us comin' out the hotel
Nosy people always gotta run and go tell
But it was just a tour date I had to do a show
So next time tell your friend to talk what she know
I wouldn't trade this shit for the world
In fact you better check yourself, 'cause I can always find another girl
The microphone is my first love my true companion
When I rap into it people think that I'm romancin'
I'm havin' visions, I'm foldin' it tight
Just me and you a phat track'll lead the spotlight

Right

We been through the ruckus together
Handle that beef
MCs got damaged in cyphers on they own streets
So ladi dadi, forget a shotty
I put a hole in your body with my lyrics when I rock it uh

[Chorus]

I hit her in the back of a club and no one showed her love
In fact it was a seminar you know how some women are
Takin' up my time, I tried to stay committed
Kedar and the Smith brothers made me stick with it
Now we politicin', on a mission tryin' to make decisions
To keep her on the cut and work just like a circumcision
Static in our relationship, its all distorted
The lines of communication, they got shorted
I cant ignore it, you know I couldn't afford it
To have this world tour planned for us abort it
Now I'm on some shit, rollin' with my clique
The mic is my companion that's all and that's it baby

If I go on my way without you
Whoa where would I go
If I go on my way without you 
Whoa where would I go

I'm having flashbacks
Let me relax my dome
My whole joint's blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva'
Ties will never sever
You died tryin' to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin' in peace don't even stress that beef
Go 'head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
every time I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
it's all over bearing witness like jehovah
ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his body's underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue

[Chorus: x2]

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table blaow
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin', not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin' Sega
And buggin' on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin' on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
He used to talk about the box in the closet 
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin' just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, it's ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin' with that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin' in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin'

[Chorus: x2]

Aye yo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin'' nearer 
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes it's gettin' clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brother's bad scratch 
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin' no crap
Another rug rat, somebody tell me where the love's at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

Yeah, destruction of the wack MC
We gone get back on that tip like it used to be
Now who remember when MC's couldn't touch the mic
If they skills wasn't tight then they best took flight
Prepare for combat, wield the contract, let the labels front
I be like Wu-Tang and put the joint from out the trunk
My situation is mad tight
So corny MC's take a hike
Before I ignite with the dynamite
And blow your crew away just like McVey
I get you, and hit you with the Parkside militia
I gets iller, than any disease that's known to man
Destroy the race of rappers like a Nazi plan
Damn, so A and R stop teasin'
Before we flip the script like a female pit when it's matin' season

I'ma show you how the east coast rock
I'ma show you how the east coast rock

OK now peep the situation
My manifestation is to rock the whole creation
Despite all the negativity, the publicity
It really ain't that hard god it's simplicity
So I'ma maintain and let it rain let it rain
And just like the MethTical I can bring the pain
I had somethin' to say so high class pulls the track out
I'm out to blow the spot like the seventy-seven blackout
Seen rappers come and go 'cause they had no flow
And if you ask 'em who was who or her I bet you they don't even know
Now who's that wack MC with all that mouth
I'll rip him in New York and work my way down south
I be the true I live it, non-fiction never slippin'
MC's they gone learn if it take a verbal ass-whippin'
My tolerance is gettin' short
So rappers that can't walk the walk grab your tape and escape from New York

An idea, but the people here on Terrance Avenue say if enacted
It won't work, and they say for the police, it will be a nightmare)

But through his shirt my third eye saw his heart pumpin'

I got the bike that I copped from my younger cousin
cause that cat is up in class like a nickel & he wasn't
I'm concentratin' on these moves that I'ma soon be makin'
and once I break then I'ma show my peeps that I'm not fakin'
See my man Pop or Die from the block
niggas wearin' reverse as we handle barred it to the block
See certain situations happen
when you caught up in the 'hood in the game of rappin'
You see scrappin' now leads to cappin'
we used to have each other's back
what the fuck happened? Stupid
Yo fuck it
Anyway Mary Easter record store
walked to the back now let me get a four
Exit from the spot everybody know what's hot
you get yours on & soon as you see 'em
the thieves turn the block
Jump on them right now when niggas chillin'
if you ever sported it you know how I'm feelin'
Cracked open my St. Ides took a squig
as Mama Blackwell whispered

You got it this time
He represents my Crew
You represent my Crew
We represent my Crew
Represent your Crew
He represents my Crew
You represent my Crew
We represent my Crew
Yo represent yours Crew

Which one of y'all think you ill enough to bust A+
get crushed by the stampede of the elephant tusks
We LB families niggas don't understand us
lyrical scanner diagnosin' niggas with cancer
you got a problem I got the answer
Twin Glocks goin' bananas
buckin' innocent bystanders son
the total sum is a mathmatical function
I used to get suspended for keepin' the class jumpin'
Had the blackboard with the chalk in my hand
Mr. Cheeks snatched the thieves off the Canibus plan
watched the crowd get amped
while they scream & chant
it's ill hot they can't keep still like a fire drill
We desire mils from 97 until
firin' high caliber steel on this battlefield
Son,

Long Isle's my Crew
Campstead is my Crew
Parkside is my Crew
Lost Boyz is my Crew
Group Home is my Crew
Everyone is my Crew
Reebok's my Crew

I entertain for my personal gain
rock the gold chains
big enough to cause neck pains
Canibus is my name
I be the last one to set it
You could find my name
in the Lost Boyz album credits
if you open up & look at the cover
you'll see Cop killin' Queens in this mothafucker
and we all represent the Group Home click
L-O-S-T   B-O-Y-Z for the 96
and as the clock ticks record sales climb
I remember when them niggas first got signed
fuckin' with Uptown bustin' they ass e'ryday
from ""Lifestyles"" to ""Jeeps"" to ""Renee""
Now they gettin' mad airplay all over New York

Jump in my whip
Feeling right
Pick my man up from off of the strip
We take flight
What the dilly fella
ain't nothing really
Getting money
Before we hit up top
Let's hit the spot and cop a twenty
Hit the southern states
So we can bounce
Regulate
Throw a tape in
Join this new joke
Smoke escaping
Windows tinted
They coming down cars on my horn
It's my mom on the other end singing a song
When the clock ain't a ?
You at a spot to perform
Kid I'm down with getting paper
Pulling capers like storm
No doubt
Hang up the phone and continue to murk
Ghetto star in the game put a name on my shirt
Got this one chick on the ? I stop to see
Runs with a team of chicks living 1-6-3
They be buying it playing space PlayStation and all
I thought I heard the cops saying I'm going to give them a call
Get some juice play some hard
Yo I'm spinning my yards
Get my lines lined up
Smell good for the guards
Get my shine
Shine my baby
Then I'm making my flash
Lay my hand on shorty rest until it's time to make cash
Call her up on her cell
What's the deal on your half
I'm just ? up for chickens
I just got out the bath
I'm around the corner baby
Is there something you need
Just bring yourself now say no more

[Chorus: x2]
We do this all night
Got fellas spending money shorties looking right
Either twist the cap or pop a cork
This is how we getting down up top New York

We on the couch chilling
Everybody getting right
Complimenting shorty
Spandex fitting tight
Press the power down
Grab the sticks
Hit us on
Cause I'm sick of hearing my man singing that same song
Yo I'm going to bring it to you live
Mad 98
I'm going to get up in that ass
Shorty fix me a plate
Fried chicken French fries cold pepsi with ice
A minute left and I ? night
My only shorty
You wouldn't believe it with a bun in her hair
Said she want to hit the cut
That's music to my ears
Hit the bedroom
Shorty smelling like perfume
Grabbed the condom out my pocket because it's on I assumed
Seen her face blown out
Time to lay down my law
Lights down
Music on
Perfect time to score
Victoria secret's ?
You know how I'm feeling
When you laid up with a shorty getting money and chilling
Got a show in an hour
So I jump in the shower
My man napping
He know that we got to make it happen
He in the zone caught in the mix
Oh damn
Can't be mad at situations that me and my man dig
Well it's your luck shorty
Go wake his ass up
Got a move to make can't afford to pass up
So go tell your to go
Tell my man let's roll
It's all said and done
Jump in my whip
Take flight
As I switch lanes
Throw on my signal light
Fake rappers get they ass ate up

[Chorus: x2]

Smoke everyday
Yelling my name
I rip a show
Peep shorty and her friends assing out in the front row
Spilling mo'
Grabbing my jeans
Yelling my name
I'm used to it now guess it's all part of the game
Let me explain how I grab the mic
Move and finesse
Shorty in the blue dress
Body screaming caress
Took her to the rest
Lay her body down on my nest
It's deep in the this game
Why she got my name on her chest

A+,"[Mr. Cheeks]
Basically, LB Fam to the motherfuckin' death
Park side, Queen's niggaz represent
Long Isle, how we do? They knew our style
Represent niggaz in and out the P now
Yo, I could do this mother shit for a while
I don't give a fuck, my rap style be true, yo
Yo, eh yo, yo, yo, how we do this

Hey, yo, well back on my South Side Jamaica part of town
Where us real niggas love to get down
Where you only hear G and P finessin' tracks up on the tape
We stuck in Queens, and I'm not tryin to escape
Yo, I'm havin cess', drinkin; I'm kickin raps and Emceein'
LB for life, kid, my way of bein'
Its time to set up shops; wild in this game and got props
And fuck cops; we puffin' lah wit' windows up in drop tops
Nothin' stops my crew from gettin' it; we learn from the past
Puffin' on this ounce of weed, I got this drink in my glass
Conversatin' with myself; what does my future hold?
Niggaz is dyin', will I make it past thirty years old?
I can't run; I guess I gots to hold it down till I'm done
What the fuck's the deal? I been doin' this here from day one
Official Queen's nigga; be a Lost Boy till my death
Until I breathe my mothafuckin' last breath

[Chorus x 2]
Eh, yo, from boyz to men
We're strictly Fam, no longer friends
Let's keep it thorough; I hold it down till it's on again
Until we meet again, yo, I'm back up on the street again
I'm tryin' to make it; throw out my nine, but pack the heat again

[A+]
Check this out
Yo, yo
My mind is reachin' twice that size than it only did last year
Three times it's likely to feel clear
A+, I transform into a super emcee
With super vocals, quicker than Superman can find a phone booth
The whole truth, nothin' but the whole truth, I roast you
Thermonuclear vocals get hotter than in Shanobal
The double O, just abide nuclear explosions
Exposin' radiation like a vulcan
I'm the only guy that knows why the golden eye
Was stolen by five Soviet spies
They told me to lie; they don't want to hear the god spit
Chop my hands off at the armpits, but I regenerate limbs
Like star fish, comin' at you with the hard shit
Swallow my beeper and page myself so I can communicate with a dolphin
Lyrical arson rush the planet like a million martians committin' arson
Walkin' the tarpits in India with snake charmers that place all the weight
Down...

[Canibus]
Yo, A+, fuck the nonsense
I got the reinforcements
To crush any enemies offense with a hundred thousand horsemen
And the hardest muthafucka on the market right here
I'll complete in a minute what would take you a light year
Extra-terrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
Battling for world supremecy
Who want to get touched?
The Can-i-bus will crush you
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Ambushin' emcees, jumpin' out the trees
Like Vietnamese in fatigues, covered with leaves
Interrogatin' you whack emcees like MIB's with dark glasses
Askin' you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed
By flashing bright light in your eyes with those silver gamas
So when you revive, you can't recall or understand it
That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
And take advantage of opportunites to do damage
I pierce your heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster then tha speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark, I rip you apart
My state-of-the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of his cranial cavity, which is actually
What happens to any motherfucker for tryin' to battle me

[Chorus x 2]",Boyz 2 Men,1998
A+,"Enjoy yourself, 9-8
Get it straight

Yo, yes yes y'all steady playin' the wall
Too young to sip alcohol at the bar
I'm ready to jet, girls actin' bourgeois
Yo Kedar, let me hold the keys to the car
I'm in front of the club tryin' to bag a chick
Tryin to get five of em, 'cause the whip seat six
Feelin' aight, chrome lookin' real tight
Watch the moonlight bounce off the pearl white
Word money, I earn money just to burn money
I'm tryin' to get this federal reserve money
There's two type of artists, expert and novice
Experts always hit the mark of they target

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me (you know you gotta)
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me
You gotta enjoy yourself, c'mon

Yo
I have the baddest foundation ever established
Me and my team bubble like Alka Seltzer tablets
Don't sleep, when it's time to creep
A little pimp like me will crawl underneath
It takes a lot more than word to move me
I don't give a P-H-U-K what you say
Actin' all wild, unprofession-al
Who got beef, I knock teeth out ya smile
My lyrical lubricant keeps the crowd movin'
You get booed when your stage show needs improvment
So if you want to see A+ the artist
You gotta Western Union me a key grand deposit
While that cat's out there steady kickin' garbage
Girls steady sayin', look I can see who the God is
You can't harm me or stop me
Even on a poor quality bootleg cassette copy

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me (you know you gotta)
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me
You gotta enjoy yourself, c'mon

Yo, yo
Take ya time, make up ya mind
The dime pieces love the diamonds and the shine
Real friends never fall in' love
Stealin' my heart, is like stealin' a car with The Club
Nevertheless I get an occasional crush
Say some romantic stuff that make you want to blush
Girls in all flavors, no matter what they race is
Rhymes amazin', makin' Craig Mack faces
Take em back to the lab and touch three bases
Take my time, don't want to catch no rape cases
Kiss her on the forehead and say goodnight
A+ y'all, and I'm out like three strikes

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me (you know you gotta)
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me (c'mon)
You gotta enjoy yourself, c'mon (what, what, what?)

				",Enjoy Yourself,1999
A+,"Uh uh, yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah
Bout' to set it off one time
For the cats that be buggin'
Ha, Clark Kid what the deal?
Group home, want to hit?
Wild man rest in peace
Ant-Live
Yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse One]
Yo it's the A-P-L-you, let me tell you
I'm sicker than any nigga that been admitted to Bel View
The rhymes I was born through a pen and my strongest strength
My pen is like a weapon when I hold it at arms length
With Kedar's consent I represent over tracks with Clark Kent
With some super vision from Superman
I get stupid man, you open off the verbal aerobics
I was in the Parkside state of mind when I wrote it
I'm the dopest, when it comes to this one
I'm invisible to ya third eye, you need a fourth or a fifth one
Maybe even a sixth one
Keep the Big Anther on the big gun for pin point accuracy to hit one
Never miss, the professional specialist remember this
The name A-plus it's anonymous with excellence
Don't forget that, before I have to get the click-clack
Give you a wetback believe me it'll be a major set back

[Chorus]
I gotta have it!  It's automatic!  Yeah!
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it! {Check it out} It's automatic!  What!
Take that, take that, take that play-boy
I gotta have it!  It's automatic!  Uh!
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it! {Yo} It's automatic! {Check it out} Uh!
Take that, take that, take that play-boy

[Verse Two]
A yo I heard some kids puttin' my name in they childish rhymes
As if I ain't bout' it bout' it enough to handle mine
You little boys pushin' past the point of being annoyed
I'll destroy, every rapper on the east of Seaboard
Just to get you I take some steroids turn into a werewolf
Jump in the ring and bite your god damn ear off
If the combat is hand to hand I bang em' in
Going bannanas man like a angry orangutan
Double my rhymes walk back to the talk fast
And manufacture the data
Here on after for all rappers
For character, you can smash with the speed of the comic book character
Flash Gordan with verbal phonics spectacular
Hear you in the back of the audio screamin' like you want to enter this
tournament
Come on bring it on and prepare to get manslaughtered
With deadly force
And my style is causing nausea like the scorpion poison

[Chorus]
I gotta have it!  It's automatic! {What what} Yeah!
So come clean {Suckas} and keep it real if you like my sound {Uh, check it
out}
I gotta have it! {Uh, Brooklyn} It's automatic!  Yeah!
Take that, take that, take that playboy
I gotta have it!  It's automacic! {Yeah yeah} What!
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it!  It's automatic!
Yo take that, take that, take that A-Plus!

[Verse Three]
A-Plus it gotta' be hip-hop's youngest mistrosity
There isn't anyone under twenty-one that could rock me
You feelin' this, forty-eight track ventriloquist
The actual synthesis passin' out the class syllabus
Just imagine if I rip your crew into fragments
Destroy the evidence so nobody will know it happened
Walking through the neighborhood full of dead men doing head-spins
Pickin' em' up like red-mans
Lyrically modified to kick the hottest rhyme
At the drop of a dime I limbo below the bottom line
Kick it tight, rhymes sent Method Man to another lifetime
Keep Erykah all to myself 'cause' I like dimes
Radiation from the bright shine meltin' MC's with height-lines
'cause' I'm very selfish with my mic time
When I recite mine, my rhymes explode likd a pipe bomb
Nobody in they right or they left mind can test mine

[Chorus]
I gotta have it!  It's automatic!  Uh!
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it!  It's automatic!  What!
Take that, take that, take that top that
I gotta have it!  It's automatic!  Yeah!
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it!  It's automatic!  Yo!
Take that, take that, take that A-Plus
I gotta have it! {What what}  It's auotmatic!  Yeah!
So come clean and keep it real if you my sound

What, I can have it

Stocking caps, ski masks, loced out, murder-one classes.
Those who wallop, hocked up, chopped tattooes permanent creased.
Survival one jeans.
Throw away his real ooze machines, Chinese AK zooms, razorblades,
Jerry Curls, finger waves, and French braids.
Labeled him sinner; look out for that motherfucker - he might rob ya.
Niggas come tatted up head in a body slang.

Doing for the juggler; niggas trying to slug ya.
Catch a nigga doing all kinds of nasty things.
Oh, what I feel is mayhem brings.
You see us on the block; we doing our thuggin'; the gottie
Got the whole cap wondering who the fuck shottie.
Lookin' for the body; tell me what they found?
His head in Richmond, the rest in the V-town.

Thinking about the set up, trying to get my red up.
'Bout my cock this tech-nine and get you wet up, blue.
So what the fuck they want to do?
Seem like we got the vas of these niggas,
Caught cash, and thought we was through.
So fuck this old bat shit; I'll get the gat, bitch,

I been checking you out right, what
You can't tell, check this out then
This what I want to tell you right here

[Chorus: A3 and Noke D]
Hey there shorty, can I get with you
Because we came here to party, and do what playas do
I've been peeping you all night, your booty's feeling right
I ain't trying to be your man, cause a playa's down to understand

[Mafia Mike]
Baby I been peeping you, for a real hot second
I know you got a man, and I trying to disrespect him
But check it, I get the message when you tell me that you need him
But baby, I ain't trying to change your lifestyle either
Your people steady telling you, to leave dude alone
But it's hard, you just pictured a new car and a home
A new phone to talk on, when you ride down the street
Your hair stay fixed, manicures smelling sweet
To me, all that beauty poo I know that you sick
It's the small things that count, and that's what you miss
I came back to get a kiss, and to tell you good night
And to really show you, that's it's goin' be alright
Kinda like Prada hot, to set the mood straight
Baby I'm your cow, goin' taking you away
Ok, go on ahead and lay your head on my chest
I know that's what you want, that mean you through with all the stress
I confess

[Chorus]

[Big Moe]
Shorty I've been watching you
Can you be my baby boo
We can bang Screw, all night
Floss in my Navigator, on chrome
Let me show you around my hood
Where the block stay hot, and it's all good
I'ma flip it, like a real playa should
I can't explain, what's understood
Understand, you can't be my wife
Cause I'm still young, trying to live my life
See things, that I ain't seen
I'm on a mission, trying to live my dream
We can chill, anywhere today
If it's real then it's real, baby girl why wait
My partner needs me, I ain't got time to play
I'll do anything you want, just say

Peep game, I ain't the one to jump fly
But since I stepped through the do', you been giving me the eye
I'm trying to figure out why, a girl so thoed
Want to mess with a nigga, that'll dig in her soul
I'm in control, let's keep it on the low
Watching your g-string, move across the dance flo'
While Moe over fo', screwed up moving slow
Only pulling bad hoes, that's down for losing clothes
I suppose, one I get up in your mind
Two, lay down then get up in your spine
Three, that's me a bonefied G
I smash and then free, that's the taste of a ski I-P
Are-O miss, to lace your bubble bath, in Don P and Cris
Watch us made that switch, but I'm far from a trick
I just like to make your wish, to live like this cause I'ma player

The one that has the lock and key,

Oh, what I'd give if I could see.
Am I the boy that you care for,
The boy who's in your diary?

Do you recall and make note of all
The little things I say and do?
The name you underline, I'm hoping that it's mine.
Darling, I'm so in love with you.

I'm from the Bush dash w-i-c-k
Faggot niggaz, they can suck a d-i-c-k
This is easy for me, flow is easily achieved, flow
Stay in my pockets in bulks, my proceeds go
Straight to the bank on the block rollin celo
And guess who's controllin the bank - Mush
Numero uno in the raps that I spank - Mush

I belonged
When you were weak from trying,
I was strong
But it's alright tonight

Come to me

Just to find you'd moved away
When you were wrapped in tangles,
I was free
And when you were almost blinded,
I could see
But it's alright tonight

A-P,"Je sais c'que les miens ont subi j'connais mes racines
J'ai évité la prison comme par magie
On court tous après l'argent facile j'ai l'esprit agile
J'suis à l'image de ma vie une machine une black machine
T'inquiète fréro j'connais mes racines
J'ai évité la prison comme par magie
On court tous après l'argent facile j'ai l'esprit agile
J'suis à l'image de ma vie une machine une black machine
Dans les jobs recalé combien d'frelons en galeche
En galère la plupart non français
Comment demander des comptes au palais d'l'Elysée
Les p'tits frères révisez mettez les bouchées doubles
Acte I en couche j'porte pas d'collier
Mais si tu fugues passe-moi l'relais
Mais reste poli moi j'vais t'épauler
Pour y arriver y'a des potos qu'on cane
J't'encourage si t'as les nerfs solides j'suis prêt à t'dépanne
Acte II message à la banlieue c'est malheureux
On t'coupe les jambes si t'es ambitieux
Ils connaissent quoi d'nous vu qu'ils sont apeurés
Me demande pas les condé qui les ont appelés
Est-ce que tu sais c'que ça fait interpellé
Menotte fichier ton nom épelé
J'me donne à coeur ouvert pas besoin d'alcool
Les black machine ont pour exemple Mandela ou Malcolm
Poursuivis les hématomes et les ultimatums
Et si on s'barrait ailleurs pour voir c'que ça donne
A l'échelle du monde t'es qu'une merde t'es qu'un atome
Y'a rien qu'a changé j'crains l'pire pour mes mômes
J'suis pas alarmiste mais j'constate
Que des bruits d'singe s'échappent encore des stades
Ils nous préfèrent en première page avec une sale histoire sur l'dos
Tu peux avoir un pote ou deux tombés pour rien
Refrain
Acte III on a trop souvent la quête du suspect
Pourquoi entre black machines on s'manque de respect
l'Afrique la terre mère une histoire des douleur
Juge personne sur sa couleur, on a trop souffert
Une pensée aux anciens combattants qu'ont fait la guerre
Pour le continent sois fier d'où tu viens
Moi j'sais d'où j'viens
Ils nous jugent au premier regard
Regarde dans nos démarches ils nous retardent
Expulsent des familles pour remplir leurs quotas
Black machine connait la famille
La terre rouge il vit où la mort sent beaucoup plus fort que la rose
Toujours prêt à défendre sa cause
Une chose est sûre pour lui la famille ça compte
Circule avec un visa ou une carte de séjour
Espérant en sang clandestino qui comptent leurs jours
Le corps sculpté par des décennies d'esclavage
T'étonne pas si on est atteints du virus de la rage
Les blacks sont les blacks machines perso j'digère pas
C'est pour les pots d'cuir des anti d'Afrique jusqu'à Djerba
Du a été le passé j'entends les coups de fouet résonner
J'en garde un goût amer impossible à cicatriser
A 10 par appart nique la taxe
Rien n'a changé depuis l'époque Rosa Pax
Refrain",Black Machine,2009
A-P,"Eh Ouais gros ...
C'est Mon Dernier Souffle
Toujours les mêmes qui souffrent
Aujourd’hui, c'est peut-être la dernière bougie que j'souffle couse
Crois pas que j'me la coule douce
Comme tous parfois j'ai des coups de blues
Le plus, souvent j'suis seul à tourner en rond
Crois que j'tire la gueule si j'dis pas un mot
Les traits sur mon visage en disent long
J'ai pris 3 fois mon âge en 10 ans ... de carrière
... de barrières pour tout te dire
J'ai pris sur moi sans regarder derrière
Y’a temps de choses que j'aurais voulu dire ...
Tant de choses que j'aurais aimé faire
C'est p’t’être mon dernier jour que faire ?
Ai-je vraiment rempli ma tâche sur cette terre ...
C'est p’têtre mon dernier souffle, qui sait, mon dernier disque ?
Des fois j’pense à tirer un trait sur la musique
La vie ne tient qu'à un fil, c’est pas un film
Dans nos villes, tu peux vite devenir infirme
Mon succès, j'le dois aux jeunes des quartier difficiles, sensibles... pris pour cible
Sache que dans la vie, tu n'es pas invincible
J’t’avoue que parfois j’suis impulsif,
Envie de mettre une croix sur cette fumée nocive,
Va dans le droit chemin, oublie l'illicite,
Apprends à me connaitre avant de me parler de ton vécu,
J'aime les gens simples humbles,
J’m’en fous de ton p…. cul
Moi c'est la sagesse que j'ai vécue
Même si j'ai commis du mal dans la banlieue sud
J'pousse un dernier cri, qui sait, un dernier souffle pour mes frères sous écrous,
Que la justice étouffe, j'suis pas là à te faire la morale
C'est juste mon coeur qui souffre,
T'es étonné que j'l’ouvre ?
Hé bien, sois choqué, n'écoute pas les gens,
Moi j'ai pas changé, tu m’achètes pas,
Y’a que les P*** qui se font payer,
J'ai eu le temps d'faire du tri dan mon répertoire,
Une pensée aux absents, si tu te demandes pourquoi on ne joue pas les stars,
C'est parce qu'on sait qu'on partira tôt ou tard,
J’construis une famille dans ma tête,
C'est un rêve de gosse, faut pas que j'regrette,
Même si j'ai déjà fait un tour du globe,
J'suis d’cette espèce qui fait peur à la Nation,
Le cul entre 2 générations,
L'époque de l'héroïne et des jeunes qui tirent sur les keufs au pe-pom,
Tous les enfants d'ouvriers, tous les enfants de maçons,
On est loin d'avoir retenu la leçon,
Pour information, on est dans le feu de l'action,
J'te parle même pas des 8-12 ans en centre de formation
Qui voient leurs grands frères pousser la fonte, conduire à fond,
J’suis ni dans le bling-bling, ni matérialiste,
113 est dans mon coeur, j'suis tatoué à vif,
L'être humain est trop hypocrite, et sa matrice,
J’'aime les gens qu'ont leur propre avis, pas celui d'un journaliste,
Cet album, c'est quelques lignes de ma vie,
Fallait que j’le fasse, fallait que j’me jette dans le vide,
N’oublies jamais que j’viens du hall 13 Camille Groult,
J’sais d'où j’viens, même en prenant de l’âge,
J'ai toujours les crocs, un sourire d'escroc,
Toujours le dernier mot,
J’suis rancunier, normal j'mâche pas mes mots,
C'est mon dernier souffle
Pour m’arrêter, la vérité, faut m'ELIMINER",Dernier Souffle/Le Son des Reurtis,2009
A-P,"J'suis pas à un disque près
C'est pour les raids dans les bistros
Actif dans l'illégal faut pas qu'jen dise trop
Fait tourner la guitare disto
Si j'vendais d'la came
Mon premier bolosse serait Ardisson gros
J'suis discret j'parle peu
C'est rare que j'me mélange les joints
J'les refuse si j'vois pas frère
C'que tu mélanges
J'm’en bas les couilles d'vos clashs,
d'avoir la place du challenger
J'ai juste un message à passer
aux petits frères et soeurs et aux charbonneurs
C'est une question d'honneur
Issue du Val 2 meurtre
J'ai des principes et des codes que j'ai appris tout jeune
J'arrive scred pour vous rentrer dedans
Je sais très bien et tu le sais combien m'attendent au tournant
J'suis discret mais j'suis venu marquer les traîtres au fer chaud
Ça me chauffe chauffe j'ai la boite crânienne qui surchauffe
Laisse moi décompresser allumer mon bédo
J'suis discret, paro, la bise fais-la à d’autres
Refrain :
AP
A la base moi j'suis pour la Paix
Frenesik à part voler, moi j'sais que rapper
Que dieu m'en préserve mais si j'pars en guerre
Je vais pas t'érafler je vais pas te louper
AP
X2

Discret, prendre des préssoces vados locos kassos for ever
Quelques bastos dans l'fusil mitrailleur
Sur écoute et filoche pourtant discret
Plus cramé que toi vaut mieux pour toi
M'fais pas la bise reste discret
X2

Si t'es comme moi discret
Passe les fouilles, une arme dans la foule
Y'a trop d'gars mystiques ici qui me cassent les couilles
On passe les portiques sans avoir la gueule à Rocancourt
Regarde par la fenêtre tu peux nous croiser en bas d'ta tour
J'suis discret, j'bosse en sous marin H-24 en virée nocturne
J'suis trop attaché au terrain
J'rode tard la nuit, comme la Mondéo police
Insomniaque il me faut une boite 6 en cas de poursuite, gros

Tu me diras pourquoi avoir attendu autant de temps
Moi j'te répondrais la famille, la santé d'abord
Tiens ta langue de pute dans la rue, quand tu m'abordes
Ça fait 10 ans qu'on est là, qu'on a pas changé de bord
On a troqué nos choupettes, nos compets contre un gamos
Amigos on est tous beaux gosses, c'est mon album
Toujours les mêmes frayeurs, les même frelons à bord
C'est le ghetto d'abord, on a l'mord

A-P,"C'est ici que transitent les substances fortes !
On casse les portes
Pour les frères ramène la force,
On tient la corde !
Déchaine les foules comme à ""Old trafford"" !
Tout va si vite,
Je suis sur le pacifique, sur un hors-bord !
Imagine-toi tes enfants dans les mains de l'arche de Zoé !
Au volant d'un bolide entrain de zoner !
Je parle au bas mot, qu'est-ce tu ferais à la place d'Obama !
Quand les gens veulent ta peau, sont près à te mettre une rafale !
Voir ce p’tit en pays instable,
Faire ces premiers pas en temps de guerre, en terre afghane !
Je voudrais de voir avec des millions d'euros,
Serais-tu serein ou ferais-tu des heureux ?
Imagine-toi à ma place,
J'essaie toujours d'innover même si j'ai plus rien a prouvé !
Imagine- toi à 20 ans,
Avoir le même talent que Messi !
T'est loin de te douter que mon album sera un missile !
On s'imagine plein de choses dans les moments perdu !
On s'évade de peur de se faire attraper par la rue !
On préfère être au soleil qu'être à l'ombre !
Combien en fermant leurs yeux de leur hall font le tour du monde !
C'est ici que transite le canna,
Vous voulez la gloire,
Gardez la je pars à Marbella !
Déchaine les foules comme au Maracana,
J'ai une formation de para
Je suis opé un truc de malade,
Je me fous malade à cause du pilon !
Je me barre à Sao paulo!
Déchaine les foules comme à San Siro
Je me vois autre part que derrière les barreaux !
Ouaiis grooos loin des girooos !
Imagine-toi au pouvoir,
Avoir les clés d’l’Elysées,
De Sénat de place Beauvau et d’l’Assemblée,
Parfois, j’pense à longer sur mon canapé,
Le jour où j’ai pris mes crocs, ma vie a dérapé
Imagine ta soeur s’manger un coup d’tazer,
Black en blaser s’faire recaler en boîte arabe et noir
Dans les affaires, s’il y a un point rouge sur ton costard
C’est pas les p’tits qui joue au laser
Imagine-toi en pleine foule l’dess ( ??)
Pour une boulette de shitt
Dès que les keufs retournent ta caisse
L’histoire s’finit les deux genoux à terre
Ca sent la garda, des heures de galères
On s’imagine avec des millions de sacs Louis Vuitton
Des hôtels de luxe sur les pages de Santo Domingo
Combien ont se défaut de penser à la place des autres ?
Comme Cavalli, j’imagine à Bali sur son yacht ou en lambeau
A fond sur la route de la côte,
J’veux un accueil comme en Jamaïque,
Comme Hussein Bolt
