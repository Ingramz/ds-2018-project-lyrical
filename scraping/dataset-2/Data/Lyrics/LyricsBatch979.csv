Sarah Brightman,"As sweet Polly Oliver lay musing in bed,
A sudden strange fancy came into her head.
""Nor father nor mother shall make me false prove,
I'll 'list as a soldier, and follow my love.""

So early next morning she softly arose,
And dressed herself up in her dead brother's clothes.
She cut her hair close, and she stained her face brown,
And went for a soldier to fair London Town.

Then up spoke the sergeant one day at his drill,
""Now who's good for nursing? A captain, he's ill.""
""I'm ready,"" said Polly. To nurse him she's gone,
And finds it's her true love all wasted and wan.

The first week the docter kept shaking his head,
""No nursing, young fellow, can save him,"" he said.
But when Pooly Oliver had nursed him back to life
He cried, ""You have cherished him as if you were his wife"".

O then Polly Oliver, whe burst into tears
And told the good doctor her hopes and her fears,
And very shortly after, for better or for worse,
The captain took joyfully his pretty soldier nurse.","Sweet Polly Oliver, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. III)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"There's none to soothe my soul to rest,
There's none my load of grief to share
Or wake to joy this lonely breast,
Or light the gloom of dark despair.

The voice of joy no more can cheer,
The look of love no more can warm
Since mute for aye's that voice so dear,
And closed that eye alone could charm.","There's none to soothe, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. III)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"The trees they grow so high and the leaves they do grow green,
And many a cold winter's night my love and I have seen.
Of a cold winter's night, my love, you and I alone have been,
Whilst my bonny boy is young, he's a-gowing.
Growing, growing,
Whilst my bonny boy is young, he's a-gowing.

O father, dearest father, you've done to me great wrong,
You've tied me to a boy when you know he is too young.
O daughter, dearest daughter, if you wait a little while,
A lady you shall be while he's growing.
Growing, growing,
A lady you shall be while he's growing.

I'll send your love to college all for a year or two
And then in the meantime he will do for you; 
I'll buy him white ribbons, tie them round his bonney waist
To let the ladies know that he's married.
Married, married,
To let the ladies know that he's married.

I went up to the college and I looked over the wall,
Saw four and twenty gentlemen playing at bat and ball.
I called to my true love, but they would not let hime come,
All because he was a young boy and growing.
Growing, growing,
All because he was a young boy and growing.

At the age of sixteen, he was a married man
And at the age of seventeen he was a father to a son,
And at the age of eighteen the grass grew over him,
Cruel death soon put an end to his growing.
Growing, growing,
Cruel death soon put an end to his growing.

And now my love is dead and in his grave doth lie,
The green grass grows o'er him so very, very high.
I'll sit and I'll mourn his fate until the day I die,
And I'll watch o'er his child while he's growing.
Growing, growing,
And I'll watch o'er his child while he's growing.","The trees they grow so high, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. I)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"Voici le printemps qui passe
""Bonjour, tisserand, bonjour!
Ami, cède-moi ta place,
J'en ai besoin pour un jour.
C'est moi qui fais la toilette
Des bois, des près et des fleurs.
Donne vite ta navette,
Tu sais qu'on m'attend ailleurs.""

Voici le printemps qui passe
""Bonjour, mon peintre, bonjour!
Ta main s'obstine et se lasse,
À faire un semblant du jour.
Donne vite ta palette
Ta palette et ton pinceau.
Tu vas voir le ciel en fate
Rajeunir dans mon tableau.""

Voici le printemps qui passe
""Bonjour, fillettes, bonjour!
Donnez vos fuseaux, de grâce,
Que je travaille à mon tour.
J'ai promis sous les charmilles
Ma laine aux nids d'alentour.
Je vous dirai, jeunes filles,
Où se niche aussi l'amour.""","Voici le printemps, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. II)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"The water is wide, I cannot get o'er,
And neither have I wings to fly.
Give me a boat that will carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.

O, down in the meadows the other day,
A-gath'ring flowers both fine and gay,
A-gath'ring flowers both red and blue,
I little thought what love can do.

I leaned my back against some oak
Thinking that he was a trusty tree;
But first he bended, and then he broke,
And so did my false love to me.

A ship there is, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in;
I know not if I sink or swim.

O, love is handsome and love is fine,
And love's a jewel while it is new,
But when it is old, it groweth cold,
And fades away like morning dew","O Waly, Waly, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. III)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you

Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you

Say you'll love me every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe, no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you

All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you, always beside me
To hold me and to hide me

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you want me with you, here beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
That's all I ask of you.

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning
Say you love me 
You know I do
 
Love me, that's all I ask of you 

Love me, that's all I ask of you",All I Ask of You [From Phantom of the Opera],1989

Sarah Brightman,"Away from you
There is no music,
There is no sunlight,
The world is gray.
Away from you
The clocks are frozen,
And time's a traveler
Who's lost his way.

The people I meet
Might as well be statues,
The words we exchange
Might as well be Greek.
The room that I'm in
May be bright and cheerful
But to me
It's dim and bleak.

I'm half alive
Until the moment
The door swings open
And you walk through.
Now my world starts to glow
Like a stained-glass window
And what was old and cold
Is warm and new.
And so you see
Why I can never be
Away from you.

Away from you
The world is lifeless
As though creation
Has gone awry.
The trees are bare,
There are no flowers,
The fields are thirsty,
The streams are dry.

We live, you and I,
For a breath of sunlight,
So brief an escape
From a world of gray.
Our moments of warmth
Have been touch and go, love,
But tonight, we'll touch
And stay.

The people I meet
Might as well be statues,
The words we exchange
Might as well be Greek.
The room that I'm in
May be bright and cheerful
But to me
It's dim and bleak.

I'm half alive
Until the moment
The door swings open
And you walk through.
Now my soul is afloat
On a wave of music
That I could feel such joy
I never knew.
And so you see
Why I can never be
Away from you.",Away From You,1989
Sarah Brightman,"Dreamers have mountains they will climb
There are dreamers who don't believe in time
Only dreamers have worlds where they can fly far away.

Certain dreamers have kingdoms they will build,
Filled with treasures and dragons to be killed
Only dreamers have wings with which to fly far away.

Some people dream of being rich,
While others dream of being tall
And there are people who don't dream at all.

Dreamers have shooting stars they chase,
There are others with nightmares they must face.
Sometimes dreamers are forced to leave their dreams far away.

And there are people who don't dream at all.

Sometimes you need to take the time
To find treasures and mountains we can climb.
And maybe we dream to change the way that we feel,
'Cause to dreamers the real world can be unreal.",Dreamers,1989
Sarah Brightman,"Half a moment 
We are together 
I shall want no-one else 
And nothing new. 
Half a moment 
I shall treasure, 
Keep it locked away 
For some future rainy day. 

Should you leave me 
With just this moment 
In my mind 
I shall capture it anew, 
Like some picture 
Taken in my childhood 
Half a moment 
Spent with you. 

Half a moment

Should you leave me 
With just this moment 
In my mind 
I shall capture it anew, 
Like some picture 
Taken in my childhood 
Half a moment 
Spent with you. 

Countless vivid memories 
Spin before my view, 
Like some toy kaleidoscope 
Images of you. 

Time looks kindly 
On fleeting lovers 
They can turn the briefest hour 
Into a day 
Turn a moment 
To a lifetime 
Making it to last 
Blending future with the past. 

We're together, 
What else can matter? 
Even though 
Half a moment is too few 
I shall save it 
'Til I have another 
Making one whole moment 
Filled with you.",Half a Moment,1989
Sarah Brightman,"I am going to like it here.
There is something about the place,
An encouraging atmosphere,
Like the smile on a friendly face.

There is something about the place,
So caressing and warm it is, 
Like the smile on a friendly face,
Like a port in the storm it is.
So caressing and warm it is, 
All the people are so sincere,
Like a port in the storm it is,
I am going to like it here.

All the people are so sincere, 
There's especially one I like.
I am going to like it here,
It's the father's first son I like.
There's especially one I like,
There is something about his face.

There is something about his face,
I would follow him anywhere.
If he goes to another place 
I am going to like it there.

Sarah Brightman,"I remember sky
It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky.

I remember snow
Soft as feathers
Sharp as thumb tacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint
When the wind would blow.

And ice like vinyl
On the streets
Cold as silver
White as sheets
Rain like strings
And changing things
Like leaves.

I remember leaves
Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper.
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas.

And parks and bridges,
Ponds and zoos,
Ruddy faces,
Muddy shoes,
Light and noise and
Bees and boys
And days.

I remember days,
Or at least I try.
But as years go by
They're sort of haze,
And the bluest ink
Isn't really sky
And at times I think
I would gladly die
For a day of sky.",I Remember,1989
Sarah Brightman,"If I ever fall in love again,
It'll be with someone just like you.
I don't say that I'm in love again
But on the day you came my way, I knew.

If I ever fall in love again,
This is just the way it ought to be,
But if it's really love again,
I'll leave to fate, I'd rather wait and see.

How can I know
When my head is saying no
And my heart's telling me that it's real?
Can it be wrong
If I burst into song
At the wonder of feeling the way
That I suddenly feel?

If I ever fall in love again
I shall know exactly what to do.
And when I fall in love again
I know it must be someone just like you.

The way that I suddenly feel!

If I ever fall in love again
I shall know exactly what to do.
And when I fall in love again
I know it must be someone just like you.",If I Ever Fall in Love Again,1989
Sarah Brightman,"Fate may often treat me meanly
But I keenly pursue
A little mirage in the blue,
Determination helps me through.

Though I never really grumble,
Life's a jumble indeed
And in my efforts to succeed
I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can
In crying when I must
In laughing when I choose
Hey ho, if love were all
I should be lonely.

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose.
Although when shadows fall
I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me
Someone affectionate and dear
Cares would be ended if I knew that he
Wanted to have me near.

But I believe that since my life began
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse.
Hey ho, if love were all.

Sarah Brightman,"I love my wife and I love her more
Than the way I used to love her before
She became my wife, but today she is
So don't call me early 'cause I'll be busy,
Beside her waiting for her to wake
And her eyes to open like dawn is breaking
The whole world over for me today,
'Cause I can't believe that I heard her say
She would honor, love and obey 'til death do us

When I knew my wife was the wife for me

Oh, how you pleaded

Sarah Brightman,"When I was a girl, I had a favourite story
Of the meadowlark who lived where the rivers wind
Her voice could match the angels' in its glory,
But she was blind,
The lark was blind.

An old king came and took her to his palace,
Where the walls were burnished bronze and golden braid,
And he fed her fruit and nuts from an ivory chalice and he prayed

""Sing for me, my meadowlark
Sing for me of the silver morning.
Set me free, my meadowlark
And I'll buy you a priceless jewel,
And cloth of brocade and crewel,
And I'll love you for life if you will
Sing for me.""

Than one day as the lark sang by the water
The god of the sun heard her in his flight
And her singing moved him so, he came and brought her
The gift of sight,
He gave her sight.
And she opened her eyes to the shimmer and the splendor
Of this beautiful young god, so proud and strong
And he called to the lark in a voice both rough and tender,
""Come along,

Fly with me, my meadowlark,
Fly with me on the silver morning.
Past the sea where the dolphins bark,
We will dance on the coral beaches,
Make a feast of the plums and peaches,
Just as far as your vision reaches,
Fly with me.""

But the meadowlark said no,
For the old king loved her so,
She couldn't bear to wound his pride.
So the sun god flew away and when the king came down that day,
He found his meadowlark had died.
Every time I heard that part I cried.

And now I stand here, starry-eyed and stormy.
Oh, just when I thought my heart was finally numb,
A beautiful young man appears before me
Singing ""Come
Oh, won't you come?""
And what can I do if finally for the first time
The one I'm burning for returns the glow?
If love has come at last it's picked the worst time
Still I know
I've got to go.

Fly away, meadowlark.
Fly away in the silver morning.
If I stay, I'll grow to curse the dark,
So it's off where the days won't bind me.
I know I leave wounds behind me,
But I won't let tomorrow find me
Back this way.

Before my past once again can blind me,
Fly away.

And we won't wait to say goodbye,
My beautiful young man and I.",Meadowlark,1989
Sarah Brightman,"Playing on his slide-trombone
In a certain monotone
He was known as Mr. Monotony.

What my poor lips can never tell
Of all the beauty God has sent my way

A rose, a ship, a book, a bird in flight,

Sarah Brightman,"Anything but lonely 
Anything but empty rooms
There's so much in life to share
What's the sense when no one else is there? 

Anything but lonely 
Anything but only me
Quiet years in too much space
That's the thing that's hard to face 
And

You have a right to go 
But you should also know
That I won't be alone for long
Long days with nothing said 
Are not what lie ahead
I'm sorry, but I'm not that strong


Anything but lonely 
Anything but passing time
Lonely's what I'll never be
While there's still some life in me 
And


I'm still young, don't forget 
It isn't over yet
So many hearts for me to thrill

How good I look each day
I'll have to find someone who will

Sarah Brightman,"Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh
Don't you know
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine
And we want you to sleep well tonight
Let the world turn without you tonight
If we try, we'll get by, so forget all about us tonight

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you, and anoint you
Myrrh for your hot forehead, oh
Then you'll feel
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine
And it's cool, and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes, close your eyes
And relax, think of nothing tonight

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes

Woman, your fine ointment, brand new and expensive
Could have been saved for the poor
Why has it been wasted? We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more
People who are hungry, people who are starving
They matter more than your feet and hair!

Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh

And we want you to sleep well tonight
Let the world turn without you tonight
If we try, we'll get by, so forget all about us tonight

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes

Surely you're not saying we have the resources
To save the poor from their lot?
There will be poor always, pathetically struggling
Look at the good things you've got
Think while you still have me!
Move while you still see me!
You'll be lost, you'll be so, so sorry when I'm gone

Sarah Brightman,"Past the point of no return, no backward glances
The games of make believe are at an end
Past all thought of if or when, no use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend

What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction lies before us?

Past the point of no return, the final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets will we learn?
Beyond the point of no return

You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence, silence

I have come here, hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining defenseless and silent
And now I am here with you
No second thoughts, I've decided, decided

Past the point of no return, no going back now
Our passion play has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong, one final question
How long should we two wait, before we're one?

When will the blood begin to race?
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames at last consume us?

Past the point of no return, the final threshold
The bridge is crossed, so stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you want me with you here beside you

Anywhere you go let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of

What is it? What has happened?
Ubaldo! Oh my God! My God!
We're ruined Andre, ruined!
Monsieur le Vicomte!
Come with me!
Oh my darling, my darling!
Who has done this to you?
You! Why did you let this happen?

Monsieur le Vicomte
I know where they are
But can I trust you?
You must, but remember
Your hand at the level of your eyes!
But why, why?
The Punjab lasso, Monsieur
First Buquet, now Piangi

Like this, Monsieur I'll come with you
No, Meg! No, you stay here!
Come with me, Monsieur
Hurry, or we shall be too late!",The Point of No Return,1993
Sarah Brightman,"You were once
My one companion
You were all
That mattered
You were once
A friend and father
Then my world
Was shattered

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Wishing you were
Somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed
Somehow you would
Be here

Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could

Passing bells
And sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye
Try to forgive
Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try

No more memories
No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye",Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,1993
Sarah Brightman,"I look in your eyes
And I see a little bit of heaven in view
I face your disguise and
I See you running too

In memory of you

By now it's loving and affection

We've run afloat
I heard the captain cry
Explore the ship
Replace the cook
Let no one leave alive
Across the straits
Around the horn
How far can sailors fly
A twisted path
Our tortured course
And no one left alive

We sailed for parts
Unknown to man
Where ships come home to die
No lofty peak
Nor fortress hold
Could match our captain's eye

Upon the seventh sea sick day
We made our port of call
A sand so white
And seas so blue
No mortal place at all

And burned the mast
And rowed from ship to shore

To reach heaven we'll drown our sorrows

Tell me why

Of love is to live

Break the chains and try to forgive me now
For the fortune on the wings of an eagle
And our hearts lie in the hands of an angel

Draw back in fear

Sarah Brightman,"Gus is the cat at the theatre door
His name, as I ought to have told you before
Is really Asparagus, but that's a fuss to pronounce
That we usually call him just Gus
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake
For he was in his youth quite the smartest of cats
But no longer a terror to mice or to rats

For he isn't the cat that he was in his prime
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in his time
And whenever he joins his friends at their club
(Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)
He loves to regale them, if someone else pays
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days
For he once was a star of the highest degree
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree
And he likes to relate his success on the halls
Where the gallery once gave him seven cat calls
But his grandest creation as he loves to tell
Was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell


Sir John 
I have played in my time every possible part
And I used to know seventy speeches by heart
I'd extemporize backchat, I knew how to gag
And I knew how to let the cat out of the bag
I knew how to act with my back and my tail
With an hour of rehearsal, I never could fail
I'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts
Whether I took the lead, or in character parts
I have sat by the bedside of poor little Nell
When the curfew was rung then I swung on the bell
In the pantomime season, I never fell flat
And I once understudied Dick Whittington's cat
But my grandest creation, as history will tell
was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

Sarah 
Then, if someone will give him a toothful of gin
He will tell how he once played a part in East Lynne
At a Shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
When some actor suggested the need for a cat

Sir John 
And I say now these kittens, they do not get trained
As we did in the days when Victoria reigned
They never get drilled in a regular troupe
And they think they are smart just to jump through a hoop

Sarah 
And he says as he scratches himself with his claws

Sir John 
Well the theatre is certainly not what is was
These modern productions are all very well
But there's nothing to equal from what I hear tell
That moment of mystery when I made history
As Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

Piano senza fare rumore
Gira il mondo le ore
Quanta fretta che ha
Un ricordo domani
Questa notte sar
Sempre qui poi torner

Nasce il sole
Che cosi
Ci trover abbracciati
La sua mano
Sulla porta piano
Spalanca il cielo al mattino

Giorno mentre arrival l'inverno
Un fedele ritorno
La sua neve cadr
E la notte pi' chiara
Questa sera sar
Quando il puio scender

Nasce il sole
Che cosi
Ci trover abbracciati
La sua mano
Sulla porta piano
Spalanca il cielo al mattino

Forte e lo voglio gridare
Questo amore pi' forte
Questa notte sar
Quante volte
Nel letto si svegliato con me
Questo amore per te",Piano [Italian Version],1998

White flags fly tonight
You are out of danger now
Battle field is still
Wild poppies on the hill
Peace can only come when you surrender
Here the tracers fly
Lighting up the sky
But I'll fight unto the end
Let them send their armies
I will never bend
I won't see you now till I surrender
I'll see you again when I surrender

Sarah Brightman,"There is more to love,
So much more,
Than simply making love --
That's easy.

Pretty eyes,
Which could be any eyes --
That's crazy.

A face is just a face ...
They come and go --
They're easy to replace ...

There is more to love,
So much more,
Than moon-struck escapades --
That's nothing.

There is peace of mind,
So much peace,
In quiet company --
That's something.

Everyone but him
Seems wrong for me ...
Every time I feel
There has to be
More ...

If I could hear
The music I heard then,
I'd never let
It fade away again ...

You were once

was shattered . . .

wishing you were
somehow near . . .
Sometimes it seemed

somehow you would
be here . . .
Wishing I could
hear your voice again . . .
knowing that I
never would . . .
Dreaming of you
won't help me to do
all that you dreamed
I could . . .

and sculpted angels,
cold and monumental,
seem, for you,
the wrong companions -
you were warm and gentle . . .
Too many years
fighting back tears . . .
Why can't the past
just die . . .?
Wishing you were
somehow here again . . .

say goodbye . . .

No more gazing across
the wasted years . . .

Never fool myself that my dreams will come true

So what happens now?

Where am I going to?
       You'll get by, you always have before
Where am I going to?


Time and time again I've said that I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom, that I'm hard through and through
But every time it matters all my words desert me

Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you?

I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom, 
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world,
It was all I desired

They're all illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answers were here all the time
I love you, and hope you love me

Sarah Brightman,"Sarah 
Gus is the cat at the theatre door
His name, as I ought to have told you before
Is really Asparagus, but that's a fuss to pronounce

That we usually call him just Gus
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake
For he was in his youth quite the smartest of cats
But no longer a terror to mice or to rats

For he isn't the cat that he was in his prime
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in his time
And whenever he joins his friends at their club
(Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)

He loves to regale them, if someone else pays
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days
For he once was a star of the highest degree
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree

And he likes to relate his success on the halls
Where the gallery once gave him seven cat calls
But his grandest creation as he loves to tell
Was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell


Sir John 
I have played in my time every possible part
And I used to know seventy speeches by heart
I'd extemporize backchat, I knew how to gag

And I knew how to let the cat out of the bag
I knew how to act with my back and my tail
With an hour of rehearsal, I never could fail
I'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts

Whether I took the lead, or in character parts
I have sat by the bedside of poor little Nell
When the curfew was rung then I swung on the bell
In the pantomime season, I never fell flat

And I once understudied Dick Whittington's cat
But my grandest creation, as history will tell
was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell

Sarah 
Then, if someone will give him a toothful of gin
He will tell how he once played a part in East Lynne
At a Shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
When some actor suggested the need for a cat

Sir John 
And I say now these kittens, they do not get trained
As we did in the days when Victoria reigned
They never get drilled in a regular troupe
And they think they are smart just to jump through a hoop

Sarah 
And he says as he scratches himself with his claws

Sir John 
Well the theatre is certainly not what is was
These modern productions are all very well
But there's nothing to equal from what I hear tell
That moment of mystery when I made history
As Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell",Gus: The Theatre Cat,1998
Sarah Brightman,"Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the hidden paw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when you reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!
You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air
But I tell you once and once again Macavity's not there!

Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunked in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered then Macavity's not there!

He's outwardly respectable, I know he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted or the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing Macavity's not there!

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place Macavity's not there!

And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations: the Napolean of crime!

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity

Sarah Brightman,"Midnight, not a sound on the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet, and the wind begins to moan.

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember a time I knew what happiness was

Let the memory live again
Every streetlamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters in the streetlamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too

And a new day will begin another day is dawning
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Burnt out ends of smokey days

The streetlamp dies

Of my days in the sun

Look a new day has begun",Memory,1998
Sarah Brightman,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly posses you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind 
In this darkness that you know you cannot find
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start to journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in 
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",The Music of the Night,1998

Sarah Brightman,"Tonto el que no entienda.
Cuenta una leyenda
Que una hembra gitana
Conjuró a la luna
Hasta el amanecer.
Llorando pedía
Al llegar el día
Desposar un calé.

""Tendrás a tu hombre,
Piel morena,""
Desde el cielo, habló la luna llena.
""Pero a cambio quiero
El hijo primero que le engendres a él.
Que quien su hijo inmola
Para no estar sola, poco le iba a querer.""

Y no encuentras querer
Que te haga mujer.
Dime, luna de plata,
Qué pretendes hacer
Con un niño de piel.
A ha, a-ha
Hijo de la luna.

De padre canela
Nació un niño
Blanco como el lomo
De un armiño,
Con los ojos grises
En vez de aceituna 
Niño albino de luna.
""¡Maldita su estampa!
Este hijo es de un payo
Y yo no me lo callo.""

Estribillo

Gitano al creerse deshonrado,
Se fue a su mujer,
Cuchillo en mano.
""¿De quien es el hijo?
Me has engañado fijo.""
Y de muerte la hirió.
Luego se hizo al monte
Con el niño en brazos
Y allí le abandono.

Estribillo

Y en las noches
Que haya luna llena
Será porque el niño
Esté de buenas.
Y si el niño llora
Menguará la luna
Para hacerle una cuna.

Menguará la luna
Para hacerle una cuna.",Hijo de La Luna,2000

There is no music,
There is no sunlight,
The world is gray.
Away from you
The clocks are frozen,
And time's a traveller
Who's lost his way.

Might as well be statues,
The words we exchange
Might as well be Greek.
The room that I'm in
May be bright and cheerful
But to me
It's dim and bleak.


I'm half alive
Until the moment
The door swings open
And you walk through.
Now my world starts to glow
Like a stained-glass window
And what was old and cold
Is warm and new.
And so you see
Why I can never be
Away from you.


Away from you
The world is lifeless
As though creation
Has gone awry.
The trees are bare,
There are no flowers,
The fields are thirsty,
The streams are dry.


We live, you and I,
For a breath of sunlight,
So brief an escape
From a world of gray.
Our moments of warmth
Have been touch and go, love,
But tonight, we'll touch
And stay.

Might as well be statues,
The words we exchange

On a wave of music

I never knew.

Why I can never be

We are together 
I shall want no-one else

With just this moment 
In my mind 
I shall capture it anew, 
Like some picture 
Taken in my childhood 
Half a moment 
Spent with you.

Spin before my view, 
Like some toy kaleidoscope 
Images of you.

On fleeting lovers 
They can turn the briefest hour 
Into a day 
Turn a moment 
To a lifetime 
Making it to last 
Blending future with the past. 


We're together, 
What else can matter? 
Even though 
Half a moment is too few 
I shall save it 
'Til I have another 
Making one whole moment 
Filled with you.

The little buttercup in the orchid garden.

And kiss the orchids dearly,

In the mandarin's orchid garden.

Sarah Brightman,"Love, love changes everything: hands and faces, earth and sky.
Love, love changes everything: how you live and how you die.
Love can make the summer fly, or a night seem like a lifetime.
Yes, love, love changes everything, now I tremble at your name.
Nothing in the world will ever be the same.

Love, love changes everything: days are longer, words mean more.
Love, love changes everything: pain is deeper than before.
Love will turn your world around, and that world will last forever.
Yes, love, love changes everything, brings you glory, brings you shame.
Nothing in the world will ever be the same.


Off into the world we go, planning futures, shaping years.
Love bursts in and suddenly all our wisdom disappears.
Love makes fools of everyone: all the rules we make are broken.
Yes, love, love changes everything: live or perish, in its flame.
Love will never ever let you be the same.
Love will never ever let you be the same.",Aspects of Love [From Love Changes Everything] [From Aspects of Love],2002
Sarah Brightman,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines-
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seems to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that every word is true

Could still my beating heart

So
Should I return to trace the shadows of my chases
My steps will echo there from sand to stone
I will never let my eyelids close on empty spaces
My dreams will fill the void with tales unknown
Know the mighty infinite obscures the far horizon
The whispered road I take will never bend
Alone
And will the wind return my story to its promise
Or will my story chase me to my end

Faces de muros antigos
Pedras que a gente desvia
Como a vida foi bela e rica, com tanto amor como prêmio
Antes que o tempo o estragasse

Eu me curei de você, eu me curei de você
Quase não tenho mais dor
Eu me curei de você, eu me curei de você
Somente um pouco de frio
Mais me curar de que? Me curar de que?
Se amor é indiferente para mim?
Quase não tenho mais dor, apenas um pouco de frio
Lá

Invejo a garota que dorme nos braços que me tiveram
Seu coração bate tanto quanto o meu quando ele batia?
As palavras que você diz bem baixinho, eu tinha razão de acreditar também?

Antes que o tempo tivesse me traído
Eu me curei de você, eu me curei de você
Quase não tenho mais dor

In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure a year in the life

How about love? How about love?
How about love? Measure in love
Seasons of love, seasons of love

Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure the life of a women or a man?

In truths that she learned or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned or the way that she died
It's time now to sing out tho' the story never ends
Let's celebrate remember a year in the life of friends

Remember the love, remember the love
Remember the love, measure in love
Measure, measure your life in love
Seasons of love, seasons of love

Slushy, humid and gritty,
What a pretty town.

More depressing, less gay.

Is grey.

The lack of sun on a one-way street,

An inch of sky and a fly or two.
Why, I can see half a tree.

It simply can't be excused.
In winter even the falling snow looks
Used.

But I see you, so the view is bright.
If I can love you, I'll pay the dirt no heed!
With your love, what more do I need?

Someone starting a brawl,
Down the block there's a riot,
And I'll buy it all!

Listen, now I'm ecstatic,
Hold me close and be still.
Hear the lovely pneumatic
Drill!

A subway train thunders through the Bronx,
A taxi horn on the corner honks.
But I adore ev'ry roar.
And what more do I need?

I hear a crane making street repairs,
A two-ton child running wild upstairs.
Steam pipes bang,sirens clang,
And what more do I need?

The neighbours yell in the summer,
The landlord yells in the fall,
So loud I can't hear the plumber
Pound the wall.

An aeroplane roars across the bay,
But I can hear you as clear as day:
You said you love me
Above the sound and speed.

You were my fool for love
Sent me from high above
You were the one
I will be with you
I'm going where the wind blows
Going where the lost ones go

Leave and let me go
Don't look back, just let me know
Carry on, carry on
You must stay strong

Nothing ever looks the same in the light
Nothing ever seems to quite turn out right
When you realize that you have been loved
Than you will never be alone
I'm going where the wind blows
Going where the lost ones go

Baby I can't come along

Sarah Brightman,"I will see you in a week or two
It's late, you better get going. 
Take care of yourself and call anytime, 
You feel, that you're missing me! 
I can only say what I always say at these good-byes

Come back with the same look in your eyes!
I know, you've got your work to do 
And I know how much you love me. 
But sometimes a friendly face can look good to you on a lonely night
If there comes a time, just remember, 
I'm the kind that cries 

Come back with the same look in your eyes!
Everything, we want, we find in each other. 
We would be fools to let love slip away. 
Everything's so right, 
I'm scared that we might lose it one day. 
We could never keep things from one another, 
You know all the feelings that are in my heart. 
It's not easy, it's not easy when you have to be apart.

So I'll see you in a week or two
It's late, you better get going. 
You think that by now we know how to handle this 
But we never will. 
When you are away, everyday I pray 
That nothing dies and you'll come back 
With the same look in your eyes.",Come Back With the Same Look in Your Eyes,2007

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home

We've no less days to sing God's praise

They sold me a Silent Night

But his mother only, in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss

If I were a Wise Man
I would do my part
Yet what I can I give him Give my heart",In the Bleak Midwinter,2008

For its coat to turn to green

Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Holiday has hardly begun
Run into a good friend of mine
Sold me her sign,
Reach for the stars

Waiting for the show to begin

Sarah Brightman,"Là dove il mare luccica
E grida forte il vento
C'è vecchia terrazza
Vicino al golfo di Sorrento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
Ed incomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È 'na catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vvene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Penso alla notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia d'un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica
E si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna  uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò piu dolce anche la morte

Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvisso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette d'affogare

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È 'na catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vvene sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro

Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono pensieri

Così diventò tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la bianca scia di un'elica

Ma sì, e la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi, si sentiva già felice
E incominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È 'na catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vvene sai

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai

A volte picchia in testa ma

Soffrire un po', ma almeno io vivo

È un dolore quando parte

Con piacere estremo cresce
(Vivo per lei nel vortice)
Attraverso la mia voce 
Si espande e amore produce

Vivo per lei, nient'altro ho 
E quanti altri incontrerò 
Che come me hanno scritto in viso
Io vivo per lei
Io vivo per lei 
Sopra un palco o contro un muro 
(Vivo per lei al limite)
Anche in un domani duro 
(Vivo per lei al margine)
Ogni giorno 
Una conquista
La protagonista 
Sarà sempre lei

Vivo per lei perchè oramai 
Io non ho altra via d'uscita
Perchè la musica, lo sai 
Davvero non l'ho mai tradita 

Vivo per lei perchè mi dà 
Pause e note in libertà 
Ci fosse un'altra vita la vivo

A married Couple with kids and a family Pet. He takes for granted that it's all good and things are set. But she feels no passion in the romance. It's been a year since they had their last slow dance. Even worse, her husband treats her like an ornament. Every other week the kids have a tournament. A team meeting, or somewhere that they gotta be. But her hearts screamin ""HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?"" Unbeknownst another hounds in the chicken coup. And he's makin moves like a player to the hoop. She met at the gym, or was it at the grocery? It doesn't matter, 'cause you know where it's goin be	! 'Cause last year, her mister got caught cheatin. So she figure that this is gonna make them even. He thought she'd wait, like all the times before. Until he found the note she left for him hangin at the door. It read: (REPEAT CHORUS) She's 16, Callin home to her momma. After to talk 'cause she's scared of all the noise and drama. She's been gone for a week and a half. All she wants is somethin to eat and a nap. 'Cause she's a runaway. Sleepin under bridges and sleepin in alley ways. Afraid to go to the shelter, so at night she prays that hopefully she's gonna see some better days. Meanwhile, Mom and Dad are really frantic. When they saw her clothes were gone you know they really panicked. Thoughts in their minds ""Did she run to the border?"" or even worse, ""Will she be a case of Law and Order?"". The Silence in her room screams of not feelin wanted, of not bein good enough it even seems haunted. All her pain soon will be known. When she leaves her mom and dad a message after the tone. And says: (REPEAT CHORUS) If you really want to know me. I guess you better show me. Is it real or is it phony. Just love me or leave me alone. (CHORUS)",If You Don't Wanna Love Me,2005

A little time on your own
To clear out your mind
Really unwind, and just be alone

Getting too close, too close to the heart

Plenty of space, all the space that you need

Does it make you feel free, make you feel young?
How does it feel not to need anyone?
You say you want space
Well I'll give you space

You need your own bed
You need your own room
Well how 'bout an island?
I bet you could find one
On the dark side of the moon

Then you won't have to deal with anything real
Cause I won't be here, I'll just disappear

Sarah Buxton,"It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame,
It ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she threw out the window,
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring

So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve,
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

Best thing I remember was the young familiar taste of someone on my lips,
It's to late to turn around,
When the shades start coming down,
The guilt you feel's the last thing on your mind

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

A wink of his eye, a shot of delight
We keep it cool and say the other’s alright, but
He moves fast and I almost can’t catch him
We come together in a game of action
It is what it is, like nothing’s amiss
But we both know that this is something we’ll miss

'Cause I know when you go that you’ll come back in my way
And I know when you do that I won’t mind

As if it isn't plain to see that I got all you need
But when it tastes this sweet
'Cause I, I know what you think about me
As if it isn't plain to see we should just let it be
And if it tastes this sweet, then call me out
Then call me out

He’s kinda cold but once he gets you it’s cool
Around here there isn’t much for us to do
But it’s never enough and we try so much
We’re always losing when our time could be up
And when he looks at me it feels like that night
I met him laughing under sodium lights
Called out my name, so do it again
We had no idea just how this would end

I cannot fight the feeling
Somethings changed
I'm lying in my bed
And feel a second heartbeat in my vanes

The sky is more blue than yesterday
The grass is green and high
The sun sends out her warmest rains
To welcome you my child

I feel a love that's so strong and true

Your face is like a mirror of my dreams
I hold you in my arms
And life is just a careless song to me

Your daddy won't be home tonight
He's on a distant road
I sing a little lullaby
I hope he'll soon be home

Every time that I look at you
I feel a love that's so strong and true
And I'm hypnotized
You'll got your daddy's eyes
Every time that I'm feeling blue
I take a long love and look at you
And you look so nice
You'll got your daddy's eyes

Ich seh' dein' Stolz und deine Wut
Dein großes Herz, dein Löwenmut

Und deine Art mich anzusehen
Wie du dein' Kopf zur Seite legst
Immer seh' ich wies mir geht
Du weißt wo immer wir auch sind
Dass ich dein zu Hause bin

Und was das mit mir macht
Wenn du jetzt lachst
Seh' ich

Oh oh

Jeder Punkt in deinem Gesicht
Ist so perfekt, rein zufällig
Es gibt nichts schöneres als dich

Und ich hab das alles so gewollt
Den ganzen Terror und das Gold
Ich habe nie was so gewollt

Wie all deine Farben
Und all deine Narben.

Weißt du noch gar nicht

When I’m feeling sad,
When I’m looking back,
I take out that old blue guitar.

Its got a belt buckle scratch on its back.
Three-year old strings and worn out frets.
Though I have to tune it constantly,
It’s the only place I found a melody.
It’s close to the hollow sound of pure lonely.

Happened so fast, didn’t take long
You stole my heart and then you were gone

So much more than a movie and a dinner

Standing in your sunshine

I wasted a few tears
Threw away a good year

Sarah de Bono,"Living in a perfect world
Where everybody's beautiful
But no one knows who you are
Everyone's a perfect ten
Almost a superstar
How can you compare yourself to them
It seems the way she looks is so plastic
How tragic oh
But there's more to life than what you see
Look in the mirror carefully
In time were gonna get it right

You got the power to be
Anything that you wanna be
Wanna be baby gotta be
If you only look a little deeper
Give yourself room to grow
Oh
Because you're beautiful
Beautiful beautiful
Because your beautiful

People get caught up in fortune and fame
I don't believe that
Were one and the same
Trying to be just like that
Girl in the magazine

You got that power to be
Just anything that you wanna be
Wanna be baby gotta be
If you only look a little deeper
Give yourself room to grow

Cause you got the power to be anything that
Anything that you wanna be yeah
Anything that you wanna be yeah
Look a little deeper
Oh yeah

Sarah Fimm,"Mr. Cripple man, do you still feel your hands?
The light you never fill, she's waiting by the door.
While atoms play around, you sit here to obstruct.
I never thought to think that what goes down does not come up.
We're hostage on the gravity train, just when we move forward we fall back again.
The sharpness of his nail, it hammers down the fold.
In all this time, we're just Running from the Whole.
Enter woman, girl.
Enter to your left, stage right.
The chaos it ensues, beneath the coating of your skin.
Her boa it constricts, the spotlight on a barren soul.
She needn't ask the stars just what it's like to feel star cold.
We're hostage on the gravity train. Just when we move forward we fall back again.
The sharpness of his nail, it hammers down the fold.
In all this time we're just Running from the Whole.
And when I leave again, I'll cycle through this atmosphere.
Past a marching band of souls, who scrape me with their human eyes.
A taste of bitter earth, I'll just bring with me a dollar's worth.
My face burns from the wind and it's time to shed my second skin.
We're hostage on this gravity train. Just when we move forward we fall back again.
The sharpness of his nail, it hammers down the fold.
In all this time we're just Running from the Whole.



",Running from the Whole,2001
Sarah Fimm,"What can you do when the poison in your veins starts to rot? 
Pounding doors? They are whores when yourself is all you've got.
But I still see the green, yes I still see that green,
And it makes me want to scream.
So a break in command starts causing flies, 
But a flowing backward motion brings it back.
This thing in my perception has left us here to bleed, 
And it makes me want to scream.
Rest assured little pigs, You can snort your way into heaven, 
I'll assign the rooms, you just count your sheep.
A little fairy pricked just tonight, 
She said, ""one wish is granted for the girl who hates the world.""
So I gave her all my money in a jar of broken dreams,
I gave her all my screams.
So rest assured you little pigs. All little piggies go to heaven. 
I'll mobilize the souls, you just count your sheep.
Is anyone here listening? Human or undead. 
Is anger just our nourishment? Our piece of daily bread?
Cause it's all a part of feeling of ripping out your weeds, 
And it makes me want toâ?¦.scream.",Scream,2001
Sarah Fimm,"
The sun has set
The ground is cold and wet
And I still haven't left
And time she let us rest
For long enough
But we're growing up
Things are different
You used to listen

Isn't it strange
How can we go on like this?
Flies in the dark
Looking for a spark
But something's gotta give
'Cause if it won't change
How can we go on like this?
How can I live?

It's just a dream
It's just a silhouette
That hasn't happened yet
But the earth is moving fast
And if I'm gone before the dawn
Take all that there was
And make it live

Isn't it strange
How can we go on like this?
Flies in the dark
Looking for a spark
But something's gotta give
Cause if it won't change
How can we go on like this
How can I live?

Cause it's just another moment
I could've played the game
I could've done without this
But I didn't.
So why can't I acknowledge
The more things change
The more they stay the same.

Isn't it strange
How can we go on like this?
Flies in the dark
Looking for a spark
But something's gotta give
Cause if I won't change
How can it go on like this
How can I live?

Now you're gone everything right has turned wrong
My heart is aching how long does it take
For all these scars to heal

After love when all the dreams have flown
Baby, it's hard to be alone making it through each day
After love why do I see your face
How can I ever fill the space you left inside of me


Someone please help me
I've got to find a way to forget
I'm lost without you that's why I haven't stopped crying yet

Every night just when I think I'm alright
Memories of you I can't fight
Like a stream they rush into my head

Deep inside I am crying
I have to let go

The road isn't clear
I don't want you near me no more

And I just can't take it no more

On my own
Although I need you so desperatley
I see the lies in your eyes
There's no where to hide

You're my true love companion
But love isn't here by my side
Don't you hear my heart calling
I'm torn up inside

I've been waiting for a miracle
Looking for the touch of an angel to show
I've been feeling so vulnerable
Playing this game with the devil
Holding my hand

Deep inside I am crying
I have to let go

""I want you to be a father
He's your little boy and you don't even bother
Like ""brother"" without the are
And he's starting to harbor
Cool and food for thought
But for you he's a starver
Starting to use red markers on his work
His teacher say they know he's much smarter
But he's hurt
Used to hand his homework in first
Like he was the classroom starter
Burst to tears
Let them know she see us
Now he's fighting in class
Got a note last week that say he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us
Cause you ain't never pick him up
You see what his problem is?
He don't know where his poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole you've been digging it
Cause you ain't been kicking it
Since he was old enough to hold bottles
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that
He don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart

So he said to him
""I want you to be a father
I'm your little boy and you don't even bother
Like ""brother"" without the are
And I'm starting to harbor
Cool and food for thought
But for you I'm a starver
Starting to use red markers on my work
My teacher say they know I'm much smarter
But I'm hurt
I used to hand my homework in first
Like I was the classroom starter
Burst to tears
Let them know he see us
Now I'm fighting in class
Got a note last week that say I might not pass
Kids ask me if my daddy is sick of us
Cause you ain't never pick me up
You see what my problem is?
That I don't know where my poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole you've been digging it
Cause you ain't been kicking it
Since I was old enough to hold bottles
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that
I don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart
When my momma try to provide and I tell her, ""That ain't your job""
To be a man, she try to make me understand
That she my number one fan
But its like you born from the stands

Yeah, my man said he wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something he could recognize, something he could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real (FNF)
Something that could make her move
Something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel

Lust
Sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything, he crushed
Ruined everything he loved
He just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them
But we hush if it's us

That's why, my momma said she wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something she could be proud of, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not having nothin' real
Real, real, real, real
That they don't know how to act
They don't know how to feel

Ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good, so God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free
Ain't a G, show you right

The game is not to give 'em nothing real
Real, real, real, real
Nothing that they could use, nothing that they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real
Real, real, real, real
So that's all they'll know
That's all that they'll feel
Feel, feel, feel

Struggle
Another sign that God love you
'Cause on the low
Being poor make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes
To try and keep 'em out of trouble
'Cause being poor also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes
Or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own I can hit 'em with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can
On the man up above you

That's why, I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something they could recognize, something they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something that'll make 'em stop
Something they can feel
Feel, feel, feel

He was sincere made her believe it was safe

Before long she was cool with givin hugs to him

You are getting too heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go

My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my own self I wonder if we still see a light
We was tight seeing lights
Speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high, life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted trying to fall asleep, losses at my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down

To never go our separate ways

Tired of all the wardrobe changin'
Playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits
Livin' off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow
Can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room, the entry room, let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is
I'm prepared to filterless
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny

But I don't know how much longer we can stand

We'll keep driving on the Blind Line
If we don't know where we want to go
Even knowledge that's sound can get watered down
Truth can get sucked out the car window

What do we really need?
But sun, showers, soil and seed
We're two-thirds water

Deep down in the rock
There's a pearl inside

See the light of the Venus shining
High over the mid-western plains
Is it telling you you gotta go?
That your heart's been burning way to slow

Just some bird that flew away
And flies still

The breeze had blown the clouds away
The fluttering ones were covering the fields
I've been walking by myself
I've been thinking about you again
Maybe one day I'll tell you how I feel
See the light of the satellite tower
The only thing that's blocking our view
Is it telling you what's on my mind
That I think about you all the time
That I wish for it even thought I know not to.

Drawn longer

I know you've been impressed
You've seen me at my best
But oh, how it hurts
When I can't hide my worst
Well thank-you for carrying on
For playing with me and this song
It made me feel better
We sat it out like some passing bad weather

My mind was like kid's boxing gloves
The kind blown up with air
That are put away after play
And get limp just lying there

Venez-vite, je vous en prie,

Sarah Harmer,"I think it'll float
I think it'll sail
We may take on waves
Hit a gale
But considering this love
Most everything
Says I think it'll fly
And I think it'll sing

There's a cat on the bed
And a leak in the roof
And I'm pretty sure now
That we don't need more proof
We'll patch it with credit
And we'll pay it on time

For I am he who searches hearts and minds
Behold I'm standing at the door and I am knocking
And the one who hears and opens it will find

That the one who overcomes will rule the nations
On the throne he'll sit beside me dressed in white

Can't do that
No matter how I tried
I'll never turn my back on someone who loves me too

I can do almost anything I have to
But there's one thing I cannot change
I almost kind of like the pain
I wear your tattoo like a stain
But it will take forever to fade away

I can't unlove you
Can't do that
No matter how I tried
I'll never turn my back on someone who loves me too
I can do almost anything I have to
But I can't unlove you
Oh no, why would I want to
I can't unlove you
Can't do that
I'll never get through that
Why would I want to

There's always time for other dreams
Why must we erase these things

I can't unlove you
Can't do that
No matter how I tried
I'll never turn my back on someone who loves me too
But I can't unlove you
Can't feel that
No matter how I tried
I won't turn my back on someone who loves me too
I can do almost anything I have to
But I can't unlove you",Unlove You,2004

You know like I know you ain't never ever met nobody like me

[Chorus]
You never met a girl like me
I ain't goin' other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down low chick on ya team

[Verse 1]
I might wake you up in the morning and cook for you
If you having problem with a song I'll write a hook for you
11:30 at night I ain't gonna look for you
Cause I know you coming home with me
I will never stress you or make you feel misled
If you want to go to the movies I'll flip it instead
You don't pay me
I get this with my bread my bread
Cause you know my money ain't a thing a thing

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2]
If you trying to be out to the party I'll let you go
If you want be out with somebody that's when I show
You do as you please cause baby that's how you know that
There's no other place that I'd rather go
I ain't trying to be fussin' and fightin' up on yo' back
Anytime you need me you know that I'm getting yo'back
Ain't no one like me I want you to know that know that
I ain't changing nothing cause it's like that like that

[Bridge]
I know you're used to lovers
That treat you like their mother
So I know it's hard to understand when I say
I'm your girl but I'm like your man
No matter if it's sweet talk or street talk
I'm right here by your side
And soon you'll come to see
How it is to be
Down with a chick like me

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

In a kingdom by the sea
There lived a maiden you may know
By the name of Annabelle Lee
No other thought did trouble her mind
But to love and be loved by me

We were children both
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabelle Lee
With a love that the winged angels high
Coveted her and me

This was the reason long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew from a stormy cloud
That took my Annabelle Lee
Then her wicked brothers came
To steal her away from me

They shut her up in a tomb below
This kingdom by the sea
But no maiden's grave could sever my soul
From the love she bore for me
For the moon don't beam without a dream
Of my darling Annabelle Lee

For many years I've wandered
Through this kingdom by the sea
I've laid myself beside the bones
Of my beautiful Annabelle Lee
I'll make my bed near the rising tide
In her tomb by the sounding sea",Annabelle Lee,2011

Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep

Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When the innocence dies

Hold on love
It's all on the line
But you'll be alright
Lift up your head
You must be strong
Must sing out your song

Dropping defenses
Those rough bloody edges
That open the gate of the hate that en-cages
Hello to new life
Means hello to goodbye
Welcome the change rearranging the inside

Hold on love
It's all on the line
But you'll be alright
Lift up your head
You must be strong
Must sing out your song

Hold on love
It's all on the line
But you'll be alright
Lift up your head
You must be strong
Must sing out your song




",Hold on Love,2006
Sarah Kelly,"Sweet Illusion knows my name
Take a breath and run away
Never ending to pretending
To escape the pain

Honesty please come to me
Humbly I've found my knees
I am blind but I want to see
Come now truth and find me

In your eyes
I see for the very first time
In this light
I feel and I know I'm alive

No need to entertain the game
On the streets of empty fame
No sufficing too enticing
No one left to blame

But honesty has come to me
Freedom found down on my knees
I was blind but now I can see
Truth has finally come to me

In your eyes
I see for the very first time
In the light
I feel and I know I'm alive

I'll wake up any moment now
It's so hard to believe that the traitor is me
Love is breaking through the night somehow
Not as real as it seems, here inside of this dream

In your eyes
I see for the very first time
In the light
I feelâ?¦l and I know I'm alive

And in your eyes
I see for the very first time
In the light
I feelâ?¦l and I know I'm alive

Sarah Kelly,"No more words to sing
No more contradicting melody
No more cheap goodbye
No more golden lie

Nothing to defend
Eyes, it's time to learn to cry again
Drawing out this line
For the millionth time

Behind me I see
A broken world and
Dead end dreams

I'm out of reach
I'm out of the reach of yesterday
Fade away
And I have changed
I have changed, so on with today

Following my heart
No where but the honest truth to start
What have I become?
What could I become?

Failure or success
Welcoming the test to prove my love
Growing in my faith
Lord please grant the strength

Behind me I see
A broken world and
Dead end dreams

I'm out of reach
I'm out of the reach of yesterday
Fade away
And I have changed
I have changed, so on with today

Thankfully, I'm breaking free
From all the chains that are holding me
I never knew how good life could be
So this is peace

I'm out of the reach of yesterday
Fade away
And I have changed

What was so right now seeming so wrong
But even the sun must set my friend
And the time has come
We must be moving on

Day has lead to this night
Time to say our goodbyes
And move on
Remember me well

Cherishing the good times
Forgiving all the bad times
Moving on
Remember me well

A not so distant melody
Singing softly, ringing in my ear
A bittersweet memory
With now one too many tears

Day has lead to this night
Time to say our goodbyes
And move on
Remember me well

Cherishing the good times
Forgiving all the bad times
Moving on
Remember me well

Just one last look
Back to yesterday
Just one more tear
Cried for yesterday

Day has lead to this night
Time to say our goodbyes
And move on
Remember me well

Forgiving all the bad times
Moving on

Sailng down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

Sun and water, old life givers
L'll have them where ere I roam
And I was not far from home

Sunlight glancing on the water
Life and death are all my own
Yet I was never alone

Life for all my sons and daughters
Golden sparkles in the foam
And I was not far from home

Sailing down this winding highway
Travelers from near and far
And I was never alone

Exploring all the little byways
Sighting all the distant stars
And I was not far from home

Sailing down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

And I was not far from home

And I was not far from home

For three score or more in this little isle of green

And I'm known by the name of old Johnny Dhu
Of all the trade's that's going, sure begging is the best
For when a man is tired, he can sit down and rest
He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
Only cut around the corner with his old rig-a-doo

I slept in the barn, down at Caurabawn
A wet night came on and I slept 'till the dawn
With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
And the rats and the cats, they were playing peek-a-boo
When who did I waken but the woman of the house
With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""boo
Aarah, don't be afraid mam it's only Johnny Dhu""

I met a little flaxy-haired girl one day
""Good morning little flaxy-haired girl"" I did say
""Good morning little beggarman, a how do you do
With your rags and you tags and you old rig-a-doo""
I'll buy a pair of leggings, a collar and a tie
And a nice young lady I'll fetch by and by
I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll colour them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too

Over the fields with my great heavy sack
With holes in my shoes and my toes peeping through
Singing skinny-me-rink a doodle o and old Johnny Dhu

I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night

He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen had no choice

I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said, ""Grab your things, I've come to take you home.""

To keepin' silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut

So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
'Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut

I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home.""

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free

Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes,but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me

Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom

On through you.... 

I was with you- that pallet 
Steaming spinning round in circles 
Dreaming I was with you on that 
Pallet steaming running round in 
Circles screaming

All the way my love over the hills and 
Right on to you Run away my love 
Over the hills and right on through you 
Over the hills and right on through you 
Lying awake in these restless dreams 
Life's never what it seems 
I've always tried to read your eyes 
To get inside that scornful mind 
Hold on tight Hold on fast 
This ain't the kind that always lasts 
If you want me to go just ask me 
To go I'd go",Steaming,1989
Sarah McLachlan,"We walk without a sound across a barren landscape
Your eyes are twisted down to a dew entrailed ground
We watch the stars as they slowly fade away and in the clearing sky I see
The cold stone face of morning setting in on me

It's a strange world
It's a very strange world that leaves me
Holding on to nothing when there's nothing left to lose

Your touch is cold and damp, the devil's in your eyes
I wonder why I always let you lead me on this way
'Cause you see only what you want to see
You feel only what you want to
And I am on the outside of your strange world

It's a strange world
It's a very strange world that leaves me
Holding on to nothing when there's nothing left to lose

We're walking hand in hand, we'll walk this way forever
Our eyes have risen to the water's edge watching with the tides
The stars have fallen to another day and the sun warms our path to
Find the reasons leave us far behind in our strange world

Holding on to nothing when there's nothing left to lose",Strange World,1989
Sarah McLachlan,"Somewhere deep inside me
I hold a picture of a time long gone
A time of ease and simple pleasures
And days in shadows not so long
Now with my mind I'm struggling
Holding on to what I believe
Listen to the fragments of my thoughts
That leave me broken and deceived

'cause I don't know the way
He said ""i can take you there,
I can show you places where our time has had no ware""
And as we walked the plains
The skies they opened wide
Revealing all the shame for what's been lost inside us all

[Chorus]
It's a day in the life
In my mind I've seen it all
Sometime soon for all to see
The walls are slowly breaking down
In my mind I've seen it all
And someday we'll be free

We're searching for a message
Or so I thought but so it seems
The ignorance in the myths of others
Is easier to redeem
I've never questioned the answers given
To find the faith that's been lost within
'cause where I lay my trust in others
Where it lies the ground is thin

'cause I don't know the way
He said ""i can take you there,
I can show you places where our time has had no ware""
And as we walked the plains
The skies they opened wide
Revealing all the shame for what's been lost inside us all

[Chorus: x2]

I know you say you love me
If what you say is true
So show me something that's not deceiving
'cause I wouldn't lie to you

The pain that's in your truth deceiving me has got me scared

Oh why (oh why)
Oh why (oh why)

Through your eyes the strains of battle like a brooding storm
You're up and down these pristine velvet walls like focus never forms
My walls are getting wider and my eyes are drawn astray
I see you now a vague deception of a dying day

Oh why
Oh why

I fall into the water and once more I turn to you
And the crowds were standing staring faceless cutting off my view to you

Sarah McLachlan,"When we wore a heart of stone we wandered to the sea
Hoping to find some comfort there yearning to feel free
And we were mesmerized by the lull of the night and the smells that filled the air
And we laid us down on sandy ground it was cold but we didn't care

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

We fell asleep and began to dream when something broke the night
Memories stirred inside of us, the struggle and the fight
And we could feel the heat of a thousand voices telling us which way to go
And we cried out is there no escape from the words that plague me so

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

In the still and the silent dawn another day is born
Washed up by the tireless waves the body bent and torn
When you wake in the face of the blinding sun, and you search only to find
That heaven is a stranger place than what you've left behind

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythum....

Lay me down beside you oh as long as it lasts 
From the river comes a figure 
Drifting slowly by 
Trailing long the water leaving softer 
Than a sigh softer than a sigh

All the feelings they remain like a 
Still life a dying swansong forever 
Lost your cries of glory 
The rain is falling down like silence 
In a shroud 
When all that really matters left to 
Loose I'm all alone I'm all alone

Sarah McLachlan,"You open your eyes  look around 
You feel the earth it wanders  
Out  from under your feet  the ground 
Is not firm but soft and weak  like skin 
Under the touch  cannot stop to falter 
Now  the damage is done the certainties gone 
The spirits altered 

[Chorus]
And now the angry morning 
Gives the early signs of warning 
You must face alone the plans you make 
Decisions they will try to break 

Our hands are tied on the table 
Maybe you can try at the back door man 
While the helpless line up on the doorsteps 
'Cause its all they can do to try to get through 
All of your life you've lived in a world as pure 
As Eden's sixth day now all you've been allowed 
Is taken away they will not let you be so proud 
And you have felt the fear growing inside 
Protest follows far and wide they'll see how long 
It will take 'till you fall from so much denied 

Your soul it aches relentless from the fear 
That they will never guess so unfair they 
They can make you feel so small 
And the fear you know is real

I move away from the crowded room 
That sea of shallow faces masked in warm regret

Oh
Lost in the darkness of a land 
Where all the hope that's offered is 
Memories of being taken by the hand 
And we are led into the sun 
But I don't have a hold on what is real 
Though we can only dry 
What is there to give or to believe 

I want it all to go away I want to be alone 
Sympathys wasted on my hollow shell 
I feel there is nothing left to fight for 
No reason for a cause 
And I can't hear your voice and I can't feel you near

Longing cold and hollow 
With sweet breath you'd come to warm me 
But I held on too hard to only a memory 

You lie there on the swollen ground 
Deserted in your heart 
Still longing for what yesterdays lost 
And for all that tomorrow might bring 
And for all that tomorrow might bring 

The passion lost  taken stolen 
The dreams we had and we shared shattered broken 
With sweet breath you'd come to soothe me 
But I so blind and filled with fear 
Would send you away from me 

There's no hope in regretting now 
All the pain that we could not see 
We both knew what we wanted 
And we took it believing it free 
And we took it believing it free",Mercy,1991

In the terms of the years that pass you by

Though your commitment to most would offend
But I stuck by you holding on with my foolish pride
Waiting for you to give in
You never really tried or so it seems
I've had much more than myself to blame
I've had enough of trying everything
And this time it is the end

There's no more coming back this way
The path is overgrown and strewn with thorns
They've torn the life-blood from your naked eyes

In a world created for only us

Crawling into each other it's smothering 
Every little part of me 
What kind of love is this that keeps me

Despite everything it's doing to me 
What is this love that keeps me coming 
Back for more 
When it will only end in misery 
I know too many people unhappy 
In a life from which they'd love to flee 
Watching others get everything offered 
They're wanton for discovery 
Oh my brother my sister my mother 
You're loosing your identity 
Can't you see that it's you in the window 
Shining with intensity

As I pulled away slowly, 
I was feeling so holy, 
God knows, 
I was feeling alive. 

Now the sun's coming up, 
I'm riding with Lady Luck, 
Freeways, 
Cars and trucks, 
Stars beginning to fade, 
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,
Oh, Lord, 
Let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.

And it's six in the morning, 
Gave me no warning; 
I had to be on my way.
Well there's trucks all a-passing, 
And the lights all are flashing, 
I'm on my way home from the place.

Well the sun's coming up, 
I'm riding with Lady Luck,

Sarah McLachlan,"On the hills of fire the darkest hour 
I was dreaming of my true loves pyre 
Who will bring a light to stoke the fire 
Fear not for your still breathing 

On a windless day 
I saw the life blood drained away 
A cold wind blows on a windless day 

Hear the cry for new life the mourning's flame 
You were the brightest light that burned to soon in vain 
Who will bring you back from where there's no return 
Fear not for you just dreaming 

On a winters day 
I saw the life blood drained away 
A cold wind blows on a windless day",Ben's Song,1993
Sarah McLachlan,"Child walks down to the river's edge 
And looks out as far as she can see 
And draws each breath as if it were the last 
And wipes away the tears across her sleeve 
She can see where the river crawls to the sea 
Like a baby into mothers care 
Somehow the longing is so far away 

The innocence so wasted and aware 
And look at the child with the dream in her eyes 
Holding it deep inside her 
Thinking about home, home
So much anger so deeply engrained 
Seemed a burden that was hers alone
 
She didn't thing that there was anything wrong 
With wanting a life that she could call her own 
How could I explain? You would not want to hear 
You wouldn't listen if I talked anyway 
For you were too weighed down by your own fears 

Look at the child with the dream in her eyes 
Holding it deep inside her
Home, home, home, home",Home,1993
Sarah McLachlan,"I remember the nights I watched you lay sleeping 
Your body gripped by some far away dream 
Well I was so scared and so in love then 
And so lost in all of you that I had seen 

[Chorus]
But no one ever talked in the darkness 
No voice ever added fuel to the fire 
No light ever shone in the doorway 
Deep in the hollow of earthly desires 
But if in some dream there was brightness 
If in some memory some sort of sigh 
And flesh be revived in the shadows 
Blessed our bodies would lay so entwined 
And I will oh I will not forget you 
Nor will I ever let you go 
I will oh I will not forget you 

I remember when you left in the morning at daybreak 
So silent you stole from my bed 
To go back to the one who possesses your soul 
And I back to the life that I dread 
So I ran like the wind to the water 
Please don't leave me again I cried 
And I drew bitter tears at the ocean 
But all that came back was the tide

[Chorus]",I Will Not Forget You,1993
Sarah McLachlan,"Crouching down inside a deep ravine
Those angry cries pass quickly by, he can't be seen
So many ways spent hiding in so many undone plans
Forgetting what it's like to fight when no one understands
Close call there in the shadows
There's a fear in the dark
There's one out there

All those memories, pain and anger, flood back one by one
They must be just around the bend, they always come
At night as I lay sleeping they come to me in herds
Their lies remain, the dreams the same, it's only fleeting words
No one calls there in the shadows
There's no end to the dark
But there's one out there, no one but me

The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me
No way's the right way. 
Is there a way out for me?
My life's slipping out

Rising up, the night is done, and now the bright lights come
Held back in my pitied world where everything's undone
A cold wind blows right through me, I'm made a hollow shell
There's nothing left, just ash remains, enrich the soil, no soil, no soil

Close call there in the shadows
There's an end to the dark
'Cause there's someone out there
Someone like me

The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me
No way's the right way, is there a way out for me
The hours pass so slowly
The life's slipping out of me
Is there a way out for me?
The hours pass so slowly
The life's slipping out of me
Is there a way out for me?
There must be a way out for me",Out of the Shadows,1993
Sarah McLachlan,"I knew you wanted to tell me 
In your voice there was something wrong 
But if you would turn your face away from me 
You cannot tell me you're so strong
Just let me ask of you one small thing 
As we have shared so many tears 
With forever our dreams we planned a whole life long 
Now are scattered on the wind

[Chorus]
In the terms of endearment 
In the terms of the life that you love 
In the terms of the years that pass you by 
In the terms of the reasons why 

Through the years I've grown to love you 
Through your commitment to most would offend 
But I stuck by you holding on with my foolish pride 
Waiting for you to give in
You never really tried or so it seems 
I've had more than myself to blame 
I've had enough of trying everything 
And this time it is the end

[Chorus] 

There's no more coming back this way 
The path is overgrown and strewn with thorns 
They've torn the life blood from your naked eyes 
Cast aside to be forlorn

[Chorus] 

Funny, how it seems that all I've tried to do 
Seemed to make no difference to you at all",Path of Thorns (Terms),1993
Sarah McLachlan,"Mary walks 
Down to the water's edge 
And there she hangs her head 
To find herself faded 
A shadow of what she once was 
She said ""How long have I been sleeping 
And why do I feel so old 
Why do I feel so cold 
My heart is saying one thing but my body won't let go"" 
With trembling hands she reaches up 
A stranger's flesh is offered 
And I would be the last to know 
I would be the last the let it show 
I would be the last to go 
Take her hand 
She will lead you through the fire 
Give you back hope 
And hope that you won't take too much 
Respecting what is left 
She cradled us 
She held us in her arms 
Unselfish in her suffering she could not understand 
That no one seemed to have the time 
To cherish what was given 
And I would be the last to know 
And I would be the last to let it show 
I would be the last to go...

Sarah McLachlan,"As the walls are closing in
And the colors fade to black
And my eyes are falling fast and deep into me
And I follow the tracks that lead me down
And I never follow what's right
And they wonder sometimes when they see all the
Sadness and pain that truth brings to light

'Cause I can't see no reason
What is blind cannot see
'Cause I want what is pleasing
All I take should be free
What I rob from the innocent ones
What I'd steal from the womb

If I cried me a river of all my confessions
Would I drown in my shallow regret

As the walls are closing in
And the colors fade to black
And my eyes are falling fast and deep into the sea
(Above line written as ""and the night is falling"" in album jacket)
And in darkness all that I can see
The frightened and the weak
Are forced to cling to mistakes they know nothing of
At mercy are the meak

'Cause I can't see no reason
What is blind cannot see
'Cause I want what is pleasing
All I take should be free
What I rob from the innocent ones
What I'd steal from the womb

Would I drown in my shallow regret

Hoping to find some comfort there yearning to feel free
And we were mesmerized by the lull of the night and the smells that filled the air
And we laid us down on sandy ground it was cold but we didn't care

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

We fell asleep and began to dream when something broke the night
Memories stirred inside of us, the struggle and the fight
And we could feel the heat of a thousand voices telling us which way to go
And we cried out is there no escape from the words that plague me so

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

In the still and the silent dawn another day is born
Washed up by the tireless waves the body bent and torn
When you wake in the face of the blinding sun, and you search only to find
That heaven is a stranger place than what you've left behind

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythum....

If you're out there won't you hear me. 
I know that we've never talked before

The man I love is leaving 
Won't you take him when he comes to your door.

I go lickety-splitly down to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly, 
I was feeling so holy, 
God knows, 
I was feeling alive. 

Now the sun's coming up, 
I'm riding with Lady Luck, 
Freeways, 
Cars and trucks, 
Stars beginning to fade, 
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,
Oh, Lord, 
Let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.

And it's six in the morning, 
Gave me no warning; 
I had to be on my way.
Well there's trucks all a-passing, 
And the lights all are flashing, 
I'm on my way home from the place.

Sarah McLachlan,"Listen as the wind blows 
From across the great divide  
Voices trapped in yearning  
Memories trapped in time  
The night is my companion 
And solitude my guide  
Would I spend forever here 
And not be satisfied  

And I would be the one 
To hold you down  
Kiss you so hard  
I'll take your breath away 
And after I'd wipe away the tears  
Just close your eyes dear 

Through this world I've stumbled 
So many times betrayed, 
Trying to find an honest word, 
To find the truth enslaved, 
Oh you speak to me in riddles and 
You speak to me in rhymes 
My body aches to breathe your breath, 
Your words keep me alive, 

And I would be the one 
To hold you down, 
Kiss you so hard, 
I'll take your breath away 
And after I'd wipe away the tears, 
Just close your eyes dear 

Into this night I wander, 
It's morning that I dread, 
Another day of knowing of 
The path I fear to tread, 
Oh into the sea of waking dreams 
I follow without pride, 
Nothing stands between us here 
And I won't be denied, 

And I would be the one 
To hold you down, 
Kiss you so hard, 
I'll take your breath away 
And after I'd wipe away the tears, 
Just close your eyes dear...",Possession [Piano Version],1996

It's chilled us to the bone 
We haven't seen the sun for weeks 
To long too far from home 
I feel just like I'm sinking 
And I claw for solid ground 
I'm pulled down by the undertow 
I never thought I could feel so low 
Oh darkness I feel like letting go 
If all of the strength and all of the courage 
Come and lift me from this place 
I know I could love you much better than this 
Full of grace 
Full of grace

So it's better this way, I said 
Having seen this place before 
Where everything we said and did 
Hurts us all the more 
Its just that we stayed, too long 
In the same old sickly skin 
I'm pulled down by the undertow 
I never thought I could feel so low 
Oh darkness I feel like letting go 
If all of the strength 
And all of the courage 
Come and lift me from this place 
I know I could love you much better than this

Sarah McLachlan,"Sunday is Gloomy,
My hours are slumberless,
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you

Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday

Sunday is gloomy
with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let them know that I'm glad to go

Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of

Sarah McLachlan,"When we wore a heart of stone we wandered to the sea
Hoping to find some comfort there yearning to feel free
And we were mesmerized by the lull of the night and the smells that filled the air
And we laid us down on sandy ground it was cold but we didn't care

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

We fell asleep and began to dream when something broke the night
Memories stirred inside of us, the struggle and the fight
And we could feel the heat of a thousand voices telling us which way to go
And we cried out is there no escape from the words that plague me so

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

In the still and the silent dawn another day is born
Washed up by the tireless waves the body bent and torn
When you wake in the face of the blinding sun, and you search only to find
That heaven is a stranger place than what you've left behind

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong

There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey

Memories seep from my veins

And maybe empty
Oh, and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel

Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back

Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don't make no difference
Escape one last time

Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

That's when the energy comes
And the dark side's light
And the vampires roam
You strut your rasta wear
And your suicide poem
And a cross from a faith that died
Before Jesus came
You're building a mystery

You live in a church
Where you sleep with voodoo dolls
And you won't give up the search
For the ghosts in the halls
You wear sandals in the snow
And a smile that won't wash away
Can you look out the window
Without your shadow getting in the way?

You're so beautiful
With an edge and charm
But so careful
When I'm in your arms

'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

You woke up screaming aloud
A prayer from your secret god
You feed off our fears
And hold back your tears, oh
Give us a tantrum
And a know it all grin
Just when we need one
When the evening's thin

You're a beautiful
A beautiful fucked up man
You're setting up your
Razor wire shrine

My heart is saying one thing but my body won't let go""

She held us in her arms

Unselfish in her suffering she could not understand
That no one seemed to have the time
To cherish what was given

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

[Chorus]

The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
'Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me

I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone

Gold I bring to crown Him again;
King forever, ceasing never,

Rainbows are visions, but only illusions,
And rainbows have nothing to hide.
So we've been told and some choose to believe it.
I know they're wrong, wait and see.

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
The lovers, the dreamers and me.

Who said that every wish would be heard
And answered when wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that and someone believed it.
Look what it's done so far.
What's so amazing that keeps us star gazing
And what do we think we might see?

[Chorus]

All of us under its spell. 
We know that it's probably magic.

Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name.
Is this the sweet sound that called the young sailors.
The voice might be one and the same.
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.
It's something that I'm supposed to be.

But somewhere long the way, I got caught up in all there was to offer
But the cost was so much more than I could bear

Though I've tried, I've fallen
I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better I should know
So don't come 'round here and
Tell me I told you so

We all begin with good intent
When love was raw and young
We believe that we can change ourselves
The past can be undone
But we carry on our back the burdens time always  reveals
In the lonely light of morning
In the wound that would not heal
It's the bitter taste of losing everything
I've held so dear

Though I've tried, I've fallen
I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better I should know
So don't come 'round here and
Tell me I told you so

Ohh

Heaven bend to take my hand
I've nowhere left to turn
I'm lost to those I thought were friends
To everyone I know
Oh they turn their heads, embarrassed
Pretend that they don't see
That it's one miss step, one slip, before you know it
And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed

Though I've tried, I've fallen
I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better I should know
So don't come 'round here and
Tell me I told you so",Fallen [Radio Mix],2003

For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay

And maybe empty
Oh, and weightless, and maybe

Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back

Keep on building the lies

Sarah McLachlan,"As the walls are closing in and the colors fade to black
As my eyes are falling fast and deep into me
And I follow the tracks that lead me down
I never follow what's right and they wonder sometimes
When they see all the sadness and pain, the truth begins to light

'Cause I can't see no reason what is blind cannot see
'Cause I want what is pleasin', all I take should be free
What I rob from the innocent ones
What I'd steal from the womb

As the walls are closing in and the colors fade to black
As the night is falling fast and deep into the sea
And in the darkness all that I can see, the frightened and the weak
Are forced to cling to mistakes they know nothing of
At mercy are the meek

'Cause I can't see no reason what is blind cannot see
'Cause I want what is pleasin', all I take should be free
What I rob from the innocent ones
What I'd steal from the womb

But for time being you're able to hold that

Tried to tell you

That you might stray
And I would stand by you
No matter what they'd say
I would've thought I'd be with you
Until my dying day
Until my dying day

I used to think my life
Was often empty
A lonely space within
You hurt me more than
I ever would have imagined
You made my world stand still
And in that stillness
There was a freedom
I never felt before

Until she cries no more
Possessing all the beauty
Hungry still for more

Comfort me, I can't hold it all in

To keep me from falling
Into old familiar shoes

How stupid could I be?
A simpleton could see
That you're no good for me
But you're the only one I see

Love has made me a fool
Set me on fire and watched as I floundered
Unable to speak
Except to cry out and wait for your answer

But you come around in your time
Speaking of fabulous places, create an oasis
That dries up as soon as you're gone
You leave me here burning
In this desert without you

Everything falls apart

Sarah McLachlan,"In the desert of my dreams I saw you there
And I'm walking towards the water steaming body cold and bare 
But your words cut loose the fire and you left my soul to bleed
And the pain that's in your truth deceiving me has got me scared 

Oh why 
Oh why

Through your eyes the strains of battle like a brooding storm
You're up and down these pristine velvet walls like focus never forms
My walls are getting wider and my eyes are drawn astray
I see you now a vague deception of a dying day 

Oh why
Oh why

I fall into the water and once more I turn to you
And the crowds were standing staring faceless cutting off my view to you
They start to limply flail their bodies in a twisted mime
And I'm lost inside this tangled web in which I'm lain entwined
You're gone and I'm lost inside this tangled web in which I'm lain entwined

Oh why
Oh why",Vox [DVD],2005
Sarah McLachlan,"Night lift up the shades let in the brilliant light of morning
But steady me now for I am weak and starving for mercy
Sleep has left me alone to carry the weight of unraveling where we went wrong 
And all I can do to hang on, to keep me from falling into old familiar shoes

[Chorus]
How stupid could I be
A simpleton could see 
That you're no good for me 
But you're the only one I see

Love has made me a fool set me on fire and watched as I floundered
Unable to speak except to cry out and wait for your answer 
And you come around in your time speaking of fabulous places create
An oasis that dries up as soon as you're gone
You leave me here burning in this desert without you

Everything changes everything falls apart
I can't stand to feel myself losing control
In the deep of my senses I know

When everything is beautiful
It's just another ordinary miracle today

The sky knows when it's time to snow
Don't need to teach a seed to grow
It's just another ordinary miracle today

Life is like a gift they say
Wrapped up for you every day
Open up and find a way
To give some of your own love

Isn't it remarkable?
Like every time a raindrop falls
It's just another ordinary miracle today

Birds in winter have their fling
They always make it home in spring
It's just another ordinary miracle today

When you wake up everyday
Please don't throw your dreams away
Hold them close to your heart
Cause we are all a part of the ordinary miracle

Ordinary miracle
Do you want to see a miracle?

It seems so exceptional
The things just work out after all
It's just another ordinary miracle today

The sun comes up and shines so bright
And disappears again at night
It's just another ordinary miracle today

It's just another ordinary miracle today","Ordinary Miracle, song (As used in the film Charlotte's Web)",2006

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Born is the King of Israel!

Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

In despair, I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

Following your aimless path away from us
You're so far away
And what can I say
Cause I can't be the one you wanted me to be

[Chorus]
So tell me how do you feel
It's so confusing
If you let it all go, it'll fall apart
Do you want me to stay and say I still want you
You want me too, don't you?

So what are we saying
Our Eden's a failure
A made-up story to fit the picture-perfect world
The one with ""I do""s
and I love you
And we are made for each other
Is forever over now?

[Chorus]

I hope there's forgiveness
In the distance between us
Can we make what lies ahead of us a better place to be?

[Chorus]",U Want Me 2,2008
Sarah McLachlan,"When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour spent together
Lives within my heart

And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when was happy so was I
When she loved me

Through the summer and the fall
We had each other that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be

And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me

So the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone
Still I waited for the day
When she'd say I will always love you

Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled at me and held me
Just like she use to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me

When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour spent together
Lives within my heart
When she loved me",When She Loved Me [From Disney/Pixar's Toy Story 2],2008
Sarah McLachlan,"O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive him still
The dear Christ enters in

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel",O Little Town of Bethlehem,2008
Sarah McLachlan,"Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glory streams from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Savior is born
Christ, the Savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

Sarah McLachlan,"The lake is frozen over
The trees are white with snow
And all around reminders of you
Are everywhere I go

It's late and morning's in no hurry
But sleep won't set me free
I lie awake and try to recall
How your body felt beside me
When silence gets too hard to handle
And the night too long

This is how I see you
In the snow on Christmas morning
Love and happiness surround you
As you throw your arms up to the sky
I keep this moment by and by
Oh I miss you now, my love
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, my love

Sense the joy fills the air
And I daydream and I stare
Up at the tree and I see
Your star up there

This is how I see you
In the snow on Christmas morning
Love and happiness surround you
As you throw your arms up to the sky
I keep this moment by and by",Wintersong,2008
Sarah McLachlan,"What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with voices sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him praise
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant king to praise Him
The King of kings, of glory brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise the song on high
Let singing fill, the earth and sky
Joy, joy, for Christ is born

What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?

Sarah McLachlan,"Spend all your time waiting
for that second chance,
for a break that would make it OK.

There's always some reason
to feel not good enough,
and it's hard, at the end of the day.

I need some distraction,
Oh, beautiful release.
Memories seep from my veins.

Let me be empty,
Oh, and weightless,
And maybe I'll find some peace tonight.

In the arms of the angel,
fly away from here,
from this dark, cold hotel room,
and the endlessness that you feel.

You are pulled from the wreckage,
Of your silent reverie.
You're in the arms of the angel,
may you find some comfort here.

So tired of the straight line,
and everywhere you turn,
there's vultures and thieves at your back.

The storm keeps on twisting.
Keep on building the lies
that you make up for all that you lack.

Don't make no difference,
escape one last time.
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness,
Oh, this glorious sadness,
that brings me to my knees.

may you find some comfort here.",Angel [Live],2008

So take this feeling'n make it grow
Never let it - never let it go

You give me something that I can believe in

Go of this moment in time
(Don't let go of things that you're feeling)
I can't explain the things that I'm feeling
(Dont' let go)
No, I won't let go

Now would you mind if I bared my soul
If I came right out and said your'e beautiful
'cause there's something here I can't explain
I feel I'm diving into driving rain
You get my senses running wild
I can't resist your sweet, sweet smile
So take this feeling'n make it grow

When everything is beautiful
It's just another ordinary miracle today

The sky knows when it's time to snow
Don't need to teach a seed to grow

Life is like a gift they say
Wrapped up for you every day
Open up and find a way
To give some of your own love

Isn't it remarkable?
Like every time a raindrop falls
It's just another ordinary miracle today

Birds in winter have their fling
They always make it home in spring
It's just another ordinary miracle today

When you wake up everyday
Please don't throw your dreams away
Hold them close to your heart
Cause we are all a part of the ordinary miracle

Ordinary miracle
Do you want to see a miracle?

It seems so exceptional
The things just work out after all

And disappears again at night

They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
singing songs of joy and peace

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
And then I'm going to quit this crazy scene

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly high

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees

I could skate away on

But I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost
the best baby that I ever had

Sarah McLachlan,"When we first met the well was dry
A long dark winter passed us by
With shooting starts and hopeful hearts our worlds collide
And so we rushed to fill each other in
Quick to feed our hungry hopes
A feast of our affections we were born anew

Oh, whoa

With open eyes we tried to make it work
And for a while the magic took
But cracks to begin to show as soon as things got hard
Like paper walls our feelings tore
We threw our backs against the door
Unwilling to bear witness to the other side

Oh, the games we play to hide the tangled dread inside
The fear that we are going nowhere fast
So we point the finger out, the anger gets so loud 
It drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow, what then?

I took a good hard look at how I loved
Years I squandered falling fast
For any boy who'd have me was so insecure
I'd lie awake alone at night
Full of loathing, compromised
And wondering how the hell did I end up like this

Oh, the tears of rage I cried, when nowhere could I find
An answer that made any kind of sense to me
I point the finger out, the anger gets so loud
It drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow

Oh I wanna learn, I wanna know
Will our history crush us or can we let it go?
I'm not the girl I was but what have I become?
I'm not so willing anymore to bend
Still pleasing and conceding
But I'm not gonna lose myself again",Awakenings,2010

Maybe I, I can't help but talking, I am here for you

Time passes us by and the way we love changes
And we're learning to waltz through the waves like everyone
Let it keep us from falling
Would you dance with me now?

The candle burned out and we stumbled around in the dark
And I can feel you slipping away
The band keeps on playing the world keeps revolving
Around all the static, the noise in between

And we need to hear that song again, let the love shine through

Time passes us by and the way we love changes
And we're learning to waltz through the waves like everyone
Let it keep us from falling
Would you dance with me, dance with me now?

We can't walk on water, we can only do better
If it's not forever, if it's time to go I will always remember

I believe I have seen you
In this white wave
You are silent
You are breathing
In this white wave

I am free",Silence [Tiësto's in Search of Sunrise Remix],2011
Sarah McLachlan,"Below the bridge the water rose on by
Trouble's gone and time is on my side
Been living in my ordinary shoes
Walkin' off my ordinary blues

Once upon a love so bright and true
Weather changed and went to Sunday School
Once upon a dark and stormy day... 
Promises dried up and blew away

I found myself a brand new neighborhood
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm walking good
Take tomorrow I'm giving up the past
Nothing but a hobo walking good at last

Anyway I'm okay
Day into night and night into day
Gone so far away from my home
Take the high road and down below

Anyway I'm okay
Day into night and night into day
Gone so far away from my home
Take the high road and down below

Anyway I'm okay
Day into night and night into day
Gone so far away from my home
Take the high road and down below",Walkin' Good,2012
