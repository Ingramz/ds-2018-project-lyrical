A,"See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and
twist of fate
On a bed of nails
she makes me wait
And I wait... without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm,
we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you...
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live with or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied,
my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing else to lose
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you",With or Without You,2006
A,"It was a bad idea
But I had to follow through,
She had no idea what I wanted to do
It was a bad idea
But I had to hit it anyway

Candy caught my eye when she walked by lookin' like a freak
I leaned over kissed her on the cheek.
I was being careful not to move too fast,
But she smiled when I gave her a backstage pass.
A real star fucker, she put me to the test,
Then I noticed Doug Ray tattooed on her breast.
I thought I was blessed to meet this treat
Candy had a place right down the street.
It didn't take long to achieve my goal
And I lost control of mind, body, and soul.

It was a bad idea
But I had to follow through,
She had no idea what I wanted to do
It was a bad idea
But I had to hit it anyway

Let me tell you how I got my pumas stolen.
It was a summer day and the sky was golden.
I was having a slice down on University
And in comes a cutie, about 5 foot 3
Caught her checkin' me out so I flashed a smile.
Introduced myself 'cause that's my style.
She said, ""Yeah I know you, I love your CD.
I know all your rhymes, you're my favorite MC.""
Quick to the point no time at all
Snuck on in to her residence hall.
In ten minutes flat we were both butt naked.
She was screaming and yelling yo I just couldn't take it.
Her roomate got pissed while we fucked in her bed,
Bitch stole my pumas while I was getting head.

I can't believe I'm never gonna see you again,
You were more than a lover, you were also a friend.
The things I learned, in just one night,
When I say goodbye, it'll be alright, alright, alright!
Now people let me tell you 'bout this girl Suzanne,
Met her at the bar and I was like god damn!
She didn't have a man, no drink in her hand,
Bought her a shot and took her back to the van.
She was tall, slim, and tan. A White Owl fan,
Asked if I would take part in some perverted plan?
She dropped her skirt, she had another head.
I lost my pride in that groupie's bed

It was a bad idea
But I had to follow through,
She had no idea what I wanted to do
It was a bad idea
But I had to hit it anyway",Bad Idea,1997
A,"I'll give back your pogo stick
As soon as you return my wasted time
And then I'll be fine
I'll feel so much more nostalgic

As soon as all my cheques are countersigned
I'm sure I'll be fine
Are you panicking or just groveling?
I want to empathize

So how does it feel
When the guilt bites into your veins?
How does it feel
You cheeky, cheeky little monkey?

How does it feel
When your conscious burns in your brain
I gotta know
How does it feel?

Been there done that don't like re-runs
If I do I'll rent the video
And cancel your show
Does somebody need a big hug?

Call me up when I'm in Mexico
Spending your dough
Are you worrying or just sniveling?
I want to empathize

So how does it feel
When the guilt bites into your veins?
How does it feel
You cheeky, cheeky little monkey?

How does it feel
When your conscious burns in your brain
I gotta know

Are you shivering, are you anything?
I want to empathize
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

How does it feel, cheeky monkey?
I gotta know
So how does it feel
When the knife is stuck in your back?

How does it feel
You cheeky, cheeky little monkey?
How does it feel
When your anger boomerangs you?

I gotta know
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

A,"I've got to get up ma, and get in my place
I've got to work out ma, and sort out my face

And I don't have the time to get all worked up about the year on the street

And it's not my fault, I can find my way, yeah it's not my fault
There goes another day, I've been here too long
Do I have to change into what it takes, yeah make it No.1

I feel out of flavour, I don't look like a picture
You think I'm a loser, but I can see through you
You're running around like you're running the country
I know that you think that you've got one on me
Ear to the ground like a boy about town
Can't get nothing to fit me!

And it's not my fault, I can find my way, yeah it's not my fault
There goes another day, I've been here too long
Do I have to change in to what it takes, yeah make it No.1

Got to call for an old friend who used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Sold his house, sold his car
Bought a ticket to the West coast
Now he gives him 'em a stand-up routine in L.A.

A,"When I was a kid I skinned my knee
And not one tear came out of me
Decided right then I was just born tough
And nothin' ever gonna ruffle my feathers

High school quarterback, football team
A revved up, fine-tuned, mean-machine
And when I got sacked I'd flash a grin
Saying ""What's the matter boys, can't you do any better?""
No pain, no gain; I couldn't get hurt
'Cause I didn't feel a thing
Then one day I saw your face
Now everything's changed

My heart's always hurtin'
My legs are barely workin'
Feels so good to kiss you on the couch
Sweet mama, your daughter's makin' my eyes water
And only one word comes out of my mouth
Ouch

Ache all over from your tender touch
You say my name, and I get goosebumps
Well, baby, this former man-of-steel is putty in your hands
And I love this feeling
Those eyes, that dress
Cryin' uncle; it's no contest
It's all your fault I fell in love

When you think we feel we need to prove
That we paid our fucking dues

You can see our contract says

A,"I'm down on the floor, there's a man on the door
He won't let me in 'cause he thinks he's the law
He'll give me shout when he's figured it out
Gotta pick up myself, what am I waiting for?
It's never enough, it's never too late
I reminded myself that I'm starting again
You're telling me ""never"", it should be ""whenever""

I'm always up on time, man
Why can't I be just like the people that I know? 

I've got what it takes, I'm bang up to date
You know how it is, I'm all over the place
Kicked in the face, I'm backstage

Standing in line, I'm hitching a ride

Only dogs can hear the notes
Be myself to pay the bills

There ain't nothing we don't know
Plug us in and watch us go!

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs!

Coming round for one more go
Way too loud for radio
Mosh pit full of casualties
OAP's get in for free
Time to even out the score
Thought we'd done enough before
Now we're kicking down your door

Come on, rock it up, to the back
Measure twice, cut it once
Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch!

Shitting bricks when I enter it in my bad brains

Too late for apologies.
Too late to forgive your brother,
Too late to get on your knees.

Too late to help the needy
And worst of all it's too late to turn
You must face eternity.

With the kiss of lovers lips
What a friendly offer

It still hurts
When I think that once
She was mine

Because I'm lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you

I guess its only right
To give someone what they need
Even if its nothing they ever
Wanted in the first place
I've seen with my own two eyes
The hurt and pain
That love causes
That's why I won't let you
Go down that road
Too emotional overdose

If I had her again
Everything would be alright
But nothings alright
And nothings ok
When you live in a memory

Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you

A tragic ending
A farewell to
A friendship that meant
Nothing at all

In their devoted grave is where they'll sleep

Watching two families quarrel, ruining lover's fate

Another tally on the body count

Won't come in the shape
Of hearts and flowers

Ride together like a charm and chain

And I'll close my eyes, and dream of a better time 
When I'm finally past this and happy on my own
I've done all I can, and I've still been cast aside
All I ever wanted to be was be the one who would wipe those tears from your eyes
But I guess I'll play second best, to a world that will never care about you
When will you understand to them you're just another pretty face? 
You'll tell me that you care, and then run straight back to him
I can hear your voice of treason from a mile away

You never did know how to whisper

Truth
You're such a liar
Tell me the truth
You're such a liar
Tell me the truth

You're such a liar
Tell me the truth!
You're such a liar

But I hate the way you look straight through me
What have I don't that's so wrong? 
Remember me when I'm so far from your reach
And then you'll know you had your chance
Take one more glance, and that's the end of our romance
You've turned your back on me for the last time
Remember when we use to be friends? 
Nothing could ever go wrong, or so we thought
But I guess you've changed a lot since we were young 
Times will change, and there's nothing I can say to right all of your wrongs
Just grow up, and pray we'll keep in touch
You've turned your back on me for the last time
I still dream of the day that I watched you choke
They'll act like I'm so crazy when they find you dead on my floor
Right now
Right now
I'd say something went wrong in our lives
And I pray that God saves us before we die

Come on

Here's a middle finger
Coming straight from oca-l-a

It's proved that I can't trust a word you say
Those must be some pair of binoculars
That you see every move I make
So I'll never be a liar
But you'll always be two-faced

You'll get what's coming to you
You're blinded by your instincts
I'm not your fucking game
I'm not so easily beat

I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed
So unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?
I've got to get out of this
My hand is on the handle
We're leaving everything behind
Goodbye for a lifetime

I'll rip that scandalous bitch in two
We'll bring the noise

Try to pretend that I never even knew your name
'Cause everything you are disgusts me

So I wouldn't be here
What I'd give for you to disappear
So tell me girly how's your edge?

You've got nothing better to do
I know why you can't see straight
I thought you were better than this
But you're just like everyone else

I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed
So unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?
I've got to get out of this

when you'll know you had your chance.
Take one more glance, and that's the end of our romance.

You've turned your back on me for the last time.

Nothing could ever go wrong, or so we thought,
but I guess you've changed a lot since we were young.
Times will change, and there's nothing I can say 
to right all of your wrongs.
Just grow up, and pray we'll keep in touch.

A Day to Remember,"Fuck yeah! 

Remember way back when, they said this life was a dream?
Well it still is, I never wanna wake
Standing in my backyard at our old practice space
Hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face

That was then, this is now
You can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me
Learned how to play guitar, and made my mum watch me
We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now
We never questioned it, was more like when and how

Started out in the spring of 2003
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
'cept to tell me all the things I couldn't do
Don't wanna hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
Hit all the nearest scenes, and every local bar
and played a show a night 'til it'd made me sick

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
""If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends""

And everyone we knew that we couldn't stand
Said, ""If you can't make it here you won't make it there""
Don't wanna hear about it
Spent most of our time sleeping on hard wood floors
People's living rooms, in any open door
We played a show a night 'til it all made sense

Go!

And the fears sets in, in an instant
Too much of myself gets exposed

我想我也很明白　沒什麼好難過

放手也是一種溫柔　你和我都會好過
而你和我也有一天　會望回頭並笑著說
放手也是一種寄託　你和我都必須做
而從今後我們就能對自己說　已愛過了

放手也是一種溫柔　你和我都會好過
而你和我也有一天　會望回頭並笑著說
放手也是一種感動  你和我都沒有錯
讓回憶它也隨著日子走  我們都愛過了

친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다

That old happy Christmas

So thin with your poet hands
And your eyes of flame

And I'd like to kiss you
Full on the mouth
I don't care if you tell

For love doesn't come in boxes
Nor truth in a crowded shop
Those red ribbon foxes are not so easy caught

Nor God in your silver cross

In the lane, snow is glistening

Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No man""
""But you can do the job when you're in town""

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

Outside to hear, the grizzlies left

 You're in the end of your time
 No future no past

 And you think your desires
 So may happen

 With just a touch of your hands

Grab your chest,
Feel your heart wanting to break through

Gauge out my eyes; 
Swallowed by color tortured slumer

A Rocket to the Moon,"It started back then in the summer ’07 making music in the old garage
Jumped in the jeep drove out to Arizona where we met a couple friends of ours
It was something in the water,
‘Cause now it’s getting harder and nothing’s gonna stop us now
With the soul Cal drummer,
And Dana’s little brother now we’re making our parents proud.

There’s a town in California where we keep our friends around
Made our way to Arizona never turned a party down.
And out in Massachusetts is where we meet up to hit the road.
Just shows how small the world really is
And we call it all home.

Drove out to Burbank thought we should sure take advantage of the winter time
Made a record and a plan,
packed up the van and it died every hundred miles
We almost got caught but we fooled the cops with a vegan in snake skinned boots
Made it to Philly drank a beer with a really cool dad who liked to get loose

Yeah we call it all home.

Spent the day off with Johnny and Josh
Making work seem more like fun
In Arlington Heights,
We stayed the night getting woken up by the sun
Out on the road wherever we go we never feel too alone
Making vans and hotels feel like home

Until we’re back in California where we keep our friends around
Make our way to Arizona never turned the party down.
And out in Massachusetts when we meet up to hit the road.

This soothing madness should keep me from going blind

Your name burns a hole in the spot where my mind used to be

Let me crash
Let me burn like a flare
Don't try to face me
Let all of this erase me
Every single moment
Sucking time from my veins

But still I'm taking in from the inside
Still I'm breathing nitroglycerine
Taking in from the inside
The primitive taste of what I could have been

Still I ache from the inside",From the Inside,1988
A Split Second,"Two statues in the dark
Frozen in time
Waiting for the list to blow
Waiting for the hate to show
Cutting of the claw that tears your velvet skin
Skin the feet that trod the petals of the flower in my arms
I hear you, feel you, breath, live you
Fight hell to hold you",The Last Wave,1988
A Split Second,"A startling sense of dislocation
Pushed away by voodoo crap
Spill your poison somewhere else
Can't shake the needles from your back

Guns and chains, emotional drains
Cutting it down to size
Captured by the Hindu curse
That hold your mesmerized

Slice my throat, stiletto knife
To keep my burning hope alive
The long black hair that smells the incense
Turns to vipers in my mind

You foul the pyramids with your presence
Holding in your tiny claws
The shakes that feed the witch with venom
Too late, no time to withdraw

Mambo witch

Sound of torture and vocal exhaustion
Barely concealed by telephone wires

Heal the wounds and lick the scars
Screw up your eyes to read your stars
She is free, I am ice
Bound to burn at any price

A Static Lullaby,"We've done our time (we've done what you said)
Twitch through the night (I wish I was you violation)
So hold on tight

I watch her spin out of control (she spins)
I watch her spin out of control (she spins)
I watch her spin out of control (she spins)
I watch her spin!

And we are the ones who held you tightly
(the trigger is cold as blood
And your pain is now my depression)
And this feels like heaven

The sin has become a massive piece of mind,
I guess I ran it over a thousand times in my head,
I can say I never felt this way
Because your violation was only skin deep
I've ended your pain and written my own ending
I'm guilty but flawless
If this is justice, I'm your jury
The chamber is loaded
And now I have the shotgun riding shotgun

Your open door (this pain will pull me through this)
That leaves you helpless (this sorry plea that leaves you helpless)
But life won't wait

Why can't I just gain control (she spins)
Why can't I just gain control (and she spins)
Why can't I just gain control (she spins)
While I watch her spin!

And we are the ones who held you tightly
(the trigger is cold as blood
And your pain is now my depression)

This feels like heaven! Heaven!
A feeling of grief
But life won't wait
She spins She spins She spins!

And we are the ones who held you tightly
(the trigger is cold as blood
And your pain is now my depression)
And this feels like heaven
And we are the ones who held you tightly

And your pain is now my depression)

A Static Lullaby,"In motion she swipes past your face
With a blur that bleeds into one
Embellish her with sight and sound
The stylish way to make someone
You love hit the ground

She swept me off my feet this time
Pray, says the needle to the thread
This is the perfect sound
And where we both collide
Pray, says the choir to the symphony

Strike up the sound
That's running through our veins
Like martyrs who take their lives
In the sacrifice for the ones that they love
I'm vulnerable, I'm spread out
And I'm facing the blade

Until our curves melt into one
I have to make these words
Carry after I'm gone
Her pictures line upon the shelf
The portrait smiles back around

Embrace, if I held her up to the light
What would I find out about
Expose, so reveals the secrets
Of my vixen in the scarlet dress
A life comes full circle

I guess we lost the war
They said we'd last forever
When we both collide
In silhouettes they see themselves
Like floating sheets from which they laid
The ghost shape takes form from who we are",The Collision,2006
A Static Lullaby,"So child, we have to see this through
The choking has you foaming at the mouth
Our bodies convulsing on the floor
Like a fish out of water
The price of wanting more

Epilepsy seems
seems safe enough for me
It's alright girl, it's alright

Contagious, contagious as this seems
And girl, you're catching on to me
Shut down, shut down, break away
And this is slightly what it's meant to be
The perfect line, the perfect time
When our bodies align

A pale smile struggles behind tears
While passion meets you striking at your face
Instantly we bottle our feelings
So tell me why are you crying
The price for wanting more

But then again it seems
You're safe enough for me
It's alright girl, it's alright

Contagious, contagious as this seems
And girl, you're catching on to me
Shut down, shut down, break away

What defines this man
What defines this man finding space in lovers' hands.

You got more

Her lips and
His caress

By the clenching of their fists
One body lie injected
Behind the others head

She weakens behind his eyes
She urns for him inside her
Collapsing by the bedside

You're up boy
Don't slow down
With constant temptations
Who said love
Its alright
Will become by the end of the night

With a cowards glare

That beauty soft

The beats mimicked by his thoughts
By his thoughts

May be a deadly

A Static Lullaby,"Stay and fill me up with something else
You're all that's left and I'll be
Picking up the pieces of our past
Like broken glass

Affection ruptures lonely nights
But I've always been the last in line
For romance
Captive among lonely hearts

Are all we are
Captive behind broken hearts
Are all we are
So lovely can I stay the night

And baby if I said that I'll be back tomorrow
This might be a bit shy from the truth
As lonely as the days that we begin to follow
Somehow we become those walls we build
Somehow we lose the urge to feel
Somehow I've become the lesser man

We become products of ourselves
Slave to despair
Despair to aspire
A real lovers love

The profound beating of this chest
A poetic type of touch
That reminds us who we are
The feeling, the rhyming rhythm

Recalling wounded thoughts
Still seeming a little tempted
To set these sheets aflame
As your eyes close
He finds that it's worth more
As he's slipping out the back door",Static Slumber Party,2006
A Static Lullaby,"Violent screams have me buckled down
From the way that it seems
We need a remedy
Embody me and kill this aching emptiness
These are just fantasies
Embalming me
As I sleep

What if you covered the face of the sun
I am just a man what gives me hope
I've shrouded the pain for too long
I'm under the gun
As I take a breath and take the plunge
We expose our fears
As these two cities burn
In the back of my mind
The will to move the will to die

So I guess these tombs are
More suited for the living

Behind the curse reveals a man
And I'm broken down
Is it just possibly
Revealing me
No time to breathe

What if you covered the face of the sun
I am just a man what gives me hope
I've shrouded the pain for too long
I'm under the gun
As I take a breath and take the plunge
We expose our fears
As these two cities burn
In the back of my mind
The will to hope the will to die

What weathers him in the night
And if misery shadows fate
Then I've been caught
Caught living on borrowed time
This is my life
Life on a splintering thread

Open my eyes
And blind this soul
Swing by the sway
Clinched to the thread
This is my life
At the hands of a serrated edge
Open my eyes
And blind this soul
Tear from my mouth
The most violent screams

What if you covered the face of the sun
I am just a man what gives me hope
I've shrouded the pain for too long
I'm under the gun
As I take a breath and take the plunge
We expose our fears
As these two cities burn
In the back of my mind

The will to move
It's almost time
The will to hope
It's almost time
The will to die",Trigger Happy Tarantula,2006

Did you think before you got it (I'm leaving for all reasons)
Every time you breathe I hope you think of me
Those are the words you told me, told me

No questions why'd I'd have to leave (I guess it's time to leave)
One reason I restored with sleep (I'll think of what I'll be)
This moment feels like destiny (I won't dare to eat)
Won't you tell me, tell me?

You want me to always remember
You promised I always will
You'll watch and wait for my return
You promised I'm coming home

For all the lonely nights when your not feeling alone
You'll taunt the midnight sky and wish the sunrise
This the life we live, the only one that we know, these things just never ends, never ends

You want me to always remember
You promised I always will
You'll watch and wait for my return
You promised I'm coming home

It's not the time to leave, its not the last goodbye (don't know I can't resist this)

I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart

Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start

She'll go floating around like a downtown ballroom gypsy
She goes great with ice cold beer or a shot of whiskey
Put one in my hand, her on my lips
Man, that's as good as it gets

Watching her sway and go

In ten minutes, she started yelling (come and get it)
And the gettin's were good
I said, I shouldn't eat, she said, I think you should
But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians
No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian
Strictly collard greens and a occasional steak

And other goodies that are filled with goop
With fried apple roots
Delectable delights, control my appetites

In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
She went lower than low, into limbo
A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo
She answered no, so she had to go...on with the program
Credence, it seems that I've forgotten your name
But it seems that she's done the same
And now something has happened
Suddenly, she's been distracted
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Now, I think you understand
Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
Right then and there, she fainted
A really grim picture is painted

Hey, Q-Tip

Had a lady queen, married since 18
He protested, that he was infested
Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it
All propaganda, one big fat lie
'cause I see the king with my very own eye
Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king
And popping up on the teammates scene
And popping and pimping on hunnies with moneys
Whole situation to me, was kinda funny
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
Caught the king scratching, so she had to assume
That he got vicked by the enemy's trick
The thought of cheating made the maiden so sick
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screaming
Threw a pot and his dome was beaming
You could hear him yelling in the motherland
""Baby, baby please. Baby, understand.""
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate, of the enemy

What we gonna do, save me and my brothers?
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that
We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?

Dance to this, your girl you kiss
I like fried foods, especially fish
Afrocentric, I'm electric
Socialistic and eccentric
Body's healthy, mind is wealthy
Thoughts, they flow, that will prepare me
To be a Native, get creative
Original and designative
Listen to the line that's playing
Listen hard to what Q's saying
Politicians are magicians
Make your vote, they hope your wishing
Ambiguous words, senseless verbs
They all amount to crap that's heard
Violent hip hop, money flip flops
Promoters won't book, but it still rocks
I'm a Zulu, yes, a true blue
Red Alert is with the poo-poo
Ozone layer, loses flavor
Here's the edge that you will savor

The economy, politics, police, everything
Except for the youth
But the youth about to come back

Alright, here they come
Uh oh, uh oh, uh!

With expressions and I'm guessing
19 years is a youthful lesson
Falling skies babe, open eyes babe
Can't you see what lays inside babe
Making mentions on this tension
Rhythmic loving, my profession
Hips, they gyrate, scripts I narrate
No banana, I ain't a primate
Ain't no soul glo, just an Afro
The head is bred to let the thoughts grow
Quest together, to lands of never
Sleet and snow and storms can't sever
Tribe is growing, never know when
For this time, six necks may show in
Dialogues have been accepted
Negatives have been rejected
That's the music, negro music
Is here for all, so you must choose it
Phonies fondle, watch it throttle
3-6-5 straight out the bottle
Busting caps, finger snaps
I prefer the second for ghetto tracks
Phife, Jarobi, Ali told me
Get the force like Wan Kenobi
Force his teaching, beats are screeching
Poly plateaus, we aim for reaching
Tribalization, freaks the nation
A mass of peers in celebration
Hopes been real high, since the knee high
Days of youth, feeling good and real spry
Avid combos, hear those bongos
Boom cacker boom, that's how they go
We ain't nomads, but we real glad
Hip hop slams through the nineties, no fad
As a rhythm, have been given
Hurry up, become, we breaking out, out

Yo when you bug out, you usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding

You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
'Comafied' your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind

Oh yo he's acting stank, really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you want to but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks

If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying, mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug

It was one MC after one MC

Or was it just because I used to swipe the women and all the girls

Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did

Supposed to be my man but now I wonder cause you're feeble

Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, Cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys, they know who they are
I was the B-ball playing fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match, her name was Flo
Yeah - I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me, like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playin' with my mind
The only thing I learned is, good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D I need somebody for me
Not someone who's mind is blank and tryin' to juice me for my bank
Swingin' with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that, yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I met my match
Was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settlin' down with one girl, wasn't tryin' to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used ta love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em, also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again, how would I know
After all this time tryin' to be a superhoe
She finally played me, but yo, I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter

Butter, like butter baby
Butter, like butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strickly butter baby, strictly butter

I remember when
Girls were goodie two shoes, but now they turned to freaks
Allofasudden ""We love you Phife"" ease of ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you goin', where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so hon, don't want me now
Here, here, take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from lookin' fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dyin' your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sportin' a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really loved yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
If you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me ""Diane made it""
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Tryin' hard to look fly, but yo, you're lookin' dumber
If I wanted someone like you I woulda swung with Jamie Summers
You want to be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sens-a-tiv-I-ty

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden,
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin'
It was I the abstract

And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter

Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like mister clean?

Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then push it along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk

Those fly routines on your cousin's block

So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack

Looking at Miss Lane, it was the fast lane
Barely knows her name, struck by fame
She just got a Benz, she rides with her friends
Gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
Rollin down the block, checking out the spots
She winks at the cops, always give her props
She knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her
Hangs out for the loot, makes her papes from the gutter
Tried to make my moves on Miss Lane, she called me young boy
Told her not to dis me I just want to be your love toy
You young boy, my love toy, I doubt that very highly
Just because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me
Business oriented, egos never dented
Always sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it
Distractions never hurt, always did the work
Always was alert, she never got jerked
Queen of the feats, thrive to compete
Love the funky beats while she drive down the street
She was justified, couldn't get a job
Had to feed her family, so she had to play, then rob
Pulling out the ooh wop, listening to doo-wop
You don't have to say a word
That's all ya heard

""Everything is fair when you're living in the city""

She's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner
Instead, I met her later, my love is much greater
Put me on her roster, to rid her of impostors
And to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler
Love is my motive, now I'm drug promotive
Plus I needed duckets to fill up my buckets
Supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
Now I'm missing action for this fatal attraction
But don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
And don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
'cause if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be
I'll be damned if I let a brother try to gas me
I played my cards well, try to live swell
For the G, I would sell, 'cause I was deep in hell
But then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin
Who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
Elaine, she kinda new, that I would do the do
But she didn't tear, I did my work with care
That's all that really mattered, he money never splattered
As long as she was paid, she was in the shade
You can't really blame her for holding on a flamer
Society taught her, but they didn't tame her
A ten clip salute, honey here's a troop
She will never stop until she reach the top

A Tribe Called Quest,"Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listening to hip hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of be-bop
I said, well daddy don't you know that things go in cycles
The way that Bobby Brown is just ampin' like Michael
Its all expected, things are for the looking
If you got the money, Quest is for the booking
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly modes
Still got room on the truck, load the back boom
Listen to the rhymes, to get a mental picture
Of this black man, black woman venture
Why do I say that, 'cause I gotta speak the truth man
Doing what we feel for the music is the proof and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bonafied strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
We deliver it each year on the street for the beat 'cause
You can find it on the rack in your record store(store)
If you get the record, then your thoughts are adored and appreciated
Cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishing out the plastic, do the dance till you spastic
If you dis, it gets drastic
Listen to the rhymes, 'cause its time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it baby
All the way to Africa a.k.a. The Motherland (uh)
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black Man (man)
Only if you was noted as my man (man)
If I get the credit, then I'll think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that (ass) (what?)
A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half (come on, come on)

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

You gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these Excursions so you must realize
Hip hop continually, about the Zulu
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what could you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a (bitch), brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be into this society
Everything is fair, at least that how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
It could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do to is know that the Tribe's in this sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

We gotta make moves
