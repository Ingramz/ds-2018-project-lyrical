Wonder Boy, shit

Yeah yeah

Let's show 'em some love
Welcome to Detroit

Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome you to Detroit City
I said Welcome to Detroit City
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good man they all say Tricky

Click click boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear 'em holla Goon Sqwad in this bitch
Let me hear you holla Goon Sqwad in this bitch
Let me hear you holla Runyon Ave. in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky
I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk, fuck that, bla bla
I'mma call that rude boy from Detroit, Trick Trick
Quick come pick me up, bring them guns
Come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil' fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie come get me, Wonder Boys what up doe I see you
Rock Bottom, yeah I see you, all my Detroit people
Where you at man, let me see them hands in the sky
Detroit motherfuckers 'till we die

Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome you to Detroit City
I said Welcome to Detroit City
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good man they all say Tricky

Homie it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
Marshall done called me to 54 and laced the track
This beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Sqwad
And gangsta been bangin' the underground since '95, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
Spent a quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
Wonder Boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house

Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome you to Detroit City
I said Welcome to Detroit City
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good man they all say Tricky

Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fucks with us

Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome you to Detroit City
I said Welcome to Detroit City
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good man they all say Tricky

Yeah, Trick Trick
Eminem, Wonder Boy, Shady
It's goin' down baby
Ayo Em, I got your back my nigga
Damn right I said my nigga
That's my nigga
Tricky",Welcome 2 Detroit [Instrumental],2005
Eminem,"Niggas didn't kill me
Now a niggas gon' get
Peel my cap back
I'm never at home
I'm somewhere
With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue
Sippin' Don Perignon
While she's sippin' up them newborns
Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga

Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
Than clappin' down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
(You copy?)

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now",Cry Now [Shady Remix],2006
Eminem,"Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or albino, yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think we just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep makin' them tired old threads
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf, yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go bad
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to it, and I was like (Oh Yeah)

See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere)

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep comin' back, it only means you know you lost a fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like 'Go get 'em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryin' to fight momentum?'
We just keep winnin', by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''
We ain't wire your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, Yes sir!
So full of joy, why am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yea boi don't curr'

See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere)

Yo' homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dawg, man life's not fair
Yo' friends shoulda known not to front 'round here
You see kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass, of your jewels, right here
Man I'm a say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Yo' girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You probably heard about me, I'm a shown up playa
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor
Ridin', winin', dinin' and shinin', know what I'm sayin'
I ain't got time for fuckin' around, and horseplayin'
I'm makin' hits, my homies takin' hits, who's stayin'

See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah)

Eminem,"Detroit, Motown
Hey guess what, they gave us the this year, and you know what happened?

Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)

Hennied up, ginnied up, ski mask, black truck
Dickey outfit, passenger side (pistol grip pump)
Fuck it I just did two lines, a chrome tech nine, it'll tear out niggaz spines
It's a party, go on in and have fun, 'cause after it's over
All you gon' hear is *gunshot* run nigga run nigga
Shootin', blastin', hittin' the floor
Ten-thousand in the safe, shit I'm 'bout to score
Cause I'm dangerous, off angeldust, shit I'll bust
Even the nigga that came with us
And this is for my nigga's that be robbin' and stealin'
Carjackin', murder one's, and fuckin' drug dealin'!

Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)

I stumble in the club blowed up, nine millimeter cocked
Something's telling me to stop, fuck it I don't see the cops
Nigga's don't believe until they see it's out
Stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
Beggin' me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that
Come out of them diamonds and you come out of that velor
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back up shit I could use it (ohhhhh)
I need the noise in case I have to let a couple off
Saw another icey chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that butter soft, and since you buyin' out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow
I'm out for the paper, my homie better hide the jewels
I'm in the game starvin', and I ain't playin' buy the rules nigga

Eminem,"In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed,
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are six critics
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an' I am not felling
You fuckers are not ready, 'cause I got jelly, like (Beyonce's) pot belly
This is destiny, yes money I'm of running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me
No apologies

My head hit's the pillow, a weeping willow, I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touched knees to elbow
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over, these cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough, so keep playing it and stand next to the subs
I choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
Fuck yeah I'm a basketcase and I mastered this rap shit, 'til my ass gets wasted,
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
Fourty four mags a fascination, a taste for disaster and if that's the case then

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me
No apologies

This song isn't for you, it's for me, a true MC
It's what it do just to see if he still has it
And if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a real MC
Got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly
You still agree, as long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an' mourning
So I'm warning you, don't coax me
It's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be fooled
The press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid
They don't know 'cause they don't see that I'm wounded
All they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'
An' they can suck my dick while I'm pukin', an' you too, you can

Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC
This is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies

Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC
This is how I'm supposed to be

Eminem,"I sense someone's tapping into my phones why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon
The F.B.I might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside of the window of my living room
And if they do you can say goodnight and bye bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
Blank stare dead pan look at my face as I gaze into space
As I wait to be scooped up in that van
Mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gon' say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the blood sucking leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the Fifth Amendment use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dying to fill out in the heroes splinters
The business way to end this I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flash back to September 7th
When Tupac was murdered in Vegas
He said that he predicted his own death
Let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By a craze lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know or do they?
Who's they for them to say touche
We're all vulnerable and it's spooky
This is about as kooky as I've ever felt now
Count down to Nuclear Meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nuttin'
When it's time it's your time
You are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy Number One",Public Enemy #1,2006

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!

Yeah, we should do something like that

There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeroes and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'til we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' dem pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex, a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this whack ass rap, kiss my black ass

Nah, Em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, the clean parts, to shitty parts,
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tear you're ass apart!

Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick,
Teflon wrapped on, 'case I get clapped on,
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home,
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows,
If I can whip the kick to spit sicker sick flows,
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it,
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it,
E'eryday Dre day, front and cause a maylay,
Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down,

There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control
Bobby Creek

I'm on the Patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone
Cause the D-J playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer
For any nigga wherevera
But I came here to get on goose and Tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice
In your caboose
Sippin' everything from white grain
To deuce juice
With nothin' to gain
But my grace and loose tooths

Bobby Creek is in the place
The name is Snoop too

I can make her spin around
If she keep her dinner down
Simmer down
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your ?
Come tickle my gumdrops

I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Get yo ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl
That will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

With a new rag
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
True that I had a few
Obie rollin' with brews
Annually knockin' the boots
It's on manual
The way I knock 'em outta they shoes

Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang

It's Shady
You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you
In the mansion
With a magnum
With a night pass to the matinee
Obie
Came to party
You better ask somebody

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow.
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo.
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo.
And possibly bend you over.
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor,
Smack that, give me some more,
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oooh.

Shortie if you wanna ride
You can ride on me
You can bump heads
And collide on me
Want beef damn right
Can rely on me
To ring the Campbell like Naomi
Just do that girl
And take it on easy
Take it all oiled up
And all greasy
'Bout that time
You start that teasin'
Way that you droppin'
Got me cheesin'
But for me you takin' all my money for real
I'd rather spend it on you right now
Than my homies bail
And I can see that's what you made for
And ain't never been no lame ho
But that booty bought and paid for
One move to you on my payroll

I love when you do it girl
Move to it like you used to it
Drop it down
I wanna put my thing to it
To the crib we go
Go fast and slow
Make it turn like a stripper
Slide down my pole
Shortie ass so slow
Got you boiled like whoa
One night with me
She wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no
Let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through
And tap that hole
Make it lose control
All the girls know
That I hit it right at night
I'm a pro
I only come round to get sexual
And she flexible
And I'm sexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that murk that work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine

Bobby Creek - you know what I'm saying
The ice in the watch
Reflects the light to her
The money quite green
And the ice like blue
The swag might kill her
So I say goodnight to her
She don't want me to leave
I can see right through her
So we dip out
Burn one trip back
Get low like Caribbean
Limbo then go
Out like light
Baby girl get right
Head so slow my hat don't fit right
We cruise in the car
Or we could take flight
The middle of the night
Make your body ache like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king
Cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care
Listen baby it's a fact
That
If you drop back
I'm a quarterback sack that
We can go deep
And I can shark attack that

And your hat at?

Eminem,"Shady, we're back!

Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that ""Renegade"" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi—
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big—ba—big—big bay—ba—baby

So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

Shady (Stat Quo!) we're back!

This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed
My kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him ""suck my dick""
Take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the ""Detox"" LP
Feet don't fail me

Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?

Shady!(Bobby Creek!) we're back!

Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't write yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'til I show I
Go out on a limb with Em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track nigga

Shady! (Ca$his!)

I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in the Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Prozac, D's and E-Pills, it's a wrap

It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody

I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me

I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet

OK children quiet down, quiet down 
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day 
His name is Mr. Shady 
Children quiet down please 
Brian don't throw that (shut up!) 
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute 
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (he's got aids!) 
Good luck Mr. Shady 
 
Hi there little boys and girls
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels 
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?) 
Say hi Bob! (""Hi Bob"") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom 
And he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot 
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot 
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock 
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks 
And even if they escaped and they got the cops 
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 
Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job 
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk 
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off 
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker 
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka 
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a ""Dr."" 
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her 
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander 
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
And what it might do to you 
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus]
See children, drugs are bad (c'mon) 
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man) 
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) 
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, O-K? 
 
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?) 
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? 
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world 
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it 
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid 
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back 
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back 
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold 
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys 
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper-drive 
And his eyes roll back in his skull 
His back starts tah, look like the McDonald's Arches 
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him 
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"" 
Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny 
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money 
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over 
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga 
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac 
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus]
 
And last but not least, one of the most humongous 
Problems among young people today, is fungus 
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff 
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.. 
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?) 
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair 
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire 
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?) 
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms 
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus 
Ya tongue gets, all swoll' up like a cow's tongue (How come?) 
Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!) 
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) 
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. 
They're gonna come for me and I'm a have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault 
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
Cause I'm bad for you 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Come on children, clap along (shut up!) 
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!) 
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) 
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin' penis!) 
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)

I just get on the track, and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody, as a stepping stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off, just left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there, with record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble, and respect myself
Say what up, keep stepping, and just rep D-12
Keep my nose clean and stay away from, weapons, jail
And living reckless, but if you gon' check my belt
You may see something else, I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Ruger, and deflect its shells
And send 'em back at you, faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops, that'll legally pop you
And I den seen a lotta people, cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja, must have lost his mind
That ex, got him thinking he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you, X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Just keep singing the same song, recycled
We all much rather get along, than fight you
Me and Halie dance to ya songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy will bite you
I hurt ya pride dog, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, wit syllable after
Syllable I'll just slap ya, killin' you faster
Then you popin' pill after, little pill of them tabs of
That shit you're on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns, we could charge harder than Busta
We bump heads, wit any motherfucka' that wants ta
So what's the, deal, what's with all the tough talk
When I walked up to you, like ""Ja, what up dog?""
How come you didn't say, you had a problem then
When you were standing there with all ya men
We could have solved it then, I'm a grown man dog, come holla
All you did was laugh then, smile and swallow
Another one of those little ex pills, in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything, that you wanna be, come on

[Chorus: x2]
I, know, you don't want it wit me
You, know, you don't want it wit me
You, talk, but soon we goin' see
You, don't wanna bump heads with me

(Tony Yayo!) You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja you Stuard Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week, I'm buying a new pistol
I clap at yo ass, wit this chrome .38
And put six through ya hats, that's seven and 3-8
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe, you bleed on the turnpike
You know and I know, who took ya chain
You got robbed two times, so ya ass a lame
I there to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies, with Steven Segal

[Chorus: x2]

(Lloyd Banks!) Fuck that I'm tired of hearing
These industry niggas starting to get outta hand
Like I won't find ya whereabouts, by stomp-ing 'em out ya man
You killing New York, even in Comp-ton, they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate up out the van, and
They see me pop up on icy, cause I could
You den lost yo money, prolly forgot yo way around the hood (hood)
Cause when you paranoid, it's hard to make good songs
How you want it wit' us, when half your artists got makeup on
Every magazine I open, you on ya knees, taking prayer pictures
And you ain't even get shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothing about what pain is sucka
I put yo ass to the ground, like a train conductor, motherfucker

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, nigga!
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath, G-Unit!

Looking like one of them puttie-cat dolls

Steps upstage, didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, shes like, ""you're""
I'm like, ya, I know, lets cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus, from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playing

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore,
Do you want more (more)
Do you want more (more)

Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight

Now what the hell are you waitin' for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more)

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

We deep as a motherfucker, we bout to get it crunk
You just another punk in the club about to get jumped
I settle my vendettas wit AK's, barettas
We don't 'posed to be in here wit our weapons but still they let us
Switch blade, brass knuckles, nickel plated belt buckle
Broken beer bottles, when we walk in you can smell trouble
Elbows flying, bitches crying, niggas bleeding
You retreating, running to your car and skating off, re G'ing
We examples outta you haters running yo mouth
You reason why you peoples is pouring they 40's out
Dirty Dozen wiling, beat niggas bloody
And you gon have to pour out a keg for all your homies!

I was raised by drunks so I became a drunk
80 Proof on this vodka, that's the name I want
I'm in the club to beef, you gotta murder me there
Only talk to a bitch, with burgundy hair
ON the Isle in the Vette, bumping Seven Duece!
See that top on that 40, you know it's coming loose
See me on the ave daily, be running this shit
If your chick get loud I'll G Money that bitch
Packing mags and clips, I'll smash ya clique
Because of Proof, they put the G in the alphabet
Smoking weed, drinking Henny, Remy and that Jimmy
Don't worry if you run out the corner store I got plenty!

Pour your 40 out! Guzzle it!

Ready or not here we come, here comes trouble in the club
11,12,13, pistols big as M 16's
How the fuck we sneak in with this many heaters in our jeans
Nina, 2 nina's, a peace and they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one they gon' think its machine guns
Vanos vo vano, bananas in our flannels
Hands around our colt handles, hold them like roman candles
Vannas vo vannas, banana fanna fo fannas
Who come back all bananas, banna clips loaded
Managers, bouncers and the club owners, the motherfuckers don't want us
To come up and rush in the club and run up in it with a bunch of
Motherfuckers from Runyan, steady popping them onions,
Ready set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixing to get into some shit just itching to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mixing coke with coke and nut rum up
Yeah Yeah oh, what up, see my people throw shit up
See you talk that hoe shit now when you down you don't get up
And can't sit up your so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater no heater, automatic no matic
Mac or no mac it don't matter if I have or don't have it
You never know what I'm packin' so you just don't want no static
And open up a whole can of whoop ass you don't wanna chance to
Risk it no biscuit, mili mac a mac milli
Really homie don't be silly, homie you don't know me really
You're just gonna make yourself dizzy wonderin what the dealy
Fuck it lets just get busy D Twizzys back up in the hizzy!

Git Up Now!
Lets get it cracking, Git, Its on and popping
Its D12 is back up in this bitch, uh, there ain't no stopping
We're gonna get it crackalatin
What you waiting for the waiters orders
Say no more for trying to play the wall and quit hating
Git Up Now!
Notice you're sitting, what the fuck is you deaf
You motherfuckers don't listen, I said,
We bout to get this motherfucker crackalatin'
Quit, procrastinating
What the fuck you waiting for get off the wall and quit hating


I keep a shit load of bullets a pitbull to pull it out
And automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth be closed permanently
You get burned until I quickly you can not hit me niggas to terrified to come get me,
Tempt me if you think Swifty won't send a slug, people run,
When the reaper comes, the repercussions' gon' leak your blood,
Inglewood, steepin' without a weapon, you leave, you gone,
I'm still runnin' with stolen toasters while on parole,
Snatch you out our home, like eviction notices hoe,
When I unload, I'm known to never leave witnesses to roam,
When I'm blowed, I'll write the wicked in scroll,
At the toll, when I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, nigga.


Now it's proven it's about to be a misunderstanding
In furniture moving, bullets flying, lawyers & mothers suing
Cause niggas don't know the difference, you bitches just stick to fiction
It's sickening, you can't even walk in my jurisdiction rippin' it,
Grippin' the pump and who wanna fuck with a walking psychopathic
Pyromaniac shady cats with 80 gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst a
And since you jumpin' in front of everybody you gon' get it first
I disperse the crowd with something vigor and versatile
So go on and record you verses now while you got a mouth,
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle,
Kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my equittle,
And a glock that ? stop you from waking,
Bullets'll hit your liver, I'll even shoot native Americans,
A ? nigga, we back in you life and back in your wife,
Hit you in the back with a knife and get it crackin' tonight.

Git Up Now!
Lets get it cracking, Git, Its on and popping

Eminem,"Woo, damn
There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy
I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down
Where the bar at?

Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more focus, hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw a Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite here to ""Cheers""
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepare for a player, who workin' with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait, let's Escalade to the nearest Super Eight
Until your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks
Come on

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
And she caught me starin'
And my homies darin' me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla 'cause I got a lot of DeNiro (DeNiro)
The DJ's playin' Obie's song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin' home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't want to be headin' home
With some double D's full of silicon
Ten hood rat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Bustin' at the bitches screamin' ""off to they rides!""

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

Okay rolie polies everywhere
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin' and she got me fearin'
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally
Like a box of Cherrios
Carry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses petite, no window drapes

Word to mother, they god damn Okra and beans
Got ya Oprah and jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

Eminem,"How come we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now
After all the years we been down
ain't no way no how, this bullshit can be true
We family and ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

So young, so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you weres ridin i went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When ronnie died you weres right by my side with a sholder to cry on
Tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood i did
Sometimes i just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours
And mine i survived it, you ran the streets, i 9 to 5'd it
We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then i blew up
To both yours and mine surprises
Now i feel the vibe i just can't describe it
As much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold, you touch its like ice
In your eyes is the look of resenment
I can sense it, and i don't like it

It was my dream at first to be on spittin a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got burst
So i came out i woulda killed a nigga first
Before i let him disrespect me and check me over some worste
Some bitch that i wasn't with i would hit her then quit
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her
Comin out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk
Like why'all was husband and wife or somethin
But me catchin you fuckin other niggas musta hurt you pride or somethin
'cause you won't fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me
When all i tried to do was show your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced
You actin like i ain't you man and lyin like she can't be loose
But i am really you friend, i'm jus trying to tell you the truth
But don't hate the game or the player
'cause the one that is changing is you

You're only at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
Homies in the hood only she be on the tube
Only gossip on the porch get to speakin on who
Fools i used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it jus happen
But PROOF is jus actin out the party was stoned
Shady made it so my babys ain't starvin at home
See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends
Whenever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives
And wastin my times with these snakes in disguise
(how come) when you talk its with bitter is fight
And (how come) it's my fault for what you did with your life
And everytime i go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face",How Come,2007
Eminem,"I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my God it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem""
""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock""
""Please Marshall please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back

Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code

Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man

You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this s*** for zone 3

F***, I just hit a jogger
People lookin' like frogger
They hoppin' out the way whenever they see Marshal's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black, permanent marker
And left the rest of the car color cover like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin' but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they're crumpin', the way they're tumbling
I gotta do something
But soon as I hit the carwash, to get the tar off
Then it's right back at it tomorrow
They're like dad, this is in, so get with the trend
This is for the pimps, listenin' to MIMS, nail polish on the rims
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show

Its ironic kind of s*** that we buy man
Make us psychotic
Threat to corporate America, then why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant look at what hip hop den done
Its allowed us to run a business, we should of made it our money
Got us out the ghettos, relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me Oprah honey I'm sorry really I promise
But n***** b****** and hoes do exist I'm just bein' honest
But why am I bein' punished why is you so astonished

Look look, I've come from a different crew
You fuck with me, I'll get to you
A clip or two, I'll put through you

Now tre pound or 44
Pick a strap the Tec, the Mac
The hawk I'll stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name
And where you rest, I'll make a mess
The hollow tips hit ya chest
Call for blood to E-M-S
Come pick you up
You know you fucked when
You get on a stretcher
'Cause I'll come in to ICU
To see you off to heaven
The system I done been through it
There's nothing new to me
They locked me up they let me out
You seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals
Why they up in corrections
They come home, get a 9
Nigga commit trying perfection
It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistic
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's going terrific
Get so close to your target that it's really hard to miss it

Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac-10s'
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I said I got my knife pulled, I'll kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry

I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, he bleeding wheezing, breathing he half dead
He must ain't know, but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn

Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, cause the rest of her, I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub

When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I said I got my knife pulled, I'll kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry",Psycho,2009
Eminem,"You are now listening to the sounds of...Shady and...Alchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist...

Got an axe in the duffel bag, couple of fags,
Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged,
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh,
Couple hustler mags, now grab the pez dispenser,
Fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers,
The governor of Alaska, She lusts when I ask her,
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh,
While we hover over Nebraska,
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture,
In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster,
She's screaming grab my titties, shady suck on those bastards,
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after,
I'm a gigolo, But Ya'll look like the juggalo rapper,
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper,
Shit, Back down,
Man I'd rather lick on a scrotum,
And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra,
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg, Sizzle with Oprah,
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa,
Getting home and play dick swords with the Jonas...Brothers,
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers, Like no other,
I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's...

Its chemical warfare, Drop bombs like sadam,
I'm bringing the drama, Like Barrack Obama,
Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the Octo Mama,

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck

Blow it like its supposed to be blown

And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call

In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness

Ain't no question who about to kill 'em

Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act

I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover

There they go, packing stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow
We can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save

You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again, not again!

It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
Days that I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of the Jack, my last Vic and-a-half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, ""I oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun""
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause

Was red wine, more red wine, and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up an in between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what's ever happened to us, why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really ask for much

A nasty breakup with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want to bag ya punk

Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rappin' pump
Zappin Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that ya want

Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips, with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
I know some shits so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, copy, one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking manservant
Follow me around, and wiping my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Haha Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell

Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
But take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid
To wait but I know to unpack his bags
Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid, Aunt Edna always told me
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably a hundred and ten percent different

Even if it sounds corny,
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful",Beautiful,2009
Eminem,"So this is it
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert

I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it

Every CD critics gave it a three, then three
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorce, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least

A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold",Careful What You Wish For,2009
Eminem,"As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nighquil then I salivate
Start off with the Nighquil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate
Too a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Look at my daughters face
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Dorritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat

Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a f***in' year
And that f***er still talks to me he is all I can f***in' hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
Too have another half of gla** of wine sound asinine
Ya I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
S*** must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow what the f*** happened last night where am I
Man f*** am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
S*** half a Vicodin why can't I?
""All systems ready for take off please stand by""

Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this s*** if Deshaun didn't die
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new f*** it what would Elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from two homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
That's an Ambian each nap how many Valium, three
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken four years just too put out an album B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the Nomonia thing
It was bologna was it the Methadone ya think
Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your vcr tape cases with you Ambian CR great places to hide ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor

Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

Eminem,"Morning, Marshall
Morning, Doc
So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?
Anxious
Anxiety?
Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world, nervous
Nervous? Come on, Marshall, you're a big boy now, sounding like a bit of a baby
You can do this; you found a sponsor yet?
Um, not yet, I mean, but when I get back
Well, if you find one, you find one; if you don't, you don't
Well, yeah, I mean, I gotta start going to meetings first and
Wait, what?
Well, I mean you don't absolutely have to go to meetings
And it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule
I know you're a busy person
Well, yeah, but I thought sobriety was the most important thing?
So what else are you thinking?
Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps
And, I mean, learning them, and start being able to apply them
The steps?
Yeah, the steps
There's a lot of them, aren't there?
Well, twelve
Christ, I don't even know them all
Really?
Anything else?
Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like
What do I do if I find myself in a situation where
Maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?
Take a drink
What?
Take a drink and, you know, take the edge off
Take the edge off?
Man, if I ever take a drink, I already know what that's gonna lead me to
What, you mean these?
Man, what the fuck?
Marshall, what's the matter, darling?
Having some doubts are we?

You'll never leave me, Marshall
We'll always be together, Marshall

You see that chick in the gym checkin' me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast where the heck is it now?
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'open sesame' mouth
Down the hatchet, the feelin' you can't match it
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
I tac-tac-tacin' the whore with the damn hatchet
I nap-sack-pack with like forty some Xanaxes
Shorty come back, I'm tryin' to score me some lap dancers
I'm 'bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula forty-four and forty's with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating baby my little friend's waitin' to say hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin' like Jell-O
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Yea

My equilibrium's off, must be the Lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extracurricular
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of one fifty one
Fifty one people asleep in my damn livin' room
'Scuse me hun, but what was your name, Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there doesn't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiendin' for some
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum

Umm

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Oh, Those were the days they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' the curtain for good
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)
I second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He no longer gettin' the three hundred bucks for these Perk-idans
Buster's gettin' to be where he lustfully surged it in
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin' him'
Childishly on the phone tryin' to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumblin' back
Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard somethin' go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just bustin' my own chops while I'm bustin' a rap
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it' I'm back

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow

After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said ""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead""
""Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset

I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything, except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah mainiac, that's Shady dog
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog

It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
It's my sector homosexual dissector
Come again rewind selector
I said nice rectum
I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lector in the guy sex and I bet ya
I tantalize ya in the less than five seconds I get ya
They said once bitten n twice shy
We lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills for my dresser
It's my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester
Drop, kick the bits before a second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter the ni yeser
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her

Crazy glue in Madonna to

Imagine if visual for that man
Who woulda thought
Could ever be such a relentless prick
And leashin' his fingers
For the chicks who waltz
She looks like she outlived her life sentence

Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow

Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate
And which motel which lake they found her in,
And how they attacked the victim,
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,

Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,
He can give her some, she can give him some
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos eyes

If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
Cause your just dyeing to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' bout' Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition I mean right
Nope, Paul Wall is dope and so's Bubba
But, but, But....
But I don't compete wit nobody
I just go hard do the rope a dope ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents do donuts
Sometimes I play possum like I'm asleep it's awesome!
I'm like a sleeping giant and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta no where and bite prey
And sink my teeth in and fill em' full a poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill em'
And let em' know I just don't feel em'
And smack em' with the backward E the' Eminem emblem
I was taught if your gonna murder somebody you should face em'
Tell em' why look em' dead in the eye then waste em'
And the dark shall emerge from the firey depths of hell
And swallow the shallow the hallow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell there souls
For this rap game and it goes

123 check,check 123, check 123
That aint the hook now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say
My public adores me!
Everybody bores me they just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror glows lips and it whispers come nearer

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay
Alright, aight, aight, aight, aight
Yo, yo
Aight, I'ma lay the chorus first
Here we go now

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom, my mom, I know you're probably tired
Of hearing 'bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
""What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fucking seat for?""
""Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffing ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer""
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleeping
What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Now just wait 'til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fucking face without even tasting it
You better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fucking place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid""

My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high what I'm high on

'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh

Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happening
A tragedy, the fucking past ended up catching me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' Aspirin and say that it has a headache
""Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it""
But I don't need it ""Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up""
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though

Eminem,"Good evening!
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please, undo your seat belt for takeoff
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

I'm Dre from back in the day from
NWA from black and the gray from
Choking a bitch to smacking her face from
Stacking up bodies to
Racking their kegs up from
Racking a bitch to
Stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry
And I'm back with a tapeworm
And we was happening and rapping and tame at me
Shady for us competition
Faggot, there ain't none

Speak of the devil
It's attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun run, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon?
No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon
A great one
Wait, the day ain't funny man
It's urgent
I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless
A nice environment
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicadin
Before I begin to get so high; pussy boy, I could spin
Fin, fin
Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin
I show you every inch grows of my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch, throw up, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse, if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)

Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

Nah uh, he ain't playin'
He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane
Vodka and kreatine
Hypnotic and red bull
It's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings
I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl
You won't catch me, CSI
It's as easy as pie
And as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make them tremble and shake

Now put your smoke up in the air
And raise your henny and coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Lets get into it
You smoking with the triest and truest
I got the Midas touch
When it comes to rolling shit up
You motherfuckas ain't smoking
You just holding shit up
Now here we go
Let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Cuz if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees

Well puffing ain't enough for me
Fuck yeah, light it up Cheech, come on
Smoke me out, cuz
Give me contact buzz
Get me on track
They love me when I'm on that stuff
But this earth calling Shady, man come on back (what?)
Man we're losing him; he won't even respond back (fuck! )
Now look at all the pretty women in here
(Damn bitches)
Dre, it's hot
I think we better go check on their temperatures
I give them the thermometer
You get the bandages
Now baby just bend over
This won't hurt a damn bit,

And give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)",Old Time's Sake,2009

Same song and dance
Damn girl everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight

I'm looking at you yeah girl you're kinda taken back by
The whole rapper thing aren't ya?
Probably think you'll get slapped so damn hard ya
Wont even be able stand up straight aren't ya?
A couple rape charges people think you're a monster
The police constantly buggin' you non-stop
I walk up on you, well hello Tonya!
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You outta gas, do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back, why don't you put your laundry basket in the back?
And sit up front, I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a wrap
In broad day, no masks for this attack
I heard them say exact opposites attract
If that's fact it'll take task force to get you back

Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance
You'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song
You'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got
Give it your all
Look at you bawl
Why you cryin' to me
Same song and dance

The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four to six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
On nickelodeon flashed to little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in son
Look her she comes I'd better put out the big guns
""Hello Lindsay you're looking a little thin, hun'
How about a ride to rehab? get in cunt!
Starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wencher, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would have already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her with sixty six inches of extension chord

Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance
You'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song
You'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got
Give it your all
Look at you bawl
Why you cryin' to me
Same song and dance

My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts and skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me and made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs
But what was really going on was that I had developed a crush,
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant's tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'm a tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight it's the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell, like ""hello my love""
I just picked your prescription for ceriquill up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one ever since at schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little girl
You hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
Come on toots give me the Valium alley-oop, I'll slam dunk it in your mouth till you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm about to make a new outfit outta you
A new outfit? shit I'll make a new suit outta you, shoot
Now show me how you move baby, do how you do

Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance
You'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you

But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go God only knows
Stay wide awake

Fe fi fo fum
I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark it's winter in December
I see my target with my car and park it and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore your the kinda girl that I'd
Assault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wida
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I mite flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian girl now lets see ya have triplets and I'll
Disintegrate them babies as soon as that out her with formalda-
Hide and cyanide girl you can try and hide you can try to scream louder
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta

So dark and so cold my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide n' seek like Jason I'm so hungry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but Gee why does she taunt me
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front see
So blatantly but silently cuz I know that she's sound asleep
Who's wakin' me so violently and why is he on top of me
He's rapin' me she try's to scream somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me he's biting me he's laughing likes it's funny
She's scrapin' me she's fightin' me she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin' me no dice ya see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me man life can be so empty

Better try to stay wide awake or you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep bitch your soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away why do they try to fight today
I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools how 'bout now are you in the shower
Scour you for six hours till outage your power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Power there's no one fowler bound ya the tub they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power such prowess look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' star wars
Jabba the Hut be di bye bye, be di bye bye it's time to die die
Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien bath me in holy water
Melting like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt there's no fun in that here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' him up with that
What was that dial nine-one-one someone's comin' in from the back

And I'm such a tortured artist, let me make music about it
And my tragic love life!"" Am I on to something here?

Captain of a cult, with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a trick or treat holiday
Have Michael Myers looking like a liar
Swipe his powers, replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a forty, stuck a suppository up his ass
And made him tell me a story, gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetables section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krugar, and Edward Scissorhands too
Then came out with a little scratch, oh
Looking like I got in a fucking pillow fight, with a triple back goose
Insanity? Can't it be vanity, where's the humanity
In havin' a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it
Cut your fuckin' head off, and that's where you headed off to
Get it, headed off to? Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco

Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run to now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground",Underground,2009
Eminem,"It fits perfect

Better watch out sucka now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught comin' and I'm packin' in my lunch a
Buncha missle launchers 'n a buncha contra
Ban-van full of ganja, now come on ja-
Man stop! Man said, ""Marshall, Oh-my-God, ya
Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quad-ra-
Polegic, boogyin' down to Frank Sinatra.""
Lindsey to the Lohan, naked while you let me watch ya?
Who'd a knew the pew'd a do to me what it's done?
Such sin-a-sism when it isn't in my system.
Blunt-igmatism betta spliff up to my lips son,
So much on my hands, I gotta give my kids a fist-bump.
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks,
""Mista, help me""'s what he said to me, and then sunk.
Women, skinnin' them and cuttin' them up in chunks,
In clumps, the woman with cocoa-butter skin once.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawlspace.
How the hell did he fit, em all into such a small place?
Hide em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?
Well fuck it then, I've got nothin' but time- I'll wait.
Until it dries, for the moment I guess you're all safe.
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's outta gas, my regular saw ain't.
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin',
You can even hear the evil spirits comin' from within.
Someone's in the back of my damn house rummagin',
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin.
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryin' to fight? You will never win.
Severin' legs, arms, damn there goes another limb.
Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Now, what ya know about Buffalo Bill?
Nothin', so chill.
Fuckin' hoe, ya better fuckin' hold still.
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill.
Cut em, gut 'em 'n just get to stuffin' those girls.
Man,I think she had enough of those pills,
So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal,
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearin' voices, like ""Wouldn't ya like to go an get your butcher knife,
And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers
Into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her
What ya usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?""
""In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin' into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are.""
I'll be sure to Gin-sue ya til there's no more skin to ya.
Boo-ya, who ya think your fuckin' with?
Duck, because here he comes again.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.

Tie a whore up with barbed wire, nothing but a broad boy,
I'm the real deal, and char-broiler on the bonfire
And Bon Voyage bitch, I'm like Chef Boyar-dee in this bitch, 
Send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for ya, boy you think your Tom Sawyer,
Til I pull you out the fucking story book and stomp on ya,

So kick your shoes off,

And siyanara see ya fuckers tomorrow,
Get some R and R and marinate in some marinara,
And have a coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar,
Whip ass on ya, that's the last straw your hoping to draw,
Yeah you fresher than most boy, I'm just doper than all boy,

I destroy you boy, fuck around and blow ya to Sod
Oh my God boy, you didn't go there, no you did not,

When the bomb drops boy does it drop,
And when it does boy there's a problem

And to that boy who done said it,
Who said he was better,

Back better than ever,

I'll settle vendettas a little later,
Giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
By saying Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You 'bout a foot in the grave, stay put and behave
I'm bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day
So hey wouldn't you say I'm the shit,

Eminem,"All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement, haha
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough that you shame me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows Dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all horny cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it fake it
They get so mad, when I call them both fagots
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the wiener schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the shizer, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussy's queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre

Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling stop!

This must be all that there is, this must be it

Eminem,"Yo, yeah girl,
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you?

You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep
Round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)

I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)

I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippin's,
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above,
Forced and treat 'em all ? stingy I've become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera
Stand back, cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

Blood curdlin' you're gurglin' on your blood
What I do for my next trick
I'm filling one duffle
I think I might just do something a little less subtle
Shove a fucking tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her laying a blood bath
While I put a catheter in
And jump in the bath with her
In my spider-man mask man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon

They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm trying to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fucking far in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studia
Now who do ya think is more fruitier
Wiener smothered in peanut butter putting on a tube of ya eye shadow and man it look nice
You should have seen it mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card
Then I'll go meet Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosy on over to Rosie O'Donnell's
With McDonald's jump on her lap and watch the Sopranos

Grab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back boom
Assuming the fact that dudes in the back room
Using the bathroom vacuum and a raccoon
Skewing a rat or cat screwing a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom
You should be glad he didn't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance I'm back doing my dance ooh
But there afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing
Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for
Why you make her read eighty four bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
Cos I'm scared there's monster's under my bed

You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the E.R., we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no not even CPR from the EMT's
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?

It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt

You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts

You know I can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals

As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go

Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' ho

We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick
Right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets

The moment you've all been waiting for,
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds,
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred a**aults, and four murders,
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:
Slim Shady!

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, b****es hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us.
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.
B****es lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the s***
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I'll be dammed, just f***ed around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
N**** on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a f***
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf***er I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the s***
I gets what the f*** I want so what I trick
Fat a** burgundy bags cla**y s*** Jimmy Choo shoes
I say move a b**** move

You're a, rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who (chicka) made you

Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac or ant'-acid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic, is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashians a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive Gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then Squish it, then pass it to her friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can
Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see your grin (Now come in girl)

Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Excedrin
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Brit forget K-Fed let's cut off the middle man
Forget him or your gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention
A little did I mention, that Jennifer's in
Love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim

I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you
Damn girl I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Lord help us he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about to flip
Jessica rest assure, Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake

With a saw blade in it to make my jail break

She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness

Big fame, big chains

Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac

Fresher than the harvest

If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last

As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow
We can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

(Dreamin', of fallin, dreamin', of fallin')

Let's pretend like its '98
Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (ok)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that 
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it, 
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
He slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that

Eminem,"On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
'Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie

Just as long as you don't call me bro'

But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight it's over with that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote

I said it's over with that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight its over with that's all she wrote

Its stupid how I'm going on everybody knowing that
I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they cant beat than with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing it was this hot
Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone
High stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on
Ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's, you can see me in the night time
I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind

Your staring straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and egg smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known I was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's coming up after I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib,
Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But I wont buy her a soda
Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Satans cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pulling five molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gassed teddy you're already bi-polar

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold

Its never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow

The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Ya life is sure a bitch
But she know I'm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again,
I kick this shit, they get to pouring in
Peso, Euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain
Never gon' see me toting anything
All you gon' see is bang!
Its so nice where I kick it,
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you niggas still can get it
Its all over 'fore you finish
Sorry bro this road we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

Yeah I guess life is a bitcha ain't it Tip
And this one can say this shit
Shirt off my back, I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now,
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time in it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophes on it dog
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon' tell me that the A & W
Ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the ""F"" on dog

And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I'm as strong as they came
They were gone 'fore they came
Now I don't wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why (why, why)

Eminem,"I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a n****
But soon for a n**** it be on, mu'f***a'
Cause all the bulls***, just made me strong, mu'f***a'

So I pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
B****, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth Motherf***er
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, Motherf***er
I'm gone
Motherf***er, I'm gone

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on yo f***in' head, ha ha
B****, I'm a pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth Motherf***er
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, Motherf***er
I'm gone
Motherf***er, I'm gone (I'm gone)

It hurts, but I never show,
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ""f*** 'em all""

Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes, got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that f***in' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-F***ed this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
F*** this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these f***in' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your f***in' heads better nod
Or I'm a F*** around in this B**** and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, B****, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible
Hulk, you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your f***in' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce and olives
I'll f***in'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
B****, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head

Haha, woo!

Girl, I think you just might've tried
To pull a motherfuckin’ fast one, I’m mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade?
Tryna play games? See this saw blade?
See this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway?
Better cooperate or get sauteed
And rotisseried while you’re hog-tied
MC’s get so quiet
You can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin’ Fall Guy
I don’t gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin
And run over kids, women, and men, vrin vrin!
Motor so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin’?
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it’s gonna cost me a pretty penny?
Shit, if I think a penny’s pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while he’s tryin' to roll a snowball
But don’t make him lose his cool
If he hollers, better let him go, y’all

'Cause (You don't own me)
Now here we go, go, go

Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah, honey, you called?
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it
Evil, I see, hear, and speak it
Lady, put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin’ chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin’
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in
So bad, you’re gonna have Kurt Cobain askin’
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable, and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag’s asshole
Now let’s take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he’s cool with it
Don’t stand there and look stupid at me
Bitch, I ain’t in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it 'til it pops up
Y’all are so motherfuckin’ full of shit that you stopped up
Me, I’m always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth
'Til your speakers crap out pft, huh, what?
Girl, you got a hot butt
Like a lit cigarette (chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But you won’t get a hot fudge sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut, because–

Now here we go, go, go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore, I know you want more
Bitch, it’s time to put the math back into Mathers
'Cause I’m a fuckin’ problem, run, boy!
Every flow, got it mastered
So every last word that you fuckin’ fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass
Yeah, in other words, I’m a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank, yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse, I really don’t feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous
Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism
Can't resist him now, can you, ho?
“Shady, I don’t understand your flow”
Understand my flow? Bitch, I flow like Troy Polamalu’s hair, boy
Don’t you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I’m raw, you ain’t even medium-rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
You can look, you can stare, and point
But you can’t touch, I’m too clairvoyant
I don’t get it, man, is there a void?
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, I’m back with some shit for that ass

Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing 'em
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'm a take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
Its unfortunate but its

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
I can not moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh,
Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your as addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away
I'm addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time I'm a
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list

I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack

Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum

His bridges, he out grow'd em
He's so out cold he's knocked out of the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigamortis and post-mortem

Take your best rhymes, record 'em
Then try to flaunt 'em
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers

While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce

I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch

Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick

I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer

See he's in a whole 'nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it, you were just in his C-D's
Laugh at infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast

Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
Screaming the wood off the panel
And cussing the pain off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these brauds
He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the LeBron so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out ah
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can get a belt or neck tie, to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman girl
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
And while I'm being poetic let me get a stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these winners and lords

Eminem,"I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

Lately, I really
Feel like I'm, rollin' for delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself
I sincerely, apologize if all that I sound like
Is I'm complaining, but life keeps on complicating
And, I'm debating on, leaving this world this evening
Even my girls can see that I'm grieving
I try and hide it but I can't
Why do I act like I am all high and mighty
When inside I'm dying, I am finally realizin' I need, help
Can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been having ups and down
Going through peaks and valleys
Dilly dallying, around with the idea
Of ending this shit right here
I'm hating my reflection
I walk around the house trying to fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah
I look fat, but what do I care
I don't give a fuck, only thing that I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid that if I close my eyes then I might see her, shit

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom
Napping at noon, yeah dad's in a bad mood
He's always snapping at you
Marshall what happened that you
Can't stop with these pills, and you've falling off with your skills
And your own fans are laughing at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle
Get up, be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart, ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, nobody, he'd fight first
But dwelling on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping Vikes, Percs, and Methadone Pills
Yeah Em tight verse, you killed it
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like Yes-Men
And they gon' do whatever I says, whenever I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it I guess then

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

(Don't know what I'm going through,
But I just keep on going through changes)

My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame, and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you
Whacha want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse, and the truth is
Fame is starting to give me an excuse
To be at a, all-time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watching the same damn D-V-D of the
First tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts, so I fast forward
Sleeping pills would make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfucking right
I ain't slowing down for no one
I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on dole 'em out
Daddy don't you die on me
Daddy better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down

Plus somehow I'm pulling through
Swear when I come back, I'm ma be bullet proof
I'm a do it just for proof
I think I should state a few
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
See it just hit me, that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things that I would have never got say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailey this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'll do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things, to explain
When it rains, guess it pours, guess it does
Wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers
Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost as if to say
I miss you sub-consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say

But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Shit's gonna get thick again, they say the
Competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom,
Look at these rappers, how I treat them so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em yeah
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute,
Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place

That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow

I hog tied a hoe, tied her in a bow

Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spiderman throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo Rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blisterin' assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost

Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws

If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
""Vietnam vet"", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute

And why the fuck am I yellin' at air?
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho, yeah

I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go,
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh!

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad

Eminem,"We touch I feel a rush
We clutch
It isn't much but its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust its torturous,
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you and love is ""evol""
Spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mofuckin' hos
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this,
I've tried in this department but
I ain't had no luck with this,
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I gotta hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Something I wont go until you toy with my emotion so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breathe away
Your a supernova, and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think is
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take,
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open, that I wont be makin' a mistake

('Cause I'm a) I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts,
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you,
Let down my guards swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin' I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezin' til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason , I could think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you just go and just give
Before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you",Space Bound,2010
Eminem,"Ayo, before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through, growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too,
God it feels like I'm going psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying
You're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem
You're crying out for help

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though I don't see nobody else 
(I guess I keep talking to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them it's you you fucking baby
Quit worrying 'bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fucking going crazy

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself

Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowing up, oh and I'm blowing up 
All over my life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.i. Keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slaying 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like 
I struggle with this shit every single day and um

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?

Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else. I'm back! Ha ha",Talkin' 2 Myself,2010

Better watch out (now)

'Cause we ain't come to hurt no one (one)
So err'body come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone (one)

Now first of all I'm a boss
I just wanna get that across
Man even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche
Garbage bag on one of the windows
Spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here come on get him
If you dames want 'em
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him?
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now could I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Now, get up, dance!

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow I'll prolly still be too high to get outta bed
Til I feel like I been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot to kill like I'm hollerin' ""Die Santa!""
Miss the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you pawlin'
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for them ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west, but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, 'cause homie that hood's tighter then Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
C'mon

Now you can do this on your own

If you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck
You weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood
Now honey, don't let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
'Cause girl I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and
Make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece 'a dry pita
I'll be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground
And flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell ya now
I'm so raw I still need to un-thaw
You feel me, y'all?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car

Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit hisself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself

So I'm a fuck til I die, yeah I'm a do it to death
And itstead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'm a need two mics
Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyming and bust it and excuse the corny metaphor
They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process

But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways

Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards

I'm on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below
Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same with you
I woulda never came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up and spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me nah Doodi you're not layin' on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through

You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away

Could of made you anticipate auch an ass-whipping, okay

You get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on

Cause they want in on the act, there's a cognac bottle
We snuck it in cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like ""This guy might hurt me""
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose
Pussy the louder you yell the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes

Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing
My signature ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick it's Bizarre
Shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

Y'all ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac

Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'

So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing O when you see him, oh
Damn, baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident
And bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!

Because I murdered her, so you can call me
Nickel to O.J. to Glove

Just waiting to be hooked to IV as Mumm-Ra's
Well, when you look at my pee
And this joint no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose
After they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edimminem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked
And your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla, they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Y'all starting to creep in, everyday its so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em

And I don't know if I was awake or asleep

All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breath new life in me
I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me it'll enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick

You come to me with ideas
You say there just pieces so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and its almost like your begging for my help
Like I'm your leader
Your supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more,
I demand you remember who you are
It was you, who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more

You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said they was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fagots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass

Never should've gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, eh?

Here the king of archery come, with a cracker dick
To fuck you in that pussy carpet you munch
If I'm not hardly the one, you must be barely the one billionth
Really you kiddin', bitch I'm the prodigal son
And I'm stuntin' like my daddy, d-dr-d-drinkin' like my mama

I ain't even shift gears yet, I ain't even here yet, I'm outta this Earth
Right? (Yeah ho!) But I just hit the surface
And I'm 'bout to walk into a bank with a shank and a black can of paint to check the clerk
(Where the keys?) Bitch you better take your purse! I got a brick of herb
And I hit the syrup, and I'm feeling like I might just hit the curb
So get the fuck outta my way buddy you don't wanna walk around the chicken house

You'll make me hurt one of your feelings
(Ha ha ha), Nah nah ni nah nah
Pick your face up off the floor, I got you feelin' sad now
You be on that Hokey Wag, Hokey Wag is bullshit
Run into this Gangsta, have your preacher at pull pit
Bitch, I was born on the Mississippi River
Take no shit from a bitch or a nigga
So so crazy gotta fucked up temper
Bi-pola', not Nicki I'm worser, I'll hurt ya

Ma nigga, I'm a lion, untamed

You ain't got the umph, you're a hoof, to the foot of an elephant
Hello toots, you look so eloquent, that's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kickin' my seat
And I'm tryin' to the tell the cashier what I want!
They say I act like an asshole, when I pull up at the White Castle
And I ask for an appli-cation, throw it back in her face an'
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her
In the head with a Whopper that I bought from BK
You expect me to be proper?
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately, slut, ho Skidda dee da da
Prada? Not a chance, I was thinkin' about buyin' you some clothes
But Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart, but the doors
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought, great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know, they didn't carry a size eight in hoes!
Oh! This is ugly boy swag, puttin' toe tags on you motherfuckin' ho bags
What a trailer trash pioneer, I am here, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea!
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two
'Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you
So we don't gotta scream at you!

Ain't gonna find no miracles here
Well you can wait on your blesses my darlin'
I got a deal for you right here

I ain't lookin' for praise or pity
I ain't comin' 'round searchin' for a crutch
I just want someone to talk to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch

Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies
Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood
It's just you and me tonight

Tell me, in a world without pity
Do you think what I'm askin's too much
I just want something to hold on to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch

Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize
Well it comes at a hard hard price
You can't shut off the risk and the pain
Without losin' the love that remains
We're all riders on this train

So you've been broken and you've been hurt
Show me somebody who ain't
Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain
But, hell, a little touch up
And a little paint

You might need somethin' to hold on to
When all the answers, they don't amount to much
Somebody that you could just to talk to
And a little of that human touch

Baby, in a world without pity
Do you think what I'm askin's too much
I just want to feel you in my arms

I don't know what else to say
I can't, I can't think of nothin'
I'm stumped
Here we go (Here we go)

On your feet (On your feet)
Stand up (Stand up)
Everybody hands up (Hands up)
Uh, man, I dunno, man
Every time I go to think of something played out to say
You already said it

I ain't calling names cause all of y'all the same, plus
I'm the king, all my past pain all done changed up
All these plains, all these lames, since the Slaughter's came up
Cause they know they hands tied, feet ball and chained up
Niggas be quick to call me the new Fifty Cent
Because of my relationship with Marshall
Used to make me a little partial, but here's the brain fuck
We the same 'cause
I'm probably about to fall out with a young buck
While I attempt to fuck the fucking game up
Bitch, splat, only thing I fear in here is chit-chat
You are hearing bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
Shady guys like the Navy, drive, wavy bye-bye
Maybe my Glock can turn your top to baby's Maybach
My shit is powerful, literally sick, trust me nigga
It's ugly to kill a thing if the bigger I get
The more disgusting and fuckin' disfigured it gets
Niggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop
Y'all about the champagne, I'm about the toast
I, only fuck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
Niggas that'll smoke you while you staring in your postbox
Only incense he enlightens when he's thinkin'
While that sinks in, I got a Brinks ink pen
I'm back, muthafucker
Notice the flyness on the cover of the XXL
I'm back from the dead like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
How y'all realer? (How y'all realer?) If I said it, I did it
If I didn't, I seen it first-hand like a car dealer
Give up the throne, your lease up, I am the Mona Lisa
That decoded Da Vinci Code, you throwin' your piece up
Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup
Nigga, the mistake was like my only teacher
Wait 'til they get a load of me 'cause

I've got Gucci's on my feet
Diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist
Bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that

Choppers in the trunk
Models in the front
Bottles in the club
But I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that

Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard
For me to come up with shit to say (Ay)
I'm at a loss for words 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' out of cliches
I'm gettin' writer's block
Psyche!

When I stand up in this booth, niggas notice it
Sittin' on the same boat that Noah built
Floatin' on the same water Moses split
Poetry in motion, but we sittin' on your grave site, overkill
Aren't you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet!
Real dudes move in silence like a mute drivin' a new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude that'd try to sue a dude that's suicidal
You will just be another victim
I am like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie, I'm a little twisted
I roll like the end credits in movies, y'all just got scripted
Got y'all niggas' bitches bobbin' to this one when she witcha
When she wit' me, she bobbin', not vibin'
Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
I'm a sperate with a purpose, havin' problems?
Not a problem I've encountered
I have found elephants, lions, clowns
Will jump through hoops like they workin' for the circus
At the fire round the circle's right in front of them, fire rounds
Pun intended, gun extended, what are you mark's askin'?
Car's Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past it
Since I decided to start Class diss
All black, all glass, panoramic roof been gettin' marked absent
I authorize my own all-access
Your bitch a whore, I'm a catch, she ball-catchin'
Her jaw's been broadcasted all across the globe from the store to Japan
Her pussy need to blocked and reported as spam
Bong! Interscope up in this dope and I sell it
My voicemail is full, got bitches screamin' inside of envelopes
And they tryna mail 'em to me, tryna reach my phone
I don't know which one is harder
Tryna not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own

I got Gucci's on my feet
Diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist
Bitches on my dick

Choppers in the trunk
Models in the front

We need to start bringin' that shit back (Mad flava)

O back around the corner
Got the crack, put in your orders
We ’bout to run up out the stores
It’s notorious, the way I got big spitting stories
Being me’s X-Clan, Vanglorious
We’re not your favorite, fuck it
You know the system and you buck it
Have you revisiting how you used to love it
A nigga spew through the music, acoustics, cool kid
Used to pursue excuses, truth is, I was truent in school
So its influence is foolish, that was my views
I’m back at it, the rap addict, by any means
We gon get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans
Say he ain’t a star, niggas might be right
I’m so regular, nigga gotta shit tonight
Take it back Selektah, let ‘em know it’s Trice
Put your seatbelts on, we gon’ ride tonight

And I would like to introduce myse-self
Surprise! Hi, it’s Ike
‘Bout to get my Ike on, I come with a life supply
Of wife beaters and my Nikes on
And a white tee over that Iron Mike
Lookin’ fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, Park my Peter inside a dyke
Bitch actin’ like she got fuckin’ higher standards than Meijer’s, right
Had to pry her fingers off the motherfuckin’ Breyer’s ice cream
With the pliers, like “AAHHH!”
Only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothles bitch with no taste buds to Ruth Chris
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home
Pick up two Big Bufords
Girl, you got a nice pair, but you’re plum stupid!
So when I pull up in that Benz
Don’t try to pretend you ain’t interested
To impress your stupid ass friends
And refuse to get in woman, and get slammed on the ground
And snap like a pool stick against cement
If you suck of dick, pretend it’s a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you’re a ho
Cause your pants are so tight
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
Boy I’m from Detroit city, you livin’ in animosity
That’s a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me
In senseless mind babble, “What me? Apologize? labrbrr”
That’s just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn’t fucking take it back if I time traveled!

Just call me Richard, cause I’m a dick
It’s also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I’m a dick
You ain’t gotta be no detective to figure out I’m a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue
Sherlock, prick! Just call me Richard

That’s my motives, jumpin’ out them Rovers
All white, like I was right up in the Dakotas
Or Minnesota, did I mention soda?
When it’s mixed with viola, watch my cup runneth over
Cut from a soldier
Them ho niggas disposable toaster
Putting holes in a nigga getting close enough
Being me till the credits roll
Till my condition is beyond what the medics know
They wanna edit O
Like a prosthetic third leg let it go
This is Shady 1.0 Em let ‘em know
I still profit through the process
The prize in my jeans my balls’ll never digress
I’m a dick that I brag about
I put it in fast and then I drag it out
World, I be your special friend see
Cause these suckas suffer from pseudo penis envy

Just call me Richard, cause I’m a dick
It’s also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it

Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

Yeah, 03, I went from plain filthy to filthy rich
Man, the emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit

I'm doing what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter

I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting

Motherfucking wall with three thousand volts of electrucity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers in each
One of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fucking see
That'll teach you to go voicing your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit
Fuck letting up, you’re gonna end up rugretting you ever betted against me
Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah, it's happening again
I'm thinking about just saying
""Mother fuck everybody that's up in this bitch, but 50!""
'Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap
This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm going psycho again
And I might just blow my lid

Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy

Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy
Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's
Never gonna end, now we number one again

I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill

I just wanna be the illest MC (That's all I want)
The same time being as real as can be

Yo, in my house, the lights out
No utilities in the facilities
Feeling my life's 'bout, to wipe out
These feelings I'm feeling be killing me
I pull the mic out, can't strike out
Cause if winning is really my enemy
I pull a nine out, blow my mind out
Is the end of me really serenity?
Man in my house, it's rap or die
Get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just passes by
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could clock checks
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts, competition can't digest
And then I stress cause the road is rough
I start feeling like shit's sour
The electricity in my will power could still power the twin towers
For ten hours, so send cowards
The message from Crooked I
Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa

In our, house we spit like Sig Sauers
The way I feel now I could spit for six hours
Straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, 
If you can hear this sound inside my head sounds like a fucking drive-by
That's what the inside of my mind's like
Looking back on my career, even hindsight, tunnel vision, 5 mics
Never wanted that so bad well I got-ta go mad
Nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these ho bags
That bother me, but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does
Even though you know that there will never come
A day someone blows past you, never was
Someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you
Couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back
What you gonna go back, to working a regular job?
Fuck that, I'm gonna go hard grab on my, gonads
Tell them fuck themselves
They call me a wigger like Renee Zell
But I raised hell like a stay-at-home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, gangrene when I'm, angry then I'm
Hulk Smash, so much passion but no compassion
If eyes are the windows to the soul
Then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassing
Alright now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stamping Yelawolf
Get ready for the most competitive
Clique in the world it's like Clash Of The Titans
I released the cracker it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done
None shall ever fuck with this squadron
So come on in, at your own risk
This is (Our House) Bitch!

So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You won't find, comfort

Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know, I flow some ol' funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do

It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this
And who gives a fuck about hoes?
So just chill, til the next episode

Fallin' back on that ass, with a hellified gangsta lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a ol' batcha' collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P
D O double-G Y, D O double-G, ya see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah) So Dre, (What up Dog?)
Gotta give 'em what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton!)

It's where it takes place, so when asked, yo' attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker, but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if yo bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., ""No One Can Do It Better""

Like this, that and this and uh

Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was ""The Chronic"" (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats

Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick

If you got a sweet tooth,
You can taste my watermelons
If a swing set bores you
I can show you all my talent
I can wear a tan like other bitches can
You can have all this, boy!
And there's only one thing that I want from you

C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
I feel it coming, coming, coming, oh
Feel it running, running, running, oh oh
C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical on your bicycle

You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike (ha ha)

If you get a bee-sting, I can suck out all the poison
I can make you last like all the bitches can't

My wheels spoke to her, my Swinn is a chick magnet

With a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shagging's something I'm a pro at, but I ain't practicing shit
Allen Iverson has safe sex, condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on it's banana seat
My fantasy's to have you land where the kick stand is
Got this bitch gagging, they call me the broad killer
I'm the cousin of Godzilla
'Cause I spit fire and my dick is draggin'
Zig-zaggin' up the avenue, pulling these chicks in my antagonist wagon, screamin'

Eminem,"I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeed fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped
To think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked, sold three million

Then it all went blank, all I remember
Is feeling ridiculous 'cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I am always under attack man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him

Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
When I'm ripping shit, but since when did this many
People ever give a shit but I had to say
It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living
Put a dick in your rear end and guess what
Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it

For drawing more attention toward it
'Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude
Thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid
Attaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out

Good luck trying to convince a blonde
That's like telling Gwen Stefan' she sold out
'Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down
In history think they know now
Because everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
""Oh, everyone knows""
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Thanks for the support, asshole [*scratch*] thanks for the support, asshole
Quit acting salty, I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth
When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Lay'em off it

But what the fuck is all this thrash talking about
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knock me down, I went down from the count
I fell but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me
To take my belt, word to Pacquiao

Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Gotta go in that ring and knock them out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revolting

Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock
Just to go out watch Batman

Who needs a test to test the testicles, not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model
Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo

My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole
With a pack torn of paper
But I'm not taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the back pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go
Trying to dip through the back door retreating 'cause everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go

Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole

Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
I smack the girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull
Thinkin' we have some magnetic pull
Then scream' ICP in this bitch, how the fuck do magnets work!?
'Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen? That ain't practical

You crackin' a joke, it's laughable, 'cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch you just need a helmet because if you think you're special, you're retarded

Thinkin' you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina,
You're a train wreck, I got a one track mind
Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
'Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor

Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog, 'cause you're on my ass
But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent
With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time
And it ain't never gonna stop.

A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime,
So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, now my cup is runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster

I'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can't not be, rude off
So fear not my dear, and dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so I feel awkward and weird,
You stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole

Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: ""let it go, fuck this""
Heart is saying: ""I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset""

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshiped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you

My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck

Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by Eminem
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Help, god police, ah!!)
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial

No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again

Backs to the wall, I’m stacking up all them odds, toilets clogged
Yeah 'cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up
But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I’m the ringing in your ears
I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged
Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow
I’m the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and
Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don’t stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
But it’s time to walk away
I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop

So one last time, I’m back
Before it fades into black and it’s all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers’ left off",Bad Guy,2013
Eminem,"Eminem Has a full line of chainsaws

Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper, Eminem
Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit

I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of tourettes
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's despicable
I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy
This kid just took my stick of licorice
And threw my sticker books in a pricker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book, now there's using your head

Mama always said 'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)
Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
(Mama could be wrong)
I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless

Fast forward some years later
A teenager, this is a fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud gee for what reason, you stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, be down and be upbeat
When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life
Chance To make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street
But if I had just kept my head up my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talking in a trance
Locked in my room yeah but I got some plans mama
These damn rhymes are falling
Out of my pants pocket I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more, school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void
Been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
Cause I'd probably be Dahmer cause mama always said

'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)
Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
(Mama could be wrong)
I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless

Now my mum goes “womp womp womp”
Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go, they scream out 'Go'
I'm bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out
Middle America, hear them yell out
In terror they were so scared, and those kids
Just about, belted out
Whatever spout that it fell out
Of my smartaleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, ch'yea, til then
Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
Til emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' Insert insult here
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little lone MC would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
And boy they did flock
Can't believe this little hick locked
This hip hop shit in his pocket and still the shit got
That white trash traffic and gridlock
Shit happened like a six blocks from a Kid Rock
Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-tober
And got forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
Cause I turn into the unabomber mama always said

'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)
Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
(Mama could be wrong)
I'mma use my head as a weapon

Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't",Brainless,2013
Eminem,"Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think I think the lines are starting to get blurry

I'm in a strange place
I feel like Mase when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face

I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
'Cause that's where most of my anger is based

Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
I'm strapped for battles, suck a duck, crawl out the back, let's bar fight

Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut, but you forgetting Sarah Marshall
Oh my bad, slut
And next time I show up in court I'll be naked and square a lawsuit
Judge be like ""That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?""
Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you au jus

'Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you""
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic Kmart chains panic
'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'Cause it works when they're reversed, motherfucker

And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming ""fuck, shit, fuck""
Adult with a childish like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like ""merits, fuck that""
I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like ""tight lyrics, dreamy eyes""
But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish

And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
And the opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition, ha ha

Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies

This darkness comes in me (Evil twin)
Here it goes again (Evil twin)
If you chose my pen that ain't me it's my evil twin
He's just a friend who pops up now and again (Evil twin)
So don't blame me, blame him (Evil twin)
I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

So who's left? Lady Gaga? Messed with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3’s
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Bed-written and destined to never leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger
My suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by The Joker
Lorraine said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her

Fuck that shit, bitch
Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers
I'd ever left it to beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with the cleaver
Golly-wally I bet he registered Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definite lean
My destiny went on the steps, I met Deshaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes, but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em

They were sleeping, I made them stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form
Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming ""fuck the police"" like cop porn

Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who do you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
And as crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants to plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)
Please come in, what was your name again?

Hi, faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I ain't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
That I should call the looney police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish somebody finally admit me
Into a mental hospital with Britney

Oh, LMFAO, no way, ho
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony
Hey ho, hey ho
I sound like I'm trying to sing the chorus to fucking hip hop hooray
No, I'm hollering, you got bottom in like an a-hole
Eight and a base whether I'm fucking off that instead of your face, ho
Let your low hand raise, yo

Tango, what you think, ho?
Slow dancing in bowling
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work

But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skiddish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitch",Evil Twin,2013
Eminem,"Mom
I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink and

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has met their grandma
Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life
One without a cause
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Just know that I was alright
And I was not afraid to die

Oh even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life",Headlights,2013
Eminem,"Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I don't belong in this world
That’s why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
So I’m non complying at home, at school I’m just shy and awkward
And no I don’t need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I’m outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
And he said that I eyeballed him

And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words

'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
But I don’t give a shit I'm fine as long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain’t walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest

This is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my

Eminem,"Something's burning, I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon to be spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts – brace
Hope it ain't, ""Here we go, yo""
‘Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario
Though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First, ""No (slurp) you don't (slurp) under (slurp) stand (slurp)
I (slurp) don't (slurp) do (slurp) this for anyone, ever""
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-god dang Jigga on, eh
‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

I told that bitch I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Sucking dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
""Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fucking Ferris Wheel
Fucking spinning on me
Fuck you think? We gon' get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fucking eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day."" Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fucking with me
You cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talking cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, ""I hope she's good enough""
Meanwhile you're chasing her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the…

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasing me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding
But just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fucking brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt
Hit a fucking tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state, in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's laying next to me in bed
Directly aiming a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like
""Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checking into rehab.""
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fucking dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, ""Hit the road"" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, ""Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident""
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, ""Rape!""
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face

Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great

But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yackidy-yac
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy

I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to
Censor you like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Mathers LP
One when I tried to say ""I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine""
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal

What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas

Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
About to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm

A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining

Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a 79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch

But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, don't care, don't have two shits to give

To take it to the next level, boost it

Cause its the…

It's the time of the season, when hate runs high

Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas

Whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like

When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again

Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckleheads

It might just fly open, get cold cocked

To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out

So spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out
A completely brain dead Rainman

Of 1 to 10, shit I must be the holy grailer
Catch this ho I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name (great)

I might hit the club on a chica's tail, uh
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back and hammer the nailer
These bitches tryna get atached with the failer
And latch him to the tail of my bumper
To scratch them with the back of my trailer like I'm itchin' to get hitched

Yeah I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me
That's what I call pitchin' a bicth

That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void bitch I'm a droid,
I void cupid stupid wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed

Oi oi oi, man oh man, you boy boy boys
Getting sick at these girls girls girls
Oink oink oink
You fucking pigs all you good boys doink doink doing

I got 99 problems and the bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of them I need a machine gun
I take 'em all out I hope you hear this song
And grow into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just drop dead
And I'mma throw a fucking party after this 'cause

My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead (dead)(I hate you)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head (you baby)
And I thought wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)

I'm just playing bitch, you know I love you",So Much Better,2013
Eminem,"You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
And I believe I'm striding the roads, I guess I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
Snatch the keys from your hand
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

A beautiful face is all that you had
'Cause on the inside you're ugly, man
But you're all that I love
Aggressed, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
'Cause you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh
We were Bonnie and Clyde
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I
Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
'Cause if you could've took my life you would've
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Other side of my pack and stuck a spike, too, should've
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
No one could hurt me like you could've
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer
'Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And a life we could've had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'mma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
But I hate you cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all that's said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I maybe
I may never trust someone

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you

Eminem,"This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt!

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust so,
Floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mu'fucka' and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
It's survival of what?

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So take it all

So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't de-fuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drive-rs
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure 'cause every ime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve!

Eminem,"One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one ""ouch""
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar Ray Leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
Fuck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya

Eminem,"Girl you gimme writers block
I’m at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That’s what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, 'cause since then I can’t be apart from her
'Cause nobodies body’s awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I’m popular, but

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I’m in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don’t see nothin' but you
And I’m about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can’t do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can’t, specifically to describe it
I just can’t seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout “I live and breathe you”
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don’t wanna be without you, don’t wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it’s both I wish to seek, 'cause this ain’t

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Just want you to myself, don’t wanna share you with no one else
What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it’s time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain’t the same as mine,
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That’s a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany’s
You better have an epiphany",Desperation,2013
Eminem,"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare (A nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare)

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious,
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are krypton-ite
To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
""I remember it clearly, even today""
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition shoes
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
Never quit, too persistent

Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding dong ditching shit
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen slim
Snot forgin' like cocksuckers and rocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to piss in
Spottin' the top of this chain
Cuppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin'
Wake up on the competition
Promise incomplete
Diamond and Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' them probably
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Adomakin
I'm rushing like your cranium LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle bitch I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now wish you pink birds, ooh no more drippin' in bird shit,
This songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but discourage any rappers the rap games God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
And doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
As you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
Blood thirst, revenge of the nerds

(They shall not escape my vengeance)

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the uncle Ron I'm turning into an non-humble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get lunch, I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the fucking jumbo tron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yarn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The goat just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
It's hard to breath floating like oak wood was burning
Return of the no good and I wont (quit)

And a gauntlet, with a chain henge, its like a groundhogs day
So crowd around y'all, 'cause you may, see about y'all hey",Groundhog Day,2013
Eminem,"I'm getting by with my wicked ways

I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an
Eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see, the bitch's hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism

The devil ain't on the level same as him
Just someone who rebels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving him an adjective an ass whooping
So bad they should put his ass in prison
I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally
Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap

Cadillac from a K Car, my ass from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell em apart
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a fuck I don't play!
You think you saw this basket first?
Yeah backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
With a gaping hole in it
Whip out, whip down

Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scalar
Being gay little faggot but by the way
Plus it's getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay

It's a fucking miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face, I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, assaults you like an ultra violet ray
I’m sellin' hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m shittin' on the competition
In the meantime it’s always mean time

I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I’ve been a career asshole
I don’t see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
And I’m coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'm a snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed would have caught a flat

If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it
Indigestion my suggestions's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
Its 'cause I am don't speculate spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase

'Cause baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me I think my face is melting
If you felt these migrains, see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-empty hole in my empty head
If you read my mind you can see my pain
And you could see why I'd be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game

'Cause I'm about, like a fuckin' echo
Psycho on a cycle
If I hear Iko
I'm out of control like no
Other mike-o, stab you to the nightpost
Nothing but a hole inside your skull where you eye close
'Cause I'm gonna sock it to you, dyko, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike
I'm gonna blow the mike the whole night so strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm like nitro
And heigh-ho, hand me my shovel I'm libel to dig my hole deeper
It's off to H-E double hockey sticks I go

I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in mouth and get my balls blew out
And gay into the A.M
And lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
But fuck it, suck from the tucket
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body

Who is that? Where are you going? Mm come back
Why does everyone always leave me?

Eminem,"Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinking 
""If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls 
Like this I would kill him.""

Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit 
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
‘Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt

Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, but Goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a Goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo! My soul's escapin'
Through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac

Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed ""ICP in this bitch!
How do fuckin' magnets work?""
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical

‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable

Been tryna hunt me down like a dog

‘Cause all of my spare time is spent

Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line

So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive

I’m going back to what got me here, yeah, cocky
And can’t knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here

Eminem,"One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some f***in' one ""ouch""
What the f***'d you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
S*** I laughed in his face spit
B**** gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your a** back in that game
B**** don't take s*** for granted
And don't take s***, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how f***ing bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your a** and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you f***in' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished b****
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar Ray Leonard wouldn't sugar coat a f***ing booger though
Just to wipe that b**** on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that b**** from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of s***
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this f***ing English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this s***
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the f***ing recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
F*** it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
S*** legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
S*** that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
F*** mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this f***ing earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner

I’m at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no a** as large as yours, how much that cost?
That’s what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, 'cause since then I can’t be apart from her
'Cause nobodies body’s awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I’m popular, but

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I’m in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don’t see nothin' but you
And I’m about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can’t do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can’t, specifically to describe it
I just can’t seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout “I live and breathe you”
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don’t wanna be without you, don’t wanna be with you neither, b****
Put me in a situation in which it’s both I wish to seek, 'cause this ain’t

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Just want you to myself, don’t wanna share you with no one else
What the f*** you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it’s time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain’t the same as mine,
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That’s a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany’s
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? What? The lease up
I’m just mad the time it took to discover
You were using me for loot like I used you for looks
Hoe thought you was too good for me, huh? 'Til you choosed to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack,
But I can’t stomach this I’m leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said “The f*** with that
Where’s my Louisville Slugger at?”
She grabbed that f***in' bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that’s technique
She came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, it would of put a hundred yard field goal, through the uprights

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love

Eminem,"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare (A nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare)

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious,
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, b****, her rules are krypton-ite
To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them b****es
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
""I remember it clearly, even today""
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a f***ing clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, f*** them stupid Pumas b****, it's all about them new edition shoes
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new s***, he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his s***
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this s***
Never quit, too persistent

Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this s***
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding dong ditching s***
I f***ing got that b**** in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen slim
Snot forgin' like c***suckers and rocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to piss in
Spottin' the top of this chain
Cuppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin'
Wake up on the competition
Promise incomplete
Diamond and Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' them probably
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Adomakin
I'm rushing like your cranium LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle b**** I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, s*** no wonder you're sore losers
Now wish you pink birds, ooh no more drippin' in bird s***,
This songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but discourage any rappers the rap games God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
And doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
As you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
Blood thirst, revenge of the nerds

(They shall not escape my vengeance)

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the uncle Ron I'm turning into an non-humble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get lunch, I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the f***ing jumbo tron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a f***ing yarn
So mow the f***ing lawn, your a**es are blades of grass
And I'm f***ing up this whole landscape of rap
The goat just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
It's hard to breath floating like oak wood was burning

I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an
Eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see, the b****'s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism

The devil ain't on the level same as him
Just someone who rebels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving him an adjective an a** whooping
So bad they should put his a** in prison
I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally
Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap

Cadillac from a K Car, my a** from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell em apart
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a f*** I don't play!
You think you saw this basket first?
Yeah backwards like motherf***ing Bob and Silent Jay
Illest s*** you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
With a gaping hole in it
Whip out, whip down

Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scalar
Being gay little faggot but by the way
Plus it's getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay

It's a f***ing miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face, I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, a**aults you like an ultra violet ray
I’m sellin' hatred buffet style all the s*** you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m s***tin' on the competition
In the meantime it’s always mean time

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I’ve been a career a**hole
I don’t see why these people always got my back
I done said so much f***ed up s***, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this s***
And I’m coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'm a snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed would have caught a flat

If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it
Indigestion my suggestions's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
Its 'cause I am don't speculate spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase

'Cause baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me I think my face is melting
If you felt these migrains, see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-empty hole in my empty head
If you read my mind you can see my pain
And you could see why I'd be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game

'Cause I'm about, like a f***in' echo
Psycho on a cycle
If I hear Iko
I'm out of control like no
Other mike-o, stab you to the nightpost
Nothing but a hole inside your skull where you eye close
'Cause I'm gonna sock it to you, dyko, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike
I'm gonna blow the mike the whole night so strike up the f***in' maestro, I'm like nitro
And heigh-ho, hand me my shovel I'm libel to dig my hole deeper
It's off to H-E double hockey sticks I go

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

Oh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God
S***.
It's a girl
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a c*** in mouth and get my balls blew out
And gay into the A.M
And lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
But f*** it, suck from the tucket
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body

Who is that? Where are you going? Mm come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? F*** you then

Eminem,"I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday

But not by the seashore if he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
This twin Eagle's of Ares coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free

100 Percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet

Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offence dunk on me

I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like ""you still ain't got a new line?""
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than 9 months, but fuck it, it's all in due time

Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
'Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a sack on your head, you bleed out like the reverend
And to think our hood harder then I might break the door

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus
I can just see why people stop callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET 'cause if
I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, 180 Degrees in here
Trying to wait for the cedar chips
Mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah
When it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger

This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just let me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bowled like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back

And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you, humbly
Completely, madly, head over heels for you
Was you and me, wants us to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I

Eminem,"Another day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though
Oh well, this is my life so as I go and try to close for the nights show
See how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll never get some of this shit just always feels so weird
To this day cause all I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
'Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way but will still have a field day
With some of the fucked up shit in the world and tell it to sucking a dick
'Cause I still make fun of a situation
Someone's in like a son of a bitch at anothers expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses
Stuck on the fence on a balance beam if I seem unbalanced
It's challenging but my conscience allows me to think
The most foulish childish things without even blinking
Without even thinkin' about, all the stinkin'
Amounts of people that seem to be reachin' in the crowds
I'm scream in the palace, sold out this evening
But now it's, maybe down to sleeping
Is it really my soul to keep or
Have I sold it cheap is it greed
Do I take more than I need
When I joke of leavin'
But keep over achievin'
'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

It's a fine, fine line

So I notice how I paint myself
And through my hair when ordeals I'm so vain
I want my respect but ignore the
Butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
Till I, sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights, yeah
It's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights where I stay up at night
And say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears cause this ice layer
I skate on's a nice way of putting it but I like stands
Feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
From this house it's quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it
Then I wonder why I'm still famous
I keep walkin' the line
This gold fish poke it's old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
'Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
Or you sold your soul

It's a fine, fine line

And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back, to me

I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and, now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin'
Hate even going outside it
Sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit browse
I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimers
Long time since I shouted them out, bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys, accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I been thinkin' 'bout the time when I slept on the floor at the outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'm, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I

Eminem,"Feels like a close, it’s coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ‘’Hi! My Name Is’’ dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
'Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I’ve been against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin’, it’s your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are

I was afraid to
Make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn’t wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, (The time is here)
Guts over fear, (I shall not tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it’s coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck""
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in
And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh
Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
'Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my damn self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone
And to think I was gone

I was afraid to
Make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn’t wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, (The time is here)
Guts over fear, (I shall not tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear",Guts Over Fear,2014
Eminem,"I guess you could consider it poetry
But with me it started out with just words just words
They started looking like puzzle pieces so I started
Connecting them to each other 'til they started to resemble blank canvases
By this time I was an artist so
I just started to see these pictures, these real visuals
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer

(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer)

Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night
Sayin' I'm a killer
Did you ever think we would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams

I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin' it plain
Lyrical murder is somethin' I've been about
Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin' in the class
Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head, ruler in his ass
With a toilet in front of him, throwin' up, pissed off
Prolly symbolic of this thought, sick tot
To my inner enemy in a rush
I'm havin' nightmares of leavin' behind my dreams
With anything less than a full bank
It's like I'm General Hong, and I'm standin' in front of a gun
I'm puttin' myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank
The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't
Yeah, got the mentality of bein' with a wizard
Every award show, we don't even get considered
How do you sell somethin' that's so lyrical
To a kid that wouldn't know what was hittin' if it hit him?
Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit
Beef on me and Shady who was thinkin' 'bout Detroit
We put the world onto it so watch how you say ""fuck me""
You just might jinx yourself, whoop, your girl gon' do it
Cause I was in that 911 in Chicago, 911 at the same time
I had already been grindin' since '97, that's longevity
And if you think you're lyrically better, you better be a killer

(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)
You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Goin' automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller
Knowing nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)

It's an elite drinker, mister ringleader
I'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher
With a street sweeper full of heat seekers
In your Jeep speakers I'mma keep ringers
I don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Niggas try to tell me I spell too much
Capital S to the laugh to the T-E-R
Ho, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks, word
Making work disappear quick as magic
Abracadabra, the trafficker blacker than Africa
Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood?
Money like Dracula, hand him some spatula, ask me a question
Am I the best with the flexing?
Fuck yes with the goon talk
I just moonwalk all over the beat then I'm lightin' up the street
Crooked going Michael Jackson on Thriller
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer

You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Goin' automatic on anybody sporadic I choose

Did you ever think we would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams

The thought of retiring
Is makin' me want to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron
What up mom, applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'?
I'm hopin' to fill up your opening
Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements
First I gotta accept you in the lobby and the isle and
You've probably already been with all the slaughter and I am in
No mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin
With no strings attached
I'm just the product of a hostile environment
But bein' brought up so brought up inspired
But I don't know why, it's still like I'm caught up inside a whirlpool
Not an appliance, but applyin' this science, I psychotically rhyme
And it's like stars have aligned all in alliance
Heart of a lion, balls of Goliath
Obscene talkin', the twine like a bean's talkin' and buyin'
But I keep walkin' the line between the wrong and the right
But everything I write seems wrong and it's like
I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause
In the fabric of our modern society
Now Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans
Dammit the pope's mad again
Probably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin
Singin' ""Bagpipes from Baghdad"" again
In my dad's drag draggin' a faggot in, a glad bag
Won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance, like that again
You thought I was lyin' when I said I think that I'm crossin' the line again?
I've lost my mind, caution oh God I think I've thought of another fucking line
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak
Defiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet
Probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant
After he's fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony tryin' to sneak by it
So please don't follow me while I revive rap
I'ma start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it
You're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin' attire in
Boston, across the marathon finish line and I
Put your thoughts against mine
Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life, worse than Dzhokhar's
And I have a bomb, pliers and barbed wire
Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking swiss army knife
A saber that's Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight
With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
I'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie
I perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end
Like fuck 'em all I'm just ridin
Like I'm locked up inside a shot of Bonnie and Clyde called
Uncle Ronnie is driving, 'bout to burst in through the side door
Fuck up an asylum and park in the dining room

You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer

Eminem,"I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner trying to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion
Its all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
'Cause I think I started hallucinating
'Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I can do is follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice so I'm not as diluted
Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi but that coochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
But juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth waterin' too so I walked up to it like I'm Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll Introduce ya
Oh I'm a misogynist too but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth
A chronic abuser, not only user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, I'm not in the mood so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke
I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, a fuckin' stone like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
To replace next up Veronica's boobs
And uhh, paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for or

Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don’t laugh, please listen
Don’t laugh, please listen

Thought I’d give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps
Relapsing under that
Well that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like its a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
'Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked, I’m coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled had some struggles yeah
But that passionate hunger's back
The fantastic juggling act
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics
But in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped the duffel bag to my back
And stuck the massive punchin' bag in it
An elastic bungee strap, proper plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back lash
On a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal
And just asked him to come crash
And I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress
And ceramic construction hat
Rubbed my magic mushroom tat
Fell off then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up then gas, lungs collapse
And that's more likely than finding someone that's

Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don’t laugh, please listen
Don’t laugh, please listen

Couple of shots of Jäger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
""You're top ten ain't cha?"" stop cause you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is
I came to fuck with your occupation
You're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
Dug him up Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles baking
Fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle
They flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
Since they all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Doctor Dre
So then what does it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation
Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption
Here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
Till I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm fucked up with constipation
That day will come before I stumble upon some lady that’s

Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don’t laugh, please listen
Don’t laugh, please listen",Right for Me,2014
Eminem,"You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach, a wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you is a

Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to

She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
The worst part of all is he just don't care
She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a (shit)
(She don't give a shit)

Sometimes I wish that you'd just die
'Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
(How did it come to this?
Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?)
I didn't know you feel the same
When I say you're no good, all you are to me, is a

Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to

Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well
Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio
In the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?
Sorry, I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler, well then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
Entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then wake up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just want a free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside

She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
The worst part of all is he just don't care

Eminem,"I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught if your CD's on fire
You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park, no fire department
So you might not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dawg
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
Widely regarded highly, bite me, sweetheart, I'm slightly retarded
But tonight I'm starting shit, I'm feeling self righteous
I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Looking to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of the LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver from movement
'Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, unpacked it and boxed it
Toxic, hands are arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
Black out, Zach Galifianakis, gallons of Vodka
But that gal has some knockers
I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Max in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Fin Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers matches with the Parkers
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
I’ll stand there and yell that at a wall
Until the mannequin doll scatter and the inanimate objects
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
'Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
I'mma spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables hooked to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all could get jumped
And I'd catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack of Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door is laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I'll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malign now, she's slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
'Cause now she's faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
(""Em"") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's ""Control"" verse
And perform ""Fack"" in concert

Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like
(I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for
What's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so meh
Still get along with this voice cause that's the monster
So do-si-do with a sociopath, everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio, meh
She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, wooh, Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing the head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back while the bath salt packets are gone, I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splashing Bizarre, Thrasher and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan

Eminem,"Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you, or your problems
Everything, and follow me

If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not to be dancing to it
And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish
And shit you're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
True it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just

Lose yourself in this music, this moment we own it
We won't never let it go (go), you better move yourself
Because tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate
Lose yourself in this music, this moment we own it
We won't never let it go (go), you better move yourself
Because tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate

'Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
Then rest your soul
You could leave the rest to me, if I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feeling I'm feeling right this minute
'Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
The skies the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage, of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck because they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

Lose yourself in this music, this moment we own it
We won't never let it go (go), you better move yourself
Because tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate

Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I'll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malign now, she's slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
Cause now she's faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
(""Em"") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's ""Control"" verse
And perform ""Fack"" in concert

Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like
(I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for
What's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so meh
Still get along with this voice cause that's the monster
So do-si-do with a sociopath, everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio, meh
She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, wooh, Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing the head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back while the bath salt packets are gone, I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splashing Bizarre, Thrasher and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan

Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivating
Ain't nobody graduating
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn I'm getting aggravated, fuck, I'm getting agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is going on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fucking Matrix

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem
I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet
No one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'till I took off
Mistook me because I look soft
But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do alls
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter
I'm going in, already got an arm and head
And whoever said word are just words
Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck
Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned
In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like
They didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it
So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime
As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine
Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
I'm starting to slow and these lines are my nines
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's)
Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh
Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waiting on someone to say something

I spit it straight through, this is take one

I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway

With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle

God, please could you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the lama
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it, it's like Clint Eastwood
Looking for peace though, maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
And to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
Into the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked so I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or
What I have to say on the mic then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause I'm a sinner

And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever giving it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nothin'

Who you think I'm talking 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend) Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power now when I blackout, power outage
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival
Your arch enemy surrounds you now he's all around you
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's in-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the diggy doc
Stiggy-stopping is not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script
Cock and I shoot
Who you think's my glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

Eminem,"Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it
Too good to be true?
Have nothing, get it all but too much of it then lose it again
Did I swallow hallucinogens, 'cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't
Think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about is
Driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
'Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to
Show out on a track with me but it'd actually
Have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear them say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say (so much) for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
(Some want a champion to fall I still wonder why I laugh at 'em
'Cause why care when I'm awesome?)
Fuck what these cynics say
(Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up)
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I want it, I'm coming to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
(And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving)
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause

(They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay, they
Just grow wings and they fly, so
Hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold up and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over)

Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
Nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leaving this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness
Kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain’t the same
Feeling to me as killing the beat is
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger
Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot
I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever, entertain even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't

When I close my eyes

Eminem,"I get to busting like I'm a thirty ought six
When I'm ripping the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him pretty hot
'Cause he knowin that Tecca Ninna's a dirty chopper
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hovering having hella go H.A.M. Though?
I said to Seven, ""Richard Havens'll be the man""
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, ""what we doin'?,"" I said to I'm, let's chop
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga
You're on, people got to wondering if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling, you're gone!

Nobody can catch up, meet the Speedy Gonzalez
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em melt
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turning up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flipping niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
We bleed ‘em, beat 'em 'til they be gone feed 'em

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstasy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy's wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity

That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the.

I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, don't wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick

Eminem,"Said you want a little company
And I love it 'cause the thrill’s cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it’s time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn’t always, will be your pill re-
Fill and I’ll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don’t fill me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills just the effects of each
Other but we gon' film 'cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?) that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah

I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don’t you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
'Cause is it really over?

But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time, bullshit
What your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you’ll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me
But at night, if you seek those thrills what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don’t lecture me, just accept that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge
Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five

Ya pray that I don't hit, I ain't equipped to miss you
Ya gonna need an ambulance to stitch ya tissue
Or either have a bag on ya hip to s*** through
Ya seen us on the Ave ain't just to get you
While my penis is a mag when I lift it hit you
Cause I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

Solemnly swear, on my daughters tears, the n**** that got 'em in the head
To fill it before the year ends, I hope ya inconspicuous my friend
Cause once the word get back you in a world of sin (Sin!)
Bullets will hurdle at him for tryin' ta murder whats, been determined
As the first solo African (Me!) It go platinum with an accident that
Happened with maggots I'm alive with vengeance to get back my momma's
Blood pressure was affected from that my little girl needed a daddy
On the phone at a certain time exact now, and n****s act wild, when
The mac come out, ya n****s exiled (BLA-OW!) and I don't wanna hear
X - Y - Z, Im X'ing out your whole entity for tryin' ta kill me (Me n****!)
Filthy muthaf***as I'll show you a real B when he's H2B light up your
Kidneys I'm so sincere you're sayin' it hurts this year, its not a verse
It's a curse for birds and what's on your purse and over here this is Obie
Here I'm clear, n****s beware I'm coming at you with firearms and yeah (Yeah!)
Your purpose on superflowas how can I be merciful when merky needs
Mercenary school n**** I got paper I had your a** urgently exposed
No emergencies bring ya back ya souls, slugs shatter ya bones pat pat me
In the dome, learn this pattern we catch 'em at home, we wrong, that's when
Automatics sporadically catch 'em in the abdomen another dirty muthaf***as gone.

Wha
Do you know what's happening to me out there?
Wh-wha-what's the problem?
Violent Ground told me to go fuck myself!
Who's Violent?
Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass! 
Do you know what it feels like to be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
But, I-
I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this
You know why Dre's record was so successful? 
He's rappin' about big-screen tv's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicadin.
I mean
I can't sell this shit!

Either change the record or it's not coming out!

Hypnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patrone
I have you feelin' aight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
N**** you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
Cuz I want you triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin'
Push the whip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know The Units the game
I got my grimy Shady with me
You front you'll have to get me off your a**
I pay the lawsuit and laugh, it's not a big deal
It's nuttin' but some cash

When me and Fif' got together to do this music then move it
We became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend s***, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this s*** is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honour, pa** it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that a**, you izz-a**
Come hizzon what kinda fizz-uckin' position is that

Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'm a be a Shady 7-4 Gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' s***, now the squad called me

Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a f***in' G
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
S*** shattered, I'm a walkin' b**** magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it

You know what this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath,
Lloyd Banks, Cashis, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50,
Its a movement

Go",You Dont Know,2015
Eminem,"Jumped out of the second floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and hence the origin of the headless horseman
Born with the endorphin's of a pathetic orphan
Endless sores and reservoir of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores with women who have been vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in to the shredded foreskin
Red is torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores in sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in
Self absorption
Skeletor, I went to hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus
Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes of course, I mess up once
You want some? Come and get some, boys
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back
His whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm desert storm
Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible, hello gorgeous
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, ""When you wanna get sexual?""
She said, ""However I fit in your schedule, I'm flexible""
Expired tags on the Saturn
Got Kathryn Beck in the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter, laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it and got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack for an axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff
Pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid...

You got it twisted
All 'cause I offered this bitch a doggie biscuit you call me misogynistic
Bitch get to massagin' this dick
Like spas in this bitch
Slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some swab and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit like I've gone ballistic
With a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, ""I hate blondes,"" and became one
I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets
Trouble 'cause a double cross
The shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to 'cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results
As Rainman's is
Something's awful when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to ""Brain Damage""
What's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'm about to dunk a bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap like an Ace bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona
To my last DNA strand, E&J in the waistband
At the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa
Pre-arrange an escape plan
Three inch blade on point like a Sensei
Consider me a dangerous man but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one

Great idea!

If I was president
Gettin' off is the first order of business
Once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand
Screamin', ""Fuck safe sex,"" throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned
And make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
It's in you to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it
I walked up in major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You want to go against zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer of bin syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'till I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
'Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Tortured a, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The board hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
'Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen
It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The rock cuts into rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker that go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelling quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeves spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I had to come back on these faggots who diss me
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel
But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplating rubbing shit in your face 'till I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again 
If you actually had fucking careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly I'm gone off you
Man light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, you puss
And thighs are squooshed
What kind of attires that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the track

Why am I such a dick?",Campaign Speech,2016
Eminem,"You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

In my eyes
Even if you are wrong, you are right
Even if there is a terrible crime
It's alright, 'cause I got your back, and I know you got mine
I belong to the church of your name
Sing a song, 'cause I worship the ground you walk on
If I pray for you, I know you'll be there
You gon' make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

In my bed I believe every word that you've said
Just a kiss and you make me forget
All the bad, the battles we lost, the bodies we hid
You don't know, just how far I'd be willing to go
You put the cracks into my moral code
So you can count on me to always be there

You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

Oh, Lord, forgive my weary hands
And for what they may do
I'll carry out his evil plans
If he wants me to

In your dream, you're drowning, I just waltzed in and saved you
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
Your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault 'cause I made you
Brainwashed and persuade you
Gibraltar, you're faithful, never falter or waver
When you causing the danger I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
Mind just follow me, babe, you
Won't be sorry you stayed, you
Always ride, whatever the plan is
To the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed the First National and cops caught us redhanded
They're coming at us, and we're trapped, put our backs up
Against the wall, and it's too tall
You catapult me or hold the ladder for me
Stay back to get captured, take the fall
You make it all worth it
Baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
Accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Whatever you have to do, you blast for me
I never doubt
That you

You could make me a believer

I fell for you and skinned my knee, but hell with any injury
Eventually you'll get up gingerly
It feels like it'll take a century to heal, but just know that I will
But fuck trying to make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium, your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz with all your lady friends, whores 
Hit the club and you go out don't know a sum
'Cause when I calculate the times you cheated and total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up 'cause you say that just giving out your number doesn't count (I hate you)
Then see me with someone new get mad and flip it look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me then tell me that I stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it (stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it)

Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing
I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth

100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover

'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? no favors

Eminem,"If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning, so definite, wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Mama to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things, time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset, I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow then a breath, machines go
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm trying to rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

(I don't want it!)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'

Eminem,"We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then you
Laughed at the stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn’t after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (things different)
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I’m confused
Because

How come you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults, they got, thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn’t mean
The words that we meant that we didn’t say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin’ still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

How come you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there’s always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard ""Mockingbird""
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
Shit, it's no wonder

Eminem,"And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman, ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (yeah)
Another day in the life (uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time, bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (yeah)
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?

Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that

My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you

Give me that apron and mo–
'Tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans left you two-faced at the show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt

I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets

If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce

I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion (ha!)
Sorry for sloppy writing, the pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
Dad’s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write them
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as I'm

Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are

But you'll grow into them, baby, I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new

I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it

Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know

Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?

I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack

And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs.""
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly

Just escaped from the state pen
For eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see

I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain

Eminem,"Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: ""I gotta meet her"" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue, you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack

Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (word, yo Rick, man!)
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
""Ain't steppin' to you, bitch,"" I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
Letter, come to me, mail, sweater, heat, some degree, fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said

Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (duh!)
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl, your
Body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're
Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too—look at my pedigree!
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one

I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it, did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I ever seen
And back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration

I didn’t (A) mean and (B) just ain’t me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen

Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things

You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? 
He's tryin' to divide us, this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can’t from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me

Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from

We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out with her inner child

Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in

Leave you for good so never would I

And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you, what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us

War machine, but you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your ear
And in the course of the assault this torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blue to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten tonne nuke like Kim Jung Un
And end up ruining your career
Moving on, this is said and done
And at the end of my run, I'll just rewind clocks
Forever young, make time stop
Will I ever fall off? That day'll never come

It's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can simply because I can

In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go ""shit!""
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what, huh?
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow ""whee""
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too
With me on it

I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

Said said can I take you home, where we can be alone?
Shorty, you the shit, girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
Crystal, let's slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
Screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I’m fallin' in like, that's kinda, why I love

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me

Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""

It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit (Fuck!)

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

Eminem,"I'm stumbling, I can’t see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

Now I’m the one thing, you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don’t want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn’t help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I’m wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me—my friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see

Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, ""Screw her!""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see

Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'

The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talked to like, you're just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit

Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it, they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirens
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”

While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a Derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach Congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals

Is it the bar I set?

A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark’s high
Butter-flies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis

Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart
Like, ""this shit is garbage""
God’s given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless

And I try to not listen to nonsense

And all that's left of my house is lawn

And everyone who has doubt, remind

When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause

Trample it and stomp it, smash it and stand on it
Dammit, I can't stop it
The rap is a vag and I can't stop goin' in like a tampon in this bitch
It's is manslaughter
Stampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods
In fact you're exact opposites
You make a wack song, and can't hold a candle
But even Daniel-san wax off, you jack-offs
Need to come to grips, like a hand job
The boom bap is back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number two 'cause that's all I do with 'em
Poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I droppin' a deuce and
When I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen them
Bitch it is real like I pooped Jerusalem
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon 
And I'm cuttin' you from your mother's womb and I'm bustin' you",Caterpillar,2018
Eminem,"You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted, Shady? You got it!

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Line 'em up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Rrr
Don't fall on my fate
Look

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted 
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spit like this in his last shit""
Hoe, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up""
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition
Slap the clip and cock it back on competition
This is how I shot a head (pew)
Gabby Gifford, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sac-rilegious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is 
To help you put together some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment
Like the feature when I stole this show
Sorry if I took forever

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
I won't
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Ha
Don't fall on my fate
It's too easy

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, unleash the monster
Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves 
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary 
In my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of turnt you're minus
Mine says very, yours says hardly
And what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 
'Cause I'm barely gettin' started
And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own
Thrust my pelvic bone
You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown!
Don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles
The Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat 
Piss and moan, but I'm not gonna fall, bitch!

It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud

Last year didn't work out so well for me (fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)

Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps
Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
While I tea-bagged the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I am the fucking pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything

Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I was in
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt, ice cold
Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, fack 2017

Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee
That way, that shit was so ass, it's something we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an acorn, stairlift beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here
Serial killin' every beat there is, but wait

Wait, got the eeriest feelin', somethin' evil is lurkin'
I'm no conspiracy theorist but somethin' here is a foot
Oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (what?)
Twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects 'cause if you sleep, you're fucked
Other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do

Eminem,"Paul, yo, um
So I got your message, I wish you would answer the fuckin' phone
Um
Turn right
No, I don't plan to reply to everybody who fuckin' says something fucked up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like
What people are fuckin' saying about Revival
And, uh
Yo, this Yahoo mother fucker, whatever the fuck his name is
Said I, literally said I rhymed ""rhymes"" with ""chimes""
""Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes""
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire fuckin' sentence you fuckin' moron
It's my fault 'cause you're fuckin' stupid
But I swear to God this motherfucker lives in Michigan and I think I figured out his address
And I'm on my way to his fuckin' house right now
Turn left
I'll hit you back later",Em Calls Paul (Skit),2018
Eminem,"Here we go, again, from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo, but we were both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope
That we'll get through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope
Would be dope, but
What kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent Van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you die for sticks a steak knife in your heart
Do you try more?
Another late night in
She stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in
And all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent
But she's goin' through my drawers to plant the K-Y in
I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and
Who has probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight, nine men
I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens
Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for
When you date my friends, in order to wipe your ass
When you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows
This the thanks I get
I'm waitin' for the day
I can hear you say, ""Marshall, what a skank I've been
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him""
Got your tubes tied for him
Got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core
But the pain I'm in, after you I swore
To make the gray skies end
Here comes the rays like wind
You get a pay hike, and, am I the good guy, or?
Do I just play like him and hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream ""Fuck you""
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snakes eyes in

Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me
Can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy

Play like you're the good guy",Good Guy,2018

James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my cat-scan that day
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray

Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basic alias is an A to the K
Get your ass spayed like bidets breakin' your legs
Eight different ways, aim for the waist, you chumps don't
Even know how to do somethin'

So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way I mispronounced a name
""DIE ANTWOORD!""
Fuck, I still can't say the shit
But how quickly they forget who the fuck I was
Now Ninja try to duck my slugs to let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout, now get the fuck out my rhyme book!
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers I'll do shit
You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit, I bullshit you not
Y'all fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop

Oh yeah and one more thing I want to mention
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)

I just slapped Vlad with a ISIS flag

I've been alone, I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all of the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower

I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules

I said ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you to make raps, let's recap
Way back, MC's that recap and tape decks
ADATs, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? the same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me the snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big
But you've been takin' the dicks
In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits
I'ma sleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat, I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the minithin, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say is a writer might've fell off
But back on that bull like the cowboys

So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move

I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you run it
I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes

Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Eh, I was tryna be nice

I'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
When you joke it upsets me, you say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy
I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks
You hope that I choke on a Pepsi
Bitch you was supposed to correct me
Been texting you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you going in those knee high boots, cut it out bitch
I doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, and those skin tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say ""Don't come over"" 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing

Eminem,"Yo, how do I keep
(I don't know what's up with these hoes, man)
Getting in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
(Yeah)
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein' mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, told her why I'm soulless, she's

Heartless, no wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause all's it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger

She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun'
We over but kicked her out, called her back now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted?
I picked someone that's so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seein'
She's only mine for the time bein'
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?

Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
Especially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceded cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!

I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hoppin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo
Flip me off right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 A.M. in the drive in a stretch white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole

Um, I listened to the new album
Um, are you really gonna just reply to everybody who 
You don't like what they have to say, uh
About you or the stuff you're working on? 
I mean, I don't know if that's really a great idea
It's, it's like, what's next, Kamikaze 2?
The album where you reply to everybody who didn't like the album that you made 
Replying to everybody that didn't like the previous album
It's a slippery slope
I don't know if it's a really good idea
Um, anyway, hit me back",Paul (Skit),2018
Eminem,"Yeah, yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts 
And see where this takes me, 
'Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now

Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage, but ain't thinking 'bout no bank account
But bitch I'm off the chain like Taylor Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar, even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause 
I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listening to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil' Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit
Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)
Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch?

You won't ever see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it

Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the Valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks

Lil' Pump, Lil' Xan imitate Lil' Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the fuck are you gonna do? Where you runnin' to?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a quarter pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
And you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed the line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get impeached, my enemies die
I don't ceasefire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats

What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch (yeah)
Invite them in like a one a day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turnin'
Is makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers

Eminem,"It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watching sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof, wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do so I ain't have to shoulder the group
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on they own and I don't want to open up wounds
I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group

If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel, and I feel like this is what got us in
The debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you've put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers
I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is clear

If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you

Bacardi in hand, never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops full of drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift, all the carnage you left
Is this the kinda karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this
Wish I had words

But I guess they're just honored for this
Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you, men
But I just can't be the guy
Everybody depends on for entire careers
'Cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air
I've tried hearkening back to but I'm fighting for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent

To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind
But we been down every road, done all we possibly can
I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

I'ma wash away my sins

So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck a blood track
Like, what's her name at the wheel?

Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, end up crashin'
Into ya, look back and it's just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin

My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my

Put the ballpoint pen 'em
Gun cock, bump stock, double-aught, Buckshot

Tie a couple knots, fired up and caught

Punk rock bitches going down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not?
You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache and I take anything in
Rectangular shape, then I wait
To face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasing me but I'm part of you
So escaping me is impossible
I latch onto you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the supervillain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you

Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuck, your beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, you weird beard
We doin' this once
Your beard's weird, why you yellin' at the mic?

Rihanna just hit me on the text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me, I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next, damn
I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my Nordic Track
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (Slim you're old)
Ow, Kelly, ooh, but I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29 I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gun, I bet you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still
Are you eating cereal, or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
Dictionary
Yo Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops, know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch?
Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you're the whack me
It's funny, but so true
I'd rather be 80 year old me than 20 year old you
'Til I'm hitting old-aged still can fill a whole page with a 10 year old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy
Go play, feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift, and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino, die, motherfucker
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailey in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the fuck?)
Bein' rich, aimed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim, yeah, bitch, pop champagne to this
It's your moment, this is it
As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort, but if I was three
Foot 11, you'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be this solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what fuckin' good is a machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write, Not Alike
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it, Kells?
Attempt fails, Budden, L's
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' whack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' AutoTune, so let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth, and keep my daughter out it

She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also someone's wife
So time we spend is borrowed
It's our moment, right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear all
Nice and easy as hair, when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle

She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is so fucked
Think that shit's got pneumonia""
I told her, ""Bitch now, just hold up""
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital, we need Q-Tip for the culture

Speed it up a little bit

I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache

I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the motherfucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella, wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we renovate
And re-develop hella weights, and I'ma get a special place, now
Take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind, I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights, they're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you're fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic, anybody who brings me, duck it

Half yellow jacket, you can't swat a
Sasquatch dancin' on top of a Ant, 
Trample it and stomp it, smash it and stand on it
Dammit, I can't stop it
The rap is a vag and I can't stop goin' in like a tampon in this bitch
It's is manslaughter
Stampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods
In fact you're exact opposites
You make a wack song, and can't hold a candle
But even Daniel-san wax off, you jack-offs
Need to come to grips, like a hand job
The boom bap is back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number two 'cause that's all I do with 'em
Poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I droppin' a deuce and
When I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen them

Eminence,"What? Uh
The Bad
Yeah
The Evil
Right, yo
put em together

Royce the 5-9, Eminem
Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothin to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothin to chew
Yo
I'm just f***in with you, cause I got nothin to do

I am bored!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers *crash sound*
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin your wallet off 

And slippin a Molotov in your C***tail (take that)
Burnin your contracts, punch your A&R in the face *punch sound*
Smash his gla**es and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook s***, if it's missin I took it (whoops!)

Nurse look at this straightjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head 
When the rest of his body's still alive RUNNIN?

Comin' with five gunmen, waitin' to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what?) hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhymin about birds
Only about two-thirds'd really set it without words

Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you b**** up
Pick the fifth up, c***, spit, you would swear it's rainin slugs (what?)
I'm the hottest s*** in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me

You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this s***'ll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)

I take it if you run your mouth, then you want to get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible

Forget a chorus -- my metaphors are so complicated 
It takes six minutes to get applause 
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career 
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin' to fall back on!

I'll throw you off of ten floors
Pull a f***in headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
I'm indoors, waitin for disaster to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores

This b**** wanted to blow me, I said, ""It oughta happen.
You swallow cum b****?"" ""No, but I brought a napkin""
Gettin' skullie while I'm autographin'
Got my daughter laughin' cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin'

I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my you-haul screamin', 
""Wait, wait, wait.. you ain't movin' here!""
Lorena Bobbitt, see'mere, want a souveneir?

I've been high as f***, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference -- I need some 'caine 
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(Oh my God!) Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

Walkin in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (what?)

Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin my fame, blowin your hand off
Dancin with the Devil leadin - I won't die, I'm never leavin (what?)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin

Street n****z with nuts, what? My meat's bigger (what?)
Fake-a** thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinkin I'm the n**** to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace

For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what?)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is gla** doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

there was no more fun
no sex no drugs no rock'n'roll
all music turned to a fashion show
White man had British pop
and black man had soul
But no, not a drop of a blood
'cause video killed the rock'n'roll

and God said ""Oh my God!""

What's happened to my lovely creatures

Mi hanno offerto un altro giro e mo' non sto più in piedi
Ma perché sono finito qua?
Niente di meglio da fare in città
In testa ho un'altra musica
La la la la la la la la

Nuovo single, bingo
Anche tu single? Uniamoci come nello spot dei Ringo
Albertino già mi sta' dicendo ""fammi il jingle""
Ho una giappo ed una russa attorno a me, bilinguo
Fanno i cori come a Eto'o, tu sei old, retrò
Mi hanno detto che vieni a ballare col metrò
Lei ha un capolavoro al collo, tipo art déco (chapeau)
E sarei lieto di invitarla dentro al mio château (pardon?)
Lei mi guarda e legge Prada sopra la mia zip (uh)
E poi mi spara una domanda tipo Sconvolt Quiz (eh?)
E me la porto dietro, sì, mica rimorchio qui (nah)
E mi si è attaccata, zio, come il rimorchio a un tir
All'inizio sono metà buone e metà no
Shot dopo shot quelle buone aumentano (heh)
No, non sono fatto, è solo un nuovo passo, baby
Chiedo scusa se ogni tanto ti calpesto i piedi (oops)

Le code in bagno, le tipe e l’alcol
La la la la la la la la

Quando entro nel club il tempo si ferma, voom
Sembra la scena del cowboy che entra nel saloon
Lui smette di fare su, lei smette di bere rum
E si alza dal posto come quando arriva il bus
""Piacere, Mascia"", il piacere è tutto mio
Prende da bere, dico, ""lascia, pago tutto io""
E visto che le tipe snob non le punto mai
Scommetto su questa cavalla, come al punto Snai
E parliamo, beviamo, balliamo
Finché la mia drink card ha più buchi della faccia di Cassano (haha)
Ti giuro ero uscito a farmi un giro innocente
Ma sono finito qui, perché in giro non c’era niente
Mi gira la testa, usciamo (ehi)
Dice, ""va bene, ma non girarti, dietro c’è il mio fidanzato""
E gira e rigira, finisco a casa sua ubriaco

Non capisce, in fondo io c'ho gli occhi e lei c'ha il culo (ha)
Dice, “Marra è bono” come il cantante degli U2
Lui non l’ha capita, manco arriva a Ligabue (uh)
Ci vorrebbe quell’affare con il flash che avevano in Men In Black
Per farla dimenticare di te
Ho raccolto questi soldi come fiori freschi
So che ce ne sono molti dove ho preso questi
E le cime mi appagano, le rime mi pagano, le tipe mi amano e tu mi detesti (ha)
Improvviso come il jazz, easy come il jet
Bevo tutto nel privé, mi ci tuffo, splash (splash)
C’è la Marramania, l’amore c’entra poco con la monogamia (see ya)

Però si è calmato il vento 
Il mio sguardo è meno freddo 
Questo inverno sta finendo
Ogni cosa c'ha il suo tempo 
Chi ha pazienza ne uscirà 
Vado avanti e non ci penso 
Questo inverno passerà

Oggi è domenica e tu gridi isterica 
E io qui col viso caldo per le botte 
Mentre nel mio cuore nevica 
Quando ti ho detto ""una come te non mi merita"" ero ubriaco 
Ma mi hanno insegnato che ""in vino veritas"" 
Dove la trovi la voglia di amare? 
Guardare il paradiso da fuori 
Senza poterci entrare
Parole d'amore, parole amare 
Le prime sono sempre più rare 
E tu continui ad urlare 
Che non sono mai piaciuto ai tuoi 
Dimenticandoti che tutto ciò è piaciuto a noi 
E ora la rabbia mi imbocca di cattiverie 
Mentre lanci i piatti 
Io prendo a calci le sedie 
Grido ""fatti vedere!"" 
No, non ti fa bene ciò che sono
Non c'è coppia perfetta
Perchè nessuno è perfetto da solo
Oggi c'è un bel cielo aperto 
Ma io non esco 
Perchè porto solo il freddo 
Come l'inverno

Il mio sguardo è meno freddo 
Questo inverno sta finendo
Ogni cosa c'ha il suo tempo 
Chi ha pazienza ne uscirà 
Vado avanti e non ci penso 
Questo inverno passerà

Nella testa c'ho le immagini 
Di quando stavi ancora qui 
Mentre cancello le tue immagini dal mio pc 
L'attrazione non è sempre amore come dicono 
Due calamite uguali a volte si respingono 
E a volte vincono gli errori 
Se servono a imparare 
Tu sei solo uno sbaglio da non rifare 
Tolgo la vibrazione al cellulare quando dormo 
Così se mi chiami con te in un sogno 
Non me ne accorgo 
Morto, dentro, innamorato di un ricordo 
Lottano ragione e sentimento 
Vorrei dimenticarti al mio risveglio, come me, mento
Quando dico che ora penso solo a me, mento 
Certo, tu mi pensi, io ti penso 
Ma se una storia non ha fine non ha senso 
Penso, che pure in questo inferno 
Con certe parole di ghiaccio 
Ti perdo come d'inverno

Fuori quanto è brutto il tempo 
Però si è calmato il vento 
Il mio sguardo è meno freddo 
Questo inverno sta finendo
Ogni cosa c'ha il suo tempo 
Chi ha pazienza ne uscirà 
Vado avanti e non ci penso 
Questo inverno passerà

Sì, i discorsi freddi che fai 
Si scioglierebbero nel calore 
Di un abbraccio, lo sai
E noi, fino a poco fa 
Ci credevamo grandi 
Ma mo, siamo esposti ai bei ricordi mentre grandinano 
E finchè dura mi accontento 
Quando un cielo bello arriva al culmine seguito dal maltempo 
E così è stato
È stato un colpo di fulmine 
Ma adesso dai tuoi occhi sta piovendo
Una nuvola che non si sfoga, resta nera
Tutto passa in fretta 
Come una nuvola passeggera 
E stasera, cuore in gola
Lotti con le lenzuola 
Fredde come la stagnola 
Perchè dormi sola
Vola in alto con la testa 
E stai con i piedi a terra 
Dopo la tempesta ci sarà la calma 
Tutto fermo, baby, goditi il silenzio 
Anche questo inverno sta finendo 

Fuori quanto è brutto il tempo 
Però si è calmato il vento 
Il mio sguardo è meno freddo 
Questo inverno sta finendo
Ogni cosa c'ha il suo tempo 
Chi ha pazienza ne uscirà 
Vado avanti e non ci penso 
Questo inverno passerà
Fuori quanto è brutto il tempo 
Però si è calmato il vento 
Il mio sguardo è meno freddo 
Questo inverno sta finendo

Questo inverno passerà",Parole di Ghiaccio,2012
Emis Killa,"Cosa mi resterà, di ogni giorno che passa di qua?
Ogni cosa che arriva per poco, è la stessa che per poco va
Ci insegnano che, là in alto c'è un tipo vestito di bianco che prende e che dà
Che la morte si veste di nero, ma la vita che colore ha?
Io che ho scelto una strada diversa da loro, a metà tra due poli
Vedo maschere ridere in coro sopra volti che piangono soli
Impauriti lasciamo ogni cosa al suo posto, fino a quando il percorso finisce
Nascosti in un corpo coperto di oro, mentre l'anima si arrugginisce

Your life won't be a blessing until you make a change
Your life won't have a reason till you stop playng games
You can't achieve till you belive in you
Your life won't be a blessing until you make a change

Se è vero che ogni umano avrà sette amori per sette tipe beh
Il signore doveva crearci con sette cuori e con sette vite perchè
Se fosse vero io sono all'inizio e rinuncerò ai miei
Ho ancora addosso il profumo di lei e non ne voglio sapere delle altre sei
Circondato da gente che ammira il successo, che mi chiede com'è che si fa?
Tutto ciò che mi manca è qualcuno che mi chieda com'è che ti va?
A volte vorrei, fermare il tempo in quegli attimi in cui sto ridendo
E mi scordo che vivere in fondo corrisponde a morile a rilento

Your life won't be a blessing until you make a change
Your life won't have a reason till you stop playng games
You can't achieve till you belive in you
Your life won't be a blessing until you make a change

Altra notte in hotel distrutto, sto vivendo di fantasia
Io che metto la vita in dubbio, fuori un mondo che canta la mia
Oltre i muri di questa stanza ogni parte del globo non è abbastanza calma
Quando l'ansia mi bacia e i miei angeli vanno in vacanza
Attirati da quello che brilla, preferiamo un anello a una stella
Illusi e nervosi battiamo i pugni sul tavolo come gorilla rinchiusi in cella
Se dio desse la parola ai cani chissà cosa direbbero
Forse che gli esseri umani non sanno più essere tali

Your life won't be a blessing until you make a change
Your life won't have a reason till you stop playng games
You can't achieve till you belive in you
Your life won't be a blessing until you make a change",Essere umano,2013
Emis Killa,"Siamo fratelli a metà, figli dello stesso padre
Divisi dall'età, cresciuti in due case separate
Ricordo che da pischello ti detestavo un po'
Quando mi chiedevano ""hai un fratello?"" rispondevo no
Papà provava a farci andare d'accordo, ogni giorno
Ma era presto per avere un bel rapporto
E tu mi infastidivi tanto per fare lo scemo
Non eri serio ma io ero ingenuo e me la prendevo
Non si era pari, tu eri già in giro con i peggiori
Quando io mi trasferii alle popolari, giorni duri
E passavamo anche mesi senza sentirci a parte in casi rari
Senza niente da dirci a parte gli auguri
Tra i problemi di papà ne abbiamo passate tante
Io capivo per metà, tu eri quello più grande
Ed oggi che ci frequentiamo e ci ridiamo su
Riavvolgiamo il nastro e la parola fratellastro non la usiamo più

E anche se ormai ci si risente da un po' ci conosciamo da un'ora
Dobbiamo crescere ancora, fratelli a metà
Quello che hai unito a quello che ho
E ciò che abbiamo noi ora,
Un po' più grandi di allora, fratelli a metà

Qualche anno dopo è successo quel che è successo
Tu hai fatto famiglia io ho fatto successo
E adesso che non siamo più così distanti con l'età
Ci troviamo qua, fratelli a metà uniti dall'alcool dentro ad un bar
Con davanti una birra e qualche racconto
E un senso di irrisolto che colmo pagando il conto
E non ci assomigliamo in volto ma è solo genetica
La complicità ci dà un'identità che è identica
Come due gocce d'acqua cadute dallo stesso cielo
Due mele marce di un melo appassito al cielo
Il tempo ha sciolto i nodi, quelli alla gola
Ne ha fatto uno più grande che ci lega con una sola parola
Tra termini incerti, siamo mezzi fratelli, mezzi amici
Ma siamo qualcosa di più di due amici fraterni
Chissà papà cosa direbbe ora
Che siamo l'uno per l'altro, quello che lui avrebbe voluto allora

E anche se ormai ci si risente da un po' ci conosciamo da un'ora
Dobbiamo crescere ancora, fratelli a metà
Quello che hai unito a quello che ho
E ciò che abbiamo noi ora,
Un po' più grandi di allora, fratelli a metà

Anche se siamo soggetti alle diversità
Qualcosa è stato scritto dentro al DNA
E non esiste gomma che ce lo cancellerà
Fratelli a metà, fratelli a metà
Anche se siamo soggetti alle diversità
Qualcosa è stato scritto dentro al DNA
E non esiste gomma che lo cancellerà
Fratelli a metà fratelli a metà

Emis Killa,"Ho ancora l’immagine impressa di quando in casa scoppiò una guerra,
Il caos in testa e i tuoi abiti a terra.
E mentre il sole dalla finestra filtrava
Una porta tra me e te si chiudeva e il buio su noi non cessava.
Tu eri brava a dirmi stop perché ero bravo a parole,
Ma non parlavo col cuore infondo era solo rumore.
E ora che questo silenzio mi ammazza dentro
Copro con le grida il presentimento di aver già
Perso pure avendoti perché tu non mi hai,
Io perdo la pazienza e sparo mentre tu no mai,
Mi incazzo come niente chiedendomi come fai
Io sbaglio come sempre tu mi ami come non mai.

Come fai a sopportarmi, non cambio mai,
Alzo la voce per niente, sono lo stesso di sempre.
Sparisco giorni e non chiamo
Mai mi chiedo quando ti stancherai,
Ma tu fai finta di niente, tu sei la stessa di sempre.

A ridurci in questo modo come ci siamo arrivati,
È stato un salto nel vuoto e adesso precipitiamo abbracciati.
Non c’è tempo per salvarci, per rifarci adesso è tardi
E cadiamo più in fretta degli altri appesantiti da troppi sbagli
E voglio il tuo bene ma sto rinunciando al mio bene perché
Restare insieme non è la soluzione ti vorrei felice ma senza di me,
Non so competere con le tue gesta e mentre io cambio tu resti la stessa,
E ti compro una borsa diversa, oltre a questo che cosa ci resta
Meriti molto di più di cianfrusaglie così materiali,
Di risposta tu dici grazie ti strappi il cuore me lo regali
Vorrei prometterti giorni migliori ma siamo solo comuni mortali
Tu ti migliori pensando per due ma i miei difetti rimangono uguali.

Come fai a sopportarmi, non cambio mai,
Alzo la voce per niente, sono lo stesso di sempre.
Sparisco giorni e non chiamo
Mai mi chiedo quando ti stancherai,
Ma tu fai finta di niente, tu sei la stessa di sempre.

Godiamoci il presente fan culo il prima e il dopo,
restiamo quelli di sempre soltanto in foto e tu, dove vai?
Rimani qua, non sarà stato uno sbaglio finché sbaglierò a metà
Sparisco giorni e non chiamo
Mai mi chiedo quando ti stancherai,
Ma tu fai finta di niente, tu sei la stessa di sempre.

Emis Killa,"Caro Dio, mi scuso se sono sparito
E’ che, ultimamente, lo avevi fatto anche te
Non sono qui per litigare ma siamo sinceri
Io ti ho cercato in ogni dove, tu invece dov’eri
Nella mia vita non sei stato quel che dovresti
Il diavolo è stato più bravo, per certi versi
Il credo dalla fede, ognuno c'ha la sua
Mia madre in chiesa piange sangue, più della tua
Non so con quale scusa ti possa difendere
La gente scrive preghiere ma forse non ami leggere
Nasci in gara per poi perdere
Veniamo al mondo piangendo e questo mi ha sempre fatto riflettere
Se ti comporti male, ti fai qualche nemico
E ci sarà un motivo, se Giuda ti ha tradito
Mi hai creato a tua immagine e oggi sono un re
Ma la corona di spine tieni tela per te.

Mio Dio
Qualche volta che io ti cerco, quando sono nei guai
Scrivo una lettera dall’inferno ma non la leggerai.
(Mio Dio) detti legge nell’universo, perché prendi e dai
Ma le lettere dall’inferno non le leggi mai.

Se sei onnipresente e dall’alto ci fissi
Se sei onnipotente a ’sto punto te ne infischi
Considerando le volte in cui vedi e non agisci,
Forse conviene farci credere che non esisti
Nonostante I crocifissi e le preghiere ad alta voce
Nessuno è prediletto, ognuno ha la sua croce
Non prego quando pranzo e non ti ringrazio
Il pane a tavola ce l’ho perché mi alzo, e mi faccio il mazzo
Faccio buone azioni,
Ma nonostante questo sul mio conto girano cattive voci
Scendi dall’altare, per una volta si può fare
Liberarti dagli impegni e liberaci dal male
Un Dio che impone I suoi comandamenti, che giustizia è?
Un Dio onesto, un Dio che non detta regole
Non avere alcun Dio al di fuori di me,
Lo direbbe solo chi è egoista e pensa per sé.

Mio Dio
Qualche volta che io ti cerco, quando sono nei guai

Detti legge nell’universo, perché prendi e dai

Emis Killa,"Piacere mi chiamo Emiliano ma chiamatemi Mario
Definito il Balotelli del rap italiano
Dicono ""che peccato"", ""un talento sprecato""
Combino sempre qualche cazzata ovunque vado
Mi gridano venduto, li mangio e non li cago
Andate a fare in culo la fama non mi ha cambiato
Non piaccio a tutti in fondo che vuoi
Per i figli sono un figo per le mamme un bad boy
Sono ingestibile come Mario,
Il manager si incazza non arrivo in orario
Numero uno col disco d’esordio
Mi impegno poco ma vi inculo quando voglio

Fermi tutti fate largo,
Questa sera c’è il numero uno in campo
Perché sempre io? Why always me?
Che vi piaccia o no sono made in Italy (come Mario)

In molti mi amano (come Balotelli)
In molti mi odiano (come Balotelli)
Da una parte mi acclamano (come Balotelli)
Dall’altra mi insultano (come Balotelli)
Torno a casa tardi (come Balotelli)
E poi mi alzo tardi (come Balotelli)
Tu non provocarmi (come Balotelli)
O ti prendo a calci (come Balotelli)

Chi ha provato ad aggiustarmi non ci è riuscito,
Non riesco a stare zitto non riesco a rigare dritto
Tutti che si aspettano qualcosa da me
Un giorno sono il peggio quello dopo il re
I media mi hanno nel mirino
Puntano sulle mie forze ma se sbaglio mi puntano il dito
Quando sono sul palco ai miei fan faccio un regalo
Mi tolgo la maglietta e gliela lancio come Balo
Quando produco bombe la gente mi chiede
Di fare come Mario, di buttarle in rete
Sono una fottuta star, conferma chi ha visto
All’aeroporto mi attendono come Gesù Cristo

Fermi tutti fate largo,

Al massimo vado a puttane non con i travestiti
Non eseguo gli ordini, faccio a modo mio
Beccassi Nicky Minaj ci proverei anch’io
Voi fatevi una vita, trovatevi una figa,
Dicono ""non lo invidio"" e poi mi guardano la tipa
Tu sei tutto casa e chiesa quanta serietà
Io c’ho la testa di cazzo ma sono in serie A
Poco umile, troppo irascibile è inutile
Ho sbagliato lavoro dovevo fare il pugile
Troppo odio sulle spalle, ti sdraio
Calci sopra le tue palle, come Mario

Emis Killa,"Se potessi fermare il tempo come una fotografia
Prenderei questo momento, ci farei un’enorme gigantografia
Per poi buttarmici dentro e gioire nel mentre
Io spesso mi ammalo di gioia ma quando ne comprendo I sintomi,
Mi è già passata la febbre.
A volte vorrei toccare le ore, vorrei ma non posso
Giorni in cui penso alla morte, mentre la vita mi scivola addosso
Sotto le luci di sti riflettori, non si vede il mio lato più buio
Il volto baciato dal sole, col cuore sotto lo zero, come mercurio.

Non senti che freddo che c’è, ho lasciato indietro una parte di me
Ma il sole dov’è? è qua vicino a me
Ma il sole dov’è? il sole è qua vicino a me, vicino a me
Resterò al buio anche se loro non sapranno mai tutto di me
Ma il sole dov’è? è qua vicino a me
Ma il sole dov’è’ il sole è qua vicino a me, vicino a me

Anni che sembrano giorni, giorni che sembrano anni
Da qua le stelle non sembrano enormi, piccolezze ci appaiono grandi
Volti segnati col cuore di ferro, arrugginiti da lacrime sporche
Amori infiniti ricordano un giorno di luce, ma il sole non sorge due volte
Tra circostante assurde, starmi vicino è difficile
C’è chi le ha provate tutte, ma la mia vita è un pianeta invivibile
Provo a restare coi piedi per terra, nonostante la forza di gravità bassa
Ma quando ti bacio mi manca l’ossigeno e scappo in un’altra galassia

Non senti che freddo che c’è, ho lasciato indietro una parte di me
Ma il sole dov’è? è qua vicino a me
Ma il sole dov’è? il sole è qua vicino a me, vicino a me
Resterò al buio anche se loro non sapranno mai tutto di me
Ma il sole dov’è? è qua vicino a me
Ma il sole dov’è’ il sole è qua vicino a me, vicino a me

Sospeso per aria, dal basso mi puntano il dito
Infondo chi siamo? puntini in mezzo all’infinito
In cerca del giusto equilibrio, compreso io
Che cerco spazio perché il mondo s’è preso il mio
Imboccato a parole dal diavolo, dialogo con l’eloquenza di un dio
Crateri negli occhi, colmati da giochi di sguardi
Non piango se muore una stella, per quanto potrà essere bella so che ce ne sono miliardi
In mezzo a giganti, non sarò mai uno dei tanti
Lo giuro, nella mia testa non voglio abitanti, solo silenzio, come mercurio.

Non senti che freddo che c’è, ho lasciato indietro una parte di me
Ma il sole dov’è? è qua vicino a me
Ma il sole dov’è? il sole è qua vicino a me, vicino a me
Resterò al buio anche se loro non sapranno mai tutto di me
Ma il sole dov’è? è qua vicino a me
Ma il sole dov’è’ il sole è qua vicino a me, vicino a me

Sono un uomo quaggiù come tanti
Che mi compro una moto in contanti e
Vivo a rate la vita degli altri
Che se esco non torno mai presto
Perché faccio presto a far tardi
Che ho posato per terra I bastoni
Perché ho detto basta ai bastardi
E stavo pensando a te, una donna quaggiù come tante
Che vuoi essere al passo con le altre
E mi riempi l'armadio di scarpe
Che mi svuoti la testa in un ora
Ma se sbaglio diventi un sicario
Che sai essere dolce in un bacio
Anche quando c'hai in bocca l'amaro

E stavo pensando a noi
Una coppia quaggiù come le altre
Che riescono nel loro piccolo
Anche se pensano in grande
Che hanno preso la vita per gioco
Cavalcato I binari di un treno
Che si prendono insulti per poco
E si vogliono per molto meno

Pensavo a me col mondo in mano
Ma senza te dov'è che vado
Con tutta questa voglia di brillare
Su in cielo e di scordarmi che ero senza di te

Pensavo a te col mondo in mano
Ma senza noi dov'è che andiamo
Con tutta questa voglia di brillare
So che se c'è da brindare voglio farlo solamente con te

Stavo pensando a me
E a l'infanzia che la vita mi ha dato
Non ho mai giocato coi soldatini
Ero incazzato come un bimbo soldato
Io che faccio più soldi che sogni
Ma rispondo va tutto ok
E mi tengo vicino I sentimenti altrui
Perché vivo ad un metro dai miei
E stavo pensando a te
Una bimba dagli occhi vivaci
Che capisco da come mi abbracci
Che hai avuto più giochi che baci
Tu che quando prevedono neve
Poi ti imbamboli un ora sui fiocchi
Tu che guardi l'oroscopo in tele
Ma non credi nemmeno ai tuoi occhi
E stavo pensando a noi
Una coppia svampita e sbandata
Che spingiamo l'amore in salita
Quando l'odio ci lascia per strada
Che non serve che andiamo in vacanza
Mentre il mondo ci guarda perverso
Noi viviamo in un'altra galassia
Siamo al centro del nostro universo

Pensavo a me col mondo in mano
Ma senza te dov'è che vado
Con tutta questa voglia di brillare
Su in cielo e di scordarmi che ero senza di te

Pensavo a te col mondo in mano
Ma senza noi dov'è che andiamo
Con tutta questa voglia di brillare
So che se c'è da brindare voglio farlo solamente con te

Adesso che so chi sono davvero
Vorrei svegliarmi e scordarmi chi ero

Ti ho cancellata solamente dal telefono
Quanto è difficile ignorarti solo io lo so
Sono all'inferno e tu sei un angelo al citofono
Mentre è arrivato settembre dentro casa mia
Non riesco a trovare più niente che fa al caso mio
La chiamavamo routine quella monotonia
Quella vita di sempre che adesso è nostalgia
Fare una radiografia dei tuoi pensieri
È la cosa più facile
Erano un libro aperto I tuoi desideri
E ho strappato tutte le pagine
Se c'è una faccia che scappa non è la mia
Fuggire per il freddo non fa più per me
La soluzione migliore sarebbe andare via
E invece resto qui all'inferno a ricordarmi che

Siamo, sono, la realtà è che tu per me sei l'unica
Vieni da me, lo prometto questa volta è l'ultima
Sono solo, preso da me stesso e dalla musica
Vieni da me e da domani non chiamarmi più

All'inizio pensavo fosse normale quel fare senza pensarci
Nottate a scopare senza baciarsi
Gridarsi ti odio, sorridendo un attimo dopo
Ma si è spento il fuoco guardami dentro e cadi nel vuoto
Tu versi un mare di lacrime, è un maremoto
Ma io sono troppo stanco per raggiungerti a nuoto
E mentre io affogo ogni giorno di più, io non ti ascolto e tu
Stai chiusa in gabbia anche se fuori c'è molto di più'
Cadere e poi rialzarsi, piangere e poi sorridere
Tu l'hai chiamata sofferenza io lo chiamo vivere
Tra diffidenti e vipere decidere è difficile
Per amore non sai se morire o uccidere
Dovremmo fare due parole perché le persone
Più' son sole e meno qualcuno le vuole, tra tutti I limiti
Abbiamo scelto il cielo e si avvicina sempre più
Ma ora ho paura se guardo giù c'ho le vertigini
È per questo che

Fanculo l'invidia, ki-killa sorride fa cin cin con questa bitch
E con la sua pelliccia in cincillà.
Soffro di dda, disturbo dell'attenzione,
Mi parli e non t'inculo, c'ho la testa altrove
E che vuoi? La boy-band? Beh non cercare noi,
Siamo la blocco recordz mica i pink floyd.
Ho la scimmia come Donkey Kong per le Harley,
Ai moto raduni bevo birra come Barney.
Occhi made in China tipo Sharpey
Quando torno a casa zio mi perdo tipo cat away,
Always me come sai chi, il flow pesta thai chi
Ti fa le guance rosse tipo Heidi
Tu come Rydi, noi in furgone come gli a-team.
Siamo i king, se hai capito con la testa fai sì.

I'm a straight ryday, I'm a straight ryday
I'm a straight ryday, I'm a straight ryday

Emis Killa,"Brindo al tempo che non tornerà
L'innocenza perduta dell'età
Brindo a chi era allora e ora non c'è
Brindo e guardo al futuro brindo a me

A volte penso che ripartirei da zero
Da quando avevo qualche amico in più e qualche soldo in meno
Giornate passate in mezzo ai casini
In piazza sulle panche o in parcheggio seduti sui motorini
Erano i tempi della scuola che non va un granché
Nella mia compa tutti ripetenti a parte due o tre
Tutto era più vero, tutto era più cool
I bomber, le giostre e la musica tunz tunz
Le ragazzine non erano mini donne
Niente trucco sugli occhi niente tacchi, niente minigonne
I nostri idoli, cantastorie di quartiere
Ascoltavamo racconti di botte date e prese
Alle prese con la vita, più cresci più capisci
Un giorno esci di casa e sono tutti un po' più tristi
Dei vecchi tempi rimpiango qualunque roba,
La piazza piena, lo sguardo pieno, la testa vuota

Brindo al tempo che non tornerà
L'innocenza perduta dell'età
Brindo a chi era allora e ora non c'è
Brindo e guardo al futuro brindo a me

Ricordo ancora le prime serata a base di alcool
Le feste in casa a Capodanno
Le prime volte in disco vestito da zarro,
Le mie prime love story, giornate intere a limonare al parco
O il mio primo compleanno fuori casa
Tutta la notte a bere e tutto il giorno dopo con la nausea
Quanto mi manca fumare e basta, ridere e basta,
Fottere il tempo col culo su quella panca
Gli anni migliori, quelli di fast&furious e di scarface
Dei primi videogames sulla prima play
I tempi dei puntelli in strada con il sole o con la pioggia
Ci si telefonava, non c'erano i social
A parte una giornata nera il problema più grosso che c'era
Era che cazzo mi metto stasera?
Rivorrei la testa vuota che avevo quei giorni
Adesso che ho la testa piena di ricordi

Brindo al tempo che non tornerà,
L'innocenza perduta dell'età
Brindo a chi era allora e ora non c'è
Brindo e guardo al futuro brindo a me

10 Anni dopo passo in piazza con qualche immagine impressa
Vimercate non è più la stessa
I pischelli si atteggiano come gangster
Ripenso a me che quando rispondevo a uno più grande erano sberle
E so bene che tra 10 anni ci sarà qualcun altro che
Parlerà di oggi come di 10 anni fa
I pischelli di cui parlo avranno la mia età
Parleranno di pischelli che si sono spinti un po' più in là
Tutto cambia con il tempo, i luoghi
Sempre più cemento sempre meno parchi giochi
Il divertimento oggi te lo compri e non te lo godi
Tra nintendo, play xbox non ci son più sale giochi
Tra due fuochi, gioventù e vecchiaia,
La prima per essere felici
La secondo per prendere atto e rimpiangere quell'aria da ragazzo
E quelle teste vuote dei suoi amici

La testa vuota, che bella vita esistevamo solo noi
Se anche la meta era sconosciuta dubbi non ne avevamo mai
Com'è arrivata, poi se n'è andata in un soffio di malinconia
Ma è ritornata, in rima baciata e il ricordo mi fa compagnia

Brindo al tempo che non tornerà,
L'innocenza perduta dell'età
Brindo a chi era allora e ora non c'è
Brindo e guardo al futuro brindo a me

Brindo al tempo che non tornerà,
L'innocenza perduta dell'età
Brindo a chi era allora e ora non c'è
Brindo e guardo al futuro brindo a te",La  testa vuota,2013
Emis Killa,"Va bene avere un sogno, una vita da favola
Ma sei disposto a rinunciare a tutto pur di farcela?
Va bene farsi 100 donne come i sultani
Ma sei capace a non tradire la donna che ami?
Va bene essere uomo, darsi un tono e stare in guardia
Va bene avere una pistola ma sapresti usarla?
Va bene fare un figlio ma poi vederlo crescere?
Va bene andare in cima ma sei capace a scendere?
Va bene essere avanti ma rispetti chi è indietro?
Va bene dirle ti amo ma sei sincero?
Va bene contare il cash ma conti senza il cash?
Va bene contare suoi tuoi ma loro contano per te?

Non puoi pensare vada tutto bene
Perché in questo mondo mica tutto va
Certe volte sembra vada tutto bene
Ma dall’altra parte c’è sempre un ma
E quindi va bene si, va bene no,
Dall’altra parte devi compensare un po’
E quindi va bene si, va bene no
Io lo faccio sempre e infatti
Tanto prendo tanto do

Va bene volere bene alla gente che hai attorno
Ma sei capace a dimostrarlo quando ne ha bisogno?
Va bene farsi aiutare finché diventi grande
Ma quando lo sarai camminerai sulle tue gambe?
Va bene farsi progetti, ambire a fama e successo
Ma se non va come volevi sorridi lo stesso?
Va bene sapere i segreti ma li mantieni?
Va bene far delle promesse ma le mantieni?
Va bene divertirsi ma sai essere serio?
Va bene spingersi oltre ma sai tornare indietro?
Va bene avere dei limiti ma sai metterli?
Va bene fare degli sbagli ma sai ammetterli?

Non puoi pensare vada tutto bene
Perché in questo mondo mica tutto va

Dall’altra parte devi compensare un po’
E quindi va bene si, va bene no

Va bene cercare un amico in momenti di noia
Ma quell’amico poi lo cerchi in momenti di gioia?
Va bene dire affanculo la legge ma la infrangi?
Va bene ridere assieme ma quando piango, piangi?
Va bene farmi domande voler sapere i fatti
Ma quando la risposta è brutta l’accetti o ti arrabbi?
Va bene dire le bugie ma sapresti non dirle?
Va bene avere i problemi ma almeno provi a uscirne?
Va bene essere vago, ma sai lasciare il segno?
Va bene essere bravo, ma sai essere meglio?
Va bene essere schiavo di un piacere effimero
Ma quando il giorno dopo ti svegli ritorni libero?

Schiaccio il territorio lombardo, parto in tour sopra un carro armato
Il suono è Ki-KiKilla lo zarro, killer fuori controllo
Ti si stacca la testa dal collo tipo il mistero di sleepy hollow
Sei già passato di moda da un po’, tu e il tuo crew siete antiquariato
Vorrei vederti coi tuoi b-boy fare break dance su un campo minato
Il colonnello Killa è al top, quando parlo sissignore
E no non è soltanto hip hop, è anche guerra e si si muore (ratatata)
Con la biro miro e sparo rimo esplosivo,
Concentrato mentre scrivo a mano ferma come un cecchino (boom)
Tutti nel mio mirino e non si scappa come Schettino
Faccio I morti con il flow, dopo il mio show chiamate il becchino

La paura ti distingue, quando vuole risposte il tempo stringe
Chiedilo al mio kalashnikov, parla tutte le lingue
Non è che ho flow, ho missili stringer
Per la fuga ho un piano perfetto John dillinger spinto al limite
Al Mike Le Bon, faccia nel fango viet-cong
Accendo sta bomba a Saddam, corri come Forrest Gump dal Viet fottuto Nam
Il reietto del diavolo, il figlio perfetto
Ho la guerra negli occhi, un buco nel petto
E una vita che aspetto la morte all’istante Lei si bagna sul letto di sangue,
Ho il dito sul grilletto tesoro giuro non sparo a salve

Perché mi sento sempre gli occhi addosso
Ho rinunciato a qualcosa di importante
Solamente per sentirmi grosso
E sono solo in tutte queste stanze
Con un freddo che mi arriva all’osso
Se la mia faccia è solo una fra tante
È colpa della maschera che indosso

Sono arrivato fino a qui con i pugni e l’orgoglio
Adesso ho una collana d’oro vero che soffoca il collo
Sento gli occhi addosso, io sorvegliato speciale
Parlo sporco cosi non ho una coscienza da falsificare
Oggi cosa ci faccio qui senza gli amici con cui vendevo sogni
Quelli con cui puoi stare zitto senza che ti vergogni
Io sto seduto su un trono di cash come Johnny
Contare soldi non cura queste mie notte insonni
Potrei farti uno squillo, potremmo avere un figlio
Ma ti ho persa per un pugno di troie e tacchi a spillo
Che a malapena ricordo la faccia e il nome
Io ho chiuso un sacco di porte, nessuno ormai mi apre più il portone

E non sto coi piedi per terra, una quercia senza radici
Carati e Dom Perignon e in superficie sto al top
Però dormo male, non vedo mia madre da un po'

E andai fuori per una ragazza 
Il suo ex mi guardò male 
E feci pugni come Rocky in piazza

Un passante ci riprese 
Con la voce non con la webcam 
E solo io so quante ne ho prese ma 
Tutto questo era un cult

Non era un gioco comunicare 
Prima che il Nokia fosse un supertrend 
Andavo in centro per chiamare 
Da una cabina come Superman

Per me Milano era come New York 
Sui sedili arancioni di un tram 
Ci torno adesso, rimpiango e penso che 
Tutto questo era una cult

Andava sempre così 
Dal lunedì al venerdì 
La stessa gente ed in tasca niente 
Però era meglio di un film

Mike Tyson, Lauda, e James Hunt
Stallone, Hulk Hogan Van Damme 
Mi guardo adesso, rimpiango e penso che 
Tutto questo era un cult

Era di moda andare a ballare 
All'Aquafan o al Cocoricò 
Musica alta e cambi locale 
Poche parole come Robocop

Il fisico delle impennate 
Giovani folli come Peter Pan 
Ci penso spesso e mi accorgo adesso che 
Tutto questo era un cult

Certe pellicole da panico 
Carlito e il finale drammatico 
Di Caprio morto nell'Atlantico 
Tony Montana col kalashnikov

Milioni spesi dentro un Pungiball 
Ci sono I baracconi in città 
E forse non l'ho avuto 
Tutto ciò che ho chiesto ma 
Tutto il resto era un cult

Quando ancora a Milano giravo in scooter 
Rispetto ai macchinoni maxi ha sempre preferito il taxi 
Non ce lo vedo De Niro che fa driver per Uber 
I superman moderni stanno sul computer 
Zero Kriptonite 
Oggi è la vita vera che li uccide 
La concorrenza del rap non è più mite 
Ce n'è sempre uno pronto a farti il culo 
Come l'Uomo Tigre

Se penso a come girava il mondo vent'anni fa 
Che per giocare ai videogame dovevo andare al bar 
La solitudine accompagna anche le superstar 
Finisce che parli con l'auto come supercar

Andavo da Blockbuster, i film di serie A 
I Ghostbuster, Lo Squalo, Jurassic Park 
Mi sentivo in paradiso in quel luna park 
Perché oggi è chiuso, tempo scaduto
Niente più cult

Andava sempre così

Talmente bello che, Fra, non era vero

Non era vero 
Era troppo bello per essere vero e infatti beh 
Non era vero, non era vero, non era vero

Non era vero quello che dicevano a scuola, quando scaldavo la sedia 
Tutti dicevano studia, senza il diploma il lavoro si assedia 
I miei compagni più più dediti mi ridevano, colpa della terza media

Non era vero che dagli spinelli si passa alle spade, come diceva tua madre 
Quella è una trappola a prova di scemo e purtroppo qualcuno ci cade 
Ieri ti ha scritto una tipa che Ciao, Wow, peccato l'account 
Non era vero

Come la boccia che hai preso al discount, non è Pampero, dolce non credo 
Molti preferiscono credere alle bugie perché credere alla verità spesso fa male 
Nonostante questo io dico la verità, Fra, nient'altro che la verità, come in tribunale 
Sempre sincero, a costo di vendere meno, anche se ho il Porsche con il pieno

Parlano i fatti e l'ho fatto sul serio, chi non l'ha fatto

Emis Killa,"Ti ricordi dell’anno scorso, lo stesso periodo dell’anno
Eravamo a Parigi fuori dal pronto soccorso, giovani e pazzi
La prassi? Fare sesso a più non posso
E poi litigare, vedere rosso fino a metterci le mani addosso
Adesso che siamo lontani, non sappiamo più nulla dell’altro
Come due estranei e mi fa strano, penso a quando dicevi “Rimani
Che tanto il mondo ovunque io sia cambia il suo volto a seconda di come
Me lo rendono certe persone”, non sai quanto c’avevi ragione
Baby

Volevo solo dirti che la Costa Azzurra senza noi non è un granché
Compare il mare ad ogni curva, ma ogni spiaggia sembra vuota senza te
Si stava meglio quell’inverno a passeggiare ai piedi della Torre Eiffel
E non vorrei morire a Saint Tropez o alle Seychelles
Ma sotto il cielo grigio di Parigi con te

La solitudine è una brutta bestia, persi in una tempesta di sabbia
Con il cuore che ci dice “resta” e la testa che ci dice “scappa”
In fondo che cambia andare Manhattan o in un qualsiasi posto distante
Traslocare coi propri problemi e vivere dentro una gabbia più grande
E adesso che c’è solo gelo, troppe nubi per essere amici
Sempre più cupi, sempre più grigi, come il cielo quel giorno a Parigi
Tu hai preferito ascoltare gli amici, ti fidavi di ciò che dicevano
E ora sei bella e col nulla attorno, come un’isola in mezzo all’oceano
Adieu

Si stava meglio quell’inverno a passeggiare ai piedi della Torre Eiffel
E non vorrei morire a Saint Tropez o alle Seychelles
Ma sotto il cielo grigio di Parigi con te

Uuh, je me souviens de toi, davanti agli occhi scorrono le immagini
Uuh, comme nous étions une fois, si tratta a volte di equilibri fragili
Uuh, des étrangers qui s’oublient, già dall’inizio destinati a perderci
Uuh, Paris adieu pour toujours, per altre strade adesso devo muovermi

Emis Killa,"Ricordo ancora quel giorno in cui abbiamo litigato in macchina
Quel sabato io guardavo quella lì al semaforo
Chiedendomi se ci stava o no
Tu gridavi ""Sei uno stronzo!"" coi passanti che guardavano
Ogni volta che ti incazzi tutto viene giù
Sei salita su quel taxi, hai detto ""Non mi vedi più""
Ma tu non sai stare senza me, come io di noi
Tornerai da me quando ti passeranno i cazzi tuoi
E se il mio iPhone si spegne ti alteri come non mai
Anche se sto al bar di sempre, chiedi ""Con chi sei? Dove vai?""
Graffi sul volto e bestemmie, colpa della gelosia
Scazziamo in strada a dicembre, che gelo che c'è, andiamo via

Se vuoi possiamo andare a casa a fumare marijuana
Lasciamoci alle spalle il drama
M'han detto che danno un bel film
Se vuoi ti posso perdonare
Questa serata è niente male
Lasciamo spento il cellulare e caliamoci prima che sia lunedì

Ricordo ancora quel giorno in cui abbiamo litigato in quella discoteca che
Mi faceva schifo, però c'eri te
Quel tipo che ti ha toccato il culo
Le sue mani su di te, la sua faccia contro il muro
Io ogni volta che mi incazzo tutto viene giù
Mi sente tutto il palazzo e prendo a calci la TV
Ma io non so stare senza te, come tu di noi
Tornerò da te quando mi passeranno i cazzi miei, e se il tuo iPhone
Si spegne, mi altero come non mai

Roba dentro i bicchieri come il tipo del Volo
Centottanta lungo la curva su un 530 Ferrari
Il mio frà alla guida prende più rossi di Costacurta e Muntari
Metto me al primo posto al costo anche di farvi incazzare
Frate, arrivo sempre in ritardo perché odio aspettare
Io amo tutte le donne a patto che rimangano zitte
Sempre appresso a 'ste cagne, frà dovevo fare il dogsitter
Le mie doti prima di 'ste rime erano palle e sangue freddo tipo Reptile
Pensavo sarei finito male, ma alla fine ce l'ho fatta con il rap, dai
Sto più avanti di 'sti babbi perché ho fatto un salto nel futuro tipo McFly
Se ci sono io nel posto suono e porto a casa la tua tipa tipo McDrive
Frà tu sarai pure ciò che mangi, io sono solamente ciò che indosso
85 chili di ignoranza, 75 senza l'oro addosso
No, non posso fare finta, cade un mito
Sono meno incattivito, è colpa della svolta
Proprio vero che non sono quello di una volta
Ora che vi rompo il culo e poi mi sento in colpa

Loro non sanno chi sono, vedono solo la vita da star
Solo io so quanto sangue ho buttato in cantiere alle 6 di mattina
E adesso che vivo la vita come al luna park
Col cazzo che ritorno ad essere quello di prima
Senza alcun mezzo, con suole scollate e un'angoscia continua
Oggi che il mezzo mi incolla al sedile se metto la prima
Penso ""Col cazzo che ritorno ad essere quello di prima""
Quello di prima

Ironia della sorte, stavo in culo al mio professore
Oggi c'ha una figlia che per me muore, questo flow è Malammore
Sempre vero in tutti i miei scritti, sia da serio che da grattone
Questo cazzo inventa nei dischi? Non fa il rapper zio, fa l'attore
Tanti ci hanno provato e li ho mandati tutti al tappeto
L'hanno presa in culo in un tempo record: Aldo vs. McGregor
Non c'è amore per queste tipe, solo feeling quando le pieghi
Questa è così larga qua dietro che mentre la fotto c'è l'eco
Questa gente mi vorrebbe sofisticato
Ma io no, non mi ci vedo così sfigato
Tutti ambiscono a un appuntamento con la fama
Io ci sono uscito a cena e ci ho litigato
La mia formazione artistica è da cantiere
Sono ancora in giro a farmi tutte le sere
Non mi fotte un cazzo di scoparmi le Veline
Frate, io ci provo ancora con le cameriere
E ora cosa vuoi? Eri tu che mi dicevi ""Non cambiare mai""
Non ho scelto di rappare per piacere a voi
Mi interessa solamente di suonare live
La mia vita è sacrificio e notti in piedi
Non mi dire ""Meglio prima"", no, ti prego
Non provare ad emularci, bro, ti vedi?
Non c'è storia dove c'è la Blocco Recordz

Sono sempre lo stesso, può confermarlo chi c'era
Lunedì sera city deserta, io ancora in giro con gente di merda
Dovrei cambiare, mia mamma ci spera, ma vivo alla vecchia maniera
Questo flow fa come crack, Emis Killa è cult come Buck
Ogni angolo di strada tipo Starbucks
Apro questi rapper a metà come uno StarTAC
Prima di essere una star in 'sto gioco rap
L'ambizione erano gli etti dentro il domopak
Rappresento questa city, ancora sono qua
Se dico Milano pensi prima a me che al Duomo, frà
Non è colpa mia se ho questa mentalità
Da una parte avevo mio papà che dava sempre dei buoni consigli
Ma mi ricordo più gli schiaffi di mia ma'
Fratelli più grandi e mulatti, sopra una ruota col Monster Ducati
Coi randa bastardi, coi vecchi educati, mezzi truccati, cresciuti sbandati, ma pieni di eroi

Frà, ti ricordi la vita com'era? Un po' più severa
Quando i problemi nascevano in strada, mica da una tastiera

Ti guarda in faccia e poi te lo spiega
Vecchia maniera: Rimas Kaukėnas
Non mollo mai fino alla sirena
E dimmi come fai a non farti pena
Io non cambio più: sono una bandiera
Ho fatto lavori così logoranti che ho perso la schiena
Sedici ore, meglio in miniera, e ho scritto quel disco di sera
E Cristo dov'era? Forse non c'era
Forse c'aveva problemi più grossi
Noi che portiamo la croce ogni giorno, ma di noi poi non ti ricordi
E dico ciò che dico perché dico il vero
Amico, mi ricordo di Emiliano senza un euro
E ora parla di euro, e sai, mi rende fiero
Sì, mi rende fiero perché so che dice il vero, boy
E fosse per noi manco avremo uno smartphone
Ma in 'sto lavoro un po' ti tocca usarlo

Seduto in una sauna a petto nudo
Potrei fare educazione siberiana
Con mio padre do rispetto per la famiglia
Ho fatto educazione siciliana
Io vengo dal basso, dal nulla, dal niente
Dal vuoto del frigo di casa di Peppe
Da pare che mettono in terra i ginocchi
Da un buco di stanza a misura per topi
Baida, è tipo un gatto, quindi te, la strada sono io frà, mica te
Tra me e te un separé, baida, è come Ali Bomaye
Son cresciuto senza soldi, paghi tu
Non ci frega che sia Radio Marilù
Dai palazzi di San Vito a Malibù
Convertire una Big Babol in Majin Bū
Vivo alla vecchia maniera: prima del cibo preghiera
L'oro che ho in bocca miniera, stesso palazzo e ringhiera
Ogni sera qualcuno che sclera, col rischio di andare in galera
Come per tutti gli amici di zona
Qualcuno si è fatto soltanto una sera, qualcuno che dentro si è fatto il diploma

Pieno di spocchia, tu che ci capisci

Noi che ne abbiamo viste delle belle

Cambiare lenti giuro è stato un autogol (ma tu no)
So che lo puoi sentire se ti penso
Oggi resto a casa co' un profitterol
Patatine bianche e Aperol
Non si dice ""ma però""
Come onde rotte sugli scogli ci infrangiamo
Diventiamo mare con un tuffo nel passato
Venerdì diciassette t'ho cioccata in giro, accarezzavi un setter

Tu sul divano che ti annoi e guardi la TV
Io sono uscito senza un piano e senza un piano B
E ho fatto a botte con un vecchio all'autogrill

Di insulti e cattiverie, come tutte le sere
Vorrei dormire adesso che ho esaurito ogni bugia
Sotto il tuo sguardo che ora sembra una radiografia
Lungo la via accendo la radio
Passa il mio pezzo preferito ma viene interrotto da una nota audio
Di te che dici che stavolta è l'ultima, lo giuri
Guidando leggo le scritte sui muri
Sembra che parlino di noi un po' come quel libro
Che tu mi hai regalato e che io non ho mai finito
E ora ti dedico un romanzo di brutti pensieri
Pensare che stavamo così bene ieri

Quando ti ho detto ""Non fidarti mai""
È stato stupido, dovevo farmi i fatti miei

E vuoi rifarti una nuova vita
Sì, vuoi dimenticarti di quella prima
E tu mi credi matto, forse hai ragione
Ma pesano queste mattine come mattoni
Vorrei fermare il tempo come prima del Big Bang
Nel preciso istante in cui vieni da me
E non tornare indietro
Ora che è giorno e finalmente ti vedo

E ti allontani, e io rimango fuori dal mondo, senza chiavi
Se a mettere la testa a posto inizierò domani
Stanotte stiamo in giro come fossimo cowboy
Perché le leggi valgono per tutti tranne noi

Per tutti tranne noi, oh-oh-ohi
Per tutti tranne noi, oh-oh-ohi

Emis Killa,"Ho portato il mio disco alle radio
L'hanno ascoltato di rado
In Italia se spacchi fai schifo
Se fai schifo spacchi e riempi uno stadio
Ci credo che sono frustrato
Se non trovo spazio per colpa di 'sto settantenne del cazzo
Che ascolta i miei pezzi e nemmeno comprende il linguaggio
Il messaggio è incompreso
Colpa di questo paese
Dicono il genere è peso
Ogni testo qua viene frainteso
C'è sempre qualcuno che si sente offeso
Sempre teso, sempre in attesa
Dietro a 'sto scemo che si pensa Iglesias
Se i talent talenti non ne hanno mai presi
Sento cantanti che non hanno presa
Nessuno si rinnova davvero
In tele sempre i soliti artisti
Tipo c'è 'sto qui che ha vinto Sanremo
Ma poi vende la metà dei miei dischi
La metà di quelli che ora fanno i giornalisti
Un tempo hanno provato a fare i musicisti
Melodie allegre, musi tristi
Arriviamo noi, sparisci, illusionisti (ehi)

'Sto speaker non è carismatico
Parla e mi asciuga come un cocainomane

Eppure si atteggia da giovane
Mi imbarazza come si comporta
Mi saluta facendo le corna
Me l'ha fatto anche l'ultima volta
Mi sa che ha la memoria un po' corta
Odio quando mi fanno le foto
Ma precisano, non è per loro
Mai nessuno che dice ti adoro (mai)
A 'sto punto i miei fan dove sono?
Ora ogni due mesi serve un nuovo pezzo
Un tempo bastava azzeccarne due
Poi potevi fare anche lo stesso testo per due vite e mezzo
Guarda Ligabue
Freddi come allenatori
'Sti discografici ignorano i cori
Quando i tifosi si infiammano e cantano
Perché i migliori li lasciano fuori
Dicono attento alle cose che dici
Perché ti ascoltano pure i minori

Emis Killa,"Ti ricordi quando non avevo niente?
E dicevamo ""Siamo il sangue ed il sangue è per sempre""
Con la roba sotto sella per strada a dicembre
Quando tornavo col le lame infilate nel ventre
Tu sei rimasta una bandita con il viso angelico
Con le braccia attorno al mio collo, come il crocifisso del battesimo
Quando la realtà ha insanguinato l'incantesimo
Quando lo Champagne era succo di arsenico
Gli amici non sono più molti
Quelli che stanno ancora in piedi era meglio fossero morti
Mi resta poco e niente ed un sacco di soldi
Almeno sono pieno di Jordan e tu di Zanotti
Ma ti ricordi quando dicevi ""Aadrà tutto bene
Ti tengo i soldi almeno ci porteranno via insieme
Quando usciremo mi verrai a prendere col Mercedes
Faremo invidia a tutte quante le mie amiche sceme""

Insieme quando butta male
Quando Emis Killa sputa sangue
Insomma, va che non va de puta madre

Si sono fatti comprare da una busta e dal bere
Tu sei rimasta una regina
L'unica che nel male e nel malissimo mi è rimasta vicina
Senza niente da perdere in giro fino a mattina
Per questo beviamo Gran Patron in una piscina
Stasera usciamo tardi, voglio camminarti davanti
Pago crudo di scampi, con ruote di contanti
Però mi guardi mentre prendo 'sti soldi e li strappo
Perché per farli tu lo sai tutto il male che ho fatto
Ye, prendimi la testa tra le mani
C'è rumore per nulla, come Shakespeare, come una scacciacani
E dormimi addosso ora che abbiamo casa a tre piani
Come quando dormivamo coi pacchi dentro ai divani, ah

Forse ero troppo distratto, forse era quella sbagliata
Tutti gli amici al mio fianco, adesso non so dove sono
Lasciato indietro dal branco, o forse ero io che correvo da solo
Mamma ti chiedo perdono
Dicevi “fermati” e non lo capivo
Quante sciocchezze per sentirmi vivo
Ogni sabato sera per poco morivo
Non ero certo il più forte del gruppo
Se ho vinto è perché ero il più competitivo
Perché non vedevo gli ostacoli lungo la strada
Io vedevo solo l'arrivo

E forse anch'io la strada verso casa non la so

Quanti chilometri ho fatto, e quante volte ho patito
A sentirmi dire che era tempo perso, da chi non era nemmeno partito

Senza sapere dove andremo a finire
Come se fossimo su una crociera
La radio che non ha niente da dire
Facciamoci del male a patto che poi
Ci perdoniamo prima di partire
Nel mio bagaglio non ho altro che noi

Quanti soldati partiti con me in questa guerra di Piero
Ne ho salvati molti, però ho perso il conto di quelli che ho lasciato indietro
Abbraccio la vita, ma temo la morte come se mi stesse ad un metro
Da quando stavo in ospedale e mia madre piangeva parlandomi a gesti da un vetro
Prima dei soldi e la gloria
Ho fatto ogni tipo di cosa
Dopo che ho mollato scuola
Spaccato pietre, venduto droga
E ora che il fondo lo guardo da su
Nelle mie acque c'è gente che nuota
Ma non dimentico di quando sono arrivati gli squali e la spiaggia era vuota
Gira la ruota e
Di colpo ci si ritrova qui
Sempre sulla stessa nave, ma
In cerca di una vita nuova, sì
Prima di darci l'addio
Prega anche per conto mio
Che dagli amici fidati mi protegga Dio
Ai miei nemici ci penserò io

Un galeotto sopra un galeone
Se vuoi ruggisci, ma non fare nomi
Una pelliccia al collo non ti fa leone
Squalo bianco pronto a farti il culo
E se vedi la pinna mettiti al riparo
Ho sentito il tuo disco, suona un po' immaturo
Sono Donna Imma per questi Gennaro
E io che ho la cazzimma perché qua è gennaio
Dieci gradi in casa con mia madre affranta
Mi ripenso spesso su quell'F10
Mentre appoggio il culo su un F50
E do gas, woah, perché questa vita è fast, woah
L'Italia mi vuole casto
Io entro all'inferno col pass, woah

Le sensazioni quando ti ho vicina
Quando mi sveglio di prima mattina
E non ti trovo a letto, tu che ti alzi prima
Il tuo buongiorno sopra ad un biglietto
E il tuo rossetto sopra a una lattina
Sei fuori donna, dentro ragazzina
C'hai la testa in aria e l'aria sbarazzina
Questa vita è dura, ma non lo sai ancora
Cammini scalza sopra gli scorpioni
Creatura pura, ingenua per natura
Tu che credi ancora che vincano i buoni
Mi mandi fuori quando sto alla guida
E penso a fare i money, faccia da rapina
Mentre tu sorridi e guardi fuori imbambolata
Sopra gli aquiloni come una bambina
Perdo la bussola quando il tuo corpo
È riflesso dentro gli occhi miei
Ma queste strade so già dove portano

So che ogni giorno è la solita storia
Ti guardi allo specchio e poi vai in paranoia
Ogni volta vorresti rifarti qualcosa

Ma ormai-ahi-ahi-ahi
So che torni a casa un'ora dopo

Ma fin quando ci si fida andiamo
Ti farò da guida e se per caso cadi
Nella loro invidia, stringimi la mano
Se l'odio è un virus io m'ammalo poco
Perché la vita mi ha fatto un regalo
Con te che sei figa anche vestita in malo modo
La mia ispirazione come Frida Kahlo
Se prima di incontrare te ogni mia storia durava due notti
Con te, lo giuro, farei due marmocchi
Simili a me però con i tuoi occhi (uo-oh)
La casa piena di giochi
Mentre io in studio provo a fare i soldi
Saremo liberi o morti
Come se fossimo Clyde e Bonnie (uo-oh-oh)

Legati anche senza tenerci per mano 
Finiti per caso in un gioco sbagliato

E io in hangover sopra un letto di bicchieri
Dicono l'alcool ci renda sinceri, e ora che sono fuori
Eccoti i miei lati veri, che sono anche i peggiori
Venuti fuori dalle crepe in mezzo a questa city
Siamo cresciuti come fiori e mo' siamo appassiti
Guidando ascolto i tuoi vocali dall'impianto audio
Alternando la playlist al tuo pianto psycho
Per farmi un torto ti sei tinta, nuovo taglio vintage

Mentre scrivi sul diario e sbrani il tappo della Bic
Mentre piangi su una tuta di ciniglia
Che assorbe le tue ansie
Spezza le mie lance
Che struscia sulla maniglia
Il tuo sorriso bricolage, i nostri cuori collage
Ho messo il tuo ricordo in un garage e pace fatta
Tu scorpione, io bilancia e per chiama' m'hai puncicato su una spalla
M'hai avvelenato

E quando vola non possiamo più acchiapparla

Lettere per Dio finite sul mio cell
Mi sento a disagio in questa festa è come se
Si stessero divertendo tutti quanti tranne me

Chi sono i buoni e chi i cattivi chi lo ha stabilito?
Tutt'uno con questa città, dei giorni è come se
Anche le scritte sopra i muri parlino di me
Stanotte il cielo senza nuvole che bello è?
Per me è un miracolo, per te non è niente di che

Running out of all our clothes
And the flash don't light when the battery's low

When you could stamp a foot down through the floor
It's a better plan by far
To blow off the roof and let in the dark
So we better get started

And if I were you, I'd let go
And feel it all over inside like a chemical
'Cause to tell the truth
I don't know
If it's ever over

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
'Cause it's floating round in the universe
Just swing it like it's tied by a string that you hold
And let it go

We could dig a hole right down into
Somewhere as deep as black and blue
And fill it with a crowd and the sound of right now

And we could carve a tunnel under
And find out just how low it goes, it goes
And we run out of dirt on the other side when we see the light

Well if I were you, I'd look up
And find a place there in the sky where there's room enough
To spread it out, and look 'round
For where to land when you come down

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
'Cause it's floating round in the universe
Just swing it like it's tied by a string that you hold
and let it go

How your smile disappear
How many times you cried in a year
Is it love, or the pride and the fear
Did you try to interfere
How she gonna dive off a pier
With some concrete shoes on their heel (I’ll arrange that)

Ok, I gave everything that I had in my check
Never held back, was you telling em that?

Carefully but full of might
See my head spinning
As surely as the planets
Justify why should I

Only the end I'm dying through
Only the end only the end

I trade my blessings
For a way to open up
A toss up of meaning and 
Hello care to make love
Give me punishment or say
I'm a normal girl
Some would say, you just need to get through
You've got everything to learn
 
What is this, hands that hold me differently
Thieves are never sweet
 
I kissed a marionette that didn't move
Stronger every day without you
Reached for a crown and it wasn't there
I got a fat sticky mess and I'm feeling pretty bare.

And assumed the whole world spins for you

But it ain't enough
You're going on and on and on

I know when I've had enough of you
You're wasting all my time my precious time

While you work out who's wrong and right
I came here out of love but it ain't enough

But you were the the sun, the rain and the superman

And its time to let you fly.

For a while the was a room that was only ours
In the darken hotel light 
There was a peace to the things that were not right

Though you showed me the glow of the runway lights
Now its time to let you go

Gun down all the suits in this place
If the sun comes back like a sniper in black
You know how to medicate the sadness attack

Silent like a spy backstage

That lie near the Moorlough Shore
Your vines that blow by borden's grove
Will I ever see you more?
Where the primrose blows
And the violet grows
Where the trout and salmon play
With the line and hook, delight I took
To spend my youthful days

Last night I went to see my love
And to hear what she might say
To see if she'd take pity on me
Lest I might go away

She said: ""I love that Irish lad
And he was my only joy
And ever since I saw his face
I've loved that soldier boy,""

Perhaps your soldier boy was lost
While sailing 'cross the sea of Maine
Or perhaps he is gone with some other lover
You may never see him again

She said:
""well if my Irish boy is lost
He's the one I do adore
And seven years I will wait for him
By the banks of the Moorlough Shore,""

Farewell to sinclaire's castle grand
Farewell to the foggy hill
Where the linen waves like bleached silk
And the banching stream runs still

Arriverà una frase e una luna di quelle che poi ti sorprenderà 
Arriverà la mia pelle a curar le tue voglie la magia delle stelle

Quando nasce il sole 
E dimostrarti che per niente al mondo ti farei soffrire

Come fosse l'ultimo al mondo
E negli occhi che rimarrai
Come fossi l'unica al mondo
E se il tempo lo stringi in mano
Il giorno dura un secondo

E le tue pose allegre false si ripetono 
Io ti ingradisco gli occhi 
Vorrei capire 
Se tu abbia smesso mai un secondo di mentire
Cerco in ogni sfumatura del tuo sguardo 
Per salvare anche soltanto il tuo ricordo 
E non mi resta altro 

Che odiare 
Per riuscire a sopportare 
Le vampate di dolore 
Nel vederti allontanare 
E odiare fino a farmi massacrare 
Ed ammettere l'errore 
Di aver speso troppo amore 
Che non potrà più tornare 

Il tuo mondo si nasconde 
Dentro ad un telefono 
Insieme alle tue insicurezze che distruggono 
Ogni tua relazione 
Ogni tua storia 
Come ha distrutto me mi fa saltare in aria 
Ogni volta che tu esci dalla stanza 
E mi lasci questo senso di impotenza 
E non mi resta altro 

Che odiare 
Per riuscire a sopportare 
Le vampate di dolore 
Nel vederti allontanare 
E odiare per non farmi massacrare 
Ed ammettere l'errore 
Di aver speso troppo amore 
Che non potrà più tornare (odiare)

Odiare

Le cinque del mattino le foto scorrono 
E le tue pose false colte si ripetono 
Io ti ingrandisco gli occhi vorrei morire 
Capisco che non ti potrò mai perdonare 

Ma odiare 
Per riuscire a sopportare 
Le vampate di dolore 
Nel vederti allontanare 
E odiare per non farmi massacrare 
Ed ammettere l'errore di aver speso troppo amore 
Che non potrà più tornare (odiare)

Emma,"Libera i tuoi sensi e cerca sempre cose pure
Taci e resta indifferente quando incontri le paure
Che si vestono di niente ma poi diventano pesanti
Quando gli occhi non sorridono
È perché non vedono

Tutta la bellezza che la vita ci racconta
Tra dolori e sofferenze c’è ancora chi non s’accontenta
Ma tu stringimi le mani, sento che ce la faremo
Le parole che si dicono senza i fatti muoiono

Poi si vanno a perdere
Tra tutte quelle cose che ti accorgi di aver perso
Tra le parole che volevi dire e invece non hai detto

A volte
Le cose che penso le trovo sospese nell’aria
Nei lunghi silenzi di quando mi sento da sola
Le cose che penso, e la parte di me più sincera

Ridi quando il tempo punta il dito sugli errori
Punterà verso la luna quando arriveranno amori
Non avere pregiudizi sulle mani che hai davanti
Anzi tu prendile se arrivano, stringile se tremano

Cerca di non perderti
Tra quei silenzi che alla fine indossano i tuoi occhi
Quando sei triste è come se piangessi senza lacrime e non te ne accorgi

A volte
Le cose che penso le trovo sospese nell’aria
Nascoste nel pianto di questa mia voce sincera
In ogni speranza di questa mia vita che trema

Le cose che penso me le leggi negli occhi
Perché io non so mentire  
Nella vita ho un solo credo: fai bene e dimentica
Fai male e pensa
Amen

A volte

Emma,"Lasciamo tutte le occasioni aperte
Lasciamo un filo d’aria alle finestre
Ventimila leghe sotto le coperte
Fammi vedere se la voglia ti rimane sempre
Di sudare senza avere un obiettivo
Solo la notte
Restiamo nudi appesi a un filo
Che va
Dalle mie gambe ai tuoi occhi
Fammi vedere amore quando ritorni

Ho sempre voglia di farmi male con te
Facciamo i nostri giochi con la luce
Ho sempre voglia di farmi male con te
Facciamo i nostri giochi con la luce

E sai perché
Passiamo tutta la vita in cerca di un senso
Che no, non c’è
E a me piace di più stare sul pavimento
Addosso a te
E se si deve andare giù
Andiamo giù
Con l’effetto domino
Con l’effetto domino
Con l’effetto domino
Con l’effetto domino

Ne usciamo a pezzi dall’effetto domino
Se una certezza crolla inizia il panico
C’è una promessa sul tuo corpo da mantenere
Se sanno tutti il tuo segreto, negalo
Per sudare senza avere più pensieri 
Solo la notte, restiamo nudi come ieri
E che fai se metto una benda sugli occhi?
Fammi vedere amore quando mi tocchi

Ho sempre voglia di farmi male con te
Facciamo i nostri giochi con la luce

Ho sempre voglia di farmi male con te

Emma,"Quando ti ha visto 
Lui ha visto la luna 
E come un lupo che canta alla luna 
Nel locale era l'una 
E già sapeva che 
Voleva solo te 
Con gli occhi dentro te 

Ma tu che d'altronde sei luna 
Pensavi solo a splendere 
Una fortuna 
Vestita d'argento 
Nel cielo beffardo 
Per brillare al centro 
Restavi nel buio 

Bene, prendo l'astronave 
Per farmi portare, lì da te 
Volo sopra questo mare 
E ti vengo a prendere 

Portami via, allora 
Via da queste quattro mura 
Portami via, per sempre 
Regalami fiori, un bel niente 
Portami via, stasera 
Non farmi più dormire sola 
E dimmi che sono la luna 
E non soltanto 
Una, una 

Luna che sogni un paio di ali 
Ma resti in mezzo a candele e vampiri 
Che ti versano da bere 
E non vedi dal bicchiere 
Che lui già tiene a te 
Ma tu sai solo dire 

Torna sopra l'astronave 
Io non ho carezze che per me 
Prima che possa tremare 
Il cielo e le sue regole 

Portami via, allora 
Via da queste quattro mura 
Portami via, per sempre 
Regalami fiori, un bel niente 
Portami via, stasera 
Non farmi più dormire sola 
E dimmi che sono la luna 
E non soltanto 
Una, una 

Luna luna, una luna 

Quando ti ha visto 
Lui ha visto la luna 
E come un lupo che canta alla luna 
Forse perché crede che sia molto più vicina
E che gli voglia chiedere 

Voliamo via allora 

Lasciando una scia 
Su sfondo nero così pura 
Ed io per te sarò l'incanto 
E non soltanto un altro 
E tu per me sarai la luna 
E non soltanto una, una 
E dimmi che sono la luna e non 
Soltanto una, una",Luna E L'Altra,
Emma,"La felicità è un’idea semplice
Davanti ai tuoi occhi
Tra l’aria che respiri
E quella che
Difficilmente trattieni

Abbiamo già un vissuto
Che a dire il vero
Somiglia più ad un conflitto
Il cuore spesso offeso
Da un dito che
Tu mi hai puntato al petto

Se gli occhi non riescono
A raccontarti ciò che vedi
Proverò io a dirtelo
Perché all’evidenza non ci credi

È troppo tempo che mi parli piano
Son troppi gli anni che ci conosciamo
Avremmo messo su un palazzo intero
E invece ci divide un muro
È troppo tempo che mi parli piano
O sei un ricordo lontano
È amore o solo un’ossessione
È un vento caldo
Troppo caldo che si muore
È caldo che si muore

Gioco a far la guerra 
Perché l’amore non mi ha mai dato tregua
Ma se ti avrò di fronte ancora un’altra volta
Nel dubbio, farò la cosa più giusta
Se gli occhi non riescono
A raccontarti i miei pensieri
Proverò a descriverli un po’ tutti
Anche quelli più neri

È troppo tempo che mi parli piano
Son troppi gli anni che ci conosciamo
Avremmo messo su un palazzo intero
E invece ci divide un muro
È troppo tempo che mi parli piano
O sei un ricordo lontano
È amore o solo un’ossessione
È un vento caldo, troppo caldo che si muore

Siamo qui
Tra un passo incerto e l’utopia di un equilibrio ritrovato
Noi siamo qui
In un percorso parallelo
Ci tocchiamo senza mai incontrarci

Se gli occhi non riescono
A raccontarti ciò che vedi
Proverò io a dirtelo
Perché all’evidenza tu non credi

È troppo tempo che mi parli piano
Son troppi gli anni che ci confondiamo
Avremmo messo su un palazzo intero
E invece ci divide un muro
È troppo tempo che mi parli piano
O sei un ricordo lontano
È amore o solo un’ossessione
È un vento caldo, troppo caldo che si muore
È caldo che si muore
Attento che si muore",Mi Parli Piano,
Emma,"Io ora lo so
Mentre mi guardo in questo specchio
E riconosco ogni mio singolo difetto
So cosa voglio davvero
Non lo nascondo e non ho nessun segreto
Mi guardo indietro e vedo quello che ho lasciato
Non sono più disposta a perdere
E mi riprendo il mio respiro
E punto tutto ciò che ho sul mio destino
Sul mio destino

Le mie gambe hanno camminato tanto
E a volte il cuore
Mi è pesato dentro al petto
Mentre perdevo pezzi di me
Per inseguirti nel vento
Per ogni mano che ho stretto
Ho abbandonato il mio mondo
Ma io sorrido lo stesso
Anche se dentro è un casino

E ti incontrerò 
Negli occhi stanchi della gente
Sarò invisibile ma tu mi capirai
So cosa sono davvero
Nella mia voce c’è la sabbia
E un sole sempre acceso

Mi guardo indietro e vedo quello che ho imparato
Non sono più disposta a perdere e mi riprendo il mio respiro
E punto tutto ciò che ho sul mio destino

I know this feeling don't last long 
It's forever gone 
You already lost my trust 

When I'm over this 
Let the last thing I breathe be you 
Imagine the feeling of passion 
Are you seeing 

Believing when we're breathing? 
But why does it feel so cold? 
Constant feeling of pleasure 
Are you hearing

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
Downtown, no finer place, for sure
Downtown, everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows, downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're gonna be all right now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares

That’s O.K.
Let’s see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let’s get down to it

Hit me with your best shot
Why don’t you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Na na na come on
Na na na na na, come on, come on, come on

'Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

Sex baby,
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let’s talk about sex (Alright)
Let’s talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let’s talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night, I’ll make love to you,
Like you want me too

(And I) And I guess it’s just the woman in you,
That brings out the man in me
I know I can’t help myself
You’re all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time

It’s going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump, like acne
No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

(Girl)I like the way you work it,
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby,

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up , babe

I like the way you work it

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

And how are all

That never did come true?

Been so ready to dim my mind

Hold me, I won't ask for anything more

It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of me

I don't mind if you take advantage of me
So take advantage of me

You're closed, you're a book. No lines
Can't read you if I try
And if that's the way you want it
That's fine I'll just close my eyes and
Try to ignore you, a free ride for you to

I don't wanna be a part of it with the beautiful people
And there you were drinking Coca-Cola, shaking your Polaroid picture
Don't try to explain it, I think that we feel the same here
And all the girls must be models here, sipping up on margaritas
Twist their bodies so beautiful, making shapes with the music
He got it all in a photograph and he marked it with Nikon
Named it ""A Boy in the Zoo"", kissed me deeply, here, that’s for you

And there were too many people at the party in bikinis
They poured their Belvedere vodka into their small glass martinis
And there you were in the corner, smoking a cloud just for cover
His name engraved in his flask, so I don’t have to ask
And all the girls must be dancers, they’re getting up on the tables
Turning their bodies to liquid, so smooth in all the right places
He held a thumb with his fingers and blinked an eye for the trigger
And said, ""Girl in the zoo, I’m glad that’s not you""

This life is not one that I own, Do I dramatise?
These days I think I'll stay at home, By the fireside
Just leave the outdoors to get on, While I theorise

There is nothing here to celebrate
I should be kickin' out my heels parade, Ah
If it fits then I'll wear it
If you can hear me I'll declare it, Share it

I've called your name out, Sunny and blue
I've picture sitting, Just me and you
No one else is, Ever around
This is the acid test that I've, Found

At least three times in a single week, I am run aground
There is no warning I can seek, I am always found
There is no rhyme or reason to this, A fault appears
With the gaping hollow under my feet, I disappear

There is nothing here to stop me
I just fall until it's got me, Ah
If it fits then I'll wear it
If you can hear me I'll declare it, Share it

I've called your name out, Sunny and blue
I picture sitting, Just me and you
No one else is, Ever around
This is the acid test that I've, Found

I think I need to shake up, wake up fast
Forgive a little low, I won't let it last
With every little day that passes
Something is fixin' if something is broken
This conversation is no longer talkin'

I've called your name out, Sunny and blue
I picture sitting, Just me and you
No one else is, Ever around
This is the acid test that I've, Found

There is fortune in my name, Currency in letters
If this life is just a game, I'll try to play it better
We all started just the same, The hopeful and the hopeless
On the streets we made our name, Our confidence, our harness

I know the marks, They don't show on the outside
But each of us carries a tale
And one of these days, We won't talk anymore
Silence begins when we fail, And I
Think I, might break

(Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah)

Now we separate again, But who to lay the blame on
These years of laying claim, To values I could count on

I know the marks, They don't show on the outside
But each of us carries a tale
One of these days, We won't talk anymore
Silence begins when we fail, And I
Think I, might break

Strengthens in a way, We don't see

In you and me

They can take you higher
They can take you higher

Tailored by the moons, She mates so well
Perfected by the symmetry, Her body tells

Just you wait and see
These limbs
They can take you higher
They can take you higher

Sitting by the bed, I can see through her skin
She can hardly breathe a word, Her body is so thin

But I can still see

They can break like branches

And not for the first time, We step on the fault line
And just like that, We watch the fireworks start

You said it was alright, You said it was just
Another night, But your eyes betray the fight
And as for this new land, Well it's not what you had planned, right?
Of love, For this life is stale as tough

Oh, Sleep, If you can

Tell me that it isn't true, The things you say he did to you
For my rage flies, And a man dies
So this is what I'd like to do, But I don't think that you want me to

'Cause people are listening, And watching and pointing
They're looking for windows, And dreaming on porches
So don't say a word if you want to be here in the morning, In the morning

So it all ends here, Almost a way
Out the door, And I'm suddenly fixed to the floor

Oh, Sleep, If you can

Full of life or full of loneliness
Whose eyes will I watch from
Today?

My glass was overflowing, celebrate
This rope's getting tighter
And someone is pulling me back to the start, Oh

I need something that I know now, Oh
Just too far away from home now, Oh
Just a sight or sound to trust now, Oh

Keep it simple, Keep me static
Just enough to lose the panic
Let me see the light again
I have to know, Where it goes

Needing from the inside out
This gut rot I could do without
So sinister, a pastime
I have to know, I have to go

So cut the cord, Throw overboard
This history that claims of me
My present, and my future
Both clear to see, Both bound to be

A replica, this life so far
I think it's time I raised the bar
But this rope's getting tighter
And someone is pulling me back to the start, Oh

I need something that I know now, Oh
Just too far away from home now, Oh

Your showing off screaming on your sell phone

You spend hundreds of dollars on a tee-shirt you wear
For the week its ""in""
Now that were apart I wonder if you miss a thing

Ei loppuyöstä kellon tunnit kuluneet
Miksi sä meet

Kaikki lupaukseni mun
Ovat pian sulta unohtuneet, unohtuneet
Sun perääsi mä itken pienen lapsen lailla

Where the darkness would shine golden bright
And there was no divide between the day and night
Or so a mother told her child

Once there was a wish that came true
Where I found my belief and gave it to you
And before love grew old it became something new
A wide eyed flower in the wild

Dreaming trees your face among the falling leaves
Dreaming trees your voice upon a gentle breeze
Your shadow on my memory
Dreaming trees
Dreaming trees

Paint the dust and colour the rain
Break your silence and tell me your pain
And if god knows the truth he???ll never explain
But there are answers in your smile

Dreaming trees your face among the falling leaves
Dreaming trees your voice upon a gentle breeze
Your shadow on my memories

We walk these woods we lie in the grass
We talk about life while we watch it pass
Like a rose petal sailing down a silver stream
Past the chestnut tree where we used to dream
Dreaming trees

Dreaming trees your face among the falling leaves
Dreaming trees your voice upon a gentle breeze
Your shadow on my memories

Dreaming trees another time another place
Dreaming trees you walk in beauty dressed in lace
Forever in a state of grace

Emma Thompson,"We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast he's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home 'til he's dead
Good and dead

Kill the Beast

Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place

We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow
For in times like this, they'll do just as I say

There's a beast running wild, there's no question
But I fear the wrong monster's released

Sally forth! tally ho!
Grab your sword, grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go

We don't like what we don't understand in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast

Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger's just increased

Ow!

I don't know if I will have the time to write anymore letters
Because I might be too busy trying to participate.
So if this does end up being the last letter,
I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school
And you helped me.

Even if you didn't know what I was talking about
Or know someone who's gone through it.
You made me not feel alone.

Because I know there are people who say all these things don't happen.
And there are people who forget what it's like to be sixteen when they turn seventeen.
And know these will all be stories someday
And our pictures will become old photographs
And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad.
But right now these moments are not stories.

This is happening.
I am here and I am looking at her
And she is so beautiful.
I can see it.
This one moment when you know you're not a sad story,
You are alive.
And you stand up and see the lights on buildings
And everything that makes you wonder,
When you were listening to that song
On that drive with the people you love most in this world.

And in this moment, I swear, we are infinite.",Charlie's Last Letter,2012
Emma Watson,"Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say

Bonjour bonjour
Bonjour bonjour bonjour

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good morning, Belle
Good morning, monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've, I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where you off to?

To return this book to Pere Robert, it's about to lovers in fair Verona
Sound boring

Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour, good day
How is your family?
Bonjour, good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive!
There must be more than this provincial life!

Ah, If it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

I'm afraid not
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

Bon voyage

Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound,  excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

Que con ella todo arreglaras

Porque después de tantos
Años aun te puedes sonrojar

Cuando todo marcha mal
Por las rosas que yo compro
Y que tú olvidas en cualquier lugar

Era aquella del Luna Park 
El crepúsculo avanzaba 
De la feria al bar 
Mientras tanto el Ángel Santo blasfemaba 
La polución que respiraba 
Musculoso pero frágil
Pobre Ángel, pobres alas

La sexta luna 
Era el alma de un desgraciado 
Que maldecía el haber nacido
Pero sonreía
Cuatro noches sin haber cenado 
Con las manos, con las manos
Manchadas de carbón
Tocaba el pecho una señora 
Y manchaba y reía 
Creyéndose el patrón

La quinta luna 
Daba tanto miedo 
Era la cabeza de una dama 
Que sintiendo la muerte cercana 
Al billar jugaba
Era grande y elegante
No era joven, no era vieja 
Tal vez enferma 
Seguramente estaba enferma 
Porque sangraba un poco por la oreja

La cuarta luna 
Era una cuerda de prisioneros 
Que caminando, seguía los rieles 
De un tren viejo
Tenía los pies ensangrentados 
Y las manos, y las manos, y las manos 
Sin sus guantes
Pero no te alarmes 
El cielo está sereno 
Y no hay bastantes prisioneros

La tercera luna 
Salieron todos a mirarla
Era, era así de grande 
Que más de uno pensó en el Padre Eterno 
Se secaron las risas
Se fundieron las luces 
Y comenzó el infierno
La gente huyó a su casa 
Porque por una noche 
Regresó el invierno

La segunda luna 
El pánico sembró entre los gitanos 
Hubo alguno que incluso 
Se amputo un dedo
Otros fueron hacia el banco 
A hacer alguna operación 
Pero qué confusión 
La mayor parte de ellos 
Con sus hijos y sus perros 
Corrieron a la estación

La ultima luna 
La vio sólo un recién nacido 
Con ojos hondos negros, redondos 
Y no lloraba 
Con grandes alas tomó la luna 
Entre sus manos, entre sus manos
Salió volando por la ventana 
Era el hombre del mañana

Emmanuel,"Yo tenía mi vida llena
Había dicha en cualquier rincón
Siempre estaba mi alma abierta
Por si ella pedía amor

Yo tenía mis manos llenas
Y vacías me las dejo
Que la busquen por donde sea
Y me de lo que se llevo

Detenedla ya que es una ladrona
Detenedla ya
Detenedla ya que es una ladrona
Detenedla

Que me ha robado el sueno de mis ojos
Y me ha dejado noches que no acaban
Que se ha llevado de mi vida todo
Por no dejar no me ha dejado nada

Que me ha robado el sueno de mis ojos
Y me ha dejado noches que no acaban
Que se ha llevado de mi vida todo
Por no dejar no me ha dejado nada

Emmanuel,"Luces de bohemia iluminaban
Al salir de la academia
Los patosos caminares
De tus pies desorientados
A ambos lados de la realidad
Niña bailarina y yo, detrás.

De tus pantorrillas aceradas
Yo colgaba mis miradas
Mientras iba maquinando
Dónde, cómo, cómo y cuándo
Se le ataca a una puberta en flor
Cuesta tanto armarse de valor

Y exclamar con decisión
¿Me da su hora, por favor?

Y hoy colgado de tu risa
Soy un loco en la cornisa
Haciendo equilibrios para Elisa
De tus pechos diminutos
Se desbordan los minutos
Que hacen de las diez
Una injusticia

Luces de bohemia en cada diente
Contestaste sonriente
Tienes un reloj ahí enfrente
Son las nueve menos veinte
Y en mi casa cenan a las diez
¿Por qué no me invitas a un café?

Una vuelta del revés
Y don Juan fue Doña Inés

Con más ansia que pericia
Desabrochas mi camisa
Besos por botones para Elisa
Y perdido entre tu pelo
Soy un justo que ha ido al cielo
Sin haber pisado nunca misa

No me lo repitas
Estoy recogiendo las cosas precisas para irme a un hotel
Un par de pijamas, jabón, zapatillas, 
Un par de camisas para no volver

Ahora me voy, no me lo repitas
También me he cansado de tantas mentiras
De no serte fiel
Aquí en esta bolsa me cabe la vida 
Con ella a la espalda soy libre otra vez

Las cosas que ahora pudiera olvidar
El libro de versos que yo te leía 
Los días felices que no volverá

El día que puedas me mandas con alguien 
Las cosas queridas de mi propiedad 
Las cosas comunes las tiras al aire
Que vuelen sin rumbo
Que no duelan mas, nunca mas

Marchitada en el suelo
Es mi corazón
Que se muere de celos

Aquel gorrión
Que suspira en el árbol
Es mi alma que llora
Si no le haces caso

Si ves por el cielo
Una blanca paloma
Es mi vida y mi voz
Que te van a decir
Lo que yo te quiero

Esa triste guitarra
Que suena y suena
Sola en la noche
Es mi voz que te dice

No me abandones
No me abandones

Esa triste guitarra
Que llora y llora
Mientras tu duermes
Es mi alma que quiere

Volver a verte
Volver a verte

Si un día en la lluvia
Acaricia tu cuerpo
No es agua mi amor
Son tan solo mis besos

Si el sol en la calle
Calienta tu cara
Son rayos de amor
Que me salen del alma

Si el aire una tarde
Alborota tu pelo
No es el viento, soy yo
Que quisiera vivir
En tu pensamiento

No busco pero el amor
Desesperado, sé a escapado

Todo el mundo busca
Y pocos hallan el amor

Estacionado aquí en tu ser
Soy presa de mi temor
No quiero volverte a ver

Con el tumbao' que tienen los guapos al caminar
Las manos siempre en los bolsillos de su gabán
Pa' que no sepan en cuál de ellas lleva el puñal

Usa un sombrero de ala ancha de medio lao
Y zapatillas por si hay problemas salir volao'
Lentes oscuros pa' que no sepan qué está mirando
Y un diente de oro que cuando rie se ve brillando

Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Y en un zaguán entra y se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo y no hay clientes pa' trabajar

Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida
No tiene marcas pero toos' saben ques' policia uhm
Pedro Navaja las manos siempre dentro 'el gabán
Mira y sonríe y el diente de oro vuelve a brillar

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina
No se ve un alma está desierta toa' la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del zaguán
Y Pedro Navaja apreta un puño dentro 'el gabán

Mira pa' un lado mira pal' otro y no ve a nadie
Y a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Y mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con qué comer

Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revolver, esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe
Un trenta y ocho esmithanhueson del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal

Y Pedro Navaja puñal en mano le fue pa' encima
El diente de oro iba alumbrando
Toa' la avenida, se le hizo facil
Mientras reia el puñal le hundía sin compasión
Cuando de pronto sonó un disparo como un canon

Y Pedro Navaja cayó en la acera mientras veía, a esa mujer
Que revolver en mano y de muerte herida ahí le decía
Yo que pensaba 'hoy no es mi día estoy salá'
Pero Pedro Navaja tu estas peor, no estas en na

Y creanme gente que aunque hubo ruido nadien salió
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas nadie lloró
Sólo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezo
Cojio el revolver, el puñal, los pesos y se marchó
Y tropezando se fue cantando desafinao'
El coro que aqui les traje y da el mensaje de mi cancion

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Pedró navajas matón de esquina
Quien a hierro mata, a hierro termina

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Valiente pescador, al anzuelo que tiraste
En vez de una sardina, un tiburón enganchaste

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Como decía mi abuelita
El que último rie, se rie mejor",Pedro Navaja,2003
Emmanuel,"Por la esquina del viejo barrio lo vi pasar
Con el tumbao' que tienen los guapos al caminar
Las manos siempre en los bolsillos de su gabán
Pa' que no sepan en cuál de ellas lleva el puñal

Usa un sombrero de ala ancha de medio lao
Y zapatillas por si hay problemas salir volao'
Lentes oscuros pa' que no sepan qué está mirando
Y un diente de oro que cuando ríe se ve brillando

Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Y en un zaguán entra y se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo y no hay clientes pa' trabajar

Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida
No tiene marcas pero tos saben ques' policía uhm
Pedro Navaja las manos siempre dentro 'el gabán
Mira y sonríe y el diente de oro vuelve a brillar

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina
No se ve un alma está desierta toda la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del zaguán
Y Pedro Navaja apreta un puño dentro 'el gabán

Mira pa' un lado mira pal' otro y no ve a nadie
Y a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Y mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con qué comer

Mientras camina del viejo
Abrigo saca un revolver, esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe
Un trente y ocho esmithanhueson del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal

Y Pedro Navaja puñal en mano le fue pa' encima
El diente de oro iba alumbrando
Toda la avenida, se le hizo fácil
Mientras reía el puñal le hundía sin compasión
Cuando de pronto sonó un disparo como un canon

Y Pedro Navaja cayó en la acera
Mientras veía, a esa mujer
Que revolver en mano y de muerte herida ahí le decía
Yo que pensaba 'hoy no es mi día estoy sala'
Pero Pedro Navaja tu estas peor, no estás en na

Y créanme gente
Que aunque hubo ruido nadien salió
No hubo curiosos,
No hubo preguntas nadie lloró

Sólo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezó
Cojeo el revólver, el puñal, los pesos y se marchó
Y tropezando se fue cantando desafinado'
El coro que aquí les traje y da el mensaje de mi canción

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios

Tú eras principio y fin de mi alegría

Un poema mil veces por año 
Ya así me entiendas cuánto te amo 

Silbaré como silba un jilguero en el día 
Borraré todas tus pesadillas

Buscaré tierra nueva en el campo

Nadaré mar adentro en tu milla

De tu vientre nació mi motivo

Voy a ser el que siempre te amarra el zapato 
El que cuide de ti cada paso 
El que ponga sabor a tus labios

Emmanuel,"La séptima luna 
Era aquella del Luna Park 
El crepúsculo avanzaba 
De la feria al bar 
Mientras tanto el Ángel Santo blasfemaba 
La polución que respiraba 
Musculoso pero frágil
Pobre Ángel, pobres alas

La sexta luna 
Era el alma de un desgraciado 
Que maldecía el haber nacido
Pero sonreía
Cuatro noches sin haber cenado 
Con las manos, con las manos
Manchadas de carbón
Tocaba el pecho una señora 
Y manchaba y reía 
Creyéndose el patrón

La quinta luna 
Daba tanto miedo 
Era la cabeza de una dama 
Que sintiendo la muerte cercana 
Al billar jugaba
Era grande y elegante
No era joven, no era vieja 
Tal vez enferma 
Seguramente estaba enferma 
Porque sangraba un poco por la oreja

La cuarta luna 
Era una cuerda de prisioneros 
Que caminando, seguía los rieles 
De un tren viejo
Tenía los pies ensangrentados 
Y las manos, y las manos, y las manos 
Sin sus guantes
Pero no te alarmes 
El cielo está sereno 
Y no hay bastantes prisioneros

La tercera luna 
Salieron todos a buscarla 
Era, era así de grande 
Que más de uno pensó en el Padre Eterno 
Se secaron las risas
Se fundieron las luces 
Y comenzó el infierno
La gente huyó a su casa 
Porque por una noche 
Regresó el invierno

La segunda luna 
El pánico sembró entre los gitanos 
Hubo alguno que incluso 
Se amputo un dedo
Otros fueron hacia el banco 
A hacer alguna operación 
Pero qué confusión 
La mayor parte de ellos 
Con sus hijos y sus perros 
Corrieron a la estación

La ultima luna 
La vio sólo un recién nacido 
Con ojos negros, profundos, redondos 
Y no lloraba 
Con grandes alas tomó la luna 
Entre sus manos, entre sus manos
Salió volando por la ventana 
Era el hombre del mañana
Salió volando por la ventana","La  Última Luna [En Vivo Desde Auditorio Nacional, Mexico/2007]",2007

Los amores imposibles nunca encuentran solución
Tengo flechas en el pecho y en la mano el corazón,
Tengo herido el pensamiento que se pierde entre tú y yo

No se si es bueno borrarte y quedarme con tu ausencia,
No se si es mejor mentirle sin querer a mi conciencia
Si te encuentro en otra vida ya no vuelvas a esconderte,
Ahí te dejo una señal en el camino de la suerte

Nos separan mil excusas, nos abraza la piedad,
Los amores invencibles no conocen soledad
Tengo herida la palabra y mi mundo esta al revés,
Si te busco y no te encuentro vuelvo a buscarte otra vez

No se si es bueno olvidarte y quedarme con la duda,
De saber si son tus besos el remedio pa' mi cura
Si te encuentro en otra vida no te olvides de quererme,
Guarda un poquito de ganas pa' juntarlas con mi suerte

No existe otra forma de enfrentarme a mi destino 
Porque el mundo se me hará desconocido 
Si no voy de la mano contigo
No existe otra estrella que ilumine mi camino
Tu me soportas, gracias por estar conmigo
Yo te juro por mi dios que voy a hacer lo que hay que hacer 
Porque otra como tu no existe

No existe
Te juro por mi dios que otra como tu no existe
No existe
Otra como tu no existe",No Existe,2015
Emmanuel,"Son tus manos de nieve suspiros de mares
De tus labios de rosa, que me enloquecen
En tus senos la luna, tu frente mojada
Una flor escondida en muros de seda

Yo te amo, te amo, te amo, te amo
Te amo con toda la fuerza que tengo
Te nombro y te llamo y siempre te encuentro
En mi te encuentro

Impaciente y nerviosa tu piel se desnuda
Es tu voz un suspiro, pero casi gritas
Tu cabello empapado, tus ojos cerrados
Y tu espalda impaciente de amores causados

Yo te amo, te amo, te amo, te amo
Te amo con todo el amor y no vasta
Te nombro y te llamo y siempre te encuentro
En ti me encuentro

Y tus muslos aprietan un alma desnuda
Y se escucha en un soplo tu voz escondida
Y tus pies le hacen punta a tu cuerpo curvado
Moriría en segundos en tu torso calmado

Te amo con todo el amor que yo puedo

Pintas en el viento mariposas amarillas
Y me cubres los silencios con tu amor

But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Emmanuel Bex,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Emmanuel Bex,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1998

A girl like you has got to have about 100 
Guys just waiting in line for her
A girl like you wouldn't give a guy the time or day for sure
But I can't help wondering what it would be like
To have someone like you in my life
Even though i know its just a hopeless faith to see
'Cause you're too beautiful for me

Too lovely, too sweet
Too irresistible in every guy you meet
Too wonderful, too fine
Too unapproachable ever to be mine

So why even bother try 
Try try 

A girl like you makes a guy like me
want to hand over my life, my heart
But the problem is everytime you get close
want to tell you, but i dunno where to start
For all the tears I had thinking of you
I might as well be as well a freak in a zoo
We don't belong together anyone can see

It's too fast, too slow

But all I can rectify is that the party's just begun

Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

It's not that my glass is empty but I need another cup
When all of the doors around me just shut one by one
I feel like falling asleep but the party's just begun

Shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day
A fire in my path and a cool decay
Of limbs and tooth under my skin
Oh, freedom, where do I begin
I'm changing my inflection and how I say the words
Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard
Oh, death of the party
I picked up the chalice of malice
And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full
I was thirsty but I drank till I was full, 
I drank till I, till I,till I was full

There's a fever in my bones that I know so well
I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell
But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell
Before they put me in that chamber
So I'm cleaning up as fast as I can
I'm cleaning up as fast as I can

You cannot fuel without a tank, 
no you can't unbreak what you break, what you break

Dont tu m'as parlé
Où j'entends notre chanson

Ça me fait du bien
Ça m'a fait du bien

Sans bien même savoir pourquoi,

À cause de mon t-shirt double face

Impossible de jeter

De photos en vrac
Série de nous sous la pluie.

Et je t'aime au présent
Même plus qu'avant
Pour mes projet d'avenir
J'aimerais t'appartenir
Tu peux dire exclusivement.

J'en ai besoin

Même si c'est sans moi
Je veux te voir heureuse

Emmanuel Moire,"Deux rappels et un dernier bonsoir
Je m'en vais par le même couloir,
Dans la loge on me sourit, remercie
Pas d'appel, mais un ancien message
Je m'efforce de tourner la page
À l'arrière de ce taxi dans la nuit

Moi j'étais bien plus qu'un homme en quelques heures
Porté, accueilli en vainqueur

Mais le temps de le vivre
C'est le retour à la vie pour moi,

Un hôtel et plus personne pour voir
Qu'à présent, je suis seul ce soir
À chercher comment dormir dans mon lit

Porté, accueilli en vainqueur
Mais le temps de le vivre
C'est le retour à la vie pour moi,

Comblé, applaudi et sans peur
Mais le temps de le vivre
C'est le retour à la vie pour moi, pour moi
Mais le temps de le vivre, c'est le retour à la vie pour moi

Comme la veille, j'attends la scène, le noir
Puis j'entends ceux qui viennent me voir
Et je sais que j'ai envie d'être en vie

Pour tomber sur tes pas.
Si c'est dans la ville où je suis né,

Mais quand on se verra,
Un jour ou l'autre,
Mais quand tu seras là,
Ce jour ou l'autre,
Je saurais que c'est toi,
Parmi tant d'autre,
Même sans dire un mot,
Sans dire un mot.

Je ne sais pas quoi toucher,
Pour tomber sur tes doigts.
Nus ils nous arrivent de poser,
Nos mains au même endroit.
Je ne sais pas où chercher,
Mais j'ai compris parfois,
Que j'aurais dû regarder devant moi.

Mais quand on se verra,
Un jour ou l'autre,
Mais quand tu seras là,

Passant aux pieds des tours
Invitant au silence

Le temps a fait son œuvre
Les mirages, les couleuvres
Ont pu tenter leur chance

A la moindre avancée
Me sentir étranger
Alors que tout commence

J'ai appris tous les signes

Les menaces et les pieuvres
Ont eu leur récompense

A la moindre avancée

Retour à la souffrance

Mais j'ai baissé la tête
Oubliant les défaites
Découvrant la patience

Il suffit de se taire
Et devenir contraire
A tout ce qui offense
A tout ce qui m'offense

J'ai appris tous les signes
Redessinant la ligne
Selon les apparences

Comme un nouveau parcours
Où l'aveugle et le sourd
Demandent obéissance

Le temps à fait son œuvre
J'ai plongé dans son fleuve
Et tenu la distance

A la moindre avancée
Le sentiment gagné
D'avoir repris confiance

Et j'ai levé la tête
Remerciant les défaites
Découvrant la patience

Une ou deux ou bien mille

Accueillant et léger

Et puis qu'est-ce qu'elle a bien pu faire,
Juste après?

Se balader, prendre l'air?
Oublier le sang, l’éther,
C'était la nuit ou le jour,
Juste après?

Deux, trois mots d'une prière?
Ou plutôt rien et se taire
Comme un cadeau qu'on savoure
Qu'a-t-elle fait?

Un alcool, un chocolat?
Elle a bien un truc comme ça,
Dans ces cas-là.

Le registre, un formulaire,
Son quotidien, l'ordinaire,
Son univers.

A-t-elle écrit une lettre?
Fini un bouquin, peut-être?
Une cigarette?

Qu'est-ce qu'on peut bien faire,
Après ça?

Elle y est sûrement retournée,
Le regarder respirer,
Puis s'est endormie.

Si paisible en ignorant,

Emmanuel Moire,"Sur une arme les doigts noués
Pour agresser, serrer les poings
Mais nos paumes sont pour aimer
Y'a pas de caresse en fermant les mains

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer
Dans un poing les choses à soustraire
On ne peut rien tendre les doigts pliés

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Mécanique simple et facile
Des veines et dix métacarpiens
Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté
Celui qui menace ou désigne
De l'autre on livre nos vies dans des lignes

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
(Suffit de rien dix fois rien)
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
A peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Un simple geste d'humain
Quand se desserrent ainsi nos poings
Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange
Des champs de bataille en jardin

Le courage du signe indien
Un cadeau d'hier à demain
Rien qu'un instant d'innocence
Un geste de reconnaissance
Quand on ouvre comme un écrin

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Quand on ouvre nos mains",Nos mains,2013
Emmanuel Moire,"Tu me dis que rien ne passe
Même au bout d'un moment
Qu'un beau jour c'est une impasse
Et derrière l'océan

Que l'on garde toujours la trace
D'un amour, d'un absent
Que tout refait surface
Comme hier
Droit devant

Tu me dis que rien ne sert
La parole ou le temps
Qu'il faudra une vie entière
Pour un jour faire semblant
Pour regarder en arrière
Revenir en souriant
En gardant ce qu'il faut taire
Et puis faire comme avant

Je peux seulement te dire
Je peux seulement te dire

Qu'il m'a fallu la peur
Pour être rassuré
Que j'ai connu la douleur
Avant d'être consolé
Qu'il m'a fallu les pleurs
Pour ne plus rien cacher
Que j'ai connu la rancœur
Bien avant d'être apaisé

Tu ne sais pas encore
Ce que je sais par cœur
Ce que je sais par cœur
Beau malheur

Tu me dis que rien n'efface
Ni la craie, ni le sang
On apprend après la classe
Ou après ses 30 ans
Qu'on peut dire trois fois hélas
Que personne ne l'entend
Comme personne ne remplace
Ceux qui partent pour longtemps

Tu me dis que vient l'hiver
Qu'on oublie le printemps
Que l'on vide les étagères
Qu'on remplit autrement

Qu'on se rappelle les yeux verts
Le rire à chaque instant
Qu'après tout la voix se perd
Mais les mots sont vivants

Je peux seulement te dire
Je peux seulement te dire

Qu'il m'a fallu la peur
Pour être rassuré
Que j'ai connu la douleur
Avant d'être consolé
Qu'il m'a fallu les pleurs
Pour ne plus rien cacher
Que j'ai connu la rancœur
Bien avant d'être apaisé

Tu ne sais pas encore
Ce que je sais par cœur
Ce que je sais par cœur

Tu me dis que c'est un piège
Un jeu pour les perdants
Que le bateau est en liège
Et l'armure en fer blanc

Que plus rien ne te protège
Ou alors pas longtemps
Que c'est comme un sortilège
D'être seul à présent

Je peux seulement te dire
Je peux seulement te dire

Pour être rassuré
Avant d'être consolé
Pour ne plus rien cacher
Bien avant d'être apaisé

Il m'a fallu la peur
Pour être rassuré
Et j'ai connu la douleur
Avant d'être consolé
Il m'a fallu les pleurs

Dans le tiroir du haut
Loin des éclaboussures
A l'abri du chaos

Et jeté les sanglots

J'ai gardé ton injure
Dans le pli d'un manteau
Sur n'importe quel mur
Au revers des tableaux

Puis se tiraient la langue

Et mon cœur de se fendre

Moi je tenais ma langue
Je vais compter jusqu'à dix
L'adolescent et le fils
J'avais seize ans
Ma deuxième vie

C'est ta maison après minuit
Je crois qu'on se ressemble
Nous nous plaisons cela suffit
Je te suis dans la chambre
Mais je sais au fond que rien n'est vrai
Qu'il ne faut rien attendre
C'est un prénom à murmurer
A poser sur la langue
Je vais compter jusqu'à dix
Je suis l'adulte et le fils
A vingt six ans
Ma troisième vie

C'est ma maison quelques amis
Le bonheur il me semble
Un horizon qui s’éclaircit
Un amour dans ma chambre
J'ai là sur le front des nouveaux traits
Tous les mois de septembre
Et un prénom qui va manquer
Sur le bout de ma langue

Emmanuel Moire,"J’ai pris le temps de faire cent fois le tour 
J’ai pris la chance, elle peut servir un jour 
J’ai pris l’amour, mais il n’a pas suffit 
J’ai pris des mots qui sont parfois petits 
J’ai pris le goût de tout ce qui commence 
J’ai pris ma peine et j’en ai fait l’absence 
De ma victoire j’ai préféré l’argile 
Dès le départ je n’ai pris que l’utile
J’ai pris le temps de faire un pas vers toi

Tu fais sûrement une nouvelle fois le tour 
Tu fais semblant que tout ça dure toujours 
Tu fais l’amour et si l’amour fini 
Tu fais en sorte qu’un autre te sourit 

Tu fais sans doute le vœu que tout commence 
Tu fais le choix et c’est une évidence 
De ta victoire tu es resté lucide 
Dès le départ, c’est toi seul qui décide 
Tu fais sûrement encore un pas vers moi 

Le jour est venu après tout 
On a toujours eu rendez-vous 
Je t’attends et j’ai confiance

Je m'arrête au beau milieu 
Point final après le ""Je""

Où l'on apprend, c'est curieux 
À ne faire que des adieux

Fais lui dire ce que tu veux 
Fais la passer aux aveux 

Elle qui n'a jamais su le dire
Elle se permet de me mentir
Ma parole m'a juré que
Certains mots sont dangereux 

Elle qui n'a jamais su le dire
Elle qui ne sait que me trahir
Ma parole fait ce qu'elle peut
Pour se taire entre nous deux

Pour qu'un jour je puisse te le dire
Je pourrais soudain me guérir
Un moment simple et heureux

Premiers pas posés
On marche un instant
Avant de tomber

Dans la cour d’école
On a beau jouer
On fini au sol le genou blessé

On tombe amoureux
Et le cœur lancé
Il fait de son mieux
Avant de casser

C'est un jeu de quilles
On est tous conviés
Les garçons, les filles
Tour a tour tombés

Mais nous sommes toujours debout, toujours debout
Mais nous sommes toujours debout, toujours debout

Tomber chaque fois, aujourd'hui, après
Sommes-nous maladroit?
Faisons-nous exprès?
Au milieu des autres
On est tous suspect
C'est a qui la faute?
Qui nous a poussé?

On fait ce qu'on doit
Pour ne plus tomber

C'est toucher du bois
Parfois même prier
Et puis ça revient
Ça envoie valser
Les fous et les rois
Le pays entier

Mais nous sommes toujours debout, toujours debout
Mais nous sommes toujours debout, toujours debout

Alors, bien sur on s’aperçoit
Que rien ne dure
Pas même soi
Mais malgré tout on recommence
D'abord un pas ensuite un sens
Et puisqu'un jour on se relève
Que tout combat fini en trêve
On peut tomber une fois encore
Et se savoir un peu plus fort

Car nous sommes toujours debout, toujours debout
Oui nous sommes toujours debout, toujours debout

C'est à 29 ans
Que je suis tomber
Un peu plus qu'avant

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat

Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Emmerson Nogueira,"Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Emmerson Nogueira,"Here I am, once again 
At the other end of the spectrum 
A tug-o-war, my head is sore 
'Cause I adore and I fear you

Well I can disagree with myself 'cause sometimes 
I feel like me and sometimes I feel like somebody else 

One minute, I'm over it
Then the next minute, I feel the opposite
Then the next minute, I feel the opposite 
Of the opposite, of feeling over it",Spectrum,2008
Emmet Cahill,"My, my Lagan love
My Lagan love
Where Lagan stream sing lullaby
There blows a lily fair
The twilight gleam is in her eyes
The night is on her hair
And like a lovesick lenanshee

She hath my heart in thrall
No life I own, no liberty
For love is lord of all

My Lagan love
And sometimes when the beetle horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling low
And through the dooreen peep
There on the cricket’s singing stone
She stirs the bogwood fire
And hums in soft sweet undertones

The song of heart’s desire
The song of heart’s desire",Lagan Love,

The pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone
And all the roses falling

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow

Emmet Cahill,"I’ve met some folks who say that I’m a dreamer
And I’ve no doubt there’s truth in what they say
But sure a body’s bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away

And precious things are dreams unto an exile
They take him o’er the land across the sea
Especially when it happens he’s an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Inisfree

And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city, wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel its wonder or laughter
I’m once again back home in Inisfree

I wander o’er green hills, through dreamy valleys
And find a peace no other land could know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow

And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home and tenderly behold
The folks I love around the turf fire gathered
On bended knee their rosary is told

But dreams don’t last, though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I’m back to stern reality
But though they pave the footways here with gold dust
I still would choose the Isle of Inisfree

I still would choose the Isle of Inisfree",The Isle of Innisfree,2013
Emmet Moeller,"I slipped up, felt the echo of a memory
rise up and disappear from me
Fill my cup, now that I've had two or three,
I can get a little free
It feels good, to celebrate the loss of my independence
I’m in the mood, to let the rhythm push me out of my head

(You're the one)

I’m lit up, dancing in my room alone
I lock my door and turn off my phone
Fill my cup, now that I've had three or four,
I could use a couple more
It feels good, to tune out from the wrongs
of the world around me I’m in the mood,
to let the warm embrace of my cup surround me

(You're the one)

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em

I’m fucked up, but I think I could have some more if
I could get myself off the floor
Spilled my cup, the room is tipping to and fro,
my mind is moving kinda slow
I know I should, break out of these walls
I have built around me
If only I could, face up to the world
let the truth surround me

(You're the one)

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
