Steven A. Clark,"Ape Drums, Steven Clark, and yours truly
Mr. W.W.
I told you once (Can't have)
I tell you twice (Can't have)
The grass looks greener on the other side
'Til you get to the other side

Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have
Why does loneliness hurt so bad
And girl I want you back
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have

Can't have
Can't have
Can't have
Ohh!

I see Central Park, from my hotel room
And it's got me thinking
'Bout the crazy things we use to do
For the fame, for the power, for the fortune
Ducked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate
It was all a dream, now I wake up and live it
Thinking that the sky was the limit
'Til I figured out there was footprints on the moon
Now I'm like get out the way, bitch move

Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
Everyone wants what they can't have right?

Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have
Why does loneliness hurt so bad
And girl I want you back
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have

Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, ohh!

Looking at my backyard, now all I see the ocean
Not bad for a kid that grew up with roaches
Drama, chaos, and different coaches
That's what allows me to see through these vultures
First we shining shoes
Then we own the shoe shop
First we make the sandwich
Then we own the restaurants
First then we clean the house
Then we own every house on the block
Not bad for some immigrants

Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
Everyone wants what they can't have right?

Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have
Why does loneliness hurt so bad
And girl I want you back
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have

Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, ohh!

But I guess we always want
What we can't have",Can't Have,2017
Steven A. Clark,"Underneath your cherry tree
Autumn leaves on top of me
Starring into your endless skies
Buzz around me birds and bees
Everything feels good to me
Starring into your endless eyes

'Cause when you look into me
It's paradise
Don't need another sunrise
With you right next to me
And a kiss goodnight
This could be my last moonlight

We'll never feel this way again
We'll never feel this way again, feel this way again
We'll never feel this way again
We'll never feel this way again, feel this way again

What rose pedals once wilted for
Dying love don't hurt no more
A resting place where young hearts lie
Where dreams are real and plentiful
And everything is spiritual
I kiss your lips and the pain subsides

'Cause when you look into me
It's paradise
Don't need another sunrise
And with you right next to me
And a kiss goodnight
This could be my last moonlight

'Cause I'd die to be young
Forever
Until my days end
And I'd die to be in love
Forever
Surrender

Steven Ansell,"Speak so softly, afraid to use the name
Tongue tied quietly, just turn and walk away
A future perfect, with holes torn in the sides
Consciously quick, to labor on the lie

These marks left by you
Ghost who went too soon
Hold me under
Like you always do
This scratch made for you
Come together soon
Just like always
Waste away these days

The cracks in the picture, never could turn a blind eye
Nothing so innocent, would occupy your mind
So we'll repeat the process further and further apart
Sleep more feel less, lay down in the dark

These marks left by you
Ghost who went too soon
Hold me under
Like you always do
This scratch made for you

Under the darkness leave the conversation undone
All the sentences don't need to be said
Just keep real quiet we'll pretend that we're dead

I'm so tired, can't open my mouth
There's a fire, I can't put it out
I'm so tired, I can't put it out

Moving silent 'til you tell me to stop
But in your eyes I see you don't wanna turn it off

Pulls you apart

A bleeding candle on a mantlepiece
The flicker reminds me
Beat of a heart

That we know just who we are
Lost kids with nothing left
Throwing rocks into the dark

Outside, a street of fire
Broken glass and aching hearts
Petrified as we divide
Screaming out a war of words

We're not fighting to be heard
We just wanna watch you burn

Let it all come undone
Cut it down, down tonight

And I can't find my way
Already buried anyway
And I can't find my way
Already buried any, buried anyway

How long can we pretend
That we know just who we are
Lost kids with nothing left
Throwing rocks into the dark

Something here has gotta give,
But we'll never understand
The reason why we cannot hide
Is trembling in our hands

Let it all come undone
Cut it down, down tonight

And I can't find my way

Ease your soul, you can understand
Take good pride in what you had
The day is done, the day is gone
Again

I'll be waiting up at midnight
When you feel
It's the ghost you made of me
It's the ghost you made of me

Blackened sky is closing in
Concrete walls sit still and the autumn's been
Cool breeze, and the cocktails fight
This bitter taste, this bitter waste of mine

Steven Ansell,"Rinsing his hands of gold
The fear that makes us old
Abused into control
The only thing he knows
Swallowing it down whole

He does what he is told
The lies that he's been sold
A place that feels alone
The silence and the drones
The only thing he knows

Bowing his head in sorrow
The light turns on
So won't you let me please forget?
They're watching close
So won't you let me please forget?
Let me please forget

His eyes showing defeat
A record on repeat
A soul that never sleeps
His heart grows old and weak
Decays and cannot keep
A choice in not to speak
It only makes it harder

The light turns on
So won't you let me please forget?
They're watching close
So won't you let me please forget?

A thousand hands are reaching out
A choir of voices to shake me down
A broken conscience
Won't you let me please forget?

To the sound of myself, so close to the fear
Of what I already know
There's nothing left to learn
I just let it go

Fall backwards, it won't be long until it's over
I can cut a new wound on an old scar that I can't cover
I've been here before, it's where I don't belong
I just let it go

Faces that change, nothing responds
Night becomes short and days are long
Eyes wide away, a body that aches
Chasing the light leading to escape

Steven Bensusan,"Walked with no one and talked with no one

And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2007

God chose to carry to
A hopeless and dying world
Good News.

I'm a disciple of
A caring Father's love,
A light to the world,
To show them the way.

CHORUS
Do they know;
Can they see;
Jesus lives in me. (2x)

A vacant house comes alive
When somebody moves inside,
A light in the window means somebody's home;
I say Jesus lives in me,
But can everybody see
The light of His love that shines in my heart.

(chorus)

A cloud of witnesses surrounds us,
Who long to share what we've received;
Tell me where will they see Jesus,
If not in you and me.

So we must let them know,
Let them see Jesus lives in you and me.
Let them know, let them see;
He is all they need,
Jesus is all we need.



",Do They Know,1987
Steven Curtis Chapman,"Another Sunday morning, same old you,
Hoping that the preacher's preaching's almost through;
Not sure you need to hear this,
Seems like you've heard it all before
A hundred times or more.
All this information second hand;
Is there something more you don't understand?
It's a way of life you're missing,
Where the word becomes a part of you,
Walking everyday with Jesus,
Finding out His promises are true.
Living life first hand,
Learning the truth
Straight from the Father.
Living life first hand,
There's no middle man
When you walk with the Lord
First hand.
It's all in your mind, the world will say,
But this is something
That they can't explain away;
Not just some fancy talking,
Or just some emotion that you feel,
It's a life of first hand walking,
Finding out His promises are real.",First Hand,1987
Steven Curtis Chapman,"Making promises came easy
Back when they first fell in love.
They talked of how they'd share the years together;
Said we'll work it out whatever comes.

I guess we never know just how it happens;
Vows forgotten that were once so true.
Holding on to broken dreams and promises,
It's time to act on what they said they would do.

[Chorus]
'Cause when it's all said and done,
It's got to be all or none;
Words are no good unless they're backed with actions.
It's easier said than done;

Talk of the race and never run,
But the prize belongs to those who've said and done.
Love is one of many pages
In a story only time will tell;

It's a book of all the words we're saying,
Read by those who see us do as well.

[Chorus]

When it's all said and done,
Have you done what you said.
When it's all said and done,
Have you done what you said you would do.

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Whatever happened to Johnny?
He was in church every time the doors were opened
He gave his time and his money
Why did he give up the fight?
He was a spiritual her

Whatever happened to Sharon?
She was the only one
You knew you could always turn to
How could she be so uncaring?
She turned her back on you
Who you going to turn to now?

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me who are you depending on
Tell me who do you believe
You lost your faith in so many people,
But is your faith in who it should be
There's only one who keeps all of his promises
He is the only solid ground
Let Jesus be the one you are trusting
To lift you up, cause he'll never let you down

Whatever happens he's faithful
Those who depend on him will never be disappointed,
So trust His Word and be thankful

Someone you can turn to now",Tell Me,1987
Steven Curtis Chapman,"Trapped in simple conversation,
Hard getting past those old familiar lines,
Guarded hearts and with good reason
Say how are you, oh I'm doin' just fine;
They've said all that they can say,
Then they turn and walk away,
And the wounded hearts must wait another day.

[Chorus:]
Who cares when they're crying;
Who cares when they're all alone,
And no one knows how much they long
To find someone
Who cares that they're dying,
Who cares that the road is long,
And you could be the one to lead them
To the One who cares.
Captured by the rush of living,
So hard to hear our brothers' quiet cries,
But freedom comes when we are willing
To open up our hearts and realize
They've said all that they can say;
We can't turn and walk away,
'Cause the wounded hearts might not wait another day.

The Father gave His Son
To show the world how much He cares,
And now it's up to us to let them know

[Chorus]",Who Cares,1987
Steven Curtis Chapman,"It's a brand new day and the sun is shining bright;
Looks like it's gonna be the very best day of my life.
So I jump out of bed into a world of opportunities;
I gotta get movin', no time to get down on my knees.
Then the telephone rings;
It's the voice of tragedy.
No I suddenly find
The time to get down on my knees.

[Chorus:]
I say, ""I love You"",
I always look to You when trouble calls my name;
But if I'm gonna say, ""I love You"",
I've gotta be faithful too .
The true test of my love will be
Did I follow you consistently,
Through the good and bad;
I want to be faithful too.
Talk is cheap;
Some words come a dozen for a dime.
But a real life conversation
Will take some precious time,
And if I give my all,
Lord that's the least that I can do,
Compared to all the faithfulness
I have found in You.
So if tragedy calls,
Or if everything goes my way,
I want to be found
Faithful to you every day.

[Chorus]",Faithful Too,1988
Steven Curtis Chapman,"""Too many hypocrites,"" I heard her say,
""I even saw it in the headlines today;
How can I follow God when His own people turn away.""
She said, ""Nobody's perfect but I just want to see
Somebody living what they say they believe;
If they've got all this world needs like they say,
I wonder why won't they give some away.""
[Chorus:]
Can he see God for who He really is
In what he sees in you and me.
Can he see God for who He really is,
For who He really is is all he really needs to see.
He slips into church and he puts up his guard;
They look so happy but his life's been so hard.
He keeps his distance so they won't see the scars;
It's just a religion that's all dressed up in white,
And God is love as long as you're living right.
But does he know that Jesus also has scars,
And His love can reach Him no matter how far.
[Chorus]
The skeptics are watching to see who will fall,
While those disillusioned search for the Truth in it all;
Maybe today we'll cross their paths unaware,
And they'll stop and look at us. What will be there?
[Chorus]",For Who He Really Is,1988
Steven Curtis Chapman,"Sometimes His eyes were gentle 
And filled with laughter, 
And sometimes they cried; 
Sometimes there was a fire 
Of holy anger, 
In Jesus eyes. 
But the eyes that saw hope in the hopeless, 
That saw through the fault to the need, 
Are the same eyes that look down from heaven 
Into the deepest part of you and me. 

[Chorus] 
His eyes are always upon us; 
His eyes never close in sleep. 
And no matter where you go, 
You will always be in His eyes, in His eyes. 

Sometimes His voice comes calling 
Like rolling thunder, 
Or like driving rain; 
And sometimes His voice is quiet, 
And we start to wonder 
If He knows our pain. 
But He who spoke peace to the water 
Cares more for our hearts than the waves, 
And the voice that once said ""you're forgiven"", 
Still says ""you're forgiven"" today. 
Sometimes I look above me when stars are shining 
And I feel so small; 
How could the God of heaven and all creation 
Know I'm here at all. 
But then in silence He whispers, 
""My child, I created you too 
And you're my most precious creation; 
I even gave my Son for you."" 

[Chorus] 
Sometimes His eyes were gentle, and filled with laughter.",His Eyes,1988
Steven Curtis Chapman,"In a world of winners and losers, 
Some are used, some are the users; 
It's a push and shove race 
Of trying to get ahead. 
In the dust of all the confusion 
We make a choice, Truth or illusion; 
Will we listen to lies, 
Or hear what the Father says. 
[CHORUS] 
We are running in a human race, 
Where nobody wants to settle for second place; 
But we've got to run it at a different pace, 
Cause the first will be last and the last will be first 
At the end of the human race. 
In a day when values are changing, 
What kind of ground are we really gaining; 
Who are we trying to serve by going the extra mile. 
We can't trade the Truth for the fashion; 
we've got to live a life of compassion, 
And those we touch are the prize 
That waits at the finish line.

Well, its my turn now,
Yes, it's my turn now,
My turn to give my life away.

I close the book and I shake my head,
Sometimes I can't believe the things I've read.
I don't deserve what He did for me,
He gave His love and His life away,
And now He's asking me to do the same,
So I'm gonna give Him all I am.,
And all I ever hope to be.

Cause it's my turn now,
Well, it's my turn now,
My turn to give my life away.

I open up the book and look again,
I read the stories of the faithful men
Who gave up all they had to follow Him.
He used the strong and He used the weak,
He even gave the timid words to speak.
He called whoever listened then,
And now His call goes out again.

And let your feelings tell you when it's right. 
What went wrong' She thought it was really love; 
Now she wonders why she just can't sleep at night. 
She knew the rules but they were too old fashioned; 
Was it worth the price she has to pay. 
(Chorus) 
It's either truth or consequences, there's no other way; 
Put truth aside, the other takes its place. 
Well, you can close your eyes but that won't make it go away; 
The truth or consequences must be faced. 
The headlines say our world's in a lot of pain, 
Hurt from all the selfishness and greed. 
What went wrong' Like sheep all have gone astray; 
We'll reap what we sow, don't be deceived. 
His truth's been given and it''s there before us, 
Written on the page and in our hearts.

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Just when I thought I was strong,
Another weak day comes along,
And all my righteousness goes wrong.
But I was doing so well;
My dreams to be a Godly man
Seem out of reach of my own hand,
But where I fall short, His grace still stands,
If I have faith like a child.

[Chorus:]
And if Monday's child is fair of face,
And Tuesday's child is full of grace,
Then you can call me Tuesday's child.
Like Wednesday's child, I'm full of woe,
And Thursday's child I've got far to go,
But you can call me Tuesday's child.
Sounds too easy some might say,
There's a bigger price to pay;
But when Jesus have His life away,
It was once and for all.
So with more of His grace filling me,
I more than ever want to be
Growing up in purity,
With the faith of a child.

Its just that I want it to be more. 

More than words, I want my prayer to be 
More than words, thoughts my heart alone can speak;
As you listen to me tell of all Your power and mercy,

As I open up this Book,
And read of all the love it took
For a holy God to care for man; 
Spirit, help me understand.

Who gave the gift of His Son to prove He loved us more than words.

As I consider quietly the wonder of all Your ability,

Where's the hope you once knew so well?

And He has plans for you that go way beyond the blue.
Like the wind carries an eagle,
Let His hand carry you now,
And show you scenes of His mighty strength.
As you rise high above all the riches that this world could give,
You will find the depth of His love,
And His grace that is lifting you up to live.

And seated us with Him in heavenly places,
So that He can show the riches of His grace

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Well, I've been watching us very close, 
And I guess the one thing that's been bothering me the most, 
Is when I see us playing by the same rules that the world is using. 
Well, I've been listening to the things that we say, 
And I, I hear us mention words like fortune and fame, 
And it makes me wonder if we're sure about the side we're choosing. 
That's why I'm asking you

Who makes the rules for me and you, 
When it's wrong or right is it black and white' 
Who makes the rules for me and you; 
It's our life at stake so we better know who makes the rules. 
When I see people just like you and me, 
Trying to live out the pictures they see on TV; 
Gotta have a new car, new clothes, new love when they get tired of trying. 
Well, I've been reading bout a different way, 
Talking bout dying to live and losing to gain; 
Seems like somebody's telling us the truth and somebody's lying. 
I want to know who.

Steven Curtis Chapman,"There's a teacher in a school room
Somewhere on the edge of town
Telling innocent little children what we used to be
They look and listen without a question
They see the pictures passed around
Making facts out of a theory and they all believe
As the lost lead the way
Another heart is led astray

These are the days when the blind lead the blind
And there's one narrow way out of here 
So pray that the light of the world will keep your eyes clear
Cause it's a dangerous place here where the blind lead the blind

There's a preacher in a nice church
Anchored in the heart of town
People flock to hear his eloquent delivery
He talks of Jesus how he can please us
But the cross cannot be found
Making theory out of facts until they're all deceived
And the lost lead the way

And none could explain
How some crazy fisherman agreed to go where Jesus went
With no thought to what they would gain
For Jesus had called them by name
And they answered

Because of the love He has shown
And because He has called us to go
We will answer

Not for a dream or a promise

Dream your dreams tomorrow because today

And looks for ways to make tomorrow better than today,

But old enough to feel the pain
Of living where no love can grow

Like a desert longs for rain

She's got a hunger deep inside
With every tear she cries
She wonders if there's

Or even notice her at all
Is anyone listening close enough

Cortez told his sailors this mission must not fail
On the eastern shore of Mexico they landed with great dreams
But the hardships of the new world make them restless and weak

Quietly they whispered, ""Let's sail back to the life we knew""
But the one who led them there was saying

""Burn the ships we're here to stay
There's no way we could go back
Now that we've come this far by faith
Burn the ships we've passed the point of no return
Our life is here so let the ships burn and burn""

In the spring of new beginnings a searching heart set sail
Looking for a new life and a love that would not fail
On the shores of grace and mercy we landed with great joy
But an enemy was waiting to steal, kill, and destroy

But the one who led us here is saying

Kind and good and full of faith
Self-controlled and gentle
Oh the heart of heaven beats this way

I pulled up to the stop sign and I saw him standing there
The cardboard sign he held said he was hungry
I looked the other way and waited for the light to change
As if to say, I'd help but I'm in such a hurry
These are the moments of truth
What would love have me do

Oh, heartbeat of heaven, I want you to be my own
Oh, heartbeat of heaven, I want my life to show
The kind of love that comes and goes
With the heartbeat of heaven

I know at times this heart of mine beats only for itself
Full of thoughts and dreams, plans and problems
But this heart beating here in me belongs to someone else
He bought it with His life to show His love
This is my prayer, Lord, today
Let this heart beat away

Oh, heartbeat of heaven, I want you to be my own
Oh, heartbeat of heaven, I want my life to show
The kind of love that comes and goes

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Well the day has just begun and I'm already running late
With too many irons in the fire and too much on my plate
I'd be pulling out my hair if I could just get one hand free
And I'd stop this world if I could find the key

CHORUS
What I see is telling me I'm going crazy, but
What is real says God's still on His throne
What I need is to remember one thing
That the Lord of the gentle breeze is Lord of the rough and tumble
And He is King of the Jungle Yes he is

People say this world's a jungle and sometimes I must admit
I'd be scared to death if I did not know who was king of it
But the truth is God created this whole world with His own hand
So everything is under His command

(Chorus)

K-I-N-G of the J-you-N-G-L-E
He is the king of creation
K-I-N-G of the J-you-N-G-L-E

He is the King of kings

Way up high where the peaceful waters flow
To quench my thirsty soul
Up on the mountain

My faith is strengthened by all that I see
You make it easy for me to believe up on the mountain
Oh, up on the mountain

I would love to live up on this mountain
And keep the pain of living life so far away
But I know I can't stay
Up on the mountain

My faith is strengthened by all that I see
You make it easy for me to believe up on the mountain
Oh, up on the mountain

I said I'd go, Lord, wherever You lead
For where You are is where I most want to be
And I can tell we're headed for the valley
My faith is strengthened by all that I've seen
So Lord help me remember what You've shown me
Up on the mountain

You bring me up here on this mountain
For me to rest and learn and grow
I see the truth up on the mountain 
And I carry it to the world far below
So as I go down to the valley
Knowing that You will go with me
This is my prayer, Lord
Help me to remember what You've shown me

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice
That heartsick look in your eyes
You hide it very well, but I've got the same disguise
I know from all you see around you
You feel worth a very small price
So plain and ordinary, but there's a pearl inside

And if you look in the mirror in the light of the truth
You'll see there's really nothing you could say or do
To make you worth more to the One who made you

CHORUS
Your are a treasure
Worth more than anything under the sun or the moon
God's greatest treasure
Is the treasure of you

The rich man treasures gold and silver
The wise man, his knowledge of truth
Some will hold to memories and some will cling to youth
But the one who carved out the oceans
And painted the stars in the sky
You are His prized creation, the apple of His eye
There's no one else in the world who could take your place
Just the thought of you brings a smile to His face
God loves you with amazing grace

(Chorus)

BRIDGE
So take a look in the mirror in the light of the truth
Oh, yes it's true
See there's nothing more you can say or do
God loves the way He created you

(Chorus)

From the T to the are to the E to the A to the S to the you to the are to the E
God made everything and everything He made
More than anything He treasures you and me
Check in in the mirror in the light of the truth
There is nothing you will ever say and nothing you will do
The will ever make God care more than He does for the treasure
God's treasure is you

Steven Curtis Chapman,"In a one bedroom apartment
On the humble side of town
There stands a little Christmas tree
It looks a lot like Charlie Brown's

And underneath there's one little gift for him
And one little gift for her

After six months on the new job
They're still barely getting by
So in the way of decorations
There's nothing there to catch your eye

But both of them would be the first to say
We're together, we're gonna have the merriest Christmas anyway

'Cause Christmas is all in the heart
That's where the feeling starts
And like a fire inside, it touches every part
Christmas is all in the heart

And even if no white snow falls
Well, that's all right because
The joy can still be found, wherever you are
Christmas is all, all in the heart

Two little blond haired boys with big dreams
Tried to sleep but sleep wouldn't come
And we'd be tearing into presents
Long before the break of dawn

With mom and dad and cameras making sure
We'd never forget that day, no, no, no

Now I'm the one who's taking pictures
In the middle of the night
Of my own little dreamers
That just can't wait until daylight

And in my sleepy eyes the spark still glows
Well, I guess there's just some things a kid never outgrows

'Cause Christmas is all in the heart
That's where the feeling starts
And like a fire inside, it touches every part
Christmas is all in the heart

And even if no white snow falls
Well, that's all right because
The joy can still be found, wherever you are
Christmas is all, all in the heart

No, it's not in the snow that may or may not fall
And it's not in the gifts around the tree
It's in the love Heaven gave, that night our Savior came
And that same love can still be found wherever you are

'Cause Christmas is all in the heart
And the joy can still be found, wherever you are
'Cause Christmas is all, all in the heart
It's all in the heart

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Her house was where the family gathered every Christmas eve
A feast was set on the table and gifts were placed beneath the tree
Everything was picture perfect, Grandpa would laugh and say
That woman spends the whole year getting ready for this day

One year the leaves began to fall and her health began to fade
We moved her to a place where they could watch her night and day
But she kept making plans for Christmas from her little room
She told everyone, I'll miss you but I'll be leaving soon

I'm going home for Christmas and I'm going home to stay
I'm going home for Christmas and nothing's gonna keep me away
I'll be with the ones I love to celebrate the Savior's birth
This gift will be worth more to me than anything on earth
I'm going home, home for Christmas

All the leaves outside have fallen to be covered by the snow
The family comes with food and gifts and Grandpa comes alone
There's a sadness in our silence as the Christmas story's read
And with tears, Grandpa reminds us of the words that Grandma said

I'm going home for Christmas and I'm going home to stay
I'm going home for Christmas and nothing's gonna keep me away
She'll be face to face with Jesus as we celebrate His birth
And this gift will be worth more to her than anything on earth
'Cause she'll be home

And as we sing 'Joy to the World' I can't help thinking
Of the joy that's in her eyes right now
And though our hearts still ache, we know that as we celebrate
She's singing with the herald angels and heaven's glowing on her face

And now she's home for Christmas and now she's home to stay
She's home for Christmas, and nothin' could've kept her away
She'll be face to face with Jesus, as we celebrate His birth
And this gift will be worth more to her than anything on earth

Oh what a gift of love;
An angel tells a virgin that
She's gonna have a son.
And though it's a precious promise,
She wonders how can this be;
What will the people say
And what if Joseph can't believe.
And her questions and her fears
Are met with an overwhelming joy
That God has chosen her.
Oh what a precious promise;
Mary waits as heaven comes to earth.

Oh what a precious promise,
Oh what a gift of love;
Joseph makes his choice to do
What few men would have done:
To take Mary as his bride,
When she's already carrying a child
That isn't his own.
Oh what a precious promise;
Mary and the child will have a home.

And shepherds stand on a hillside,
Their hearts racing with the news the angel told them;
A star's light fills up the dark sky,
As the night of precious promise is unfolding.

Oh what a precious promise,
Oh what a gift of love;
The waiting now is over and
The time has finally come.
For the God who made this world
To roll back the curtain
And unveil His passion for the heart of man.

Did all the things that babies do;
He rocked and He napped on His mother's lap,
And He wiggled and giggled and cooed.
There were the cheers when He took His first step,
And the tears when He got His first teeth;
Almost everything about this little baby
Seemed as natural as it could be.

But this baby made the angels sing,
And this baby made a new star shine in the sky.
This baby had come to change the world.
This baby was God's own son, this baby was like no other one.
This baby was God with us, this baby was Jesus.

And this baby grew into a young boy,
Who learned to read and write and wrestle with dad;
There was the climbin' of trees and the scrapin' of knees,
And all the fun that a boy's born to have.
He grew taller and some things started changing,
Like His complexion and the sound of His voice;
There was work to be done as a carpenter's son
And all the neighbors said He's such a fine boy.

But this boy made the angels sing,
And this boy made a new star shine in the sky.
This boy had come to change the world.
This boy was God's own son, this boy was like no other one.
This boy was God with us. This boy became a man,

And love made Him laugh and death made Him cry.
With the life that He lived and the death that He died,
He showed us heaven with His hands and His heart,
'Cause this man was God's own son.
This man was like no other one,
Holy and human right from the start.

The sun was beating down inside 
The walls of stone and razor wire
As we made our way across the prison yard
I felt my heart begin to race 
As we drew nearer to the place
Where they say that death 
Is waiting in the dark
The slamming doors of iron 
Echoed through the halls
Where despair holds life 
Within its cruel claws 

But then I met a man 
Whose face seemed so 
Strangely out of place
A blinding light of hope 
Was shining in his eyes
And with repentance in his voice 
He told me of his tragic choice
That led him to this place 
where he must pay the price

But then his voice grew strong 
As he began to tell
About the one he said 
Had rescued him from Hell, he said

I'm free, yeah, oh, 
I have been forgiven
God's love has taken off my chains, 
And given me these wings
And I am free, yeah, yeah

Had sentenced us to die

Footloose and fancy free

And find a longing deep inside of me, it said

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Another case of I wish I wouldn't have;
Another promise not to let Him down again.
Fighting battles in a war I thought was over;
The old man of sin died a long time ago,
But left behind a sinful nature deep within,
So if I want to win this fight,
There's a part of me that must die,
But I'm not gonna cry.

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm dying to live,
Live for Jesus.
Dying to give myself to Him,
And the life that He gives will be mine
If I am dying to live.
Dying to live,
Live for Jesus.
I want to give myself to Him;
Gonna give up - from now on I'm dying to live.
Giving up what I can't keep anyway,
To gain something that I know I'll never lose,
Trading in the temporary for the eternal,
And though it's settled, I'm reminded everyday;
To live or die to self - it's up to me to choose,
So if I want to win the fight there's a part of me
That must die.
Well I've said my goodbyes.

[Chorus]",Dying to Live,1996
Steven Curtis Chapman,"In the distance I can see the storm clouds coming my way,
And I need to find a shelter
Before it starts to rain,
So I turn and run to you Lord;
You're the only place to go,
Where unfailing love surrounds me
When I need it most.

[Chorus:]
You're my hiding place;
Safe in your embrace,
I'm protected from the storm that rages
When the waters rise,
And I run to hide;
Lord, in You I find my hiding place.
I'm not asking You to take away
My troubles, Lord,
'Cause it's through the stormy weather
I learn to trust You more.
So I thank You for Your promise;
I have come to know
Your unfailing love surrounds me
When I need it most.

While You may be found,

I see so many times He carried me through; 
And if there's one thing that I've learned in my life, 
My Redeemer is faithful and true. 
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

My Redeemer is faithful and true. 
Everything He has said He will do, 
And every morning His mercies are new. 
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Strolling past temptation avenue, 
You hear so many voices calling you; 
Maybe you'll step in and take a quick look around. 
Try to walk through it, 
And you're gonna fall down. 

[CHORUS ]
You've gotta run away, 
Turn around and run the other way; 
Don't even look in the direction 
of a thought you should not entertain. 
You've gotta run away, 
It's a prison that is calling your name; 
You just can't win if you play, 
So run away. 
There comes a time when you must stand and fight, 
When the darkness tries to overcome the light; 
But sin that is dressed up in the color of gray, 
Is only defeated 
When we run away. 

(chorus) 

Don't put yourself in that position 
Where sin can make it's proposition; 
And if you find that you have fallen, 
You gotta get up, get ready to run 
Next time sin comes calling, calling.

Looks like I'm gonna be late again; 
Why does the race I'm runnin' never seem to have an end. 
A day away from Sunday, 
Feels like I'm already losing ground - 
Funny sometimes how quickly my emotions get turned around; 
They're letting me down. 

[CHORUS] 
I gotta keep my eyes on Jesus 
Through the weak days; 
In a world where we really don't belong, 
I've discovered if I keep my eyes on Jesus 
Through the weak days, 
Then even on the weak days He'll make me strong. 
The spirit is so willing 
When the fellowship is so sweet; 
How soon all the good intentions 
Find the flesh is weak. 
But there's a power waiting, 
With no limits to times or space; 
All of our doubts and fears disappear without a trace 
When we look on His face.

And when we keep our eyes on Jesus, 
We'll gladly follow where He leads us.

And you know its time to step back over the line,

A sign that its time for a change;
And you're listening for thunder,

Night falls and the curtain goes down;
No ones around,
Its just you and the truth.
As you lie in wait
For a feeling to take you by storm,

Somewhere in the depths of your heart,
Where its empty and dark, there's a flicker of light,
And the Spirit calls,
But do you notice at all;
Are you . . .

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Jimmy and Mary were quite a pair back in their younger days
They met a married in six weeks time and
That was sixty years ago this May
Four kids made a house a home and a love for Jesus kept them strong
Now every morning at eight A.M. Jimmy takes a drive through town
He spends his days at Mary's side In a home for the old and broken down
With a cane in his lap and a Bible in his hand He reads her stories about the promised land
And with tears in their eyes they dream of a place Where everything changes in the light of Jesus' face and

CHORUS
That's paradise... Hey, that's paradise...
When the life breaks through and the old's made new And the joy will never die, that's paradise

In another corner of this world, met another man named Jim
Told me how twenty years of running from God Had finally gotten the best of him
He said all hope was gone and he wanted to die 'Cause what could God do with such a messed up guy
So we talked about Jesus, God's love and His plan And when Jim walked away he was a brand new man

(Chorus)

Now listen, Well I know the best remains to be seen In a place that's far beyond our wildest dreams
But until we see heaven we've got Jesus' world That He'll never leave us and each prayer will be heard



",That's Paradise,1997
Steven Curtis Chapman,"Sometimes His eyes are gentle
And filled with laughter,
And sometimes they cry,
Sometimes there is a fire
Of Holy anger,
In Jesus' eyes.
But the eyes that saw hope in the hopeless,
That saw through the fault to the need,
Are the same eyes that look down from Heaven
Into the deepest part of you and me.

[Chorus]
His eyes are always upon you,
His eyes never close in sleep.
And no matter where you go,
You will always be in His eyes, in His eyes.

Sometimes His voice comes calling
Like rolling thunder,
Or like driving rain,
And sometimes His voice is quiet,
And we start to wonder
If He knows our name.
But He who spoke peace to the water
Cares more for our hearts than the waves,
And the voice that once said ""You're forgiven"",
Still says ""You're forgiven"" today.

Sometimes I look above me when stars are shining
And I feel so small,
How could the God of heaven and all creation
Know I'm here at all.
But then in silence He whispers,
""My child, I created you too
And you're my most precious creation,
I even gave my Son for you.""

Suddenly living life meant so much more

What is it that makes my heart beat faster when I'm in your arms

How is it that your sweet smile can get me through the hardest mile

What is it about this dance the sweetness of our romance
That makes me feel this way

Reflections of what we were created for
Hints of the passion and freedom
Awaits on the other side of heaven's door

What is it that makes me sad any time you're feeling mad
What is it about this night the music and the candlelight

I'm here hiding in my bed
A song plays on my alarm clock
As I cover up my head
But somewhere in the distance
I remember yesterday
Singing ""Hallelujah""
Full of wonder, awe and grace
But now I'm just wondering
Why I don't feel anything
At all

This is a moment made for worshipping
Cause this is a moment I'm alive
And this is a moment I was made to sing
A song of living sacrifice
For every moment that I live and breathe
This is a moment made for worshipping

When I'm praying with my children
As they're running off to school
When I kiss my wife good morning
Just to say I still love you
When I'm feeling love and happy
When I'm feeling all alone
When I'm failing to remember
All the love that I've been shown
Every single beat of my heart
Is another new place to start
To know

This is a moment made for worshipping
Cause this is a moment I'm alive
And this is a moment I was made to sing
A song of living sacrifice
For every moment that I live and breathe
This is a moment made for worshipping

Every single beat of my heart
Is another new place to start
Right now

This is a moment made for worshipping
Cause this is a moment I'm alive
And this is a moment I was made to sing
A song of living sacrifice
For every moment that I live and breathe
This is a moment made for worshipping

To the setting the sun

In Indiana 1983
Living on pizza and too little sleep
Just me and my animal friends
Then in the distance I saw through the leaves
Creature of beauty like none I had even seen
The trouble started when you smiled at me
And our two worlds came crashing together
And true love slowly began

I am Tarzan, You are Jane
I am the night, and you are the day
We're like sunshine and rain
We're so different from each other
You are a woman, I am a man
You're the sea, and I am the land
And I would not be who I am
If I didn't have you

I know that somedays we both wonder how
We got together, we're still so different now
But I can't imagine my life without you
Cause all those things that make us so different
Are just what make us all that we are

I am Tarzan, You are Jane
I am the night, and you are the day
We're like sunshine and rain
We're so different from each other
You are a woman, I am a man
You are the sea, and I am the land
And I would not be who I am
If I didn't have you

We belong together

Steven Curtis Chapman,"I've watched the sunrise in your eyes
And I've seen the tears fall like the rain
You've seen me fight so brave and strong
You've held my hand when I'm afraid

We've watched the seasons come and go
We'll see them come and go again
But in winter's chill, or summer's breeze
One thing will not be changin'

We will dance
When the sun is shining
In the pouring rain
We'll spin and we'll sway
And we will dance
When the gentle breeze
Becomes a hurricane
The music will play
And I'll take your hand
And hold you close to me
And we will dance

Sometimes it's hard to hold you tight
Sometimes we feel so far apart
Sometimes we dance as one
And feel the beating of each others hearts

Some days the dance is slow and sweet
Some days we're bouncing off the walls
No matter how this world may turn
Our love will keep us from fallin'

And we will dance
When the sun is shining
In the pouring rain
We'll spin and we'll sway
And we will dance
When the gentle breeze
Becomes a hurricane
The music will play
And I'll take your hand
And hold you close to me
And we will dance

The music will play
And I'll hold you close
And I won't let you go
Even when our steps
Grow weak and slow
Still I'll take your hand
And hold you close to me
And we, will dance



",We Will Dance,2002
Steven Curtis Chapman,"(verse 1:)

Well, I still remember the first time
I felt the power of your kiss
It hit me like a bolt of lightning
I said, ""I never will recover from this""
And like the words from the mouth of a prophet
I have lived to see those words come true
Just look at me now, I'm still reeling

Chorus:

With every little kiss I'm reminded
How wonderful it is to be in love with you
With every little look
With every little touch
With every little kiss

(verse 2:)

Like a moth being drawn to a candle
This is something that I can't resist
I guess you could say I'm addicted
'Cause I keep coming back again and again
And after all of the storms that we've weathered
All the seasons of change we've been through
Somehow the flame keeps getting brighter
You give me just a little taste of heaven
Just one more good gift that God has given
I don't want to miss one single little kiss

Watching o'er your flocks by night,

Yonder shines the infant light

Come and worship, come and worship,
Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.

Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.

Sinners, wrung with true repentance,
Doomed for guilt to endless pains,
Justice now revokes the sentence,
Mercy calls you, break your chains

Come and worship, come and worship,
Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.
Come and worship, come and worship,
Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.

Though an Infant now we view Him,
He shall fill His Father's throne,
Gather all the nations to Him;
Every knee shall then bow down:

All creation, join in praising
God, the Father, Spirit, Son,
Evermore your voices raising
To th'eternal Three in One.

And one thing you're never gonna be worthy of
But there's a song being sung over you
By the One who breathes life into you

You are being loved, you are being loved
Right now at this very moment
You are being loved, you are being loved
Right now, you are being loved, loved, loved
You are being loved, loved, you are

You ought to see the smile you're bringing to your Father's face
You ought to hear Him sing his version of Amazing Grace
'Cause that's the song being sung over you
By the God who breathes life into you

You are being loved, you are being loved
Right now at this very moment
You are being loved, you are being loved
Right now, you are being loved, loved, loved
You are being loved, loved, you are

And with every breath that you're taking
And every beat of your heart
Even while this song is playing
Whatever you do, wherever you are
There's a song being sung over you

You are being loved, you are being loved
Right now at this very moment
You are being loved, you are being loved
Right now, you are being loved, loved, loved

Steven Curtis Chapman,"I walk the streets of London
And notice in the faces passing by
Something that makes me stop and listen
My heart grows heavy with the cry

Where is the hope for London?
You whisper and my heart begins to soar
As I'm reminded
Every street in London in Yours, oh yes, it is

I walk the dirt roads of Uganda
I see the scars that war has left behind
Hope like the sun is fading
They're waiting for a cure no one can find

And I hear children's voices singing
Of a God who heals and rescues and restores
And I'm reminded
That every child in Africa is Yours

And it's all Yours, God, Yours, God
Everything is Yours
From the stars in the sky
To the depths of the ocean floor

And it's all Yours, God, Yours, God
Everything is Yours
You're the Maker and Keeper
Father and Ruler of everything, it's all Yours

And I walk the sidewalks of Nashville
Like Singapore, Manila and Shanghai
I brush by the beggar's hand and the wealthy man
And everywhere I look I realize

That just like the streets of London
For every man and woman, boy and girl
All of creation

Steven Curtis Chapman,"It was the day the world went wrong
I screamed til my voice was gone
And watched through the tears as everything
Came crashing down
Slowly panic turns to pain
As we awake to what remains
And sift through the ashes that are left
Behind

But buried deep beneath
All our broken dreams
We have this hope

Out of these ashes, beauty will rise
And we will dance among the ruins
We will see Him with our own eyes
Out of these ashes, beauty will rise
For we know, joy is coming in the morning,
In the morning, beauty will rise

So take another breath for now,
And let the tears come washing down,
And if you can't believe I will believe
For you.

Cuz I have seen
The signs of spring!
Just watch and see:

Out of these ashes, beauty will rise
And we will dance among the ruins
We will see Him with our own eyes
Out of these ashes, beauty will rise
For we know, joy is coming in the morning,
In the morning,

I can hear it in the distance
And it's not too far away.
It's the music and the laughter
Of a wedding and a feast.
I can almost feel the hand of God
Reaching for my face
To wipe the tears away, and say,
""It's time to make everything new.""

""Make it all new""

This is our hope.
This is the promise.
This is our hope.
This is the promise.

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Heaven is the face of a little girl
With dark brown eyes
That disappear when she smiles.
Heaven is the place
Where she calls my name
Says, ""Daddy please come play with me for awhile.""

God, I know, it's all of this and so much more,
But God, You know, that this is what I'm aching for.
God, you know, I just can't see beyond the door.
So right now

Heaven is the sound of her breathing deep,
Lying on my chest, falling fast asleep while I sing.
And Heaven is the weight of her in my arms,
Being there to keep her safe from harm while she dreams

And God, I know, it's all of this and so much more,
But God, You know, that this is what I'm longing for
God, you know, I just can't see beyond the door.

But in my mind's eye I can see a place
Where Your glory fills every empty space.
All the cancer is gone,
Every mouth is fed,
And there's no one left in the orphans' bed.
Every lonely heart finds their one true love,
And there's no more goodbye,
And no more not enough,
And there's no more enemy (no more).

Heaven is a sweet, maple syrup kiss
And a thousand other little things I miss with her gone.
Heaven is the place where she takes my hand
And leads me to You,
And we both run into Your arms.

Oh God, I know, it's so much more than I can dream.
It's far beyond anything I can conceive.

Somehow you lost the thrill and thrills are what you need,
To let you know where you're gonna go.
You struggle on trying to earn what He's given you.
You struggle on; He died to give it, what more can you do.

So consider it, consider it done;
The prize you're fighting for is already won.
So consider it, consider it done;
You'll find His work's just begun
When you consider it done.

God helps the ones who help themselves, some people say,
But are we helping out or getting in His way.
He wants our best and Hell do the rest;
It's by His grace we're saved,
Not by the things we do,
So we've got to serve Him with a thankful attitude
And let Him know where He leads we'll go.
From this day on our hope's in Jesus and His work's complete.
From this day on, He makes His experience our history.

Steven Curtis Chapman,"The long awaited rains
Have fallen hard upon the thirsty ground
And carved their way to where
The wild and rushing river can be found
And like the rains
I have been carried here to where the river flows

My heart is racing and my knees are weak
As I walk to the edge
I know there is no turning back
Once my feet have left the ledge
And in the rush I hear a voice
That's telling me it's time to take the leap of faith
So here I go

I'm diving in, I'm going deep, in over my head I want to be
Caught in the rush, tossed in the flow, in over my head I want to go
The river's deep, the river's wide, the river's water is alive
So sink or swim, I'm diving in (I'm diving in)

There is a supernatural power
In this mighty river's flow
It can bring the dead to life
And it can fill an empty soul
And give a heart the only thing
Worth living and worth dying for

But we will never know the awesome power
Of the grace of God
Until we let ourselves get swept away
Into this holy flood
So if you'll take my hand
We'll close our eyes and count to three
And take the leap of faith
Come on let's go

Don’t try to figure it out
Just listen to what i’m whispering to your heart
‘Cause I know this is not
Anything like you thought
The story of your life was gonna be
And it feels like the end has started closing in on you
But it’s just not true
There’s so much of the story that’s still yet to unfold

And this is going to be a glorious unfolding
Just you wait and see and you will be amazed
You’ve just got to believe the story is so far from over
So hold on to every promise god has made to us
And watch this glorious unfolding

God’s plan from the start
For this world and your heart
Has been to show His glory and His grace
Forever revealing the depth and the beauty of
His unfailing love
And the story has only begun

And this is going to be a glorious unfolding
Just you wait and see and you will be amazed
We’ve just got to believe the story is so far from over
So hold on to every promise god has made to us
And watch this glorious unfolding

We were made to run through fields of forever
Singing songs to our savior and king
So let us remember this life we’re living
Is just the beginning of the beginning

Of this glorious unfolding
We will watch and see and we will be amazed
If we just keep on believing the story is so far from over
And hold on to every promise god has made to us
We’ll see the glorious unfolding

Just watch and see (unfolding)
This is just the beginning of the beginning (unfolding)",Glorious Unfolding,2013
Steven Curtis Chapman,"There’s a little boy looking at me in the mirror
He’s asking where the time has gone
Was it here just long enough to draw these lines on my face?
Well I’m not sure I’m much wiser
But some things are clearer
And it’s getting clear that I’m not here for long
So what am I to do with my few minutes here in this place?
And we hear the world sigh with its aches and its pains
We see the grass wither and watch flowers fade

But oh, there’s a day that is coming
When everything will be new
And oh, God will dry every tear
And everything sad will be made untrue
And oh, it’s gonna be a celebration
All of creation longs for
And while we’re waiting for that day to come
We’ve got a little more time to love

There are little ones hungry for love of a family
So many hungry for bread
On the left and the right surrounded by the last and the least
And just down the street and just across the table
Hungry hearts are waiting to be fed
‘Cause deep in our soul we’re all longing to be at The Feast
But until we sit down where there’s more than enough
Let us give as we’ve been given and love as we’ve been loved

There’s a day that is coming
When all the last will be first
Every orphan will be home
And all will be filled who hunger and thirst
It’s gonna be a celebration
All of creation longs for
And while we’re waiting for that day to come
We’ve got a little more time

To do justly and love mercy
And show the love we’ve been shown
For we can only be the hands and feet of Jesus ‘til 
He leads us home
He will lead us home

There’s a day that is coming
A day that never will end
There in the light of His glory
Everything broken will be whole again
And this will be the celebration
All of creation longs for

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

Everything is cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughin' at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane

Runaway train burnin' in my veins

Steven Drozd," As you walked away
A strand of hair came undone
And was reflected in the sun
And everything was orange

As you disappeared
The shadow of death came undone
And was reflected in the sun
And everything was orange

They have begun to celebrate
The tidal wave they think is great
The ever-beating heart that it wasn't

They have begun
They have begun
They have begun
To assassinate the sun

As you died in the night
A million stars formed into one
And became another sun
And everything was orange

And now this horrible machine
Churns out pain instead of love
And looks just like the sun
And everything was orange

They have begun
To assassinate the sun

Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

Steven Halpern,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.

But he just can't see.

But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""

But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

Steven Kowalczyk,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1995

The harder they come, the harder they fall.
The quicker they come, the quicker they crawl.
Dead Celeb's coming back with this brand new track.
Here's another taste from our swinging battle axe.

You wanna be a star, here's a gimmick and a style,
To mimmick and free clothes to help design your image.
I feel like the only way I'll see fame and wealth,
Is to kill myself the same week my record hits the shelf.
All you really need is a record label budget,
Then watch the machine force feed it to the public.
Hate it or love it, watch it or unplug it.
Careers disappear quicker than next week's club hit.
You're just a puppet on a string I'm your master.
You're not cut out to sing, you might as well be an actor.
Or write a chapter how sex sells music,
Nobody likes your songs, they watch your videos muted.
Mixed and diluted, polluted trashed will crash.
This prostitute music selling songs with ass,
I gasp for breath, Dead Celeb pass the test.
Music for a living? I can't ask for less.

Fuck mass appeal and fuck keeping it real,
I feel I need to date Tommy Matola for a record deal.
What would you do for that big contract?
Change your face like Michael, be on American Idol?
Act homicidal and eat your own intestines.
I thought we were musicians not Fear Factor contestants.
Overnight stars want credit? Forget it.
Yeah, you went platinum, but who bought your record?
Extra philosophy, behind a music prodigy.
The next best thing since The Motley Crue Biography.
It's like Gods become a shark in deep water.
You swim up to the mainstream, then you bite the author.
You could be a star, too, if you're near edges.
Fuck the opinions of these haters and critics.
They can be so cynic, quick to call you a gimmick.
You can't tarnish my image, you can't write it, I live it.

Dear, come there with me.
I'm longing to teach you
Love's sweet melody.

I'll sing a dream-song to you,
Painting a picture for two:

Blue heaven and you and I,
And sand kissing a moonlit sky.
A desert breeze whisp'ring a lullaby,
Only stars above you
To see I love you.

Oh, give me that night divine
And let my arms in yours entwine.

Its voice enthralling
Will make you mine.

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

North or south way down tune in next week

Heart beating like a big bass drum

And good old boys driving big machines
And you can kiss my ass, can’t help but say
It’s good to be “born in the USA”

Steven Wilson,"(Hello, mirror, so glad to see you, my friend, it's been a while)

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.
The truth is the truth.
That's all you can do is live with it.",Repentance,2007

Searching empty places
I miss your warm embrace

And this I will swear to you
That I will be loving you forever
And I know you have to go on your own
To find your way back home

To turn back the hands of tie
I would cherish

Lots of friends and children
Layin' in the grass
Hookah makes me crazy
Believe I'm goin' have to pass

Think I'll go down

Go on down the road
See what's goin' on
Down the road

Then you find your cocaine
Start to movin' fast
Trip, stumble, fall, freeze up
Hope your body last

Think I'll go down
Mama
Go on down the road
See what's goin' on
Down the road

Drinkin' plenty good liquor
Bourbon twelve years old
Hero wine, just in time
Worst trip that I know

Think I'll go down
Mama
Take a pass
Go on down the road
See what's goin' on

Some people into Jesus
Other people into Zen
I'm just into every day
I don't hide from where I been

I just go down

Go on down the road
See what's goin' on

Each moment that you've been gone away, 
I only dream of you, 
I wish on a star and every night I pray, 
Don't go, girl don't walk away, 
I'm half of the man without you, sad and blue, 
Don't go away, 
'Cause my heart is true, 
Don't go please stay, 
'Cause I'm still in love with you.
I know I'm the one to blame, 
For falling in love with an angel, 
In my heart I found out 
You were my everything, 
Now my everything is gone, 
Can someone tell me how to carry on
Don't go, girl don't walk away, 
I'm half of the man without you, sad and blue, 
Don't go away, 
'Cause my heart is true, 
Don't go please stay, 
'Cause I'm still in love with you.
I'd climb all the mountains, 
Cross the widest rivers 
That's what I'd do, 'cause my love is true.
Don't go, girl don't walk away, 
I'm half of the man without you, sad and blue, 
'Cause I'm still in love with you.",Don't Go,1999
Stevie B,"A woman on the radio talked about revolution
when it's already passed her by
Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about 
you know it feels good to be alive

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this

Right here, right now
there is no other place I want to be
Right here, right now
watching the world wake up from history

I saw the decade in, when it seemed 
the world could change at the blink of an eye
And if anything
then there's your sign of the times

I was alive and I waited, waited

Stevie Blacke,"This fear has me chilled down to the bone
And I have been haunted by these things I still have left to say
I'm weary of fighting this alone
So tired of holding on to strings much better left to fray

And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down
And this seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth

I'm wilted and faded after all
Too strung out and burnt out to be half the man that I could be
I'll never belong inside your world
So black out the sun and leave me to play out the same old tragedy

And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out
And this seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth

Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out
And this seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth

You're my savior after all
Use your flame to guide me home
And then lay your hand on me

And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling

This opportunity's mine
I'm sick of complaining
About a beautiful life

How did we get here?
Did we forget all the things inside?
And how do we stay here?
Do we embrace all the things denied?

I feel so alive tonight
You got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over, and we're older

For my entertainment
You tell a whimsical lie
To keep me complacent
You knock me down with a smile

How did we get here?
How do we pretend everything's alright?
And how do we stay here?
Do we erase all the fear inside?

I feel so alive tonight
You got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over, and we're older

Like sugar and cyanide
These worlds are gonna collide
I want to yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over, and we're older

So take me, but go slow
Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this seed grow
Until we finally call this home
So take me, but go slow
Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this seed grow
Until we finally call this home

If I was to die tonight
Would it tear you apart?
Would you yell it from the rooftops down?
Until it's over, and you're older

I feel so alive tonight
You've got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftops down

Learned a lot about life

Never believed about love at first sight

I got you so I know I didn't lose

See I was think bout what I like
Cause when it clicks right before my eyes
We could be together for the rest of our lives
Turn a magic time to an endless night
Love won't ever let us be alone again
Cause love came down heaven sent
To let you slip on by just wouldn't be right
Couldn't let you go even if I tried

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

(it's been) one year two months
But it just dun seem like yesterday (we were) we were still together
Time has passed and things have changed so
Why do I feel this way
'cause you're with somebody else
And I'm with somebody else but

Whenever I think about the love we had
It hurts so bad
Whenever I think about the love we made
I said that I'd be strong
Girl I really thought that I'd move on
But still I find myself asking

Do you still think of me like I think about you
Do you still dream of me 'cause I can't sleep without you
Tell me if time should make a change
Then why do I feel the same
Your love has got me addicted
Said I don't know
When I'm with a chick and hittin it girl I call your name
Said I don't know
When I be with somebody else I push them away
Tell me if time should make a change
Then why do I feel the same
I know I gotta move on but I'm so addicted to you

It's been long enough don't know why I'm still holding on
If I had a wish babe I would turn back the hands of time
'cause you don't know what you got until it's gone (till it's gone)
It's the reason why I'm writing you this song
Girl I'm slippin and I don't know what to do
Girl I admit it, I'm sick over you
Damn I realised my mistake, my pride got in the way
I should have begged you to stay

Do you still think of me like I think about you
Do you still dream of me 'cause I can't sleep without you
Tell me if time should make a change
Then why do I feel the same
Your love has got me addicted
Said I don't know
When I'm with a chick and hittin it girl I call your name
Said I don't know
When I be with somebody else I push them away
Tell me if time should make a change
Then why do I feel the same
I know I gotta move on but I'm so addicted to you

If you ever lost someone you truly love
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah, let me hear you say
And if you lost someone you truly need
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)

Do you still think of me like I think about you
Do you still dream of me 'cause I can't sleep without you
Tell me if time should make a change
Then why do I feel the same
Your love has got me addicted
Said I don't know
When I'm with a chick and hittin it girl I call your name

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love

All the music of life seems to be

""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004

And you will be pleased to know 
That Sunny Skies hasn't a friend

I guess he just has to cry from time to time

Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
I be on some rich nigga shit when I step out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
I be on some fly, rich nigga shit, steppin’ out
I be on that fly, rich nigga shit, steppin’ out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about

Quarter-mill for the car, quarter-mill on the arm
Black Double-R, back the fuck off
Drophead, cut your head off, hard top, no soft
Wet pussy turn me on, money keep me hard
King shit, Versace towels, I ain’t dryin’ off
Marble floors, you dusty niggas couldn’t walk on
Jesus walked on water, so I’mma walk on charters
Private jets, baguettes, only fuck with ballers
All this, half a mill, first week of August
I ain’t even doin’ shows, I’m just workin’ on the album
Forty for the feature, I just payed my mama’s Visa
You in the club breathin’, that Ten X, you niggas Beavis
She give me butt, head – get brain like a genius
I got that dope shit, the 80s chrome Alpinas
White Beamer – my son gon’ inherit this flow
You niggas gumball drops on the bottom of my sole

[Chorus]
I be on some fly nigga shit when I step out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
I be on some rich nigga shit when I step out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
I be on some fly, rich nigga shit, steppin’ out
I be on that fly, rich nigga shit, steppin’ out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about

Young nigga, we Rich Gang
Came up from that rich game
Picture me rollin’ down Biscayne
Black Double-R with your bitch, mane
With that top off and that drop head
Pull up on ‘em, they drop dead
Niggas talkin’ that bird shit
When them birds came, they was not dead
And I was out there with that work
From the 15th to the 1st
My clique mean and they merk
We’ll let them clips squeeze like dirt
When it come to them dollars, nigga, why bother?
These niggas don’t want no problems
‘Cause I’ll kill all y’all dead, put a price on your head
Get your brain, I doubt it
I be on that fly shit – M-O-B that mob shit
Boy, I’m talkin’ G5 shit
Fifty racks for that ride, shit
That ain’t yours, that’s my bitch
You clocked out and I signed in
We young niggas, we grindin’
We shinin’ like diamonds

[Chorus]
I be on some fly nigga shit when I step out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
I be on some rich nigga shit when I step out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
I be on some fly, rich nigga shit, steppin’ out
I be on that fly, rich nigga shit, steppin’ out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about

Make them pop ten bottles like, ""give me ten more""
I’m in the club passin’ weed to the bitches, like “hit this shit”
Your stupid ass outside talkin’ ‘bout “get me in!”
Should’ve known I was a fool, when I moved
When I pulled up in that Bentley
Told y’all I was gangster, still somethin’ like a pimp
Don’t say I didn’t – million-dollar flow
Got a lot of dough, brand new clothes
VIP for niggas like me
Wish a motherfucker would touch that rope
Rappers, hustlers, dealers, killers
Thugs, goons, beasts, guerillas
Money, cars, jewels, chinchillas
Jets, cribs, condos, villas
Say that, then
Goddamn right, bitch I’ve been fly since way back when
That’s right, I am YMCM, Grave Street, play that, there
Burnin’ up the track like a motherfuckin’ matchstick,
You know that’s him
Tryna shine when you come around stars like us
They do look dim
Ain’t got your game tight, ain’t got your swag up
Shame on them
Your legs too little and your T-Shirt big
Nigga, go to the gym
For the love of my clique, we up in this bitch
So sorry that your girl’s suckin’ my dick
Throwin’ money in the air like I’m sick of this shit

[Chorus]
I be on some fly nigga shit when I step out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
I be on some rich nigga shit when I step out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about
I be on some fly, rich nigga shit, steppin’ out
I be on that fly, rich nigga shit, steppin’ out
Fuck what y’all talkin’ about

We be on our fly shit
You see us right
Fly shit
Swag or die and we high
Haha Rich Gang

Stevie Mulhearn,"On the sunset, horses silhouette 
All is calm tonight 
New horizon, keep your eyes on those stars 
Lighting a way 

Take me somewhere out there 
Through the fields, in the night 
All the dark horses ride 
No more reining in 
Now my aim is in sight 
To the wild and the light 

Out of harm's way, where the traps all lay 
Tying you down, selling you out 
Beating you down - they're all over town 
Know your true self, or your truth might bend 
They will turf you out in the end 
Don't heed a word they say 
Keep heading away 

Faraway, slow in motion 
Through the fields, in the night 
All the dark horses ride 
No more reining in 
Now my aim is in sight 
To the wild and the light 

Long-lost summer days 
Are shining around again, 
Sky ablaze, ride away...",All the Dark Horses [Live][*],2009
Stevie Mulhearn,"I discover the wheel and watch the buildings go by 
You talk a little soft, turn off the radio 
I just want to hear all the past times 
The rushed hours, the endless lives 
Don't become a burden 
Say the word and be free 

You will find a great weight lifting 
Easing your mind, a great weight lifting 
Just leave it behind, a great weight lifting 
And you will find a great weight lifting 

It's been a lonely winter hibernating away 
You need a little sunlight on that face 
How long can you stay in the darkness? 
Dust round the empty nest? 
You could make you way out 
If you lay down the load 

You will find a great weight lifting 
Easing your mind, a great weight lifting 
Leave it behind, a great weight lifting 
You will find a great weight lifting 
Just leave it behind, a great weight lifting 
And you will find a great weight lifting",Weightlifting [Live][*],2009
Stevie Nicks,"Hello, it's me
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
There's something here that doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine
 
Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me

Think of me
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me

Think of me
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should",Hello It's Me,1978
