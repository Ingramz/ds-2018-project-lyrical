Dinah Shore,"Here he comes lookin' for his baby
It's for sure, sure and not for maybe
Don't ask when will the lucky day be
Here he comes and let him tell you himself:

If I seem to scintillate
It's because I've got a date
A date with a package of
The good things that come with love
You don't have to ask me
I won't waste your time
But if you should ask me
Why I feel sublime
I'm

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight

Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood

There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes and on my nails
(alternate line: In my top hat and my white tie and my tails)

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight",Steppin' Out With My Baby,1998
Dinah Shore,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart",When I Grow Too Old to Dream,1998
Dinah Shore,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way,1998
Dinah Shore,"Most people live on a lonely island
Lost in the middle of a foggy sea
Most people long for another island
One where they know they will like to be

Bali Ha'i may call you
Any night, any day
In your heart, you'll hear it call you
""Come away, come away""

Bali Ha'i will whisper
In the wind of the sea
""Here am I, your special island!
Come to me, come to me""

Your own special hopes,
Your own special dreams,
Bloom on the hillside
And shine in the streams

If you try, you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
""Here am I, your special island
Come to me, come to me""

Bali Ha'i,
Bali Ha'i,
Bali Ha'i!

Someday you'll see me floatin' in the sunshine
My head stickin' out from a low-flyin' cloud
You'll hear me call you,
Singin' through the sunshine
Sweet and clear as can be
""Come to me, here am I, come to me""

If you try, you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
""Here am I, your special island
Come to me, Come to me""

Dinah Shore,"Hear that whistle, there goes that bell,
That means we're on our way.
All aboard boy, I'm feelin' swell,
This is my happy day.
Paddle wheel, you're mighty mighty slow,
That's why I keep on shoutin', ""Let her go!"".

Roll on you Mississippi, roll on, (scat)
Hang on you lazy steamer, quit your stallin' and move along!
Clear the river, here we come,
Watch her smoke boy!
Hear that engine hummin', lawdy!
Take a look at that shore
With the folks I adore.
There's a spot around that bend,
That's my home, my journey's end.

Come on you old man river, come on,
Roll on you Mississippi, roll!
New Orleans, hello!
Bye-bye New Orleans!
Get along,
Goin' strong,
Baton Rouge,
Hold on!
Say cap'n, tell me,
What's the next big town we'll see?
I'm so excited I'm as happy as can be!

Dinah Shore,"Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you",When I Fall in Love,1998
Dinah Shore,"Don't mind telling you in my humble fashion
That you thrill me through with a tender passion
When you said you care, imagine my emotion
I swore then and there, permanent devotion

You made all other men seem blah
Just you alone filled me with, ahh
'S wonderful, 's marvelous
You should care for me

'S awful nice, 's paradise
'S what I love to see
You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous

Oh, 's wonderful, 's marvelous
That you should care for me!
'S magnificque, 's what I seek
You should care for me

'S elegant, 's what I want
'S what I love to see

Dinah Shore,"I'm as corny as Kansas in August,
I'm as normal as blueberry pie.
No more a smart little girl with no heart,
I have found me a wonderful guy!
I am in a conventional dither,
With a conventional star in my eye.
And you will note there's a lump in my throat
When I speak of that wonderful guy!
I'm as trite and as gay as a daisy in May,
A cliche coming true!
I'm bromidic and bright as a moon happy night
Pouring light on the dew!
I'm as corny as Kansas in August,
High as a flag on the Fourth of July!

I'm in love with a wonderful guy!",A Wonderful Guy,1998
Dinah Shore,"You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child . . . 
When you were only startin' 
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 
 
An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
You must have shown the other kids how . . . 
I can see the judge's eyes as they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow! 
 
Oh!, You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now . . . 

Does your dad appreciate 
That you are merely great? 
Does your mother realize 
You're such a treat for the eyes? 
 
You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child . . . 
When you were only startin' 
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 
 
An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
You must have shown the other kids how . . .

Dinah Shore,"Every kiss
Every hug
Seems to act
Just like a drug
You're getting to be
A habit with me

Let me stay
In your arms
I'm addicted
To your charms
You're getting to be
A habit with me

I used
To think your love
Was something
I could take
Or leave alone
But now I couldn't do
Without my supply
I need you for my own

Oh
I can't break away
I must
Have you everyday
As regularly
As coffee or tea
You've got me
In your clutches
And I cant break free
You're getting to be
A habit with me",You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me,1998
Dinah Shore,"Day in, day out
The same old hoodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And, darling, I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips
And the pounding becomes
The ocean's roar
A thousand drums
Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out",Day in Day Out,1998
Dinah Shore,"I wish that we could live up in the sky
Where we would find a place away up high
We'd live among the stars, the sun , the moon
Just you and I.

East of the sun and west of the moon,
We'll build a dream house of love, dear.
Near to the sun in the day,
Near to the moon at night,
We'll live in a lovely way, dear,
Living on love and pale moonlight.
Just you and I,
Forever and a day;
Love will not die,
We'll keep it that way,
Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life to a lovely tune,
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear,
East of the sun and west of the moon.",East of the Sun (And West of the Moon),1998
Dinah Shore,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.",I Hadn't Anyone Till You,1998
Dinah Shore,"Your sweet expression
The smile you gave me
The way you looked when we met.
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget.
I hear you whisper
""I'll always love you.""
I know it's over, and yet,
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget.
So I must dream
To have your hand caress me,
Fingers press me tight.
I'd rather dream
Than have that lonely feeling
Stealing through the night.
Each little moment
Is clear before me
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget.",It's Easy to Remember,1998
Dinah Shore,"Better luck next time?
That could never be,
Because there ain't gonna be no next time for me,
No sirree!
Made up my mind to make another start,
I've made my mind up but I can't make up my heart.

I'd like a new lucky day, that would be nice,
But this comes just once in a lifetime, not twice,
So don't say, ""Better luck next time"", that could never be,
Because there ain't gonna be no next time for me.

Dinah Shore,"The beggar man and his mighty king are only different in name,
For they are treated just the same by fate.
Today a smile and tomorrow tears,
We're never sure what's in store,
So learn your lesson before too late, so

Be like I, hold your head up high,
Till you find a bluebird of happiness.
You will find greater peace of mind
Knowing there's a bluebird of happiness.
And when he sings to you,
Though you're deep in blue,
You will see a ray of light creep through,
And so remember this, life is no abyss,
Somewhere there's a bluebird of happiness.

Life is sweet, tender and complete
When you find the bluebird of happiness.
You will find perfect peace of mind
When you find the bluebird of happiness.
Two hearts that beat as one,
'Neath a new found sun,
We are in a world that's just begun,
And you must sing his song, as you go along,
When you find the bluebird of happiness.",Bluebird of Happiness,1999

With a friendly kiss
And though I'm not the surest kind

Dinah Shore,"(Fascination turned to love)

It was fascination, I know
And it might have ended right there at the start
Just a passing glance, just a brief romance
And I might have gone on my way empty-hearted

Seeing you alone with the moonlight above
Then I touched your hand and next moment I kissed you

A sleepy lagoon and two hearts in tune in some lullaby land

And slowly grows dimmer
The leaves from the trees all dance in the breeze

Of roses and dew

We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies
Except for the few that were there in your eyes 

Dear, as I held you close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low 
""Darling, I love you so"" 

The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn 
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

Their watch of wondering love.

And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!

The blessings of his heaven.

But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.

The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,2001

One lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own
To see with.

My every kiss with theirs?

I'm faithful to you

And I am a fool

But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning.

Lay your head on my pillow.
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
Hear the whisper of the raindrops,
Blowin' soft against the window,
And make believe you love me one more time,
For the good times.

I'll get along; you'll find another,
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me.
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever,
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me.

we went so high we couldn't stop
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere

We spun so fast we couldn't tell 
the gold ring from the carousel 
How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had

the once upon a time 
the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday

Flowing through me to my son and daughters

Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues,2006

Dinah Shore and The Modernaires,"Get your veil and get your duster
Get the yen for goggles when the wind's a guster
Keep your Hubbard gown
Firmly belted down
When you're out in your Stanley Steamer
In a gale we never fluster
`Cause we're told we get that old familiar lustre
If you're dressed in style
Ev'ryone will smile
When you're out in your Stanley Steamer
Honk, honk!
Honk, honk, honk!
The donkey used to have his charm
But he's looking at us with alarm
For it looks like he's back to the farm
But if you fail with your combustor
Then your speed is gonna need a new adjuster
And you must be just
Just the one we trust
Or we won't step inside
No, we won't take the ride
That you plan in your Stanley Steamer
That you plan in your Stanley Steamer
In your Stanley Steamer automobile.

Chug, chug, chug, chug,
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
That flat tyre was so unexpected
There she sat alone and rejected
I started to sigh
Then I caught the eye
Of the man in the Stanley Steamer
It began to rain
When along the lane
Came the man in the Stanley Steamer
He was a sight to make me tingle
And a dish to make me glad that I was single
He proposed a ride
So I hopped inside
And away we started in the Stanley Steamer
It was not that she was stupid
Nor the shot she thought she got from Mr Cupid
I just lost my heart
From the very start
To the man in the Stanley Steamer
Honk, honk!
Honk, honk, honk!
The tandem bike has had its day
If you're ridin' one you'll find that they
Poke along in an obsolete way
With all the bright anticipation
Like a child with a wild imagination
And we wanna ride, wanna ride inside
Of the latest motor deal
Wanna sit behind the wheel
With the man in the Stanley Steamer
With the man in the Stanley Steamer
I'm a-nothin' but a dreamer
In your Stanley Steamer

Dinah Shore With Andre Previn,"Why do I do just as you say?
Why must I just give you your way?
Why do I sigh?
Why do I try to forget?

It must have been that something lovers call ""Fate""
Kept on saying I had to wait
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall till we met

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still

A distant moanin' of a train seems to play a sad refrain to the night

I feel like it's rainin' all over the world
How many times I wondered

Late at night when it's hard to rest I hold your picture to my chest and I feel fine

But it's a rainy night in Georgia, baby, it's a rainy night in Georgia I
feel it's rainin' all over the world, kinda lonely now And it's rainin' all over the

Enough trouble to make a poor woman
Wonder where she's gonna go

They rowed a little boat
About five miles across the farm
Said they rowed a little boat
About five miles across the farm
I packed up all of my clothes, trowed them in
And they rowed me along

Where it thundered and lightnin'
And the wind began to blow
Said it thundered and lightnin'
And the wind began to blow
There was thousands of people
They had no place to go

I went out and stood up
On a high old lonesome hill
I went out and stood up
On a high old lonesome hill
I looked down on the house
Where I used to live

Back water blues that calls me
To pack my things and go

Cause when our friends begin that
Heartless rumor,
I know I'll really need my
Sense of humor.

That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream

The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you`re older

The writing`s on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it`s final inning,
Don`t know what happened
It`s all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you`ve been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you`re on to -
But fools will be fools and where`s he gone to?

It`s lonelier and tougher.

There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away . . .

Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

This heart of mine was doing very well.
The world was fine as far as I could tell.
And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

This heart of mine is gayly dancing now.
I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

I've an elegant legacy waiting for ye
'Tis a rhyme for your lips and a song for your heart
To sing whenever the world falls apart

Follow it over the hill and stream
Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow who follows a dream
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow
Follow the fellow who follows a dream

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child
Oh, the lure of that song kept her feet running wild
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free
To the east with the lark, To the west with the sea
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes",Look to the Rainbow,1991

But if you wanna make me happy

And that happy tune is your step

He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

He says, ""Now, Judge, suppose I fail?""

Dinah Washington,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress my world was overturned
At the very start, all my bridges burned
By my flaming heart you'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

Dinah Washington,"Perdido, I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero: 'Let's meet for a sweet fietsa'
High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero
High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido, that yearning telude
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
The day the fiesta started
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
That's when my heart departed
It's perdido

Dinah Washington,"Somewhere along the line
You met this heart of mine
Would you unwind it?
Now you would shun it over a glass of wine

Friends knew it all the time
That no wedding bells would chime
I was just a young dreamer, no match for a schemer
Yours was a lover's crime

Folks gossiped--they said it was too good to be true
They even bet you'd search for someone new
This pendent world of ours was paradise
And I was blind by the star dust in my eyes

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.

That I get a kick out of you?

Some, they may go for cocaine.
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too.
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me.
I get a kick though it's clear to see

Dinah Washington,"Oh! They say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'Til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues/I Don't Hurt Any More,1992

Sailed the sea without a compass
Well, when his men began a rumpus
Up spoke Christopher Columbus

He said, ""There is land somewhere
So until we get there we will not go wrong
If we sing a swing song
Since the world is round we'll be safe and sound
'Till our goal is found we'll just keep the rhythm bound""

Then came a yell, let's drink to Isabella
Bring on the rum
A music in that all the rumpus

He would spend it on the girls

Such a sweet, sweet guy was he

Yes, her tears flowed like wine
She's a real sad tomato
She's a busted valentine
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind

How he loved the old race horses
He would bet them every day
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay
He indulged in fancy spending
Ordered rings, cars, and furs
But alas, alack
Like a stab in the back
She found out they were not hers

[Chorus]

He got mixed up with a Maisie
He got mixed up with a Flo
So Flo shoved him in the river
He'll not get mixed up no more

No insurance could she find

There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart",That Old Feeling,1996
Dinah Washington,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1996
Dinah Washington,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam; who would? Would you?
And so all else above

Was tinged with the sadness

Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again

I sit around and wonder
About your new love affair
That's what you call lookin' back

You say you love me and you hold me tight
But when I awake, you're out of sight
Darn that dream

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit skies
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that crazy one track, mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Darn that dream and bless it too
Without that dream, I never would have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true

But I'm in love and I know what time it is

Well, I have sought and my, what a climb it is

My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near, I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone, I'm cloudy with showers

An emotion like the ocean
It's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man
Like I love him

Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around
I end up like I started out: just cryin' my lil' heart out
He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could; I got it bad and that ain't good

So bad, so bad

I got on it so bad, so bad, though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad; I'm mad about you; I can't live without you

Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,
Every time we say goodbye.

Is this all a game?
Am I the fire
Or just another flame?

A one-sided love would break my heart
He may be just acting and playing a part
If he don't love me
Let him tell me so
And I can't hold him
If he wants to go
And though I'll cry
When he's gone
I won't die
I'll live on
If it's so
It's too soon
Way too soon to know

And though I'll cry
When he's gone
I won't die
I'll live on

Dinah Washington Quintet,"I've got a dentist who's over seven feet tall
Yes I've got a dentist who's over seven feet tall
Long John they call him, and he answers every call

Well I went to Long Johns office and told him the pain was killin'
Yes I went to Long Johns office and told him the pain was killin'
He told me not to worry, that my cavity just needed fillin'

He said ""when I start drillin', I'll have to give you novocaine""
He said, ""Yes, when I start drillin', I'll have to give you novocaine
Cause ev'ry woman just can't stand the pain""

He took out his trusted drill
And he told me to open wide
He said he wouldn't hurt me
But he'd fill my hole inside
Long John, Long John, you've got that golden touch
You thrill me when you drill me, and I need you very much

When he got through, he said ""Baby that will cost you ten""
Yes when he got through, he said ""Baby that will cost you ten
Six months from now, come back and see me again""

Say you're supposed to see your dentist
'Bout twice a year, that's right
But I think I feel it bobbin'
Yes I'll go back there tonight

Say I hope I keep on achin' so I can see you every day.",Long John Blues,1999

When they see me in the party, they better act like they know 
YO, we connecting dots that makes spots hot 
To the beat'cha (Y'ALL!), ah ya don't stop (STOP!)
Notice, how many groups can formulate then lose focus 
With a lot of hocus pocus, concepts that sound bogus 
I'm seeing the world and all its different kind of poses (WOO!) 
Crush you like roaches, that's keeping the crowd moving (Ha!) 
Mr and the dancers, who said ""Culture consuming""

I've come to wet the party like a tropical depression 
Mixed with scherm for this musical session

Blinking, kicking, better back up chickens 
The guns stun split, I keep it real, front worm (WORM!) 
'Cause I'm like a hands therapeutic 
Measurements, square, feet, and cubic

How much can a nigga take before he break fool 
I tell ya cool, with the New School 
And the tool to examine my unorthodox pattern 

From Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn 
And don't forget Uranus, Neptune and Pluto 
Flow deeper than the lava inside a volcano, bro 
(Never snitch, never dominate 
I'll be wild, smokin drowsy) 
Fuckin up my economics, is it rather ironic 
Sippin gin, juice and tonic 
Like Shawn Kemp with some hemp, super sound and sonic 
Baby, above your head, below your feet and it still wimp 
See-Boogie Brown, my shit is brilliant 
Yeah yeah, yeah (AHH!)

And I'ma take 4 steps and cross the whole Titanic 
Better believe I (KEEP!) movin (OVER!) people

Yo, I be the Moses takin poses 
When the wine flows so beautiful like a large bouquet of roses 

Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along 
Keep it movin', keep it movin' 

Keep it movin now 
No need to try to stop it, we gon' wreck shit anyhow 
Your, limitations is something I never will allow 
When we bake the cake, I be that nigga that brings the icing 
Disregard your whole identity and revoke your driver's licence 
You know I blast in your ass real fast 
Got your bladder burning, desperate for a bathroom pass 
My  like a Busta Rhymes statue made of grass 
C'mon, hypnotise some ass, shit so hot, better jump in the water, 
Nigga 
Breakin fools at parties like a ruckus sound class 
Make a philly down the back and mix the weed with more hash 
I will wash away your pain like Draino 
Erupting like the angriest volcano, or the wickedest whirlwind and 
Tornado 
We stay up in the streets, cruisin, me and my whole crew, gotta

Keep it movin' along 
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin' 
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along

Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit jus runnin' the streets
Without some type of beef, the week wasn't complete

On feet, just to see the body slumped in the seat

There's not to many people who ever can walk in Loc shoes
Its good as hell that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
Im clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that crushed weed sparks to brang
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when i pulled up and parked the range
Ya damn right i got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the harder aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, till you find out I cought the chain..

Hallelujah,
The question is peculiar
I'd give a lot of dough
If only I could know
The answer to my question
Is it yes or is it no?

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Here comes a blushing bride
The groom is by her side
Up to the altar,
Just as steady as Gibraltar
The groom has got the ring
And it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger
The choir begins to sing:

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor

Now the nation rise as one
To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent
The bonny burning question,
What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?
Boom boom

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?

Nuori elämänsä on kahlittu vaunuihin
On vaunuissa lapsi taas sataa lunta

Kun hän työntää lastenvaunujaan
Ja kulkee ilman saattajaa

Hän on ollut joskus nuori nainen
Käyttänyt aineita speedistä tinneriin
Maanantaiaamut vain yhtä tuskaa
Näin eilisen muistot vierellään
Hän on tuntenut tuntien kipeää
Yksin jäämisen tunteen häpeää

Se sama tyttö on uskonut ihmisiin

Se sama tyttö on nähnyt helvetin

Se sama tyttö on uskonut ihmisiin

Hän tulee vastaan ei-mitään ilmein
Tulee ei-mistään ja päätyy ei-mihinkään
Tietäen on jossain yksinäiset
Jotka nuoruuden leikeistään luopuen
Paljon saivat vain yksinään kantaen
Palapeliä virheistään liitellen

On tyhjentynyt estraadimme
On ihmiset jättäneet narikan tyhjilleen
Takahuoneessa on vain pieni nainen

Dink,"So you feel like you're all grown up now
A great big fish in a great big town
With the whole wide world at your fingertips
All slicked back and ruby lipped

An all-star player at the front of the line
Kissing lots of ass and working overtime
You got real good at acting your age
You're a bird in search of a cage

Ever since you were young it's been push, push, push
And now looking back it seems torturous
You say I'm the greatest thing that this worlds ever seen
My mommy and daddy wouldn't lie to me

They gave me everything that they thought I would need
A sack of gold and a sack of leaves
Hit me real good and screamed with rage
Now I'm a bird in search of a cage

A sack of gold, a sack of leaves
A sack of dirt for us to eat
Cross the road, walk the tracks
Open your eyes and don't look back

You got an eight-ball in your coat and some money in your wallet
A hundred dollar bill is rolled up in your pocket
It's a fast, fast world for a fast, fast guy
The king of the hill with your head in the sky

You sold that sack of gold a long time ago
And the big bag of leaves was getting old
Strutting around like you're on a stage
Dirty little bird found a dirty little cage

Time's gone by and you're feeling pretty old
All your friends stopped calling back a long time ago
You know there's something missing but you don't know what
It ain't money, ain't power, ain't a silky little slut

You're a time bomb, time bomb born without a fuse
Credit's running out and the bills are coming due
Now your wings are all shriveled and you're counting up your days
The door's always open but you love your filthy cage",3 Big Bags,1995

Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive, hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself

But now I hold my head up high and you see me

Laisse-moi un message, même si j'les écoute jamais

À vrai dire, j'ai eu du mal à démarrer, ce matin
Sans ton message dans lequel tu m'souhaites une bonne journée
Ni mon cœur, ni mon téléphone, je n'veux plus faire vibrer
J'ai tellement peur d'être seule
Tellement peur d'accepter qu'c'est terminé
Puis tu sais, j'suis irrité alors parfois, je pleure de trop
En vérité mes larmes ne servent qu'à irriguer ma fleur de peau
Sur mon lit rempli d'mouchoirs, j'me fais des images de guerre
En m'demandant qui aura la garde de notre enfant imaginaire
Si tu savais comment j'saigne, en m'disant que plus personne
Finira mes pop-corns, avant qu'le film ait commencé
J'me dis qu'c'est dingue comment quelqu'un 
Peut tout changer autour de toi
Quand j'trébuche sur l'trottoir 
Et qu'y'a plus personne pour s'moquer d'moi
En panique, j'ai voulu faire une croix sur toi
Mettre un voile sur mon cœur 
Mais l'amour est un établissement laïque
Du mal à m'dire que cette histoire est lointaine
Si tu savais comme j'te déteste, tu saurais à quel point j't'aime

Et quand j'me lève, j'me rappelle
Que mes lèvres toucheront plus les tiennes
Les lumières s'éteignent en plein après-midi
L'impression d'être une ville sans soleil

Quand on m'demande de tes nouvelles et qu'je sais pas quoi répondre
Aujourd'hui, t'as perdu cette lionne, que t'as si bien apprivoisée
J'aimerais devenir une montagne, pour n'pas avoir à t'croiser
Bébé, laisse-moi fermer les yeux et avancer dans l'noir
Parce que toutes les rues que j'vois m'rappellent un souvenir avec toi
J'aurais aimé qu'ça s'passe autrement
Que tu m'envoies un roman pour que j'te laisse une quinzième chance
T'as même brisé mon cauchemar, dans lequel on emménage
Et on s'prend la tête parce que je veux un chat et qu't'en veux pas
J'me demande la réaction qu'j'aurais en t'croisant
J'ai peur que l'amour soit marié et qu'la haine dure trois ans
J'aimerais arracher ton cœur, couper tes bras avec une hache
Mais s'te-plait, pince-moi une dernière fois avant que j'le fasse

J'imagine que t'es entouré d'groupies et qu'tu t'amuses avec
Mais quand ça marchera plus
Tu s'ras tout seul à t'poser sur Namek
Presque ravi de m'dire qu'cette histoire est lointaine

Du pez et du pez, content que ma rime te plaise
J'suis obscur, j'dors que d'un œil comme Jean-Marie Le Pen
On n'fait qu'rapper nos carences, nos peines et nos malchances
Qui veut la guerre prépare une avance
Qui veut la paix prépare un No man's land

So I'm out to land on somethin'
Hopefully a girl will come
To me at the ground

Eyed it, dried it, untied it
Chilled it, spilled it, refilled it
Paste it, traced it, erased it

Hopefully a girl will come

Gotta find a way to mend
The less we see, the more it grows
Festering out of control

Piled high, you get that face
I wonder why we ever got it together
What's to say, there's just no clue
We just know to do, hope it comes together

It's the norm, float again
It's the stuff you said you send
Take it in, wait to see
If it's enough just 'cause it's free

Push too far, you feel the skin
Begin to scar, can't really put it together
Now it's a drag with no hope of coming back
How can you ever get it together?

Bottled up, stored away
Always ready to give way
Push it farther, yeah, we know
Clinging, hoping, it won't show

Piled high, you get that face
I wonder why we ever got it together
And push too far and feel the skin begin to scar

And cons of your eyes farewell, toes

Well, it'll be a while
I gotta unfry
'Fore I pick it up with you
Help me

Do I need that stable care
Don't I know that they'll be there
Does that count now you've appeared

Do I need that stable core
Or do I jump for something more
Are you all that I fear?

It's a shame my judgment rots
And I sure feel rotten long

It's a call that's tough to make
It could be a big mistake

Maybe I'll say hi that's my best

'Cause I'm scared of feeling
That appealing touch

You gotta get through
My maze and pass every test
'Cause I'm choosin' one love
Tattooed across my chest

Know the time has come
I ain't gonna fester no more
Let the world be free of my disease
I never knew a rubber doll
Would be so hard to please

Now I'm preachin' out
One last burst before I retract
No one will know
'Til I finally let go of the one thing
I ain't never going to give back

I want to help you, baby, can't you see
You're better than my pillow?
'Cause you don't stain so easily
You know it's hard just to finally let go

And leave all the pictures behind
Hope I brought you some happiness
I believe I just had to get on
'Cause just wasn't a world
I wished to need to find

So they sabotage their own livelihood

The parts all function but the fuse is lit
Teeth scrape on the last remaining fossil

A question people think, I call a friend
And the next wave is valentine

See yourself call, no big deal
Ever since that's not a fear
Wishin' the lamp would shine
And beam me at it, give me some fuel

Find a way, to clog it up alone
Terrified, the way you stand
Feeling natural behind the phone

Rain has fallen, the tree does cry and [unverified]
And the toads are running free and [unverified]

It's no fun to that's what stinks
Bought a carrot and still can't see
You know I've been waiting for 6 years
For a ray of hope, leaves me a float

Then I could believe in sunshine
In the winter time, mountains glow
There's always so much to adore
There's a little scenic picture on my skull

See the second building, imagine
Where'd you go, all I wanna know baby

The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.

I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,

And someone way down here loses someone dear.

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.

But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1999
