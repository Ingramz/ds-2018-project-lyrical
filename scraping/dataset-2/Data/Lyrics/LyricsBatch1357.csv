Bryan Smith,"Love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

I can't conceal it
Don't you see?
Can't you feel it?
Don't you too?
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I've just made it
I found you at last
So come on
Now let's try it
I love you
Can't deny it
'Cause it's true
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it
But just wait and see",I Do I Do I Do I Do I Do,1999
Bryan Smith,"I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream",I Have a Dream,1999
Bryan Smith,"No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house
Tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends
This is goodbye

Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
We just have to face it
This time we're through 
Breaking up is never easy, I know
But I have to go 
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

Memories, good days, bad days 
They'll be with me always 
In these old familiar rooms
Children would play
Now there's only emptiness
Nothing to say

Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
We just have to face it
This time we're through 
Breaking up is never easy, I know
But I have to go 
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do",Knowing Me Knowing You,1999
Bryan Smith,"I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

(Don't go sharing your devotion)

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me",Lay All Your Love on Me,1999
Bryan Smith,"I been cheated by you since you know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything 

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?

Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go 
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything 

[Chorus]

Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
""Bye bye, leave me now or never""
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
""Bye bye"" doesn't mean forever 

[Chorus]

Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go",Mamma Mia,1999
Bryan Smith,"I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

Bryan Smith,"I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted
      
I was an impossible case
No-one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know

The name of the game

I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know
       
What's the name of the game?  (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)
(But it means a lot)
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know
Oh yes I wanna know

The name of the game  (I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?  (But I think I can see in your face)
(That it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?  (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)
(But it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?  (I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?  (But I think I can see in your face)
(That it means a lot)
",The Name of the Game,1999
Bryan Smith,"They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all
Never left at all

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call",One of Us,1999
Bryan Smith,"Where are those happy days they seem to hard to find?
I try to reach for you.  but you have closed my mind
Whatever happened to our love?  I wish I understood
It used to be so nice.  It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?
 
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out. I wish I understood
What happened to our love? It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?

Bryan Smith,"Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right

Bryan Smith,"If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me

If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown

Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better

So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you

Bryan Smith,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing

What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me",Thank You for the Music,1999
Bryan Smith,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All,1999
Bryan Smith,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Bryan Smith,"Heartaches
Heartaches
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me
I can't believe it's just a burning memory

Heartaches
Heartaches
What does it matter how my heart breaks?
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches for you",Heartaches,2003
Bryan Smith,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless,2003
Bryan Smith,"Smile an everlasting smile a smile could bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you're gone cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory let's start a brand new story now my love
Right now there'll be no other time and I can show you all my love

Talk an everlasting words and dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my love I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean a single word I say
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,

Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

And why I'm so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,

Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town

I cannot forget the people who love me

I was the one when you left town
Said I'd get along somehow
Didn't take long to find out
That I was wrong

Look at me now
Nothin' but a whole lot of time on my hands
Look at me now
Thought I wouldn't need you 
Now I understand
You said I was never gonna learn
Look at me now

I was so busy looking out for myself
I know I must have took you for granted
Didn't want to make room for someone else
Didn't know love when I had it
You were the one who set me free
But you can lay the blame on me
Come my way and you'll see
I have changed

Calling your name in the quiet of the night
Seeing your face every time I close my eyes
It's always the same
I keep hoping that you might

Look at me now
Standing here holding my heart in my hands
Look at me now
Wishing I'd told you we could still start again
What I'd give if you'd turn
And look at me now

Here you are on the back of my mind again",Look at Me Now,1994
Bryan White,"There's not a star left in the sky tonight
That hasn't been wished on
And I've been wishin' I could find me a wishin' well
I'd throw in every penny I own

I've got moonlight and a warm June night
All that's missing here is you
Me and the moon have never been so blue
If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me

In a way
I can see your eyes in the stars
But it's not the same
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight

To be the stars in your eyes tonight
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight
But it's me and the moon
It seems if you believe in a dream enough

It has to come true
And mine would turn back time til the world unwinds
If I could be holding you
So if a star falls from the sky tonight

You'll know what I tried to do
Me and the moon have never been so blue
If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me

Bryan White,"She cries just a little when she sees him walk away
After all, she can't see it any other way
And it's hard when you're feelin' like there's nothin' left to lose
No she can't help it, she sees no excuse

There's no good in her goodbye
There's no tears she hasn't cried
But it's not enough
She needs nothin' less than love
Don't say the sacrifice is small
And no one ever has it all
When all she wants
Is nothin' less than love

You can't stand in the middle and see it either way
That's just how it is, no one ever wants the blame
So she'll pick up the pieces and pretend she just can't see
Cause all she's looking for is some room to breathe

She knows better than to wait
Just keep waiting until it's too late

There's no good in her goodbye
When all she wants
Is nothin' less than love

Don't say the sacrifice is small
And no one ever has it all
When all she wants
Is nothin' less than love",Nothing Less Than Love,1994
Bryan White,"Rebecca Lynn grew up in Carolina 
Half a mile from Tucker Cherry's farm
A quiet girl with green eyes full of fire
Her daddy's pride and all her mama's charm
Rebecca Lynn became my heart's desire
Long about the start of second grade
Mrs. Roosenbloom let me sit beside her
So we'd pass notes and after school we'd play

[Chorus]
Singing ring around the rosie
Pocket full of dreams and posies
Patty cake and baker's man
Tag your it, kick the can

And I think I hear my mama calling
Gotta go
Man I loved her so

High school days with me and Becky learning what it really means to be in love
Give and take, holding back for Heaven's sake
And fighting for a week and making up
I said please Becky won't you marry me
Prom night in my car out by the curb
She was so surprised, first she laughed and then she cried
And somewhere in my heart I'm sure I heard

[Chorus]

Mama flashed the porch light for me
Gotta go
Man I loved her so

When love is wrong it dies and that's the way it goes
But when it's right, your love grows

Laura Jean was born in Tennessee
Now that's a common little miracle I know.
But for me and Becky Lynn she's the dream that started
When we fell in love so many years ago

Gotta go
Oh man I loved you so",Rebecca Lynn,1994

Bryan White,"She's standing at the front door
With a suitcase in her hand
I'm staring down the hallway
Frozen where I stand
She says she doesn't love me anymore
Oh Lord what can I do?
It's gonna take a miracle to make us stay
That's why I'm asking you

So please don't you have a miracle just laying around
One small miracle nobody needs
Send it on down
I'll never make it through this night 
Thinking she's with someone else
Please don't you have just one small miracle left

I know I haven't been a saint
And asking you for anything takes nerve
'Cause you've already blessed me with so much more in life than I deserve
But if you can make a blind man see
And change the water into wine
Then surely you can keep her from tearing out this ol' heart of mine

Please don't you have just one small miracle left",One Small Miracle,1997
Bryan White,"On a tree inside a heart
A dull boyscout knife 
Took half a day to carve
Michael loves Caroline
He just turned ten and she was nine

The summer she turned sweet sixteen
He finally found his nerve 
And took her out to see
And what she saw through her tears 
Were seven hearts for seven years

CHORUS:
And they stood beneath the tree of hearts 
And they watch their feelings grow 
And they swore they'd never be apart 
True love left it's mark
On the tree of hearts

The tenth time he carved their names 
Caroline's dad was giving her away
There beneath the shelter of
The tree of hearts they pledged their love 

And then four hearts down the road 
They brought the first of two born home 

CHORUS: 
And they played beneath the tree of hearts 
And they watched their children grow
And they swore they'd never be apart 
True love left it's mark

At sixty-one Michael knew 
There wouldn't be a sixty-two

Did you change the world
Or play the game

In a world dark and cold
A night so still, winter's chill
One bright star was shining

On a bed made of hay
In a manger He lay
Shepherds came, they knew His name
King of kings, a brand new day

They saw the light in the darkness
It shines on love and tenderness
Brings out the hope that's in all of us
May it shine its light on you this Christmas Night

On this Christmas Day
May that star light your way
This Christmas Eve, I still believe
That same star still shines on me

I saw the light in the darkness
It shines on love and tenderness
Brings out the hope that's in all of us
May it shine its light on you this Christmas Night

It shines on love and tenderness
Brings out the hope that's in all of us
May it shine its light on you this Christmas Night

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Speeding window of a train
On a billboard on a highway
It always looks the same
A smile out of nowhere,
Stops me in my tracks
Can't believe that after all this time

Everywhere I turn I see your face
Proving that a fool's love never fades
In my mind your image is forever burned
I keep trying not to stare but your always there
Everywhere I turn

I spell out your name
I watch people run across the street
Through the pouring rain
There you are again so easy to find
Under the umbrella in another woman's eyes

Will feed their pain away
Words on broken phonographs
Reeking with decay
Close our eyes to circumstance

Hope it goes away
I'm Broken, Broken
We're Broken, Broken

You're the hole in my umbrella
The soaking wet behind my ears
The bloodstain on my name
The same disease I've had for years

If I went to see the doctor
He would say to stay away
But why should I heed advice? (The hospital charges twice)

When it's possible to feel worse
Sid and Nancy, loved each other
I want you to be my Undercutter
We'll watch the stars, lying in the gutter
I need you to be my Undercutter

Jezebel of my novella
We're soaking wet between the sheets
These feelings never change (I'm happy to be deranged)                                           
Without you I'm incomplete

Provided we don't kill each other
I want you to be my Undercutter
Make my heart, melt like butter
I need you to be my Undercutter",Sweet/Broken/Undercutter,2010

Polvos corridos, siempre echamos tres 
A la cuenta de una le bajo la luna 
Pero ella quiere con Maluma y conmigo a la vez 

Estoy enamorado de las cuatro 
Siempre las busco después de las cuatro 
A las cuatro les encanta en cuatro 
Y yo nunca fallo como el 24 

De los Lakers siempre es la gorras 
De chingar ninguna se enzorra 
Estoy metio en un lío, ya estoy confundio 
Porque ninguna de mi mente se borra 

Me pongo las gafas Cartier saliendo del aeropuerto 
Vestio de Osiris, zapatos en pie 
Tú tienes tú mi cuenta de banco y el número de la Master Card 
Tú eres mi mujer oficial 
Me tiene enamorado ese culote con ese pelo rubio 
Pero tengo otra pelinegra que siempre quiere chichar 

A veces hasta le llega al estudio 
La peliroja chichando es la más que se moja 
Le encojona que me llame y no lo coja 
Peleamos y me bota la ropa y tengo que llamar a cotorra pa' que la recoja 
Tengo una chiquitita nalgona con el pelo corto

Ya me salieron más caras que un reloj de Ulysses Nardin 
Es que la babies están bunny ninguna las 4 se ha hecho completas 
Dos tienen maridos y ninguna de las dos al marido respetan 

Cuatro chimbitas 
Cuatro personalidades 
Dos me hablan bonito 
Dos dicen maldades 

Diferentes nacionalidades 
Pero cuando chingan gritan todas por iguales 
Quiere que la lleve pa' medallo 
Quiere que la monte en carros del año 
Que a una la coja 
A la otra la apriete 
Y a las otras 2 les dé juntas en el baño

First shift, eternal light
The curse of Adam labor
Outside, in the parking lot
The current of wind and the light went hot
He held his head in terror
By Jove and by surprise

It burned his hands with symbols
White noise as Lucifer

Conceived with holy water

I need you, sensation, by virtue, persuasion, by Jove, by Jove

Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush

No one ever ever really knew me

Everyone was always out to screw me

Never met a man I ever trusted
Always dealt with shysters in the past
Now I'm well adjusted 'cause I've got a friend at last

Don't help me

Always playing singles, never doubles

Bryn Terfel,"Al borde de una laguna 
Tres brujas montan caldero 
Y baten un mundo espeso

Una le pone la luna
Otra sangre de cordero
Y otra los últimos besos

De camelot vuelan señales 
En los dragones y los cuernos 
Y hay un silencio de animales 
Mientras se anuncian los infiernos

El odio al otro es nuestra suerte 
La sangre ajena es nuestra viña 
Cuando profanen y den muerte
Seremos aves de rapiña

Los contrahechos del norte 
Y un enano de alcahuete 
Sádicos abominables

Reclutan tribus y cortes 
Para gestión de grilletes 
Y corazones de sables

Y una vez más como tragedia 
Ronda el olor a carne rota 
De calabozo de edad media 
Donde callaban al ilota 

Y una vez más contra el impulso 
De besar y abrazar a gentes 
Ceder al último recurso

Bryn Terfel," I talk to the trees
 But they don't listen to me
 I talk to the stars
 But they never hear me
 The breeze hasn't time
 To stop and hear what I say
 I talk to them all in vain

 But suddenly my words
 Reach someone else's ears
 Touch someone else's heartstrings, too
 I tell you my dreams
 And while you're listening to me
 I suddenly see them come true
 
 I can see us on an April night
 Sipping brandy underneath the stars
 Reading poems in the candlelight
 To the strumming of guitars
 
 I will tell you all the books I've read
 And the way I met the King of France
 Then I'll send the servants off to bed
 And I'll ask you for a dance

Stayed beneath my feet before.

In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

That I would rather be.

I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.

Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.

Once my child to the night
I see that you have minds to cop
And I can only watch the sickened sorrow
Little do you know
Of the progressions that you teach
The people that you reach are tired
Of livin' in a world of elastic towers
Dance with them and sing a song of changes
And talk with them of life and all its dangers
Surround yourself with now familiar strangers
Who kiss and who hug and eventually mug you of your time
And the clock on the wall is a bore
As you wander past the door
And find him lying on the floor
As he begs you for some more, you frozen smile
You cannot ever picture me
You know me by my thoughts
A file for your travelogue
Oblivious to the night, the fog around you
The germs they are ridiculous
They bother you at night
The blood that rushes to your brain
The ticket on the plane you're never catching
The price you pay exclusive of your taxes
To chop you up inside with tiny axes
The girl looks up to you from floors she waxes
And speaks to your belt with tears among her eyes
And the clock on the wall is a bore
As you wander past the door
And find him lying on the floor
As he begs you for some more, you frozen smile
The metaphysic wrinkles in the face of what you face
Are hidden by the fake-up man
Who lives inside the sterno can beside you
Now climb ye to the mountains
As the sun is almost gone
Escaping from your other selves
Your brothers hide among the shelves inside you
The games that people play can only bore you
But only those that know you don't ignore you
How many times have I come there to restore you
And caught you lying on the couch with father time
And the clock on the wall is a bore
As you wander past the door
And find him lying on the floor
As he begs you for some more, you frozen smile","The Modern Adventures of Plato, Diogenes and Freud",1968

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,1998

Into the open arms of temptation

You should be crying when
I've fallen again and
Where do you hide the tears
That fell in the day I turned you away
You throw them away...

draw my heart
Out of the darkness
Where I was hiding from your face
Into the open arms of forgiveness
Offering grace
Into a place where there's no memory
Left to press against me

You should be crying when
I've fallen again and
Where do you hide the tears
That fell in the day I turned you away

Stumble or fall
You cover them all
Nothing to hold you
Let them go
Love takes me in
And covers with in
To welcome the child you know I am

Where do you hide the tears

And the fear I hold inside will be no longer.
Still it seems that love has taken so long.
And the waiting is like a never ending heartache.

Hey...

The circles in my mind just keep on spinning.
Could the winds of love be blowing my way?
Let's make the storms in my heart feel the sun.

One hundred percent 'cause I expect the best 
Nothin' less 
Don't hit Ras with the stress 

Spittin' rhymes hard that's crackin' the bird chest 
Took me twelve months to stack money in lumps 
Far from livin' foul but further from Don Trump 
Hit the speed bumps got slowed but still flow 
Huntin' bruthas down for money they still owe (owe) 
Brothas gettin' killed and brothas in cell blocks 
Comin' home to bills that's fillin' my mail box 
Felt all the pain through sunshine and rain 
Hopin' one day that all of this will change 
Had to rearrange my life, I strike twice 
Standin' on the curb with bruthas rollin' the dice 
Never nothin' nice when all of yo cash flow (what) 
'pends on how the ivory's hittin' the Castro 
You know, that if you ever needed Rasco 
That I would be the first to stand in toe-to-toe 
I never ran, my moms raised a real man 
Taught me all the tricks to formulate the plans 
World in my hand, she said it was all mine 
Always made sure that everything was fine 
Stop it on the dime, drop nuttin' but ill rhymes 
Started as a hobby, I did it to kill time 
Now it's got perks, no longer the desk clerk 
But sometimes that's where I was doin' my best work 
Hope that vest work, we spittin' the Teflon 
Get out of the way before you get stepped on

Towering over your head.

And she's gone.

where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

That grow so incredibly high.

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

Mein Bruder war ein guter Junge mit dem Herz am rechten Fleck
Einen Hang zur Gangster-Scheiße und keinen Wert für das Gesetz
Aber Liebe für die Gang, leider auch für schnelles Geld
Doch mit dem Licht kommen auch die Motten und fressen dein letztes Hemd
Wenn die große Nummer zu 'ner Zahl hinterm Komma bricht
Meiden sie das Sonnenlicht
Es kommt, wie es kommt, also komm mir nicht
Mit, „Du verstehst!“, denn du verstehst hoffentlicht
Dass du nicht verstehst, was meine Sorgen sind
Auch im Sommer sind die Nächte für ihn weiß
Beide Hände kalt vom Schweiß, nach gefühlten achtzehn Lines
Kommt die Maske auf's Gesicht, Wohnungstüren brechen ein
Beute wird getauscht gegen Beutel voll mit Stein'n
Heute in sei'm Rausch wirkt der Teufel auf ihn ein
Es zieht Lebenszeit vorbei in ei'm eingerollten Schein
Jeden Tag bete ich, er kommt sauber wieder heim
Und hoff', der kalte Engel gibt ihn wieder frei

Mein Bruder ist so high, mein Bruder hört den weißen Teufel flüstern
Nein, mein Bruder jagt schon wieder Ticker

Doch wen liebt man trotzdem? Geschwister!

Ich lass' dich nicht hängen, ganz egal, mit wem sie kommen
Welche Namen sie so kennen, ja, das hat man halt davon
Familie über Gang, Gang über Leute, die dich sofort Bruder nennen
Und zu den Bullen rennen
Sie hassen die Verräter, doch lieben den Verrat
Damals war ich Täter, doch hab' niemals ausgesagt
„Bleib immer am Boden!“, hat mein Vater gesagt
Irgendwann muss hier jeder für die Taten bezahlen
War zu klug für die Anklagebank
Shotgun im Schrank
Schüsse in die Luft und wir lassen es knallen
Zwischen Dreck und die Waren, die vom Lastwagen fallen
Haben Lasten zu tragen, lassen uns nichts sagen
Wird es ernst, heißt es immer noch Mann gegen Mann
Suchst du Stress, siehst du hier rot

Bis dein Leben sich mal ändert kann es sein, dass du gefickt bleibst
Gefickt bleibt nie derjenige, der Hei wird
Sondern der, der nur ein Fisch bleibt
Bin keiner von den Rappern, die sich dissen oder freestylt
Begrabe nie ein Kriegsbeil
Zu jeder Zeit zu viel bereit
Das allerwichtigste muss die Familie sein
Bleibe so, mich einzuholen
Wie Busfahrer gegen Formel eins-Pilot
Und es bleibt, wie es ist
Life is a bitch

Ich les in deinen Augen
Es reicht ein einzelner Blick
Um zu sehen, wer du wirklich bist
Und nur eins steht fest
Life is a bitch
Der Gegenwind, den du schickst
Kommt schneller, als dir lieb ist als Sturm zurück
Denn Karma schießt scharf und direkt in den Kopf
Und glaub mir, es trifft, denn

Statt der Großstadtromantik der Boden voller Dreck
Auch im Sommer ist die Luft hier kälter als man denkt
Denn jeder hat einen Rücken, aber keiner mehr Respekt
Wie ein scheiß Western, nur die Kugeln sind so echt
Wie die Tränen in den Kissen bei unsern Müttern im Bett
Sag mir, werd' ich alt oder packt es mich erst jetzt?
Warum gehen wir nicht zusammen, sondern ballern uns nur weg?
Ich denk' mich in den Himmel, doch hör die Vögel nicht zwitschern
Und statt unser Herz hören wir nur den Teufel flüstern
Paranoia macht ein'n schlagartig nüchtern
Wir beten vor dem Schlafen, doch schalten nochmal das Licht an
Jeder schreibt sein Schicksal
Also warum gehen wir klauen statt zu ackern in 'nem Job, der auch was fit macht?
Trauer schreibt Wut auf zu viele Gesichter
Das Ego ist zu groß und die Empathie nicht da
Ein Wort wird ein Schlag, ein Schlag wird ein Stich
Ein Stich wird ein Finger am Abzug, der ihn auch drückt
Mann, der Tod wird zu Trauer, Trauer wird zu Hass
Hass wird zu Rache, die einer Mutter ihr Kind nahm
Sinnlos, wir füttern nur das Feuer mit Benzin
Gehen Richtung Hölle, aber träum'n vom Paradies
Wollen Frieden im Tod, aber leben einen Krieg
Beten für Hilfe, doch der Teufel sind wir

Es ist kalt, doch es liegt nicht am Winter
Und auf dem Spielplatz spiel'n keine Kinder
Grausame Welt, Hauptsache, Geld
Hauptsache, keine Aussage fällt
Und mein Herr, wenn wir uns selbst betrügen
Selbst belügen, um mehr zu fühlen
Nichts mehr genügt, wir sind schwer zu führen
Weil wir den Schmerz nicht fühlen, unser Herz ist kühl

Sitz' mit falschen Leuten niemals an einem Tisch
Es ist alles, wie es ist
Schnelles Geld auf der Straße, alles ist Profit
Und ich mach' den nächsten Schritt
Handel' nicht mehr mit Gift, hab' mich wieder im Griff
Und ich mach' den zweiten Schritt
Nie wieder Zelle, der Anwalt bekommt nichts

Immer kühl zu den Leuten, weil ich weiß, wie sie sind

Bleiben stabil, keiner bleibt liegen

Zwischen Quatschen über Ackern mit meinem Vater
Und den Geschichten, die ich ihm lieber erspart hab'

Well are thunderheads just another cloud, we do
Not fragile, straight at you

Then we vanish to the night
Still in your ears but out of sight
Not fragile

Don't think we feel hurt or wounded
Or our egos are showing thru
It's our world that's been disrupted
And our strength reflects from you
Well its true
Not fragile, over you

Try us when you're getting down
Feelin' high or just hangin' round
Not fragile

The times we travel in our lives
Are hard and give us drive
We may seem distant most of the time
But many thoughts are still on our minds
Not fragile",Not Fragile,2001
BTO Spider,"We rented a truck and a semi to tow
Travel down the long and divided road
Look on the map I think we've been there before,
Close up the doors, let's roll once more.

Cop on the corner, look he's startin' to write
I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight,
Drove so fast that my eyes can't see,
Look in the mirror, is he still followin' me?

Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway,
Roll, roll.

Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
Move out boys, let's get ready to race
454 coming over the hill
The man on patrol is going to give us a bill.

The time's real short, you know the distance is long
I'd like to have a jet but it's not in the song
Climb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luck
We gotta keep movin' if we're going to make a buck.

Every one a one night stand
Workin' for a man down south Louisiana

[Chorus]
I'm gonna get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Make a stand
I'm gonna take it like a man

Met a stray woman, I think it was in Texas
She was made for those who'd pay
Got a little drunk and raised a mild ruckus

널 데려다 줬던 집도
다른 남자의 집이었고
사람 많은 곳에선
좀 떨어져 걷는 느낌이었어
우린 커다랗게 부풀었던 풍선이
쪼그라들 듯 식었지
답답한 마음을
감출 수가 없어 난
뭐가 잘못된 거지
지난 밤과 항상 똑같아
너는 외면하고
나만 매달리는 사이는
이젠 지쳤다고
항상 난 너였기에
너를 믿었던 나기에
매일 밤 외로워 괴로워 지겨워
내가 떠나줄게 니가 싫어지게
이제 더는 귀찮게
매달리지 않게
I\'m gonna be better
차라리 없는게 더
오늘따라 비밀이 너무 많은 너

She gives me so much pain
I won\'t be back again
I wanna hate you

후회 없이 보내는 게 힘들지만
네 모습이 아직 잘
실감이 나질 않아 난
우리 한 약속은
바람과 함께 사라졌어
남은 건 너의 차가운 시선
거지 같이 여전히
네 미소를 그리워하는
내가 미워 이젠 정말 너와는
끝이란 걸 인정 못해 죽겠어

사랑이란 그네는 멈췄고
다신 돌아오지 않을 기찰 타고
I\'ll let you go
I\'ll let you go
내가 다 버릴게 이젠 다 놓을게
그만 떠나도 돼
다신 날 찾지마 마음은 아프지만
잊어버릴 수 있게

Do you wanna know my story?
I never told this to anybody
Yeah, come on

이 넓은 바다 그 한가운데
한 마리 고래가 나즈막히 외롭게 말을 해
아무리 소리쳐도 닿지 않는 게
사무치게 외로워 조용히 입 다무네
아무렴 어때 뭐가
됐던 이젠 뭐 I don’t care
외로움이란 녀석만 내 곁에서 머물 때
온전히 혼자가 돼 외로이 채우는 자물쇠
누군 말해 새끼 연예인 다 됐네
Oh fuck that, 그래 뭐 어때 누군가 곁에
머물 수 없다 한대도 그걸로 족해
날 향해 쉽게 얘기하는 이 말은 곧 벽이 돼
외로움조차 니들 눈엔 척이 돼, come on

내 숨이 막혀도
저 수면 위를 향해 hey oh oh, hey oh yeah

밝게 빛날 수 있을까

오늘도 다시 노래하지 나

세상은 절대로 몰라
내가 얼마나 슬픈지를
내 아픔은 섞일 수 없는 물과 기름
그저 난 수면 위에서만
숨을 쉴 때 관심 끝 외로운 바닷속 꼬마
나도 알리고 싶네 내 가치를 everyday
걱정의 멀미를 해 늘 스티커는 귀 밑에
Never end, 왜 끝은 없고 매번 hell
시간이 가도 차가운 심연 속의 Neverland (Neverland)
But 늘 생각해
지금 새우잠 자더라도 꿈은 고래답게
다가올 큰 칭찬이 매일 춤을 추게 할거야

까맣게 잊고 있었던
널 다시 마주했던 때 14살 무렵
어색도 잠시 다시 널 어루만졌지
긴 시간 떠나있어도 절대 거부감 없이
날 받아줬던 너
Without you, I'm nothing
새벽을 지나서 둘이서 함께 맞는 아침
영원히 너는 나의 손을 놓지마
나도 다시 널 놓지 않을 테니까

그때 기억해
나의 십대의 마지막을
함께 불태웠던 너 그래 한 치 앞도
뵈지 않던 그때 울고, 웃고
너와 함께여서 그 순간조차
이제는 추억으로
박살난 어깰 부여잡고 말했지
나 더 이상은 진짜 못하겠다고
포기하고 싶던 그때마다
곁에서 넌 말했지
새꺄 너는 진짜 할 수 있다고
그래 그래
그때 기억해
지치고 방황했었던
절망의 깊은 수렁에
빠졌던 그때 내가 널 밀어내고
널 만난 걸 원망해도
넌 꿋꿋이 내 곁을 지켰지 말 안 해도
그러니 절대
너는 내 손을 놓지마
두 번 다시 내가 널 놓지 않을 테니까
나의 탄생 그리고 내 삶의 끝
그 모든 걸 지켜볼 너일 테니까

치기 어린 사랑에 잃은 꿈의 길
내 야망의 독기 매일 칼을 갈았지
But 참을 수 없는 내 욕심에

알고 있어 다
이 사랑은 악마의 또 다른 이름
손을 잡지 마
외쳤지만 저버렸지 내 양심을

그 입술이 너무 달콤했기에

건드릴 수 없는 매서운 주위의 시선들

4 AM, we back in Athens, rollin' balls, and the bitch is laughin'
Chalk the first one, up to rappin'
I waited years, but tonight it happen

(CHORUS)
Hey Betty Betty, hush your mouth, let me tell you something
Hey Betty Betty, this Bubba K, the one your boyfriend bumpin
Hey Betty Betty, understand, see I ain't got no patience
Hey Betty Betty, get in the truck, lets crank up these relations
Hey Betty Betty, I'm tryin' to see if you adventurous
Hey Betty Betty, I only mess with 9's and 10's and up
Hey Betty Betty, you got some things, I'd love to photograph
Hey Betty Betty, you heard a while, but you don't know the half

I missed you Betty, since I last, saw your ass at the Polo Club
What's the matter, can't show no love?
I guess you here bout them photos of, you and me on the internet
Get over there, we ain't finished yet
I got a new, cam-er-a, miss Pam-el-a, and I'm fin to let
Bobby introduce you to the helicopter, and when he through
I bet its clear, why crackers here, ain't trying to hear, another word from you
I'm certain to, attract a virus, 'cause using rubbers, don't excite us
If you ain't cutting, don't invite us, and I won't return, if you stole the nighters
Don't deny us, we them boys, talkin' bout you sing with a pretty voice
Just to fuck, and now your buck, all in my face, you made a shitty choice
I get it moist every time I touch it, freaky deaky all out in public
And guess where Mr. Sparxxx erupted?
In her grill, but still, she loved it

(CHORUS)

Now you might see me, ridin' ?Lac, with Rodney Black, on a coochie chase
Or you might catch me with chunky Shan, at some slightly tan, white groupie's place
Then booty shake, Betty's got, a special spot in Bubbas heart
Puttin' cheese to her college degree, but a lot of fleas shake it up for free
If it was up to me, you'd be with me, sippin' Beam, ridin' in between
Lagrange and Athens, if you love me, engrave my name on your nipple ring
I'm spiffy clean, when it comes to females, sex with me only ups your resale
Blazin' quarters, up to ounces, keep the dimes, they done nixed the Sprewell
How that weed smell? Oh I know it, that's how these Georgia crackers grow it
You getting high to every time you blow it, if you feelin' freaky, why won't you show it?
I don't mind, Shan don't mind, Jed don't mind, WE don't mind
But if you scared, get on from here, 'cause frankly dear, we don't need your kind

Bubba Sparxxx,"Its Bubba Sparxx in the streets (2x)

I just hitch hiked my way from Athens to Cascade
Paid homage for three days been written the past eight
I feel I'm the last great warrior of written lyric
You can move to Polo Club bitch you still ain't gettin near it
If its Bubba spittin fear it, this that shit legends made of
It'll take more than a flag for them folks to segregate us
Hook it, let it cake up prepare it for whole sale
This my mother fuckin heart I don't care if it don't sell
I dare you to go tell, your people that Bubbas bogus
I'm sorry, did my antics interrupt your fucking focus?
Dammit I guess its hopless, y'all just won't listen
When I'm rhymin to provide you with diamond that don't glisten
I had to be the one, this shit was my birth right
You content with moving units, I'm faced with a worse plight
To give you a verse like, that first hit of extascy
Yeah you special in your click but you ain't shit up next to me
And if you get the best of me, nah, that shit ain't feasible
'cause trying to get a hold of Bubba is like chasing a greasy bull

Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (C'mon know y'all don't really want it)

Shit these boys don't really want it, the just mumblin to be heard
Damn y'all wasn't lying, sleepy crumblin in some sweet herb
I'm humble till my speech slurs, then its off the bleachears
In the closet with your wife enticing her to floss her features
This one 'ot to teach you, it ain't fun to play with Bubba
Took a rich prissy bitch and played her this and made her gutta'
But she made me late for suppa', and I don't eat but once a day
I'm tryin to watch my weight 'cause my street days a month away
And I want these sluts to love me, but if they don't then fuck 'em
'cause tomorrow if they swallow, if they won't the I duck 'em
I bet y'all never seen one of me look so clean
Kept it right here in the South and did it with a good ol' team
So hate it if you must, but I made it and you can trust
That every vowel out my bowel, is sacred it just to us
They played it and made a fuss, 'cause the truth is a frighten topic
Ricky pull the plug, shit, that's all that might could stop it

Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (C'mon now y'all don't really want it)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (The coolest white boy I know)
Its Bubba Sparxxx in the streets (They just mumblin to be heard)

I'm through noddin my head to shit, that's anythin but monumental
can't just settle for La Grange, therefore my slang is continental
From my road to your trap, my code is no dap
If your head is like a keg, chillin ice cold with no tap
Five shows with no nap, I'll sleep when I in the dirt
Ain't tryin to party with you industry faggots I come to work
Emergin from the hurt, that life was and still will be
Took a shower at the dungeon, dried off and was still filthy
These bitches will feel me, I promise just bein honest
Its like its '93 again, got that heat for them premadonnas
Wide eyed in the booth, this goes beyond politics
In other words keep that pussy, I already got a bitch
And I'm pledgin not switch from authentic to counterfeit
'cause when it comes to that raw, y'all hit it I found the shit
And I won't speak in the dungeon, till its hardway on the wall
In the name of Bubba Sparxx, shit ain't even fair for y'all

I can't do that Timbaland shit, that that shoop shit..

There goes that damn Bubba just bein his country self
Slide inside Timmy's track and ride it 'til nothing's left
Bet you then they'll get the picture, a legendary mixture
like Jim Beam and Coke, can you cope with that elixir?
Drank it, that'll fix ya, why you angry anyway?
I'm in the same mud as you, been dirty for plenty days
Okay, let's get it on, in any shape form or fashion
At the Tunnel in New York, or at the dorms out in Athens
y'all still don't hear me?  Am I not speakin clearly?
I just throw y'all little lames on any trash heap that's near me
Fuck 'em, hot damn 'em, really, to hell with 'em
Send 'em to Nelly B(?), and certainly they'll get 'em
I really don't have to answer to questions that y'all present me
But I know why after this here session, y'all resent me
Never the one to fuss, just smile and let 'em walk
Okey-dokey, now they knowin how Bubba talk

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
y'all don't know me a'tall
I say the same thang but slower than y'all
A little Southern charm to top it off
Okey-dokey, dis dat Bubba talk

This time it gets ugly, my folks done got to drankin
Some rednecks and thugs in the club, now what you thankin?
Hopped up and stankin, bankin on Bubba's rise
All up on that Betty you got, with rubber thighs
Can't help but love them guys, they happy they out the country
But the country's still in them, black and nappy, white and grungy
Lawd this boy's gone, from dirty to fast speed
And if she don't visit, we snatchin that rare squeeze
If you mad leave, this is not yo' type of party
Some Jim Beam with gin and Henn with white Bacardi
Yeah we quite retarded but hell you only live once
Still talkin Bubba but I can't complete the sentence

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I slowly let my anger turn to just concern
for y'alls well bein, I'm seein there's much to earn
In this money pit of music, this dummy shit's amusin
That's what you think it is?  Meet me at the bank with this
I'll withdraw the same two bills and spend it on port (?)
y'all can't run with me, stay on the porch please
There's somethin special, about Bubba's mannerisms
That's why they should accept, any helpin hand I give 'em
I don't know, is it me, or is this industry foul?
They used to be sugar but they shit to me now
Get in and get bent, that's enough then cut me off
No matter what it cost it's worth it when Bubba talk

I hear your car keys jinglin, go 'head and crank it up
Spent a thousand on the liquor but tonight it ain't enough
Cause this town is full of drankers and they all hang with us
Grabbed Betty by the arm, told her man, ""Stay in touch""
We takin this one all the way from Athens to Virginia
Hit Timmy for a hundred - that's the last one I'ma lend ya
Ol' girl want to kick it but she not on my agenda
Did I ever love her? Well, not that I remember
Twerk that, work that, Betty where your purse at?
Snatch daddy's credit cards, here take his shirt back
Where the hell my car at, does anybody know?
If it ain't back in five, everybody gotta go
Ah to hell with it, y'all keep that little Honda
I'm waitin on some Beams from this bitch named Yolanda

But momma always said if you don't love it then get rid of it
Besides, I got thirty dogs waitin in the yard
They gotta eat too girl, don't make it hard
I'm kinda difficult to understand at first contact
Offered you a beer, don't be expectin much beyond that
Aww shit, y'all quit, I'm winnin
Drownin in a pool of alcohol and I'm swimmin
You want to play with me but can't last nine innings
Since you want to chase, what you like, lime, lemon?
I'll make an open challenge tot his whole industry
We can do it with tequila, bourbon gin or Hennessy
Have you butt naked pukin in a purple limousine

Stop bein hard, baby girl I give plenty
I seem like a prick cause I got some shit in me

Then I grab the tool and take your jewels
And I'ma watch this blew the same as Jigga's
It ain't the liquor I'm really sick, smokin' Shwag eatin Crystal chicks
On a rollercoaster with Bo and Kosha
Can't even fuck witch'all pencil dicks
Ain't this some shit?

Which one of us gon' snatch your bitch
And leave you strokin' all by yourself
Understand this Bubba Sparxxx, S-P-A-are-triple X
I sprinkle soul in your pussy hole 
And put some coal on your nipple and neck
Tell your man, if he flex it's gettin drastic, legend has it
I know this mob spell G-A and with no delay they'll let him have it
It's just a habit, reppin' Athens and LaGrange, it's in my veins
I'm mixin Beam with Coke and (?), and every time it's still just the same
I tend to aim towards spittin' thangs, it's classical so masterful

Drink Bourbon in a cup, if it's bumpin' turn it up

Drop that liquid on yo' tongue, put that reefer in your lungs

Step in the club it's on
Nevertheless gonna find the somebody I could sip on
A seat with a view in the V.I.P., and got two tight things to grip on
A bag of trees to put my lip on - gotta cut it, roll it, light it, pass
And me and Bubba gettin' crunk in the club 
With a tape full of Bud in a champagne glass
Puttin' it down for the B.C., in the backwoods where we be
Better call a producer when you see me
And get your ass right back in the GT
Y'all lame boys, hangin up lookin' just for a name boy
Goin upsize with the Game Boy
Witcho' mind right go out lookin' for a cane boy, it's a shame boy
You the main one tryna stall right, sold the broads out the game boy
I beat 'em down like chop chop chop
Yessuh, cut 'em up and leave 'em alone
On my cell phone they callin', talkin' 'bout ""Kosha baby, call me""
Leave your name and your number at the sound of the beep
And I'll get back witcha shawty
Most hated by baby daddies for breakin' up happy homes
When the men is on and she don't say no then that mean she wanna bone
So partna don't get me wrong, I'm just bein Kosha
That Southern playa with a stroke that keep 'em wet like a ocean
Yessuh, me and Bubba get rowdy (rowdy)
And me and Bubba get bout it (bout it)

Maybe buy a little liquor I spend some talk in the mirror
This the playa from the soul; love to gang up on hoes
I'm tryna let this pimp shit go cause I don't even like it no mo'
See these niggaz that I hang with they just run through these skanks
Talk about 'em over dinner, pass women like dank

I stand true to high live, this a quest for a mil'
It done took a nigga different places, seen plenty of faces
Whatever may have been the cases I thank God for his graces
See my knife'll tell the fakers, kept me spinnin' like breakers

Am I versatile? Probably the best y'all heard in a while

Don't y'all love when I talk? How I sell it the way it was bought

Problem solved, stir and call the food court in the mall

Help me y'all, if her closet is too small
for some domino drawers or a piece of her, bra
I would reckon that one of her damn digits is off

Shit and I ain't slept, in a month of Sundays
Still I'm wide awake as we coast out on the runway

And now the captain says I'm number one for take off
But Timmy I'm too weak all this starvin' led to weight loss

Fear turns to adrenaline as life accelerates
I'm headed to my destiny, how long you guess it takes, to get there?

The in flight movie today is ""Gladiator""
But I can't afford the headphones, it's cool, I'll catch it later

Yet we all agree a safe flight is what we need most

Hey stewardess, I can't handle all this turbulence
The ride's gettin' bumpy and that shit don't help my nervousness

Now they fin' to serve the meal, I think I'll go with steak

You can shake for dem but bet that you don't profit none
I got a coochie fart fetish, baby pop me one
While you by the bar I grab your boy a shot of rum
I'm the shit to the point you gotta stop I got the runs
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Why they all on Timmy?
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Ten grand is all they give me
Still got a grand left, can I let my hand rest
right there on your damn chest, fondlin your tan breast
I might just snap back and cuss a broad
But this bitch is truly blessed so I must applaud
In and out of every club in less than a hour
Sprinkle on a little Pervis like I'm fresh out the shower
Ohhhh! And rest assured Timmy runnin with Bubba
We gettin slurped by two sluts right in front of each other
And we'll probably do the same thang next Monday evening
I gotta ride this Bentley home cause Timmy's out so we leavin, now

Thank you Timmy, I don't mind yo' sloppy seconds

Uh-huh, uh-huh
That fish, that money, Bubba Sparxxx..
Uhh

Now allow me to present the very first resident
of this millennium mindframe, no angel but heaven-sent
So make a print on this landscape and when it's little as a handshake
I convince you to think of Bubba as yo' brother the color of mayonnaise
We lockin up these airwaves from LaGrange to that staircase
and your projects up in Queens with no budgets nothin but dreams
I consume me a couple of Beams now I'm feelin like life is wonderful
Got me seein past the lies that otherwise make me uncomfortable
I'm peepin out this jungle full of snakes, tigers and elephants
All huntin the same prey but the chase got them all negligent
And Betty looks so elegent but our motive's dirty like sediments
It takes more to make Bubba sway to slick talk at handsome measurements
Fuck it I'm turnin celibate - nah, I'm only playin
If yo' lady listenin now, takin her on home but she stayin
I bet y'all think he playin when he tellin y'all he the first
whutchacallit, alcoholic, with that 32-gallon thrist

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
Who was the first whutchacallit?  Actin foolish at yo' function
The first whutchacallit - tryin out yo' daughter's suction
The first whutchacallit - lookin clean and still stankin
The first whutchacallit - in your head has gotcha thinkin
I'm the first whutchacallit - spinnin frequent in yo' city
The first whutchacallit - every weekend gettin shitty
The first whutchacallit - ridin chrome just because
I'm the first whutchacallit - with some nuts all in my drawers

[Bubba Sparxxx]
You probably saw me out in Kaia lit pushin up on Mya
When the vibe ask her why I bet she say that I'm a liar
But I feel like I'm that fire and these bitches share that sentiment
My project's in the woods scarin like the Blair Witch with
Flippin it, from one roll to another head then cut her 
in the back, another knack, now picture that with out a rubber
Out the cutter twistin green, listenin to what you seen
That slick shit you spit get nada, not a fuckin thing
Fuckin Queens small time but mostly it's just bear holes
and assholes with Aloe but I guess you know how that goes
I'm shallow for now, but wait a second, it gets deeper
I'm through cryin over her cause after this shit I want neither
I'm off the meter totin heaters cause you showed me that's the sensity
A country Caucasoid talkin noise cause it's my destiny
What you thought it was ain't nothin like what it is
From the swats up to your neck, got every cent bumpin in

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Hey man forgive me if the thought of Bubba woke you from yo' sleep
But next time, get that phlegm up out your throat before you speak
Why won't you just compete instead of mumblin petty shit?
Or let me visit witcho' gul to see how wet that Betty get
Very sick how I spit, next let's hit the next millennium
I'm fuckin with the best, then I kill the rest, I pity 'em
Oh Bubba K's the silly one - hmm, that Sparxxx my interest
We lose so many units that the fuckin charts exempt us
For me to guard is endless, got me tryna get some ice
So I can see the pray to Christ, cause right now I'm hatin life
I won't never take advice so let me be to find myself
And even though I can't see I beg you Lord for helpin well
And whoever else that felt my plight, I hope you take flight
The flaws, snappin jaws, no applause, exit stage right
From daylight to the day gone if you ain't wrong stay strong
And show these fuckin faggots seven figures they can hate on

[Chorus]

  Whutchacallit, get yo' ass up, get yo' ass up, get yo' ass up
  Get yo' ass up, get yo' ass up, get yo' ass up boy, get yo' ass up

[Intro]
Hey Betty Betty, hush your mouth, let me tell you something
Hey Betty Betty, this Bubba K, the one your boyfriend bumpin'
He Betty Betty, understand, see I ain't got no patience
Hey Betty Betty, get in the truck, lets crank up these relations

I left yesterday, and I headed straight, up 78, to the A-T-L
These record sales done paid me well, so I'm smoking good, cant you smell?
Life is hell, till you drop a gem, now Bubba got hoes, jocking him
Not cuz he cute, cuz he got that loot, wear polo suits, and that's hot to them
I see your ass, over at the bar, try your best to fill up that bra
A double-D, sippin' bubbl-y and you'd give your life just to fuck with me
Reluctantly I walk on by, I'm not gon' lie, that Betty fine
But I got to drank, cant even thank, unless I'm tanked, I'm already high
So let it fly, miss Kimberly, I can see right now you into me
Im'a holla at you bout 10 till 3, tryin' to switch from Beam to Hennessey
But you know I cant, so give me Jimmy
And sit right down till the bottles empty
Then we cut, but now shut up, old stupid slut, I stated simply
4 AM, we back in Athens, rollin' balls, and the bitch is laughin'
Chalk the first one, up to rappin'
I waited years, but tonight it happen

[CHORUS]
Hey Betty Betty, hush your mouth, let me tell you something
Hey Betty Betty, this Bubba K, the one your boyfriend bumpin
Hey Betty Betty, understand, see I ain't got no patience
Hey Betty Betty, get in the truck, lets crank up these relations
Hey Betty Betty, I'm tryin' to see if you adventurous
Hey Betty Betty, I only mess with 9's and 10's and up
Hey Betty Betty, you got some things, I'd love to photograph
Hey Betty Betty, you heard a while, but you don't know the half

I missed you Betty, since I last, saw your ass at the Polo Club
What's the matter, cant show no love?
I guess you here bout them photos of, you and me on the internet
Get over there, we ain't finished yet
I got a new, cam-er-a, miss Pam-el-a, and I'm fin to let
Bobby introduce you to the helicopter, and when he through
I bet its clear, why crackers here, ain't trying to hear, another word from you
I'm certain to, attract a virus, cuz using rubbers, don't excite us
If you ain't cutting, don't invite us, and I wont return, if you stole the nighters
Don't deny us, we them boys, talkin' bout you sing with a pretty voice
Just to fuck, and now your buck, all in my face, you made a shitty choice
I get it moist every time I touch it, freaky deaky all out in public
And guess where Mr. Sparxxx erupted?
In her grill, but still, she loved it

[CHORUS]

Now you might see me, ridin' 'Lac, with Rodney Black, on a coochie chase
Or you might catch me with chunky Shan, at some slightly tan, white groupie's place
Then booty shake, Betty's got, a special spot in Bubbas heart
Puttin' cheese to her college degree, but a lot of fleas shake it up for free
If it was up to me, you'd be with me, sippin' Beam, ridin' in between
Lagrange and Athens, if you love me, engrave my name on your nipple ring
I'm spiffy clean, when it comes to females, sex with me only ups your resale
Blazin' quarters, up to ounces, keep the dimes, they done nixed the Sprewell
How that weed smell? Oh I know it, that's how these Georgia crackers grow it
You getting high to every time you blow it, if you feelin' freaky, why won't you show it?
I don't mind, Shan don't mind, Jed don't mind, WE don't mind
But if u scared, get on from here, cuz frankly dear, we don't need your kind

[CHORUS]
",Betty-Betty,2001
Bubba Sparxxx,"Okay
If you shed blood with me to this point, you deserve an explanation
For all the hell you've endured, while helping me reach my destination
And this effort to bless the nation
I've might had did more harm than good
But I've always showed you heart, this is just my but apart from would
Man I love the darkest hood
But also the brightest suburb
To think I would just despise the folks because I'm broke and white it's absurd
I'm told be tight you get heard, but I don't hear my vinyl spinning
Yeah we found some distribution, but bet the crying is just beginning
'Cause these bright nights, could lead to dark days and vice versa
Even if Greg Street don't play, I guarantee you a nice purchase
Frankly, I'm quite certain I'm the livest fucker out there
I'm making love to the truth, inside that vocal booth without care
I won't even talk about stares
From angry illogical rappers
'Cause every time they get confronted, they'll give you head than dap ya
This one don't really need a hook, but Shannon said it'll be a single
So I devote this to my life, so much more than a catch of a jiggle

[Chorus]
Dark days, bright nights
For that outside in the night, you know what Bubba's life is like
Bright nights, dark days
For them broads that truly love me and hate to see me live this way
Dark days, bright nights
For when they say you can't live, fuck 'em, do it just out of spite
Bright nights, dark days
For every person without a voice that got something they need to say

See it's imperative that you know, there's a lot of folks that love Bubba
Not 'cause of any rap I wrote, they see something above gutter
Though, my pockets don't reflect that
It's my vision, and they respect that
Love comes in a form of a various drug, and I can't neglect that
So me and my folks get fucked up like six nights out of seven
That's the bright light of our lives
Like God's shinning light right out of Heaven
But at the conclusion of every session
I wish that Dark Day to expose
The plight of my situation, no blow, no dough for big shows
But still they see we this close from seeing the promise land
So that leads to another bright night, when all of us is college grads
Being loved by the moms and dads
Which some of us wasn't blessed with
You think we all born with two lovin' parents and a treasure chest
Shit, I was fortunate to be loved, by my paternal units
I'm gonna make their son a winner, fuck how bad it'll hurt I'm doing it
Even if I was to ruin it
Never with me and my heart part ways
We developed too strong of a bond, turning bright nights into dark days

[Chorus]

Yeah it's true, I also do get praise from the other side of the tracks
You know, that dark days part of town, when they intentionally hide the blacks
Ain't got no reply to that, I said I'm sorry if I'm to blame
I tried like hell to sooth your soul by planting the facts inside your brain
I never once lied to the game, the acceptance of not one black dude
It's just Bubba that country fucker smoking sages and eating snack foods
Now every time they ask you, why you live the way you choose to
Say 'cause Bubba set you right, the only one they loved, knew you
That leaves you with no excuse to settle with what they offer
He try to pay you the slave wagers, play that role, and tell 'em nah, sir
I'll probably won't even fault you dismiss me as the demon
It is true, I am not you, my skin's the tone of piss and semen
But if we fight this evening, I assure you, we'll both bleed red
And it'll take your whole slum and all your guns to leave me dead
Plus all that blood we shed what do nothin' but server their purpose
So let's unite these bright nights and dark days, then see who nervous

Bubba Sparxxx,"Back in the day he was outta control
Need another standoff but his music ate y'all
That's when me and fat Steve got that handle of beam
Drank that motherfuckin' drive, started chasin' these dreams
Then a tram pulled up bumpin' Player's Ball
We soaked up the game, fish grits and all
And now look what the south done let up out they mouth
Country ass, Bubba Sparxxx, and I ain't fin to cut it out

Buckle up, look daddy, cause Bubba K come to play
All these crackers livin' good, that ain't what my stomach say
Every slutty you-G-A who daddy pay they way
Wanted me to stay and play, well Betty gotta pay to lay
I really hate to say you can't elevate to this
But if I settle for your level I ain't never make the hits
Me and ? tight as shit on the demo, fore we send it
And I'm tryna fuck these tits on this bimbo fore I end it
See I'm off balance, and I just bought a half a gallon
Of Jim Beam cause it seems to cultivate this talent
That I got in my hot, why don't you ask the slums
Or them folks who get they crumbs using microphones and drums
Or go to where I'm from, in LaGrange for a change
But be careful, it gets muddy, get a stain on your range
The shame made you change, you could look me eye to eye
Cause Bubba got that fire, tell the truth, you like it, aye

I'm touchin' down off the loot, with Jen and a group
Of jazzy little females to buy, cut and resell
Oh we hell, like prerogatory gone sour
And it's got me eating ? every hour on the hour
I'm pissin' in the shower cause my toilet's overflowin'
Then I hit ghetto ?, I know he got that ? blowin'
Look my toes is showin' through these four year old Brooke's
Bubba actin' shady, got my ex old lady shook
She know that I'm a crook by the chances that I took
So it's normal buyin' Polo's to enhance the way I look
But I won't close the book cause this stress killed us both
Then meet me at the Grammys with the scissors and the roach
I'm ? on the coach like Sean Paul and J-Bo
My Bloodz awful Young though, I'm using drugs to halo
Ain't no way in hell I'm a fail now

Country ass, Bubba Sparxxx, and I ain't fin to cut it out

You see I can't sang a lick but I rap till I'm outta spit
And I heard your girl remark how Bubba is hot as shit
So now I got the hit but make no mistake, I break
As soon as she make me shake, just in time for y'all day to day
I break the ? today if I'm longer than Mr. Black
Scott ? had a half of home grown, and we twistin' that
Now Athens up on the map, you could hate me or give me dap
But I was a part of that, drankin' miller straight out the tap
And I'm strapped with thirty ? and a sheet of that jelly-jelly
With them Rucker boys and ? pushin' the heavy chevy
Lookin' for Betty-Betty's just talkin' bout cutty-cutty
Bring your sister, your niece and especially your study buddy
And Bubba a lovey-dovey wit y'all two at a time
Fuck these lames in this game, seeming too mad to shine
Man, be glad you rhyme, ? and we stay good
And when Bubba's holdin' fort, make sure you listen good

Shit, you couldn't relate to Bubba K if we shared the same blood
That's why I keep you guessin like manics change up
Flame up for my peers who done walk with me for years
Through this pissiness then rain, we gon be ballin when it clears
In the mall workin the seers tryin to get my ? to ?
I swore to tell the truth, though it may offend them itty-bitty weak-minded crabs

Fuck that money in your safe, I want them munchies off the top
Folk that's hungry off this block and they countin on me to feed em
Got a car load of chickens and we bout to go home and eat em
I'm cravin everything from cabbage chips to cheese
'cause it's that feeling in my stomach got me takin trips for keys
From Athens to Belize, whatever for my nutrition
I'll even turn cannibal if it takes that for you to live

Now tell me how y'all expect to eat if y'all boys ain't hungry
How you figure you gon straighten the beef if y'all boys ain't hungry

I'm eatin lettuce and ? nuggets and just ? that take turn
It's that flake that hate burn
Live by y'all who can't learn
Why it hurts to see them with them platinum plates they ain't earn
I'm lickin this cool whip munchin on a few chips
Fittin a snack on this broad I thought I'd never fool with
Duddy the chef throw out that kick, heat up that snare
Season that tip, I rhymin with a reason to spit
We leavin the shit financially and physically slick
You'll never see me undernourished 'cause I'm lyrically fit
Like grillin this shit when it comes to verses of hunger
I'm rappin this for happiness and polo shirts for the summer, yeah
It hurts me to wonder if you can me can leave with each other
You might not like my cookin now but I'm gon teach you to love it
I speak to you in public, the pride, the salory calories
I don't know when your turn gon come
But it have to be after me

How you figure you gon straighten the beef if y'all boys ain't hungry (ah, ah, ah)

They say that country folk can't do it but we will 'cause we hungry (yeah, yeah)

I got a tape full of songs, wylin with five ones
Waitin on the deal to come 'cause my plate full of crumbs
It's so hard through them bright nights sleep on dark days
And these crackers livin good that ain't what my stomach say

Waitin on the deal to come 'cause my plate full of crumbs
It's so hard through them bright nights sleep on dark days

And every meal I ate consisted of some bread and cheese
I'm bet to believe y'all ain't scared to eat after me
But if you don't want what's left of this, well then feed after me
You want me to leave the charts toward this buffet then just say
Bubba it's feedin time and I'll sharpen these teeth of mine
And devour this filthy slop that they fed us from the start

Hahahahahahah!  Don't be scared of me
Come on over here and let Bubba infect you
Uhh, uhh

From the slums the East of Athens to the plains in North LaGrange
Bubba K can stumble drunk up on any porch I hang
Smokin all sources dank - from Jimmy Shwagger to Cambud
And I'm chasin Jim Beam, we keep stallin until my time's up
Line up lames it's time for your vaccination
Be glad you been infected, accept it, congratulations
I got platinum asperations but fear's my motivation
I'ma wait in my time to shine but daily I grow impatient
Strictly for procreation, I need to plant my seeds
Since these bitches won't cut I'll rely on my hand to breathe
Fuckin this Cantonese, Betty named Tamberly
and her four older sisters 'til the blisters began to bleed
They probably'll banish me for spittin in how I'm live it
But I'm still with my tongue out - flickin it like a lizard
Bubba like chicken gizzards; fried in Southern pride
Man go on and drink dat beer but you know I'ma funnel mine

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
Now you could shoot it in yo' veins or shoot it up straight to yo' brain
You could smoke it out a bowl or get a blunt and roll it swole
Lo and behold boy you should've done injected
Cause if you ride with me I'ma get you so infected
Now you could hit that Betty raw or bust a load off in her jaw
You could place it where she doo doo, or even lick her poo doo
See I don't care what you do, just don't leave her neglected
Cause if you fall asleep I'ma get her so infected!

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I just got off the phone with God, he said - I know this might seem odd
But Bubba I really need you, these preachers ain't doin they job
So travel to Cape Cod, buy a thousand sheets of acid
and distribute it witcho' album, no doubt that'll be a classic
Dude lockin up every fashion, whether it's dope from weed to coke
from heroin to X, so next we needin a boat
Off the coast of eastern Georgia for two hundred keys of snort
For them heavy reefer chiefers, the five was trees to blow
They count on me fo' sho', if you fronted I'm goin the low
Man I'm from who did it though, but it's funny, cause no one sold it
But now that Bubba hold it I'm certain they gon' disperse it
The rural parts the suburbs, I know that may seem absurd
But long ago when I heard they meet the urban people
They play by ears for years now my folks deserve some equal
Affection from this infection that gives our foundation
The same blood the same drugs equals a proud nation

Shit I probably know what you thankin when yo' legs get wobbly drankin
(Bubba K got it hard!)  That's when they found yo' body stankin
And you won't be body linkin, what you thought I was from N'Sync?
I'm a country muh'fucker who ain't changed my clothes in six weeks
Runnin with a thick fleet, of hungry Caucasoids
The type when you see us in the club actin up y'all avoid
Call your boys I got boys from Westpoint to Nelly be	
Yeah I run with black folks too and they do carry heat
Plus I fuck with smelly freaks and I think they pussy very sweet
The fine Betty Betty with double D's and sexy feet
On coke or ecstasy, down here we call 'em Beanie Babies
She was sensitive to the touch so when we fuck I mean it's gravy
but I ain't seen her lately - I been too busy chasin patients
We gon' shoot a movie next just so yo' ass can play the hatin
If the livest in yo' faction tellin me where the mic's at
He won't never rap again and he might not ever get his pride back

Or even explore, but I die

And explosion of introspect so quiet,

Into the sins lounges into the most tempered thug,

Made it this far, but I still can't escape now, 
Law ran in, back in the A town, 
And all I'm worth is all that ain't found, 
My brother in Denver used to do a lil dirt, 
Maybe move with him, I can do a lil' work, can't produce a walk, 
I do a lil smirk, shop at Wal-Mart, I do shoes and a shirt, 
Tried to call mama, she denied the call, 
She ain't smoke the shit I provide for y'all
Try to doze of with PM Tylenol, just move a lil piece, can't smile it off, 

Y'all ain't free, Not yet free, 
Not yet free, Not yet free

Continuing my voyage, in the Colorado, 
Can't live life with my Doraldo,
This pill is hard for you to swallow, 
This pig shit in which for you to wallow, 
I'm posted up here, at least until tomorrow, 
Get a pound of Buffalo Nik's that you can swallow
Only thing I'm holdin' is pain, 
You can borrow, a whole pocket of change,
For your sorrow, Lotta Kat'z busted, but they can't find the hop, 
That hustlin' game gotta stop, 
On the open road, now is not the time to flock,
The buzz is formulating, 
Now it the time for Jimmy time to drop",Intro,2001
Bubba Sparxxx,"{C.I.}
Yeah, ha (B.K.) C.I. (okay?)
Yo

You ever rolled up in a convenience store with a forty-four
and told the cashier to drop to the floor?
But you didn't take anything but a bag of chips
a half gallon of milk, some juice, and a box of grits?

{Bubba}
Nah but I might walk up in Kroger, head straight for the DVD's
Stuff 'bout four of 'em in my cargo, smile and flee with ease
Then hit up the Super Target, exchange 'em for store credit
That's sixty dollars worth of grub, some squares and a case of Bud

{C.I.}
Yo.. yo you ever invested your money in some internet stock?
Seen how your cheese multiply quicker than sellin rocks?

{Bubba}
I invest in pharmaceuticals like Xanax and Loritabs
Take 'em all with alcohol, then hunt for some more to grab

{C.I.}
Yo.. you ever had a chick with no brains, but liked to give 'em
that had the nerve to ask you to scream her name while you hit it?

{Bubba}
Haha.. nah but I know this Betty who licks ass for her enjoyment
She also takes golden showers and drinks the piss from out my toilet
And when it's time for the deployment of doo-doo from out my anus
She likes to catch it in her hands and lick the excess from her fingers

{C.I.}
Yo, you ever tried to purchase a car with a personal check?
Have your lady call you a dog, and send you to the vet?
Ever been in trouble with the cops, for more than three times
from tryin to sell digital video cameras to the blind?

{Bubba}
Mannnn fuck purchasin a car, I live on ""New Jersey Drive""
Athens Georgia, three-oh-six-oh-five, that ain't no lie
And my girl don't even speak cause I get violent when I drink
But it's perfect cause she don't talk, I need some silence when I think
about the thirty-three times the law tangled me up
With chunky tray, legs up, stuck, thinkin we fuck
Well screw 'em they ain't enough to stop these Sparxxx from flyin
If Bubba ain't the truth that just mean that my heart is lyin

{Chorus: repeat 2X}
No matter what you ask me, I'm givin you Bubba Kay
Just the truth of the matter okay? Fuck what you say
Nuttin more nuttin less, I'ma get it off my chest
C.I., spit what I feel, regardless

{Bubba}
Would you rather move two thousand units and be critically acclaimed
or sell two million out the gate and be labelled lyrically lame?
In other words, would you prefer to have dem mics in The Source
or a Grammy, some jazzy broads, a little ice and a Porsche?

{C.I.}
I ain't gon' lie, I'm tryin to sell three million out the gate (okay)
And get six mics in The Source off of lyrical force
And push a custom made Porsche and a Range with the woodgrain
And spit verses sharp enough to cut straight to your brain

{Bubba}
Well, you ever fucked a chunky broad, weighin three hundred plus up
and actually took some pride to the shit, and didn't rush none?

{C.I.}
Yo.. when it comes to big chicks, C.I. plead the fifth
Cause I only weigh a buck-fifty and I don't own a forklift

{Bubba}
Man have you ever snorted coke 'til your heart sat in your throat
then took your whole advance to buy more, and woke up broke?

{C.I.}
Yo.. C.I. don't do drugs, I hang out with corporate thugs
that transport microchips and oriental rugs
Then sell 'em on the streets for as much as they can
The only Coke I mess with comes in sixteen ounce cans

{Bubba}
But would ever consider dancin with the devil for paper?
Fly with me and Fred Durst on an embezzlement caper?
Would you bet on the Lakers if Jordan played for the Clippers
or leave yo' girl and move to Vegas with a STABLE of strippers?

{C.I.}
Yo.. I wouldn't dance with the devil, the stocks are too hot
And if Jordan played for the Clippers I'd claim Cali like 'Pac
And I'm not into embezzlement, I like hostile takeovers
Corporate jets, BMW's and Range Rovers
cause they're tax writeoffs, they're all business expenses
And as far as that stripper, yo I let my man hit her (man c'mon)
see to the I, Central Intelligence
And if I did touch her believe me you wouldn't find a trace of evidence

{Chorus - repeat 2X}

{Bubba Sparxxx}
Yeah (C.I., and Bubba Sparxx, nonsense)
I think in conclusion, it could be said
That no matter where the fuck I'm at
No matter who the fuck I'm around
I'ma do what the fuck +I+ do
Ride walk leave it or love it I don't give a fuck
Now I fucks with a motherfucker like C.I.
'til we both bleed 'til we can't bleed no more
just cause I know he'll do that same type of shit
The East, the West, don't forget about the South
Don't forget about the motherfuckin South

y'all know what the fuck it is.. (?) bitch",Regardless,2001
Bubba Sparxxx,"{Duddy Ken}
Now truthfully, I believe that I'm the tightest nigga musically
Usually I wouldn't brag but I've been bustin since my puberty
In a Cadillac that ride with five guls and they nudity
You can bring yo' best words, I bet I still outrep you brutally
Low down dirty and beautiful, who want to test my verbal side?
Boy I'm fly-n-tie(?), especially when I let that herbal fly
Southern fried, cool kid, some of that country culture
Leave you dead, peep your bread, a value meal for them busters

{Bubba Sparxxx}
Shit I'm steppin off in the tunnel with a funnel of Keystone
Ate a ten-strip of blotter, been wiggin all week long
y'all keep on, with that jibbery jabbery slippin out happily
Expose you pretty hoes with a dose of this hospitality
Gravity in yo' trunk while yo' producers forgot the bump
We introduce you to these high hats like that, yo' spot is krunk
This blunt, I put the fire to, I really do admire you
But even though Bubba dirty, he certainly fin' to shine too

{Chorus: Duddy Ken}
I hope you can swim if you want to battle
You're up shit creek without a paddle
Whatcha gon' do now, grab my pen and slaughter
Bubba Ken and Duddy Ken, take'm to the water
I hope you can swim if you want to battle
You're up shit creek without a paddle
y'all ain't ready (y'all ain't ready)
y'all ain't ready - take'm to the water

{Bubba Sparxxx}
See momma named me lil' devil, that ain't no relation to Satan
Ain't got no patience for hatin, I'll be at the station awaitin
the arrival of that DJ that don't replay unless we pay
I stormed the beach like D-Day, now that bitch play, when we say
I'm with D.K., ain't no N.Y., and we been fly, since gin (?)
Sips bourbon with a twist, Bubba lurkin in your midst
Without my dick perverted this cause y'all was smellin vaginal
Been bumped wrong, one too many times for actin rational

{Duddy Ken}
D.K. I bomb folks, man I throw heat like I was John Smokes
But mine from a gun though, change yo' name to John Doe
Shit, have your whole family Mourning like Alonzo
Then go back to my condo, so I can let my kind grow
Is you blind folk? Why you can't see bigger thangs?
Don't rup on this stage, cause ain't no bitch-ass nigga mayn
And my mob ain't either, don't make me have to play a song
with my lil' chrome heater, bet that and (?) punk nigga
Now get it get it crunk, like jumpoffs, B.K. they trippin
I'm fin' to go on and take one of they lumps off, cause I ain't slippin
Just hippin you to this real shit, so get in where you fit
Sittin on lean, off that Jim Beam, fin' to throw a fit
From A.T.H. to Atlanta, Louisiana, Savannah
Sippin gin and Tropicana while Georgia play Alabama
Might stumble over a freestyle and pick up like a scanner
Turn the mics off lost, somebody call the light boss

::Chorus::

{Bubba Sparxxx}
Aww shit
Boy I'm out here chasin daddy lucid, shit Satan produced it
Switched from duce-duces to substance abuse nuisance
Fuckin these loose gooses, raw dick, we all sick
I'm goin skinny dippin after y'all hit (aww shit)
That country fuckin Bubba hit his head and lost his mind
Eight grand for a Roley? That only just bought you time
I'm in line waitin to grind, it's too cloudy for me to shine
I'ma keep this bitch krunk, get rowdy, while you recline
And in time, I'ma jump this fuckin ship, and run and get
my crown in every town, I lay it down, when I spit
This shit, is so much more than white folks and white thangs
or black folks and black thangs, just bounce if the track bangs
You lack game, Bubba got that shit goin two for fifty
Communicatin cool with them country folk, strictly
Just hit me, on the beep, whenever, cause I don't sleep
Two thousand, every week, take a peep, before you leap

{Chorus - repeat 2X}",Take'm to the Water,2001
Bubba Sparxxx,"[Intro]
Let that water cleanse yo' mind
Feel it tricklin down yo' spine
It's all about the wills and won'ts, do's and don'ts
and the price they'll pay to shine

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Now I done came a ways up this long road
In spite of the lies that y'all told
Believe me these folks is all cold
From the Polo Club to Paul doe
They all know Bubba ya boy who cut her without a rubber
But you couldn't look past my skin
So me and Ken wrote about the water
Now it's true I babble on about blotter and tales of beanstalks
But peep it it ain't no secret I'm reachin beyond that cheap talk
Cause we fought battles and this water make yo' trunk rattle
So if it's beef you searchin fo' I run with poachers who hunt cattle
And it don't matter, if you crunk in the club, or drunk in the pub
Bring that notion to my ocean boy you sunk in a sub
I'm crumblin buds of homegrown, ponderin shit that's gone wrong
But fuck it it ain't productive to dwell on somethin that's lone gone
My dome's blown, from twenty plus years of experimentin
with whatever drug you pedalin, from acid coke to heroin
But lately I've been settlin for liquor and herbal treats
I want the money, the hoes, and the house on Myrtle Beach

[Chorus]
Let that water cleanse yo' mind
Feel it tricklin down yo' spine
It's all about the wills and won'ts, do's and don'ts
and the price they'll pay to shine
Let that water cleanse yo' mind
I pray it opens up your eyes
Cause can't nobody call, tomorrow at all
So we live for the present time

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Next time you in the A-T-L get on 85 South and travel
sixty miles to Legrange, but watch yo' chrome off on that gravel
Then mount your horse and saddle cause you in the country now
The birthplace of Bubba 'kay now leave before the sun is down
It's funny how you look at us as nothin more than crumbs of dust
that's scattered on your wall when just like y'all in guns we trust
Run with us for bout a week, let us teach you how to speak
with this jazzy rural grammar to get them hoes up out they seat
Bouncin beats all down the street out them Buicks on chrome'n'blades
And even though it's Christmas day we still eatin on foamy plates
Ain't nuttin, we gon' be straight whether you accept us or decline us
I ain't Baby, Shan ain't Mannie - but I still feel we +Big Tymers+
Them classics all designers, unforgiven and livin
like today is forever cause tomorrow is for the vision
Based on optimism and honestly I can't see it
I'ma crank it up tonight if tomorrow comes so be it

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Man I'm feelin day to day, on dope quotes
Ridin a boat that hope floats
With an entourage of po' folks
who smoke dope but don't cope
I swear to y'all I won't croak, before this dream is realized
No confederates in this settlement but trust me the South will rise
It ain't even about the rap shit, we already mastered that shit
All the water in this well's for country folks who never had shit
Did you know they closin down the only factory in this town?
But still you got the nerve to say it's plenty work to go around
I asked the Lord to hold me down 'til I find me some distribution
He kept me up for seven nights then finally hit me with this solution
As a result of this pollution it seems my water is now valued
at twenty dollars a jug, so yessir, we puttin it out soon
But in the form of loud tunes to soothe your troubled heart
What many call salvation is really just Bubba Sparxxx
So when I'm easin up them charts, say thank you cause this for y'all
Pay the price, live your life, and that money, get it all

[Chorus]

  If you need to bathe, then bathe
  And if you want to drink, come on and drink
  from this well

[Chorus]

.. Bubba Sparxxx, huh, Big Shan, J.J., Southwestern Clay
.. Collabo, two geezy, huh, y'all hurtin for this

Like 3 wheels and triple cheeseburgers ATL coastin (say no more!)
But the pimp is one of the coolest but I (pay no more)

With the flip-flops, and the silk socks and a Kangol to the tip top

It's not coincidental all the glass was kept clear
Who's worried his or her first shit it's freezing it here
The only heat is my piece to make it even at least
I'll go to work without even catching a crack in my crease
I guess the dubs out there do what they 'posed to do

True artists go it out
What's in they heart they spit it out
I play my part and get about
What God commissioned me to do
And the fact that that's my co's
Got me pissy in this booth
See it's tricky with the truth
Cause everybody got they own take
I'm a give it how I live it
Till my blood, sweat and bones ache
Watch me bake my own cake
Money mixed with purpose
As long as the hooks made it
All these fick official purchase
Whatever Bubba cast out
I pray to him that that's clout
Cause if it's not I'm in the gap
Spittin' hot but ass out
And this will be my last bout
In the ring with the demon
Cause my belly don't stay full
When I sing just for dreaming
And my team's just a clinging
Feemin for my arrival
So everytime I spit
I'm bringin' it for survival
Thinkin' I might be able
To fold at any minute
So if you got some silver
Throw in some pennies with it

Take some for your enjoyment

The troops is rallied for deployment
In a war with twenty doggies
They probably won't bark
But they still bit yo ass
Tell Betty to get the cash
? you ? mommas
Get you back on dry land

As you raise your right hand
Have you ever wondered why
I don't approach you at a venue
Like honey where the beans
Like you know it's on the menu
Yeah I spoke to him too
He came to me the same
Told him naw but I'm looking
Now get away from me you lame

[Chorus]

Told several talkazoid
That don't toot but do shoot
Got two cousins in the grange
Hard like ? and loop ?
So push that woop woop
When you want a dirt road
'cause if you trying to shout
They make you whine like ?
And bet, I sure ?
Six blonds with big asses
In a ? of suction cups
Everytime I dick passin
Plus I got battallions
As simple than Nelly beats
So next time you out in Athens
Remember to yell at me
So I can page Duddy Ken
To give clearance for your appearance
Look at this loose sock
The spirit of my deliverance
So when that shit said
That we obviously gives a head
That's why I don't fuck wit why y'all
I'm just keepin to my present state

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme
Rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin'
Like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now
But it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer?
That sucks for you
Cause this is Bubba's moment
I put my mother on it
I said my momma
It seems as if
I love her don't it?
So buckle up, 'cause
It's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's
And my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk
Gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth
But ain't no joke inside
This is complicated
At least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million
Then I'll call it quits
But until that day
Y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw
You crank it 'cause
I just leap through you
What you need to do
Is just admit you love me
The South has
Always been Dirty
But now it's gettin' ugly

Ugly-in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get
Ugly, ugly, ugly
In here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
Uh-oh

Though I am country
Don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger
With every song I hear
Cause y'all been bullshittin'
Spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and
Came with somethin'
That truly matters
On goes the saga
Of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrah
If I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now
I hate it came to this
How else can I say it
I don't speak
No other languages
I'm fairly ripped now
So this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha?
That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem bows
Fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us
Will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose
Ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just
Forget what we discussin'
This that new South
Take a picture of me
Cause I'm a fuckin' legend
And this is gettin' ugly

Ugly-in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get
Ugly, ugly, ugly
In here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
Uh-oh

Now this thang is jumpin'
Ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special
This whole moment
Came from nothin'
Now you see it triples
I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets
Hatin' broads
Clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live
You with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then
Better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin'
Then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet
I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law
They can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done
Nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions
I wanna see you whylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight
Know he was smilin'

Ugly-in here

One.. Two.. One..Two..Three Lets GO..

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Back in the mud again, I confess, I'm so happy here
There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away

[Verse 1]
It's just that country boy, city slick
Hot boy, temperament
Add the pony, add the flame
Either way it's an event
If it's me consider it
Pardon the coincidence, even though they mumble at me
Suckers keep they distances
Father, Kay Hey
What's that they say
Hip hop redneck that's a safe place
Say what makes you comfortable
With me cause I like it here
How about a rural dwelling, urban music pioneer
Turn it up, let it bang
Run with me, I bet you can't
Took too much to make it float
Never will I let it sink
So we reinvented it
Boy are we generous
Hoping that my moment pass
I can see the end of it
25 years of life, I was born yesterday
Loving life, doing right, earning every breath I take
Standing in the mud again, cause it seems to pay me well
Playing with my not so distance cousins from the ATL AHHH.. 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ah Yea, Ah Yea
Press it up
Ship it out
Call the pony
Rent it out
Everything I Am today
Is what I've really what I've been about
Athens Georgia Resident
Native of Lagrange though
I don't love the Peach State, brothers say it ain't so
Naw, Sir, In Fact it's quite the opposite
Loving y'all from Brunswick, Up to the metropolis
Can't forget about my Betty Betty in the ?.
That put them triple X's at the end of Andy's Monica
How can I run from, everything that made me
Knowing all the love I get is appreciated greatly
Now witness something truly inconceivable
Bubba International, but still he kept it regional
Trying to make my momma proud
Ricky Lathens see me smile
Gotta make sure this next CD is the fire
Making sure everyone one of my talented associates gets what they deserve
Nothing short that's appropriate YEA!!!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Get your cup, fill it up
Soda don't appeal to us
But if your broke, do what you can't that alone still enough
Help us out if your rich, cause we about to pitch a bitch
Just stop by the store and grab a case of that, a six of this
Hey Betty get it ready, cause you daddys in route
Let her join the Beat Club, peep that lil trim out
Have her screaming new south, with out pulling loot out
He always wonder what you doing, let him wonder who now
At the end of the day, I will have no regrets
Got it done on every front, and I ain't even focused yet
At the bottom of the pond, swimming with them mud cats
If you dive in I'm perusing for a grudge match
Spell It out L-E-G-E-N-D, I still believe
What ever goal God set for me, indeed I will achieve
Either in this life, for in the next
Whether drinking Gin or Becks
Bubba fin, to bring it home, still you can send a check

I see you comin round the barn
I just can't think of anything that can
make me smile like you can

[Bubba Sparxxx - talking over Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
It's the era of the New South, yes sir
Sooner or later, one way or another

[Verse 1 - Bubba Sparxxx]
There's a portion of the south in the spirit of this song
Keep followin the fiddle, it'll never steer you wrong
I've lived a lot of life, so my innocence is blown
I'm headin to La Grange, to replenish it at home
I've been across the globe and I've seen the world's charm
I taught 'em my slang, I didn't mean the world harm
It makes the soul smile to see what I've accomplished
I got up out the woods without a map or a compass
Life does change and the sun does set
But my last breath ain't a one gust yet
As long as daddy knows that his son does sweat
The same as he did for that unjust check
I'll sleep fine and a child will come
With the same last name as my papa's son
And you can rest assure that my son will know
That his dada wasn't a one squeal show

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2 - Bubba Sparxxx]
One time for the New South's imminent progression
Thank the good lord so generous with blessings
Whenever it was needed he'd send me some direction
I'd gaze up in the sky and take a minute for reflection
Is it baby balls or a miniature erection
It makes you view change with degenerate dejection
Pay no nevermind to what the Senator's confessin
He don't really mean it, he just winnin his election
Nothin they can do to have prevented this obsession
With the vaccination of innocence infection
My heart is behind it if I hint it or suggest it
I finish with aggression but meant it with affection
To the common man at the end of his oppression
Welcome into church only meant for the collection
And the common woman, gender's no exception
Please keep providing with men in your reflection

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
There is no king for the throne I seat
All by myself, so alone I leap
For the young boy, daddy gone five weeks
He's only fourteen, but he's grown by me
Cause he keep the heat on and his little sister fed
With his knowledge of the land and the tools in the shed
He could be in school, but he chose this instead
No avenue he won't pursue for the bread
And who was there to speak for him but Bubba
He listens to his own, can't relate to none other
The product of a bad hand and a young mother
If daddy wasn't ready all it took was one rubber
To prevent the pain that his family done suffered
Thankfully his son is a real come upper
Cause it's gonna be somethin on the table come supper
There the plight of my people is uncovered

[Chorus] - 4X

Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutterbug
A horny little parasite that all the women love to love
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was

I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to
And another ? before my great aunt Missy
Yea, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy

Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about
He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good
Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could

I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy
Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me

Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally

An uncanny whit plus a time that is impeccable
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual
Confused them all at first so this time is understandable

Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now
Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown
Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds

And you certaintly can blame the jazziest persona
But it's classy broad that get trashy in the sauna
Bubba's just the slickest, how else is there to word it
I'll just plead my case, and then let y'all unveil the verdict

[Chorus]",My Tone,2003
Bubba Sparxxx,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
To all it was
All it is
And all it shall be
New South

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Uh, yeah, yeah [motherfuckers]
I gotta key Bubba answers, a kilo of questions
The heart for humility, that ego perplexes
Strength, will and honor, a hero's possessions
On the road to destiny I need no directions
Far to Southerners, the best man the winner
And only this morning does the best man remember
Fighters seen the weak, more success than inventors
And a saint never ever suffers less than a sinner
But I'm proud to admit that this shit no longer
Phases or amazes me, I only grow stronger
At any given moment this world can so long ya
Box you up, drop you in the dirt and slow song ya
So every blessed minute I'm breathin
I'm conceivin, for when I do perish, reasons for your grievin
That's not to say I plan on leavin here this evening
I'll be in Honolulu with Steven next season

[Chorus]
Dear God, left, right
Life will pass by
Breathe in, exhale
I scream, you yell
New South! (New South!)
New South! (New South!)
Ew, a ew, (break it down)
Ew, a ew (break it down)

[Duddy Ken]
And we gonna rush 'em with a blitz on this
Go round the world and hit every other upper scale and project brick with it
Bubba Sparxxx who meet with the Organized Godly beat
Man it's funny how God can be when you work hard to achieve
It's still slaw nigga (*vocal scratch*), spittin that Pac liquor
This is straight up pocket party, your summer that not nigga
classical rhymes got most cats tryna battle with Ken
Bet they won't ""go up shit creek without they paddle again""
Come down to my town, bet you won't visit Athens again
And I write that hard har, roll like I got crack in my pen
But since your so happy that things go exactly as planned
Don't clack if we land, then it's crack a lackin again
Then most of these clowns up outta the pay
All I need is a stout, clean your coolatta and day
And the day that I'm able to finally get outta the game
What this hip hop has become is what the New South gotta change
Bring it back

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
What difference does it make, who I'm affiliated with
Cause if you love 'em, how could you have really hated this
All the groundbreakin these hillbilly maders did
Wasn't no room for +Bubba Talk+ until we made it did
I flow for Jimmy Mathis on that bus route daily
And for momma June and all she fuss about lately
I'm a get it white, if your hairless for Governor
I'm tellin y'all the yanks ain't prepared for this southerner
see-Dub certified, DF, dignitary
Beat Club, they applaud, New South, visionary
In spite of the efforts y'all made to pigeon hole me
I rose from the pig shit without a smidgen on me
At 15, 90, Adam's drive makin miracles
For these many much, yes and everyday is pivotal
I'm no entertainer so what I say is literal
You say you ""New South"", faker tat it on your genitals

[Chorus - 2X]",New South,2003
Bubba Sparxxx,"Listen, first, you must travel, a long, desolate road
This road that you shall travel, will seem like nowhere.
That nowhere, will turn into somewhere
Keep your head up Bubba, don't let nobody get you down,
Cause that road you travel will turn around

I've accepted every challenge, and risen to all occasions
A country boy that's got his shit like Randy Moss and Jason
Perhaps some of these numerals don't fit in ya'lls equation
If your opinions coincide with that you oughta save â??em
Lookin' for the greatest Southern rapper, fuck it period
Negative spirits they only keeping down a myriad 
Of Satan's substances, and my systems' still my wisdom
It never once compromised that between God and I
Never once forgotten my manners
Cause my ma'ama played in public housin' in Alabama
But she had a diff'rent plan for me, russ and ginger
Thank the lord for Jimmy Mathis, pops he must remember us
Are you really down when those other clowns disappear
Taught me how to set the scope, shoot and leave with the deer
Man made me drink the blood, and showed me life was precious
The muddy road from nowhere to somewhere is my direction

[Chorus]
I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's like
I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's like

Can you relate five kids, six fish sticks on the plate
All writin' to Santa Claus, I guess he got the list too late
Or to catch the fish you bait the hook with lil' Dylan's poo-poo
On Mr. Allen's property, he catch you, he will shoot you
Let these cats amuse you with comical depictions
But where I'm from being broke is no honorable affliction
Love some Jimmy Carter, but we never even voted
But slum is still slum, so you best believe we told it
Every five armed from AK's to 30-30's
And from live watch to live stock they pays the early birdy
Thus we worked the land like you worked the block with yayo
But I choose keys over cattle cause the profits way more
But I might get locked away though peddling the sno cones
So we keep it simplified with papers of that homegrown
It's the finest shine that you can find on this side of Memphis
From east nowhere to west somewhere still the grind is endless

[Chorus]

It all comes down to this, one last chance to advance
Beyond the second round of the big dance, all my plans
Of being viewed as something special, more than just the other one
We'll vanish from the papers and the plague the South has suffered from
The world's weight plus a ton, restin' on my shoulders
But what's attractive, to ease my nerve, is blessed to the beholder
Cause Eminem's incredible, but did I really need to say this
For ya'll to leave my soul at rest and add me to your playlist
But this time I may just, leap and clear that hurdle man
Cause there's gonna be a million more, who knows if they'll be worth a damn
Bubba K, I surely am, with that silky kinda sound
Carson Daily host it out, I'll be early for this time around
Cause I've come to far for my own mistakes to quell me
Cause looking back at self improvement proves an aching ailment 
Cause nothing they can tell me will get me somewhere in a hurry
If I'm nowhere, then that nowhere will leave me no more need to worry",Nowhere,2003
Bubba Sparxxx,"(I hope we're tapin now)
Party people
It's the place to be
I come to bring to you

And that bitch got somethin to prove

What up Timmy

'Cause I will never turn and run (oh)
There's nothin I can't overcome (oh)

I'll just grind on and get it done (oh)

'Cause I will never turn and run (oh)
There's nothin I can't overcome (oh)
Let's these cats keep bumpin gums (oh)
I'll just get it done, just get it on

Enough with the yappin', just cut on the damn beat
Ain't no glory this week, in what was done last week
This shit ain't nothin' new, I was put on this earth to fail
I see the future now, my vision's just blurred as hell
I may never do a third of what I deserve to sell
But my story's all fact, not just what I prefer to tell
See we circled the wagons, me and Chevon Young
Timmy, Sebastian, and plus Petey Pablo
So sucker don't ask me, nothin' 'bout Beat Club
When the talk dies down, the music'll speak up
A lot of cats jump ship, you'll never see me run
You think we be cooled off, then ya under the heat come
I'm nearly focused dog, and that's a point of concern
Why you speakin' now? I ain't annoyed at your turn
It's Bubba K reborn, y'all have been prewarned
Every other dog with a plan I'm a sleep on

[Chorus]

You have no idea 'cause, all the road blocks I've steer clear of
Failure is all I live in fear of
Chose to compete with rap just outta sheer love
These people (these people) don't know me (don't know me)
These labels (these labels) won't hold me (won't hold me)
These lames ain't (these lames ain't) don't clone me (don't clone me)
Watch it move forward (oh), so boldly
I'm always for the streets, but baby not for the block
Came here for what I want, can't hate me for what I got (oh)
'Cause when I add it up, buddy it ain't a lot (oh)
I count on fast feet to be everything that I'm not (oh)
But put it all together, oh lord
Them two country boys, ain't no bum
No backseats taken, I told y'all
Swear for god I will (overcome)

[Chorus]

Take it how it is, or leave it as it be
If you don't like my shit, then beat it outta me (woo)
You think you that grown?, we can stop and see
Put bring the heat along, you'll need it probably
I never did claim to be the baddest so and so
But if you feel like you gotta have it, so it go
Are the rumors true? Girl had bad you want to know
But I require more than they've asked you for before
What heapless flirtin', just twerkin', and slick and slirpin'
A lot like my daddy for certain, a kid conversion
She may not want the log inserted, my pick is workin'
Ain't the longest dome, but its perfect to bring the hurtin'
And that's all he wrote (oh), should you just call me note (oh)
Sorry you just crossed the rope (oh) and it just ain't all you hoped (go head)
Daddy with me, I bet you had it with me
Betty help me with the hook and she come naturally

Bubba Sparxxx,"[Bubba Sparxxx - talking]
Uh huh, yeah
Good Lord
May God have mercy on my soul

[Verse 1 - Bubba Sparxxx]
I love her, but you never would know
That by the way I just let my girl go
With tears in her eyes from years of the lies
She backed on up and disappeared out the drive
Wait, hey, what can I say?
All we had means nothin today
I did my thing and she did hers
But my crimes are a wee bit worse
And now I'm sittin here all alone with my guilt
Just me and the dogs in the home that we built
It was Andy's and hers, even though Bubba bought it
But Bubba wouldn't leave just like her mother called it
from the pink, only to the blue blame
God forgive me for causin you pain
All it was, ain't no more
Cause my baby's gone and when it rains it pours

[Chorus]
She tried to tell me I needed to be strong
I wasn't listening and now my baby's gone

[Verse 2 - Bubba Sparxxx]
One for the pleasure, two for the sin
Three for the family we could a been
Had I not been so concerned
with this life, no spoken words
Could begin to undue what's done
Deep within I know that you must run
Far away, from the thought of my smile
And the broken dream of us walkin that aisle
I first saw +Betty+ in my Nanny White's yard
The breast where the best, and the fanny my lord
A fly country girl, just workin them gifts
She's my queen, was a virgin I guess
But I ain't never ask and I ain't never tell
But Betty had the cash every time I went to jail
And how did I reward her loyalty
Let her walk in and see her cousin Joy on me

[Chorus]

I ..
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
It's been six months and still no word
I try to carry on like it still don't hurt
Hoes come around but I still won't flirt
Drinking's worse and the pills don't work
Last I heard she was in Birmingham
Livin with a good hard workin man
And lookin back on it, that's exactly what she wanted
Not a rebel with a passion for the moment
I live for the fiddle and the kick in the snout
I take my love and I stick it in there
Moved a Jimmy and made this song
All because my baby's gone

Yeah I party dog, but not with them drugs that y'all like
Now where Prada, Hampton and that little fuss is all hype
I want what you want, and that's the busted bra type
Where I come from, white boys ain't lame dog
Honky and all that, the real ones ain't called
Don't pull no bullshit unless you playin' paintball

These country folks wouldn't have it, no other way
Cause I yell, but they ain't got nothin' else to say
And I got a heat warm and tugged away
Plus the beep, beep, Timmy keep heat
Him and Rick each, ain't no weak links
Guess I'm just different than whatever you sniffin'
Still the same language, this ain't hieroglyphics
Ask am I prolific? Yes sir indeed

See how I maneuver so effortlessly

Am I not the most uniquest person that you ever knew?
Walk up in the party, sanitation blurtin' with a brew
Bet ya this album does all the first one didn't do
Stop with the badgerin', can't you see I'm staggerin'?
All that you babblin', ain't even close to matterin'

I keep pushin looking for a lick to hit shit I need some cheese
Gotta go no sleepin for me momma I gotta leave
And if god is on my side then one day soon I'll get where I gotta be
I'm free ain't nothin gone stop me from seein what I gotta see
Not even me
The day I cop a ?? gone be the day that I can't even breathe
All the shit that I go through, if I could show you, you wouldn't believe
All I got is my Bible & me and this rifle my last name ain't Mavoe

Still I do not want what's yours unless it's rightfully mine

Cause I'm scrambling down the same road
Travelin in the same clothes 
Feelin 2 million days old can't let all this take hold
'cause see I always saw myself as just a little more special than
These sappy crappy no rappin whoever's collectin fans
I'm doin the best I can I just need a better plan
I still ain't in peace with flyin 'cause my plane has yet to land
I'm runnin & runnin my stomach's grumbling but I ain't
Hungry enough that I'm just disgusted because I can't
Ever make what I thank translate into what I say
Unless I pour this Vodka in that big cup & chug away
I want to just run away from what I've become today
A rebel with a warrant & his name is say Bubba K.

This is heart it ain't a verse pick yo fruit name yo curse
With all the pain that is life dyin hurts lyin's worse
Drive my Hearst down 85 to momma's house in LaGrange
Drop me off on the porch then send my off in a plane
Forget my name 'till God arrives to show all y'all what Bubba meant

Bubba Sparxxx,"[Chorus]
I've been travelin for some time {*echoes*}
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine {*echoes*}
On these long dark dusty roads {*echoes*}
Lookin there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay aaay

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I left out from mama's with my thumb in the wind
The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again
Solid on the surface as I crumble within
But legends are made out of vulnerable men
So on the brink of death I still manage livin life
Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice
I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price
No instructions when I was handed this device
But with what I did get, I was more than generous
Put others over self on several instances
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness
And one way or another I shall have deliverance
So I say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?
Toast in the new south, this one is for history
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury
Called the same people and it's yo you just missed them be	
This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?
Then they start to question whether you a true talent
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict
So then you hide away just to try to find your way
And now they back to callin you 200 times a day
I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it
And 10 million sold in the name of my deliverance

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured
The blood you shed is still stainin your velour
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor
Only to discover that your savior's manure
Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother
They put a lot on us hardly knowin one another
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you
Now we are brothers and together no one can touch us
It hauls me with regret I never met your baby girl
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin us to save the world
This musical marriage is no coincedence
On my mama Timmy baby we shall have deliverance
So we say

[Chorus]",Deliverance,2003

New South!  LaGrange, Georgia... Athens, Georgia...
The whole state of Georgia

Uhh, better BELIEVE we get it done this time baby
The Mathis family, they can't hide that money from us no mo'
It's goin down, uh, yeah

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx - repeat 2X]
Jimmy Mathis please come out here
And tell these folks who yo' son is
And momma tell Russ to load the shotgun
And get this loot cause we ain't got none (what?)

[Verse One: Bubba Sparxxx]
Ha, ha...
Any blood shed for a cause it deserves it
It's blood well worth it, we fought to preserve it
You caught him in person, you know Bubba's psyched out
You hate it when they talk, but love it when I shout
Fuck with me I doubt, that you really can
When I get to doin, my hillbilly dance
A step to the left, then two back to the right
Take a shot of the trone and then get back to the mic
Yeah I'm rappin tonight, but soon as the light hit
I'm all about the green man to hell with this white shit
Unless it's that white shit, that speed up your pulserates
Some party saccarhin, so sweet with a dub taste
This what they must face, I'ma be right here
Spittin these flames out, and drinkin Bud Light beer
'til the cows home and the dogs quit barkin
Daddy tell 'em who I am and don't beg no pardons

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Bubba Sparxxx]
Ahh...
They watch me in the country like the race on Sunday
And I wear the crown for 'em 'til you take it from me
I made some mo-ney, but blew most of
Bought and sold all the shit that you boast of
But I love my life and ain't much I regret
I just hope I remember, half of what I forget
Through the years and the tears, the blood and the sweat
But if you ever believe, it's time to double your bet
Cause I ain't even tapped into half my potential
But I have shown growth though, and that is essential
Grab you a pencil, and jot a few notes down
The questions they asked me, the answers I know now
Bet I ain't no clown, fuck what you thought dawg
I'm in Jimmy Mathis old truck with a sawed off
Pistol-grip pump, let some shit jump
We take it to the water and yo' ship'll get sunk

I heard that I caught five, but I gave it back
When I touch down bitch, I'm gon' pay you back
I'ma fuck all you friends, all you close of kin
Go back to bein a straight pitch again
Put that steering wheel in your back, ride you bitch
And I could give a fuck if your cryin bitch
I'ma give you somethin dirty, I'ma have the last laugh
I put that on my life, I'ma have the last laugh

Now this little dame, must of misplaced her brain
Switchin up without the slightest little trace of shame

She's thinkin my dang-a-lang, is a ride on the gravy train
I certaintly ain't a lame, little Betty you misguided
Cause it's rubels, not noodles that gets me excited
Ain't never seen shit like it, a fisher done been dykin
Since Clinton was the pres, now 'tendin she meant like it
Now slut, you got somethin to tell me ""oh wow, what?""
You always loved Andy, cooled olie and mowwed up
I'll oblige and give you a ride, but the only prize
You receivin is what I'm squeezin out on your chalky thighs
Oh these five dudes standin behind me, don't mind them
But if it's fuckin we discussin, just know they gon' chime in

Back to the same Turk that I used to be
You can get off my dick bitch, stop sweatin my balls
Cause it wasn't all that when I was behind the wall
Bitch now you want me behind ya, I don't want have none
You did a dirty deed, bitch you played me sour
You left me stranded like ""Gilligan""
To be honest with you bitch you was killin me
But I'ma dog like ""Blue's Clues""
You did that bitch, well watch how I do you
I'ma put you on cruise control
Full speed bitch, you stanky ho
It's a must that you feel my pain and hurt bitch

Mentally institutionalized, since the '85
Buildin tree houses (that the wind couldn't blow down)
Look at me now, holdin it down
Doin it well, I ain't triple platinum yet (but ain't gon' worry 'bout it)

To stop and say I'm sorry to this dude and this scout
It was just a little bump, shit you dented my Ferrari
Don't call the law, shit is rented, look I'm sorry
All we have done in the name of the south
Gave these ugly motherfuckers somethin to ""Raise Up"" about
But I'm still unfulfilled, since my daddy still drivin
That fuckin school bus, know that Bubba still strivin
I want me a label, want me a mansion

Bubba Sparxxx,"This song right here, 
Is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, 
Lost city of New Orleans, we call him this

(Georgia)

Now
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard the explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965, I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now
But it's president (Georgia) Bush

[Repeat: x2]
We from a town where (Georgia)
Everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby I'm still praying which ya
Everybody crying but (Georgia)
Ain't nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush

Now
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the white house hating, trying to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still moving then he holding it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tch-es
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yea!

We from a town where (Georgia)
Everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby I'm still praying which ya
Everybody crying but (Georgia)
Ain't nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush

And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed-spring
Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine
And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM
Young toon, yea that's what my people call me
Fifty thousand for the cross, trying to keep the reaper off me
I drink a lot of syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walking
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be the target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game no arguing (arguing)

And I don't even write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga balling
Mike Jordan, pardon my swaggy
Even my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami
I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me
Any rapper wan get at me, tell ya label contact me
Half four hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of miss cita
My dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Notta sip seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfucking ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hos
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos
Price sizing for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve
If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse

You're workin' to the bone
You're givin' it, then it's gone
You keep on or you don't

Ain't life grand
You're workin' to the bone
You're givin' it, then it's gone
You keep on or you don't
Ain't life grand

Yeah, this is it, put the kids to bed and get your shit
A hit's a hit though, but took I ain't forget this shit
But when we get a hit, we only slack a little bit
But y'all gettin' sick of banjos and fiddle shit

I hit a lick with it, but now I'm feelin' brand new
It's time to reinvent again and win again
So can you, put on that loop, split the blunt and food
And send me on my merry like you did my favorite rap group

We outlast and outclass these vagabonds
Dungeon Fam, yeah pass me that baton
See my medicine, as an adolescent one was
Black eyes and Babylon, shit that's what I'm proud I'm from

And what I have become is a major fact that one
They don't mention much, but trust they know that cracker's on
Fuckin' believable, believe it dude, please don't let me intrude
Smoke the blunt and eat your food

You keep on or you don't

You sit and wonder 'bout it
You hope and wish you got it
You try your best to hide it
You'll have to keep from cryin'

Ain't life grand
One day your on a high then
Next day you wished you died
Folks hate it when you're ballin'
They'd rather see you gone

This is me man
I just bust, I don't adjust much
To bust what this month left, I'm huff puff
On the hush hush, they'll never touch us

Dis-a-gust the national, that's putt, putt
I'm in the Butt Hut, fucked up some wet
Uncut, untucked, tryin' help me one up
One OC 8, oh makes me a whole

Entirely different type of a-hole
Gotta proper bank roll, Betty drop that thing slow
Motherfuckin' load the devil thing like it swell
Same way the Range Rove, same way the Chevrolets

Same way the Cadillacs, how I do it everyday
Bubba K'll never sway, born and bred in GA
I love Troy but it never was no play
It's like my four head stacks off a baby put it
They find it stankin' in Tennessee, here they wouldn't find ya, ho

Ain't life grand
You're workin' to the bone
You're givin' it, then it's gone
You keep on or you don't

Ain't life grand
You're workin' to the bone
You're givin' it, then it's gone
You keep on or you don't
Ain't life grand

In conclusion, listen to me when I'm talkin' to you young fella
It's fittin' to start rainin', hope you got an umbrella
I'll probably never be a number one seller
Might of been beige, but I never was yella

And when I saw yella, I don't mean yella
As in light skin, I just mean the type when
The beef heighten, get to sprintin' right then
Like a herd of bison, when I start riflin'

Oh yeah, I will go there
?Cause I'm from nowhere and I really don't care
If a pussy wanna stare, then a pussy gon' wear
My hand across the face, when I put it on there

I'm a one in a million, Dungeon affiliate
I brought you the realest shit and a bunch of you feelin' it
This gun I will empty it, if the chatter continues
You never did like me, but you had to pretend to

'Cause that just what men do when they hear we blew
Thirty million dollars, just as fast as them trees blew
Then how he refueled, and with Big re-booed
This whole fuckin' ship for a like a million and three moons, bitch

Ain't life grand
You're workin' to the bone
You're givin' it, then it's gone
You keep on or you don't

Ain't life grand
You're workin' to the bone
You're givin' it, then it's gone

Yep, yeah
Yep, yeah
Oh

I'm on, I'm grown, I'm so in my zone
You ain't gotta tell me, I know this my home
Throw me my phone, let me call up anybody
Who don't know about it and tell 'em I am him
Pale and not so slim
But I shine bright even when it's dark and grim
She marched on in but she far from a saint
Knowin' you's pretendin' that you are what you ain't
'Cause your startin' to taint what once was pure
Regardless I must endure
'Cause what's for sure, is that I am blessed
Just give me what I'm owed and I might get rest
See slight success, only brings more hunger
But don't you mistake lightning for thunder
'Cause thunder just rumbles, lightning strikes
Like men of great faith, then white's hype

Why your rims spin, spinnin'
I ain't slept ten minutes
No shut eye 'till this is
Right, yeah, is finished
I came for that big spinach
And I can't get it, with image
So all I can do is spit vintage
Again and again and again

Just draw the play up and run it
Vision, something that's great, I've become it
I played it and won it and profited it from it
A wonderful life and with honor I've done it
But you gotta confront it, it's permanent shorty
Feel the flames is burnin' you softly
Yes these lames is certaintly salty
That's how I know that the birds is off me
All I really ever wanted in my whole life
Was to stay the whole night, in the morning no flight
To have my own wife, instead of havin' to borrow
Johnny's in Philly and Chad's in Toronto
I ask for a lot though, thus I accept it
I'm gonna die lonely, big money's my homey
So Betty why don't we proceed to the suite
My pet snake skeet, so eager to meet (yeah)

[Chorus]

I'm special, especially when these lames is next to me
Every check I see, bring the flex outta me
Girl I'll pay for your love, and the sex I'll free
Okay, don't play, you gon' stay, then stay
But if you afraid of livin', then you ain't really wit it
Then please be on your way, with no delay
They say only the strong survive
And it seems that you gotta do wrong to thrive
But the truth ain't dead, I'm so alive
You don't want me to shine, then close your eyes

I'm at the condo, with General Patton
Losers make excuses, winners make it happen
We can pull the rides out, give you somethin' to cry about
Give you somethin' to lie about, inspiration while you pout
We can pull the broads out, in a straight line
Yours ain't fine fuck it, here, take mine
Dude you way behind, get on Bubba K. time
I'm lightyears ahead, have a light beer instead, yeah

Bubba Sparxxx,"I come, they go, I run, they slow
I ain't ashamed that I did what I did
I just live how I live, you don't like it, say so
Ain't a singer on my payroll

I'm platinum, they're probably that gold
Buckhead bouncing, move a little ounces
Talking out loud, but I ain't low
Wait for the day that Bubba can't blow

And get them fo?sho, bitch can't blow
S.V. style, you know what I'm talking about
Mo?fucking bank account, you say Os
These hoes better stay on their toes

The big play threat, I just may go
87 yards in the blink of an eye
It really don't matter what you think of the guy
'cause I'm eager to try this style, and that style

And stack piles of cash, while sayin' something
Dudes agile, hear that? Wow, a bad child that turned good
Now, I've earned good, but I've burned better
That cush, please just sush, wuss, I'm the team captain
Get your first letter, bitch
(Pussy)

You thinking, you dead, boy?
Know where I'm at, boy?
I'm on the other side of the room, your lady feel frisky
Tell her come get me, I'm on the other side of the room

If you came to party, let's go get it started
I'm on the other side on the room
Whether you with me or you're against me
I'm on the other side of the room

I remember when we used to carry them things
Back in the days
Hot as a flame and I'm setting through the blaze
Homey, full of hate

Dollar bill full of cane
It?s the mister motherfucker with a hundred different names
Ain't fuck with nobody
Can't roll no problem, diamond

Never could quite understand a man that never talked how to
Stay to himself, quiet as kept
With a coldness in his eyes that will scare you to death
I was on my way, man I had one foot in the grave

Motherfucker, I stayed contemplating about my last and final day
I'm supposed to be nothing, they were supposed to give me life in prison
Last pick, misfit, probably did a full twenty, hey, I'm right here, head up
Got the whole world shaking for me, I said

You thinking, you dead, boy?
Know where I'm at, boy?
I'm on the other side of the room, your lady feel frisky
Tell her come get me, I'm on the other side of the room

If you came to party, let's go get it started
I'm on the other side on the room
Whether you with me or you're against me
I'm on the other side of the room

Maybe death and taxes ain't the only thing certain
To come unnerved from out behind the closed curtain, bubba skirting
What's the word? You must have heard a lot of BS was asserted
Since none of us is perfect, wonder who it was unnerving

Not me, not you, grin and bear it? Got to
If they ain't worried about you, then they ain't worried about you
Hear, hear, get it clear, disappear from out my hemisphere
If indeed you've got some business here, then state it crystal clear

All this fake innuendo from little minnows
Is gonna make the big goldfish unload on the fish hole
Fuck Cane and Nate, baby tell me that it is so
I?d rather watch my momma get low than quit this, fo? sho, yo

You thinking, you dead, boy?
Know where I'm at, boy?
I'm on the other side of the room, your lady feel frisky
Tell her come get me, I'm on the other side of the room

If you came to party, let's go get it started

Bubba Sparxxx,"I'm supposed to represent

[Verse 1]
I'm too motherfuckin raw to be all, worried if these broads, is fuckin with me
Y'all can suck my right and left nut with the same slurp
Nomore of the fames perks, I'm back in LeGrange hurt
Can't work, same dirt I thought I had wiped off
The same jerk that used to jerk Paul now he's my boss
Lonely if I lost, my light on the pathway
Nomore Bubba K., just as white as a trash day
Say you can take the boy out of the country
But can't take the country out the boy, even with money
I believe it was funny, I was deceivingly burning
At the Four Seasons, all four seasons with Sunny
But I'll be just fine, the grind's in my bloodline
It's what's in your guts time, baby I'm one rhyme
From being what that man paid me to be
Wasn't no concrete but I was raised by the streets

[Chorus]
It's your turn, you supposed to represent
Do yo thang, you supposed to represent
Stop Playin', you supposed to represent
It's only right, you supposed to represent
It's your turn, you supposed to represent
Do yo thang, you supposed to represent
Stop Playin', you supposed to represent
Not only get money, you supposed to represent

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you gotta lose yourself to find out where you really are
Let the cut burn then you know you earned it when it scars
I been a star, my name rang bells
But it means not a thing if it can't bring sales
If you ain't seen hell you should get a load of this
Just a dose of hopelessness while you sip your Mo and Cris
If I ain't on your list, shit you can't win them all
But until he died, most of y'all ain't fuck wit Biggie Smalls
Atleast south of D.C. and west of Pittsbrug
That points, they don't know you 'til you resting in dirt
If resting is sure, a loser isn't sexiness
So make me the deadliest, MC I guess it just
Wasn't meant that I be mentioned with the greatest spittin then
Lord atleast let me get it up and pay the rent again
You may intend to win but my alternative's
The coffin or the furnacing, talking more determinant

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
What, you think I'm scared, you think I'm a pussy?
Really now, how far did you think you can push me?
Before I snap, just like that and bust back
Fear, he don't live around here, what's that?
What, you think I'm scared, you think I'm a pussy?
Really now, how far did you think you can push me?
Before I snap, just like that and bust back
Fear, he don't live around here, what's that?

[Verse 3]
Just stack, get your mind right and get your cheddar better
Volcano gone erupt, it won't lay at rest forever
Every level of the game, these country boys gettin to it
Nothin but your lips is movin, Hush you body shit and do it
I been knew it, you don't wanna jump bad
Hatin escalates and you don't want it to become that
I'm from that, dying breed of white MC
That knows what it's like to be told it ain't right to be
Rappin, now adapting just so happens it's the thing now
To get a cracker on your roster since Marshall came out
I can't explain how, vital time it is
Even now I wouldn't exchange our lives, mine for his
Like this

I wanna runaway...Cuz baby you're my everything 

I don't need this 
All I need is us 
C'mon girl, lets put it in the wind 
I don't care none, bout no one 

If they loved us they shoulda did it when 
They had a chance 
But now the dance is over 
And for sure its highway time 

Let the top down 
Can't stop now 
Explain the past baby I ain't tryin 
I ain't lyin 

When I say we done came of age 
Ya know things dun change 
Time to spread our wings 
Fly to better things 

Pack your suitcase today's the day 
Don't tell yo mama, don't tell yo sister 
It will only complicate the issue 
We'll mail em a box of tissue

The only one that loves you is right here with you 
Girl don't ever look back 
Our destiny awaits us 
In what ever place we park the brakes 

I work my hands to the bone
If that's what it takes ta 
Give us everything 
Our folks never had 

I'm prepared for that 
It may take a while 
But ima make you smile 
Forever 

I said a prayer for dad
And...I know he's listenin 
At least to this one 
If he never heard none of the others 

This is me and you 
And ima see it through 
From this highway to under the covers

We got off the exit at Wayco
Frankie J was on the radio 
I asked her was she afraid to go 
All the way with this 

She delayed the no 
I said baby I jus need to know 
If you ain't down 
We can turn it around 

Your happiness is my happiness 
And that's the only thing that's concernin me now 
Just hurt me now 
She said would you please jus let me talk for once 

Then all at once she went into how 
Shed been tryin to prevent this all for months 
Not at all because she didn't love me 
And only me 

Its jus that she 
Had withheld one vital piece of info 
She looked up at me 
Wit both eyes full of tears 

She said you remember that day at the clinic? 
I went in wit the doctor and I told you I did it 
I wasn't able to go through wit it 
No you didn't 

How could you 
Wait minute that makes you what? 
Three months and some change 
Well baby doll that jus ain't enough 

To derail us 
'cause see that jus means there's three of us 
But answer this, at what point did you think this topic should be discussed? 
I don't know whether to cry or smile 

But somehow I'm doin both 
But this changes nothin 
I got two babies and I solemnly swear to be true to both 
Baby

I wanna runaway with you... 'cause baby you're my everything 
I wanna runaway, (I wanna runaway) with you (I wanna runaway) 
I wanna runaway...Cuz baby you're my everything 
I wanna run, wanna runaway, there's nothing they can do er say to make us stay 
I wanna run, wanna runaway, there's nothing they can do there's nothin they can say 
I wanna run, wanna runaway..ahhhh oooh ohhh

Everywhere that I seem to go, all people they know
There goes that man

There goes that man
Been all around the world and I kissed every girl
There goes that man
Girl this ain't no kind of allusion, it's really that man
There goes that man

[Verse 1 - Duddy Ken]
Hey, when we step up out the play man
We bring that monster A game
Switchin or say through lanes
Green on my shirt like Tulane
Drunk and drivin in two lanes
Dirt Reynolds, that's the new name
Dip out and handle a few thangs
Bet I come back a rich man
Some of these cats is bitch made
My shift be like a switch blade
The doors, open this way
That man, went that a way
Chase cheese like a rat race
Push my button like there
And that's gonna get you nowhere
Just like you fuckin yourself
I've been all over the globe and hit a lot little spots (spots)
Met bitches that love the nigga, that's if she fucked me or not (not)
Trappin what's in my spot (spot)
Not movin, just got me no dough
It's like my money was slow mo'
I bought a car and got Mobile
My city's up on my shoulders
I'm takin life as we know of
Tranformin into a whole 'nother world and time
Beat up tracks and murder rhymes
Don't dare close the curtain, cause I'm just beginnin
Bubba was the beginnin but bitch I'ma end it
Hey, I'm that man, man

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit, I'm a Dodge Rammer, god damn if I ain't two and 0
I'm competin and momma's eatin, so am I losin? No
But shit was movin slow, I had to switch machines up
Destiny don't always match with the shit you dreamed up
But Bubba ain't no cream puff
In my life, I've seen much
Held the thrills and the spills
Through it all, I kept it trill
Guarantee I never will ever feel as helpless
As I did these last couple years, I know you felt this
Really don't expect no forgiveness for ""Deliverance""
Then again I offer no apologies, I meant the shit
Cause I lived the shit, truth is truth and that's the end of it
I'm up and runnin, bet my jersey's in the rafters when I sit
Watched it when I get a hit, everybody benefits
I'm far removed from innocence, a year older than twenty-six
Pussy just remember this, I ain't chose the path I'm on
If you want it, come and get it, as that man I stand alone (oh!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Duddy! Haha
Uh huh, hey say, hey let the guns play
I just came with ""Me, Myself, and I"" like Beyonce
Let these suckers run they coffee coolers, I'm the truest
Country motherfucker, bust and kill the talk, it's time to do it
Everything your idol do it, I can do it cock eyed
Three albums supplied, once I have not lied
That should mean a lot right?
Maybe when they open up the books, I can get a look
You must admit, I'm dope as fuck, true I ain't devoted much
Of my raps to dope, I'm just a little to preoccupied with the truth, you know what's up
Sorry but I know this much, Bubba K is sen-sat-ional
That shit ain't no bull
Ain't no bull that I can't pull, I am him
That'll be the case, if I'm ridin rims or shinin them

Just bought me a dodge, a hemi, give me 20 new 20's
I'm on day number 3, I need some energy in me

I been in the city behavin' like I'm still in the woods
Just a white boy livin' life as trill as I should
Really good, if I say so myself
Might be a little pale, they can't hate on much else

'Cause when I take this shirt off and show this girth off
It's all over but the tears, if your ho is up in here
Go on throw a couple beers on my tab tadpole
Life goes on, so you got your little rascal

Huntin' for a fire to throw my little wood on

Chop, chop, heat it up, beat it up, eat it up
With Dre and G wildin', these freaks love each of us
Now it's new to Louise to love
'Cause peepin' is for communist and Bubba is a capitalist

Sit down on my lap and let's talk about
The first thing that pop up little Michelle
A whisper when it's in a shell, turn the yellow into swell
Already been to hell, I'm tryin' to see how heaven feel

Could of cracked a cranium or two but still I kept it chill
Let me live, I let you live, bygones is bygones
I worked my movie or two, do your dance to my song
We won't be alive long but since the court afforded us
The luxury for a minute, I'm feelin' glorious

I'm in a good place, I've got this thing whooped
I'm cookin' with grease, these suckers can't look
They disgusted and it baffles me
I'm rappin' happily again, you should be glad for me

Actually, you can get on 85
Goin' through the southbound lane, you okay to drive
'Cause they can't deprive us, this is our turn way
""Hip hop hooray"" it's everybody's birthday

You need a hearing aid, I said I feel wonderful
I'm fittin' to take it to the house and pick my own fumble up
And anyone that loves life as much as I do
Hope you love it ever more since I made the south blew

Talkin' with Jimmy Mathis and he got a plan

And how he got the bay he rode
He said he killed a man in Ohio

He said he'd never forget that winter day

Told no one that I knew this man
Started thinkin' of a plan
Bout how I'd deal him his last hand
Didn't take him long to come unwound
He jumped up and gunned two men down
Ran outside to leave the town
But ole bay was nowhere to be found

I head out with my forty-four
And when he walked back through the door
I shot till I could shoot no more
And Dave Rudabough fell to the floor

I try to concentrate, my mind wants to explore,
The tropical scent of you, takes me up above,
Girl wen I look at you, oh, I fall in love.

Oh, no doubt you look so fine
Oh, girl I want to make you mine,
Oh, I want to be with a woman just like you.
Oh, no doubt I'm the only man
Oh, who can love you like I can
Oh, so just let me be with the woman that I love.

[Chorus:]
Oh, mysterious girl,
I want to get close to you,
Oh, mysterious girl,
Move your body close to mine.

Watchin' the sun go down,
The tide is driftin' in,
We can get close enough
And feel the warmth within,
'Cause I'm lookin' in your eyes,
Feelin' so alive,
And girl when you touch me,
It's time to take it through the night.

Oh, girl I want to be with you,
Oh, I want to spend the night with you,
Oh, I need to be with, a woman just like you
Oh, I want to do to you
Oh, all the things you want me to,
Oh, I need to be with the woman that I love

I guess that proves that I got mine

It's just who we are baby, we've come too far to start over now
I know what you're thinking; I'm not always easy to be around

You keep me believin' that you love me too
And I know it's true
This love drives us crazy but nobody's walkin' away

If I had a genie in a bottle
Three wishes I could wish for us
I wish we'd live forever and get along together
Turn these tempers into trust

And the professor is approaching
The saucer to see if there's
Possibly any sign of life aboard

Well, I'm sure something
Are you there

(I hear you knocking
But you can't come in)

That was Laughing
Lewis' record, Knocking

This is John Cameron
Cameron on the spot
And now I believe we're
About to hear the words of
The first spaceman ever
To land on Earth

(Womp bop a loo bop
A lomp bam boom)

And now here are the ball scores
Four to three, six to two
And eight to one

The impact of seeing
The first spaceman has
This reporter reeling

(Here I go reeling
Uh-oh, uh-oh...)

That was The Clatters again
With their big one, Uh-Oh

This is John Cameron
Cameron again downtown
The spaceman has returned
To his ship and is taking off
We return you now to our studios

The flying saucer has gone
There is no threat of an invasion
However, the flying saucers
Are still around

(Still around)

We are not going
To interrupt this record
Yes, we are

The flying saucer
Has landed again
Washington, The Secretary
Of Defense has just said

(Ain't that a shame)

That was Skinny Dynamo's
Record, That's A Shame

This is John Cameron
Cameron, part two
Gathered around me are
Several of the spacemen
Tell us, have you come
To conquer the world

And now would you
Repeat that in English

(Don't want the world
To have and hold)

Hey, why don't you go back
Where you came from

(Don't be angry
And drive me away)

We return you now
To our studios

Here is a news item
From Washington
The President has just
Issued a statement to the
Spacemen and we quote

(You can do anything
But lay off of my
Blue suede shoes)

That was Pa Gherkins record, Shoes
We switch you again downtown

This is John Cameron
Cameron downtown
Professor Sir Cedric of
The British Institute
Tell us how were
The saucers able to land

Well, you see..

(The motor cooled down
The heat went down)

That was Huckle Berry's recording
The Moter Cooled Down

This is John Cameron
Cameron again
I believe the spaceman has
A final parting word

(See you later, alligator)

We return you now
To our studios

The spacemen have gone again
But look to the skies
The saucers will
Always be there

(Always be there)

Everyone learned to live together, ah hah

Such an itty bitty thing should be
Why can't you and me learn to love one another?

Who is down and needs a helpin' hand
All it takes is you to understand and
To pull him through, ah hah

We got to solve it individually, ah ah
And I'll do unto you what you do to me
Said, no

Hear the shoutin' from the mountains on out to the sea
No two ways about it, people have to be free (they gotta be free)
Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be
Natural situation for a man to be free

Get right on board now, huh, huh

Yeah oh, what a feelin's just come over me
Love can move a mountain, make a blind man see
Everybody sing it now come on let's go see
Peace in the valley now, we all can be free

See that train over there?
Now that's the train of freedom

Well, believe me I've tried but there's no explaining, 
Eyes piled up you look like a painting, 
Saintly and sexy, the soft-spoken wind blows, 
Uncertain curtains cover broken windows, 
In desperate need of a safe haven and inflamed, 
I walk around Paris, unshaven and ashamed, 
20 odd years since last time I slow danced, 
Teenage crisis and the end of romance, 

I see myself in the form of a wolf, 
Furry, down on all fours and worried, 
Uneven colours and the echoes of fly tones
Connections I've lost in a collection of jawbones
Apples and oranges, you decide which, 
I'm writing graffiti on suicide bridge
I once knew a woman who was clever and tough
Who said too much make up is never enough
Her eyelids were heavy with words and desire
She lives underwater with the birds and the fire
And it just so happens I'm selling my psyche

You and me are meant to be, that's right I love you, 
Can't you see, whatever partner you do choose, you have the ability to marry, 
6, 7, 8, I'll never hurt you, you know.
Husbands love their wives, 
Yeah, love the woman, 
Part of me is here with you, 
One life, where my heart beats for you,

But the sounds of my dreams always keep me awake
Don't wanna scare the birds away so I speak soft

Her bedroom philosophies are so perplexing
But I think these two wooden legs are so sexy
Cries of sadness, spectacular 
You be Rossy de Palma and I'll be your Dracula 
Fist is of agony decorate the last room
Shoes by the door, on the floor is your costume
Open the trunk with the car key, the odd way
Love songs, call me the marquee de shad
Lord of the files, you lost me I wonder how 
Midnight, meet me at the entrance for the underground
So many questions, but I'm afraid to ask
So I whisper them to apollinaire by Picasso
I touch all the flowers and break the chain
I wish I could fly, but I'd rather take the train
And it just so happens I'm selling my psyche

Ya suck certain judges' dicks and then you paid off the rest,
With your bootleg apparell and counterfeit poetic license,

Eatin' a salad and drinking mad champaign,
And signin' the deal for the missoni ad campaign.

Of a high heel shoe in their mouth with a foot in it,

To first readjust the focus and then to change the shudder speed.

Buck 65,"A game worth winnin' from the beginnin' of the first inning.
An essential day off since it's provincial playoffs,
And I'm playin' shortstop, batting fourth in the line-up,
The opposing pitcher's a right-hander with an unorthodox wind-up.
And a good move to first, throws a curve, and changes speeds.
Can be wild at times and known to blow the strangest leads.
Like the last time we faced him, he turned one savage
Lead into a loss for his team, and inflated his earned run average.
But today he seems focused and we were stuck out to dry
In the top of the first 'cause he struck out the side.
But in the bottom half, the bad guys came out swingin'.
A lot of coaches like to choose takin' the same route,
Bringing the big hitters to the plate, and players that are purely speed,
And try to manufacture runs and jump out to an early lead.
And this time it worked, so we were gonna need a hero,
'cause after one complete, the score's already 3 to 0.
Leadin' off the second, I swung at the first pitch.
No wonder the center fielder back-peddled to the track and settled under it.
0 for 1 and can't get goin'.
The ball's thrown around the horn and back to the pitcher now.
And all is going good for the bad guys, but not so hot for the visitors.
The big right-hander is takin' no prisoners.
He seems to have us figured out, the question is, can we compete?
He's pitching perfect after 3 complete and has a 3-1 lead.

top of the fourth and our lead-off hitter makes it to first base.
And here we go, it's the worst-case
Scenario for any opposing pitcher because he got a reckon
That the first chance he gets, he's gonna try to steal second,
Which he does. so for the first time during the mission,
We've got nobody out and a man in scoring position.
The next batter flies out to right, but yo word,
That's still only one out and a runner on third.
So then the number 3 hitter steps up to the conventional talk,
Showin' where he'll hit, but draws the intentional walk.
It's an old maneuver they made 'cause trouble may follow
Unless they get the double play from the clean-up hitter and that's me.
The infielder's set up a double play depth when they're ready,
But I smack a line drive into left-center for a double, bringing two across,
Which just leaves it up to me to do the damage in the clean-up spot,
'cause now the score was 3 to 2.
The score remained the same through five past hits to pretense.
We kept it close with a dazzling display of defense.
We had to pull the starting pitcher, the one that was left handed.
The story of the sixth inning was base runners left stranded
And bullpen activity. but still the job is gettin' it done
After a perfectly executed hit and run
And what may later prove to be the ultimate game-winning catch.
We got a tie game going into the seventh inning stretch.

From dawn to sunrise, sunrise to dawn
I drop math in ya path and rock on
Sunrise to dawn, from dawn to sunrise
For you to try battlin me would be unwise
From dawn to sunrise, sunrise to dawn
I drop math in ya path and rock on

For you to try battlin me would be unwise

Buck 65,"Sky diver, your pants are on fire and the rest of your clothes is blowing
And for some strange reason, your nose is growing
My skin is crawling, everybody's chin is falling,
Jaws are dropping left and right
Lost cause you came like a thief in the night
With nice white teeth and a tight ass and long conversation
Fascinating feeling to spend months in your company
I never felt uncomfortable, even with my clothes off
Chillin' so hard, my ass almost froze off
Everybody shows off and wants to look presentable
But the fact of the matter is that accidents are preventable
From the sound of the candy wrappers
Down to the handicappers
Everybody's got to exercise a little caution
But every so often expect things to get hectic or
Technically difficult and I begin to get skeptical
Especially when the Canadian bacon gets sizzlin'
Isn't it a sin when the ceiling is invisible
We need new inventions that reveal peoples true intentions
A portable pride protector, affordable lie detector
The wild lifestyle has the tendency to intimidate
But it isn't your invitation to imitate
In front of my face, you spoke my gospel like an apostle
But on the other side of town, you got coke in your nostril
Just for example, we all want to live a bit
Whatever, it's your body of water, why should I give a shit

Who are you anyway, and where did you come from
Dumdum, just when I thought I could trust someone
The mask comes off, and your face fades away
You radiate eighty-eight full shades of gray

Black and white rainbow, you know you ain't acting right
Game show hostess, stabbing every back in sight
The time has come thicker than blood
And make no mistake, I'm a stick in the mud
I'm a kick in your pants and I'm a lump in your throat
And I'm the hassle in your castle, I'm going to jump in your moat
Splash, hypocritical condition the hospital
Makes this mission impossible
Pretty much, I've got no patients left and as a physician or doctor
It puts me in an awkward position
No magician can trick me, or lick me with a cattle whip
So what makes you think you can sink my battleship
We ain't family, drama queen, the camera's rolling
Show me your swollen memories before the moment's stolen
Slow-motion Picasso, wearing the wool socks
And coming with the full clip, I'm sick of this bullshit

Who are you anyway, and where did you come from
Dumdum, just when I thought I could trust someone
The mask comes off, and your face fades away
You radiate eighty-eight full shades of gray",Pants on Fire,2001
Buck 65,"Most people are curious
Some wanna get dirt on
The centaur I'm famous
I walk around with not shirt on
The easiest way would be for you to lie face down
I'm a man
But I'm built like a horse from the waist down

people are afraid of me
But act like they love me
Feist your eyes upon my nudity
I am beauty and the beast
I have plenty to say but nobody listens
Because my cock is so big
And the end of it glistens

so I'm famous for it
Freaky is what everyones name is
For shorts larger than yours
I'm a centaur for christ sakes
I like to eat rice cakes
And listen to classical music
I'm told passion is my specialty
But really I'm old fashion

and I'm quite well built
As far as physiques go
So people seem to think
That I belong in a freak show
They wanna have pictures taken
Constantly assuming
That my sex drive is three times that of a normal human
Asking silly questions
Like I'm their personal mentor
All they care about is my big dick
Cause I'm the centaur
The porno industry wants to pay me lots of money
To appear in books and movies
Cause they think I look funny
But I'm looking for true love
Not groupies and freaks
More than a huge cock
I have a complicated mind
I'm not the favorite kind of companion
For the average person
Sometimes things start well but eventually worsen
When sex becomes a problem
Or else their unimpressed
With the attention that you get
Being a centaurs love interest
You don't care about my next life
Just my ex wife
And the intimate details of our sex life

most people are curisous
Some wanna get dirt on
The centaur I'm famous
I walk around with not shirt on
The easiet way would be
For you to lie face down
I'm a man
But I'm built like a horse from the waist down

so handsome
Known to throw a tantrum
Quick on the draw
Got a job pullin' a rickshaw
Rock star talkitive talented provocitive
Awkward socially unusualy emotional
Way out of proportion
My heart is the warmest
Unfortunately for me
My private part is enormous
More so than normal
I'm also an authority
And all sorts of important stuff
Morally the centaur
Historically horrible
Adorable not exactly
I'm magically attractive
Drasticly indowed
Rocket powerd cock unit
None allowed talking about it
Don't even look at me sideways or crookedly
I'm crotchety in more ways than one
I'm macho
Watch out now I'm fury and furious

most people are curious
Some people wanna get dirt on the centaur

most people are curious
Some wanna get dirt on
The centaur I'm famous

The easiet way would be
For you to lie face down

",Confidence in the System/Centaur [Remix],2001
Buck 65,"Standin' on the side of the road with a long shadow and suitcases,
Going nowhere, and I don't care, I'm a grown man.
Hold my own hand, kickin' my own ass for cryin',
I'm dyin' on the inside, they don't know who I am.
Filthy, fraught, and haunted by a guilty conscience,
Runnin' away, and all because of silly nonsense.
Gone since - God knows when,
And I ain't comin' back knowin' that, no one gives a rat's ass anyway.

I just wanna find a place where I can sit in a rocking chair,
No matter how far, even if it means walking there.
Maybe I'll get me a dog for some company,
It's better than tryin' to figure out somebody.
Give me a good book, a radio, and a sewing machine,
A place in the woods by the ocean and no inbetween.
I gotta get rid of these dark circles and headaches,
Maybe if I meditate, rather than medicate.
I can no longer hesitate, I get so frantic,
But what if my wishes are overly romantic.
Though, the suns too low in the sky for second guesses I reken
And I'm used to taking chances.
Breakin' a few branches, and gettin' lucky now and then,
Findin' some trouble, was just a matter of how and when.
And now I take notes, and make boats from Burch bark
But stress still shows in my face like a birthmark.
As soon as I get where I'm going I'm going to wash my hands thoroughly
And start getting out of bed earlier.
It's curious the way I've tried vicariously,
To fly so low to the ground and so carelessly.
How embarrassing, I can't wait to call it quits,
Knowing that more and more tiring is all it gets.
I've applied various and unique strategies,
Read a few Greek tragedies and fasted for two weeks.
Been rollin' around
In the hole in the ground
No surprise both my eyes
Are swollen shut, I'm stranded with no supplies.

I need a lift...

What have I done?



",Rat's Ass/Customs,2001
Buck 65,"(song 1)

it was the echoing voices of the old ones,
through thick steal forests and overscorched earth.
always just out of reach.
a murder of crows judged my every footstep.

my bones were frozen.
penniless and entirely out of breath,
i washed my beautiful hands in the black market dog water trough.

but through it all, the real stick in my spokes was the torment of my dreams.
i fought off sleep with both fists and sometimes fire.

with little more than a blow gun that i made from an exhausted pen,
i shot the stars out of the sky.
when each one fell, sparkling to the ground,
i made wishes that never came true.

apparitions of angels with angry eyes appeared at each new moon.
my own ghost began whispering
and the trees died if i tried climbing.
the decision was made for me...to begin interpreting real life
just as i would a nightmare.

(song 2)

watching an already dead world vanish,
we the banished and outlawed wander
hither and yonder like dogs gone hungry.
funky and angry and sometimes ugly.

drums like drugs have turned us to scavengers,
pathfinders, addicts, and mathematicians,
practitioners of blackmagic.
we make music from used up junk and bad luck dreams.

liars and losers, emus and aardvarks,
gypsies and penthieves, pedalers, cardsharks.
all of us fortune tellers combing the forest.
hardcore, building a cardboard fortress.

forward fast and backwards blindfolded.
trying to find gold buried in floodplains.
covered in bloodstains, flybites and egg yolk.
running away with one of my legs broke.

sometimes it's lonesome travelling homeless.
not knowing where you're going, riding the railroads.
pick up some sailboats, and most of the locamotives
once we decide to see some of the countryside.

working with circus performers and cutthroats.
discussions with percussionists, perverts, and poets.
haven't you ever heard of the... 1200 hobos??

we ain't vampires dressed like rock stars,
we build campfires and ride boxcars
town to town, we just write songs,
and plus we stay up like all night long.

we ain't vampires dressed like rock stars,

(song 3)

twenty some years is a long walk,
even if it's not in a straight line.
you see a lot of things in the distance.
you know what they say about great minds.

you and i think about the same things,
dream the same dreams, play the same games.
we started out in the same place.
believe it or not, we got the same names.

everything happens for a good cause,
whether it be victory or loss.
and the road may turn into a runway,
but you'll know what to do someday.

trust me, i've seen it all before.
i've climbed to the tops of the tallest trees
to get away from the deep water,
to find a touch of the smallest breeze.

you'll find a girl with a low voice,
who holds the world in her bare hands.
you'll fall in love, you'll have no choice,
once you were given a fair chance.

for the first time you will sleep well,
take a deep breath, see the sunshine.
hold on to her for dear life,
then watch the whole world unwind.

ask her to show you some magic,
and i guarantee that she will say yes.
tell her you've seen forever,
and you'll be together not a day less.

just know until that time comes
and after you cross that first mile,
that the hardest part is behind you,
and all of the pain will be worth while.

from storm clouds come angels.
let pain give you pleasure.
from dirt roads grow flowers.
when faith can't be measured.

from storm clouds come angels.
let pain give you pleasure.
from dirt roads grow flowers.
when faith can't be measured.

(song 4)

i know a man who was born with his heart on the outside.
every man's worst fear, he also had heavy hands.
he couldn't touch his lover's face, he couldn't hold the baby.
he would never desert 'em, but he was worried he's hurt 'em, maybe.

mad at the world, his face turned hot pink.
the best he could do was just try and not think.
but he was too bothered, so he would only try rarely.
he read the last page of every book in the library.

he lacked the charisma of a true revolutionary.
crime fighter, would try to write, but kept breaking his typewriter.
he'd preach his manifesto like a militant radical.
was dilligent, but his greatest mistakes were grammatical.

if he only spent more time rehearsing, preparing,
there wouldn't have to be so much cursing and swearing.
eyes on fire, his volume was blistering.
no one had taught him about the power of whispering.

he is dynamite: blows kisses, eats dirt.
mouth of a volcano, he is a t-shirt.
he stands on stilts, but doesn't stand for funny stuff.
ask me? he just hasn't been around the sun enough.

he paints self-portraits with a ruler, only eats corn,
and then tries to sell his own soul on the street corner.
he always remembers everyone's numbers and
sometimes cries into his own cumbersome hands.",Square One,2003

[intro]
Music to be murdered by
It is mood music in a juggular vein and I hope you like it
Our record requires only the simplist of equipment
An ordinary phonograph needle
A 4 inch speaker
And a 38 calibur revolver
Naturally the record is long played
Even though you may not be
So why don't you relax?
Lean back and enjoy urself
Until the coroner comes...

oop my penis is comin out
There must be trouble in the monkeyhouse
Fever runnin cage to cage
Either one in change for change
Both of us with glass between us
Bittering and banging,
Singing in sanging
Spinnin and hangin out
Yingin and yangin
What's the big idea?
Comin with the sideshow mountain act
You could always drop my class
If you find it too challenging that way
Nobody knows a face
We just take it to a higher gear
But oh that's why you're weird now
You got a barbed wired beard
I see you better watch your face protecting your material
You know who you're dealin with here I'm flakier than breakfast cereal
I changed all levels and I replaced all players but I'm
Tired in runnign around like baseball players always got
Trouble on the mind developed the feed of prophets
Tell the deceased about it, go yell at a priest and shout it out
Loud is here new laws, in stoen, windblown
You saw the infection with bad knees and an ingrown duel claw
Bitch, you got lucky with the phone calls and the spread sheets
So, cut the crap out along with the cigarettes and the red meats
This fate can see in your eyes trying to match manuvers with your mouth open
Looks like you're diamonds scratched and hearts champed
Play along, safe inside me it doesn't matter what you think
You no-floats, and row boats when you hit below don't say
Doh,.meew!meew! got to get out of here!
Slur my esses, then you blur my message

I got a long list of reasons, and an even longer rope to tie
Demons ain't supposed to cry
Tears enough to soak the sky
Pourin out of both your eyes
Cross your legs and hope to die

Nowww ii feel like goin out I've got enough love to fill the place
Ill come to you're house and ovulate on you're pillow case
I know where I'm goin so I dotn even need to look
I should probably do a show you know
But id really rather read a book
So, pay me lots of money now
I'm done payin dues
And I'm not puttin the pressure on
And I'm not sayin jews
But I've accepted challenges
And I've taken many dares
And its hard to make it all coem back when you haven't been anywhere
So, we can have a sleepover
Ill lay a towel down
You can do the rest, and then well both make a vowel sound
Single white female, we can play connect the dots
But gimme a second to myself to just collect my thoughts
Uhh....
Now meet me at the great taste
Show me your soul, and ill try to keep a straight face
I know you are pissed in the past and you were put off
Why dotn you take it out on me
And shoot the last of you're foot off?
Switzerland, what about girls?and what about jobs? and what about all the time that was spent int he what about fogs
I should pull your pants down
For no reason and spank you
But I won't, if you be a good boy- please and thank you
Now i.
Say jump.
You say.
How high?
Its the grim reaper vs the gym teacher
And it goes liek..

And the coolest, coolest thing about buck was that he was one of us, didn't smoke didn't drink, didn't kiss no women...
It was great cause you could really talk to buck and he would hear ya
Oh one time they threw buck out the 3rd story window he landed on the ground *thud* that cat was stiiiill goin jack! haha We were all goin ""GOO AHEEAD BUCK! that was really cooool man!""


[intro]
You try so hard, you jump so high, then you run so fast and you don't know why...you gotta try so hard, jump so high, and you run so fast and don't know why...you gotta try again, try try again


The try hards drive cars that need new parts
They got vampire fangs and see through hearts
But they wouldn't be caught dead without the right clothes on
The harder they try, the more everything goes wrong
The tryhards talk until the back of my neck hurts
No matter what, the topic is ""the experts""
The tryhards can't dance, but do dance anyways
Then they say tryhards, are kinda retarded
But I wouldn't go that far, I should mention for starters
They're modern day maureders just dyin for attention
Yeah, tryhards, candy-coated comedians
Live through medium-sized imaginations
Lies and exagerrations, all on an average weekday
They have a unique way, of making you want to vomit
Drama slash nonsense akways part of the content
Opinions and comments, from cowboys and indians
Climbin a steep hill, just for a cheap thrill
Dancin queens, can't seem to keep still
The tryhards dotn sleep well, they just toss and turn
And I'm not concerned about it, to tell you the truth
They get on my nerves, I refer to them as perverted
Earthworms, as they prefer to play dirty
The tryin hardest, they'd probably say I'm an artist
Obvious novices that just feel so informed
That's its even more annoying than being trapped in a toystore
With hardcore rappers, paraders and wannabes
I say probably highway robbery
Ain't worse than being pestered by this type of person
Tryhard children still throw tantrums
On their mattresses in their mansions
And pay attention fully to the bully with the headphones
Fascinated actually with makin a fashion statement
Tryhards don't know how to relax
Its ridiculous how he always overreacts
The tryhards just go along for the ride
I guess the nbeed for speed can be stronger than pride

[fades]
The tryhards.....they jump so high, they run so fast and don't know why.....



[buck]
I was raised on a dirt road
Ghost town, stray dogs
Whole nine, the gold mine closed down
I knew the woods like the back of my hand
And I would shoot the breeze
With the roots and trees
I'd go by the river
And watch the way the devil dances
But never took his hand
Even though I did have several chances
Everybody slept
When the morning dew turned to frost
Darkness moved in
And somebody burned a cross
A girl named stella cuwin
Was prettier than you'd imagine
The town should've given her the crown
For the beauty pageant
But instead
Some local pinhead started spreading rumors
About the cuwins being inbreds
And what's worse, people believed it
Cause the family was dirt poor
And down on their luck
So that made it hurt more
Picking up garbage and mowing the grass
At this point stella stopped going to class
You know how they ridicule a kid in school
And this shit's enough
To make anybody feel like a misfit
She made herself invisible
And hid inside a house of mirrors
Whenever the fear stops
So did the tear drops
But fear is forever
And lies become legend
And eventually growing
Slowly, exponentially
She should've been a cover girl
Treated like a princess
But she's an enigma
Haunted by the stigma of incest

she tried to hide the scars
Her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds divide
In the corners of her eyes

she tried to hide the scars
Her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds divide
In the corners of her eyes

one horse town
Known for the most softness
Little old schoolhouse
Burned down post office
Blueberries and bulrushes
A tree with a tire swing
Volunteer fireman's fair
The whole entire thing
Stella was heartbroken
Decided to start smoking
Bad taste in her mouth
She grew into a sad face
Her few friends were worried
But her parents were always pround of her
But she never escaped from under the cloud cover
A woman reduced
She was eaten by a monster
And after all these years
The past, it still haunts her
It whispers her name
When she's trying instead
To just listen to music
While she's lying in bed
Now the story of stella
Is one that every child knows
But the witch in the woods
Is more like a wild rose

she tried to hide the scars
Her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds divide
In the corners of her eyes

she tried to hide the scars
Her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds divide
In the corners of her eyes.....







",Square Three,2003
Buck 65,"The man with the hair would talk real loud
He made feel proud for not being afraid,
He helped me get over my fear of the dark
And of the unknown in the year of the shark.
We'd meet in secret at the ends of the weeks
And we were friends of the freaks and the misunderstood.
We'd listen to jazz, or go for a drive
And I'm just glad we both were alive
And everyone knew that the giant was john
And no one had heard him once say a bad word.
Some say he's perverted, or maybe a manchild
Just 'cause his imagination ran wild
And what's wrong with that, in a world gone-a-fishing?
You want to run away from a man on a mission.
Wow bob, wow wake up and smell the coffee
Enjoy the scenery and the sounds of machinery.
Me and the man with the hair would compare notes
We both wear boots and drink rootbeer floats.
We told jokes with old people and lit things on fire,
And we all fall down in a small small town.
But now it's dark, and we follow the weird words of murmuring,
Burglars and murderers further than our father figures.
The nasty, ghastly, devious, and blasphemous
Provides a more lasting fascination for us both. 

Swimming upstream,
Young men and women are fiending for
Immediate intimacy with no limitiations.
Alas, the skirts don't hide the shadows
Cast by the bare ass on the dancefloor.
Sexual warfare waits in the staircase
And therefore most of them probably
Shouldn't even really be there in the first place.
Unarmed soldiers of lust rub shoulders
With those older and more immature than them,
It's disgusting, yet intruiging to see
Overachieving greasers unleashing themselves
Upon the female species,
Especially when the weather gets warmer and then
The whole entire wardrobe is normally informal.
For your information, the hats are worn backwards
And so are the morals when the girls wear overalls.
It's a sensitive issue involving insecurity
Maturity levels, and lots of toilet tissue 'cause

The girls are desperate,
But the boys are even hornier,
The rose smells sweet
But the stem is even thornier.
It's a match made in purgatory,
What more do you want to know?

The girls get goosebumps and nipples to notice but
No one knows how to communicate it's useless when
Lies are told with closed eyes and
Everybody tries to disguise their own flaws when the guys go,
""we need females and we read details.""
It's card tricks and hard dicks
And a beat that goes like ""uh uh uh yeah, uh huh uh uh yeah.""
The neat part of the meat market apart from the
Darkness and lots of narcotics to me is the hard rocks,
No one needs to be told twice, there's plenty of cold ice,
Just tight pants and old spice who take shots and roll dice.
The carpets are crumby with puke coming out of them.
It's putrid and stupid
Why don't you make a contribution
To the plan-gathering, as a matter fact, word
What do you say, this Thursday?

The girls are desperate,
But the boys are even hornier.
The rose smells sweet
But the stem is even thornier.
It's a match made in purgatory,
What more do you want to know?

It smells like everything inside of the hideout
But I doubt anyone really wants to know why,
Oh my, goodness gracious, the place is basically bulging
With people indulging in, all kinds of fabric,
It's a magical buffet of pheromones and flesh
That defies all logic.
It's just like dodgeball, but instead of a ball
The contestants throw around the head of a doll
And I don't know what it means,
But it makes it worth the cost alone,
Even with the overflowing load of testosterone.
The sexual appetites are salty, it's a circus,
The circuits are faulty, and everybody's uptight
With sweat stains and jet planes and hot rod love songs,
Blistering kisses for every mister and misses,
In the same of time it takes for you to make a sandwich, love,
You can probably find someone for you to take advantage of.

'Cause the girls are desperate,
But the boys are even hornier.
The rose smells sweet
But the stem is even thornier.
It's a match made in purgatory,
What more do you want to know?

My long lost best friend was born to be wild,
When I was a kid, I conformed to his style.
Be-boy deluxe from yankees to canucks
With connects and contacts, and always came correct.
Exact him, except he was easily distracted by sleaziness,
Even when we should've been practicing
Because back when we had peach fuzz
He was freaking out each weekend.
And speaking of waiting for the end of the world,
He befriended a girl with a heart made of glass
And was afraid to ask if he was
Falling in love, falling asleep, falling apart, or all the above.
He was a fling, and she was his weakness,
Kissing his cheeks and playing with his paychecks.
At breakneck speed he was heading for a dead end,
Pretending he was healthy and defending himself,
He would always exaggerate and use his imagination.
Waiting for someone to say ""congratulations,""
But I wasn't exactly happy for him, actually
After turning his back to me gradually.
I call it a tragedy, watching him disappear,
This year it's crystal clear, listen here

Fast ain't always better than slow, you know
A home run every time would start to get boring after a while
I hope I never forget how to bleed

Having my picture taken with the Amazing Creskin

It's where you can pay for a room with your good looks
The ball parks are always busy and the umps always make the right call
Everyday is Halloween and people use plastic Christmas trees
They fight with their fists and go to drive-in movies
There's no such thing as luck or the dentist
And shoes never hurt your feet
I keep a lighter and dog treats in my pockets at all times because you never know
I got a Saint Francis of Assisi keychain and a wallet made of Corinthian leather
Sometimes I drive all night and listen to talk radio
Sometimes I practice scratching for hours on end
Usually I sit in the window and listen to my tapes
I got all kinds of tapes
Hugs and kisses and treats in a bag
In paradise, a buck will buy you a comic book, a soda and a candy bar
You can always find a place to park or to hide
The DJs only play originals and the theatres still have silver screens and Buster Keaton matinees
I'm an outlaw faith healer with sock monkeys for the kids
I'm the ringmaster king of the convenience store parking lot
My show is an every man for himself freak fest
Pack a lunch and ask for Johnny Rockwell
Here your favourite pen works forever but memories parallax
It's 70's doing 20's, 50's doing 2000
Everyone's got their own arrow
And there ain't no short handled shovels
It's under my pillow
It's tomorrow and the next day",50 Gallon Drum,2003
Buck 65,"She had exes on her eyes
She was only good for one thing
It was over before it started, sooner than some think
She had a nose for trouble and all things illegal
She came with heavy baggage and a stupid ass beagle
Man, I hated that dog
It would shit in the kitchen and howl at the moon
Always scratching and itching
Queen of the plastic bag forked tongue and 80's retro
Everything from new wave, metal and electro
Creature of the night, of habit and of the tanning booth
Dedicated, crippled and heavily medicated
New pair of shoes to wear out and walk a mile
She got what she wanted and cried like a crocodile
She liked to mix it up, but couldn't cook to save her soul
Every year when Santa Claus came, he only gave her coal
Blatantly obvious, I read her like a book of matches
Maybe she's crazy, but I'm the one who took the chances

And what does that say about me
In the wrong place with a long face
What does that say about me
I just don't know
Without sunshine and rain the grass won't grow
But what does that say about me
Couple bandages and knuckle sandwiches
What does that say about me? I just don't know
Without sunshine and rain the grass won't grow

The thorn in my side was also my addiction
She spelled it out backwards and blinded me with science fiction
Porcelain doll, she let herself go to pieces
Kept it in bottles for too long with no releases
The outcome was volcanic
Disgusting and wonderful, messy, confusing
Exciting and depressing
The whole entire time I had my foot on the accelerator
I saw it all happen like watching numbers on the elevator

But what does that say about me?
In the wrong place with a long face
What does that say about me?
I just don't know
Without sunshine and rain the grass won't grow
But what does that say about me
Couple bandages and knuckle sandwiches
What does that say about me? I just don't know
Without sunshine and rain the grass won't grow",Exes,2003
Buck 65,"Leftfielder, living in a suitcase 
Comfortable shoes, photo album and toothpaste 
Road atlas, learning my way around 
Kissing the pavement, lucky 'cause I may have drowned 
Hotel notepad, three pens for five dollars 
Black, red and blue, recommended by scholars 
On foot, talking loud and telling fortunes 
Steadily building up an empire and selling portions 
Spinning plates, disappearing, walking the high wire 
Sawing a woman in half, on trial by fire 
Call me country, I'm dry as a bone 
Perhaps I would die if I was alone 
I pray to saint christopher and shout at the devil 
I made a million promises and have broken several 
Man of the moment, trying to get some more 
And you never heard it like this before 

Fly fisherman, don't know, don't care 
Straight out of the middle of butt fudge nowhere 
Champion of breakfast, reverse kleptomaniac 
Rainy day wall flower, what did you expect? 
Pickled beats everywhere, daily pollution 
Everyone's looking for a saline solution 
Give me a lawnmower, something made of wood 
Beat up contraptions that smoke when they heat up 
Pygmalion, big city grease monkey 
Maybe the most honest, probably the least funky 
Raccoon with rabies, backstage hermit crab 
Give me your zippidy do da and I will turn it sad 
Permanent scar on a smooth face of mediocrity 
Just leave it up to me to rock it awkwardly 
Tin can evangelist, trying to make some more 
And you never heard it like this before",Leftfielder,2003
Buck 65,"The sun is shining on full blast
It's garbage day
Air in my tires and all my cares are far away
I'm looking like a million bucks
Feeling good and sort of frisky
Plus enough money in my pocket for a quart of whiskey
Tattooed tear drops, confetti 
I've learned to trust my animal instincts when farmer's fields turn to dust
This is the day we've been waiting for all our lives
So let's write letters to our parents and call our wives
Raise the flag
Let's take a drive and raise our voices
Celebrate our differences
Build a bridge and praise our choices
There's babies crying and it makes it hard to go to sleep
Some days are throw aways and others you're supposed to keep
Time waits for none of us
Even though my watch is slow
And nothing's for certain but I'm searching for Sasquatch
And you know what?
The unknown is all part of the plan
For a runaway soul and a hard loving man

New beginning
I've washed my hands and made my bed
Maybe I'll turn on the television or shave my head
I'm getting kind of bored with the same old cheese and crackers
My plan's all inside out
My reason's backwards
Some new air in my lungs is what the doctor ordered
But being exposed makes me feel kind of awkward sort of
Give me a shot in the arm first
The clock's ticking
I'm watching the water boil
I like to let the plot thicken
I'm ear to ear with good intentions and vibrations
I'm on fire
Sometimes I conspire with Vaughn Squire
Sometimes we go alone
Over hills and through the sewers
Try to keep our edges sharp and learn a few new maneuvers
The whole world is drying up and everybody's eyes are red
It's hard to see or even try to guess at what lies ahead
But you know what?
The unknown is all part of the plan
For a runaway soul and a hard loving man

Buck 65,"I don't know what's wrong with the youth of today 
Wandering lost, it's true what they say 
And who is to blame? tv and magazines 
They would have you believe that everyday is halloween 
Why, when I was a kid, playing in the ditches, 
Living in fear of satan and the witches 
The whole world was made of wood and smelled like gasoline 
The days were at least twice as long and the grass was green 

Running for my life, I was cursed by a talking snake 
I'd walk all day and throw rocks across a bottomless lake. 
There was a killer in the woods who would whistle. 
Once in a while I could hear him shoot his pistol. 
And the other kids hated me...but like a martyr, 
I drove myself harder and harder 
Blood in my eyes, scrubbing to get the dirt off 
I didn't say much, didn't like to take my shirt off 
I was quick but I didn't know the meaning of pain yet 
I would visit father bob and he would show me his train set, 
Tell me a story, offer me a glass of milk 
Send me on my way with a question to ask myself 
The rain didn't bother me the search had meaning 
Church was good but I'd rather be dreaming. 
High speed horseshoes, harnesses and heavy string 
The problem is, today they got an answer for everything. 
4-6-3 an x, an o 
And I can't think of a better way to end the day 
4-6-3 a punch, a kick 
And I can't think of a better way to end the day 
4-6-3 as yes, a no 
And I can't think of a better way to end the day 
4-6-3 it's life, death 
And I can't think of a better way to end the day 

Learning the words, turning the double play. 
Doing some damage in my own subtle way 
Been all over, I've seen too much 
I no longer feel the need to rush 
I'm upside down, I'm inside out 
Broken glass all in my mouth 
Cut wide open and everybody knew why 
'Cause when it comes to rocking something fierce, boy do I",463 [Album Version],2004
Buck 65,"Dirty and low with the same pair of pants on
Tables I dance on and benches at bed time
Way passed the deadline and waiting for the world's end
I just had a terrible argument with my girlfriend
Something or other, I always seem to be in trouble
Getting kind of hard to hear and maybe now I'm seeing double
God almighty, give me strength and put the poison down tomorrow
Tonight I'm gonna stay up late, see if I can drown in sorrow

(2x's)
I go under the blouse and grope for the breast
I call this one hope and hope for the best
I play fight rarely and barely touch the surface
Anchors away I'm out of focus on purpose

I'm lower than life, living like it's the last day
Eyes gone out and hard like an ashtray
Dog won't play with me I'm smelly and unshaven
Walkin in circles and searching for a safe haven
Time's running low but still I remain patient
Practicing my lines hanging out at the train station
500 excuses and working on a dozen more
Unemployed again your parents hate me cause I'm poor

(2x's)
I go under the blouse and grope for the breast
I call this one hope and hope for the best
I play fight rarely and barely touch the surface
Anchors away I'm out of focus on purpose

I'm quick to throw the towel in too stubborn to apologize
The future is bleek and my memories are wallet-sized
I'm out of ideas, it feels like I'm choking
All of my mirrors and promises are broken
I'm lousy and threadbare too low to get down
Almost out of gas but can't stand to sit down
God almighty, wish me luck, let me get to sleep
I'm trying to keep it all together
I've got to laugh to keep from crying

I go under the blouse and grope for the breast
I call this one hope and hope for the best
I play fight rarely and barely touch the surface
Anchors away I'm out of focus on purpose
