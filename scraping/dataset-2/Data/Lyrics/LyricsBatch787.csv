Nine Inch Nails,"You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you
I broke apart my insides
I've got no soul to sell
The only thing that works for me
Help me get away
I want to fuck you
I want to taste you
I want to feel you
I want to be you
Just like an animal
You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have absence of faith
You can have my everything
You tear down all my reason
You see through what I hide
You make me perfect
Help me get inside
I want to fuck you
I want to taste you
I want to feel you
I want to be you",Closer to God,1994
Nine Inch Nails,"He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see 
He tries to tell me what I put inside of me 
He's got the answers to ease my curiosity 
He dreamed up a god and called it Christianity 

Your god is dead and no one cares 
If there is a hell I will see you there 
He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line 
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine 
His perfect kingdom of killing  suffering and pain 
Demands devotion atrocities done in his name 

Your god is dead and no one cares 
Drowning in his own hypocrisy 
And if there is a hell I will see you there 
Burning with your god in humility 
Will you die for this?",Heresy (Blind),1994

Nine Inch Nails,"Step right up march push
Crawl right up on your knees
Please greed feed (no time to hesitate)

I want a little bit
I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I want to watch it come down

Don't like the look of it
Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down

All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't that make you feel better?
Shove it up inside surprise! lies
Stains like the blood on your teeth
Bite chew suck away the tender parts

I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down

Maybe afraid of it let's discredit
It let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down
Now doesn't that make you feel better?
Don't you feel a whole lot better?

Nine Inch Nails,"I beat my machine it's a part of me it's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream it's changing me I am becoming
The me that you know he had some second thoughts
He's covered with scabs and he is broken and sore
The me that you know doesn't come around much
That part of me isn't here anymore
All pain disappears it's the nature of my circuitry
Drowns out all I hear there's no escape from this my new consciousness
That me that you know used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping and he's left to decay
The me that you know is now made up of wires
And even when I'm right with you I'm so far away
I can try to get away but I've strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all my bad parts
I don't want to listen but it's all too clear
Hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid
Annie, hold a little tighter I might just slip away
It won't give up it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head",The Becoming,1994

(Yes I am)
And I have a big gun
Got me a big old dick and I

Held against your forehead

Maybe I'll put a hole in your head
You know just for the fuck of it
I can reduce you if I want
I can devour
I'm hard as fucking steel and I've got the power
I'm every inch a man and I'll show you somehow

You know how this world can beat you down
I'm made of clay
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way
I'm always falling down the same hill
Bamboo puncturing this skin
And nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm
Drowning in
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
And if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place

I do not want this
I do not want this

Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel

I stay inside my bed
I have lived so many lives all in my head
Don't tell me that you care
There really isn't anything, is there?
You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer
To those who know what it really feels like
To those who've had a taste
Like that means something
And oh so sick I am
And maybe I don't have a choice
And maybe that is all I have
And maybe this is a cry for help

Keep me running, running scared

She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind

He loved Wild Bird and raised horses, and fought in World War Two.
Now he and his brother married the same girl, and if you're still confused, my uncle married my grandma when my daddy was only 2. 

Grandpa Doc and Uncle Brooks would get along just fine. Hellraisin' in a '65 'Cuda, lovin' brothers til closing time. But her name came up, they'd go toe-to-toe, everybody'd hit the door.
By the time the Sheriff'd get to 'em, they'd be out cold on the floor. 

I do believe, they done passed it down, I'm out bird-doggin' chicks all over town. 
The Lord or the school won't do no good, I'm out getting' froggylike ever' hophead should.

Now when I was 13, my daddy left home, and it was plain to see---

Back when I was young and naïve, I wore my influences on my sleeve. Preached from the safety of my bedroom floor. Tried in vain to steer my peers away from superstition and fears. Only thing I learned was: always lock your door.

I'm not cynical, I've just seen too much. Sometimes I wonder why I even try. Only choice you got is where to eat your lunch, to have another slice of Fuck Pie.

He used to sleep in school, hopin' no one would call his name, as the teacher tried to turn 'em out all the same.  Get up every mornin', do the work you're expected to, and at night, sit and count the crumbs thrown to you.

Somewhere along the line, he'd been deceived. Get stoned, read the Bible, an' pretend he still believed.

Nothin' haunts a man like knowin' that he's free to choose. So he lets up off the gas when he thinks of all he's got to lose. 

Well, you work all day, live just like a slave. Hustlin' for a seat on the slow shuttle to the grave.

And you say
I talk so all the time, so

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah I missed you

And you say
I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention
To the distance
That you're running or to
Anyone anywhere

I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no no no, bad

So I, I turned the radio on,
Iturned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song
Lovers in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay

And some of us hover when we weep
For the other who was dying
Since the day they were born, well
Well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing
But I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever
But now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take me anyhow
Or anywhere,
With you

And you said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, ""hey, I can leave, I can leave""
Oh but now I know that I was wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you

You said, ""you caught me cause you want me
And one day I'll let you go""
You try to give away a keeper
Or keep me 'cause you know you're just so
Scared to lose

And you say,
""Stay""
You say
I only hear what I want to",Stay (I Missed You),

Por miedo a caer y mira me caí

Como en un manto, un manto lleno de armadilla
Mi cuerpo se ha bañado en el y sigo ahí
Y sigo ahí

Atrapada, enlazada, desde en fondo de mi ser

E dejado de llorar
En este instante

Te perdí dime si
Mentí nada es fácil
Y tendré que acostumbrarme
Me tarde de no sufrir

Y en mis ganas de vivir
Poco a poco ir intentando
Ser feliz, pero ahora

En realidad como duele
Que no estás como negar
Que estoy sin ti

Como voy a ser tendré
Que aprender pero sé que
Va a ser muy difícil
Yo lo sé

Te juro que en verdad
Me siento sola
Me siento sola
Estoy tan sola

Te juro que en verdad
Me siento sola

Qué fue de ti, a dónde fue
Todo se esfumó se nos perdió
Como un rayo de luz, no entiendo

Llego a la casa y ya no estás
Está tu espacio sin llenar
Nos faltas tú
Caso perdido si te vas

Tú que creías ser el dueño de mi vida
Ahora verás, no es tan fácil olvidar

No me verás
No me verás llorar por ti
Aunque me quiera yo morir
Por mi voy a sobrevivir, yo te lo juro

No me verás
No me verás hablar de ti
Serás un fantasma para mí
Me morderé los labios
En otros brazos me olvidaré de ti

Sin saber todo lo que fui
Se lo llevo esta soledad
Que se acabo en un dos por tres
Justo cuando él llegó

Tú que creías ser el dueño de mi vida
Ahora verás, no es tan fácil olvidar

No me verás
No me verás llorar por ti
Aunque me quiera yo morir
Por mi boya sobrevivir, yo te lo juro

No me verás
No me verás hablar de ti

Que te estoy amando

I'm tired of everyone

Well being alone now
It doesn't bother me
But not knowing if you are
That's been hell you see

So the day will begin again
Take comfort from me
It's up to you now
You're still here
And you'll dig in again
That's comfort to you
It's up to you now
So pariah you'll begin again
Take comfort from me
It will take time

Don't worry about a thing

And hang around just gathering her knees to place her chin upon them when I leave
I know some where's a girl who would wear hot pants and right now that might not be so bad
To have around I've seen normal people live but they don't have things to cope with like she did
Red lips I wrote all that you ever said forgive me if I've lost all that I could have had
I'll hold her hand she's still shady and the same but don't hold out for Paris in the rain

And that's a sure nice way to look at my pain
But I can't turn my head

And that's a sure nice way to look at my pain

Look at my pain
I can call my name out to the wind

When the wind is calling you
Still you call me an eyesore

And that's a sure nice way to look at my pain
But I can't turn my head

It wasn't paying,

We think that's funny,
You think I'm so cool,

We're in it for the money,
Guitars and tattoos,
You fell for it honey,

Ninety Pound Wuss,"Your substantial credibility
Isn't much a part of me
A spreading sickness, poor in taste
No sense of reality
Following the newest trend, it's cutting edge
So you pretend to believe ideals
And conform to rules of material opinions
We're all products of a manufactured generation
Controlled through television by sex and violence
Resist
We accept the obscene as average
Twisting all that our instincts are fighting for
Resist it
Man exploiting women, flesh, sex, skin, flash
We rape, we destroy all that's holy
Resist them
Flesh market society we digress
We fight to survive while
Destroying each other with selfishness
Lies of liberty and freedom
Hopes in something called democracy

Ninety Pound Wuss,"Crash triggers clinging chokers
Choking victory dry
Don't panic simply randomly
So what she has alzheimers
Mathematically epileptic
If she don't wet her pants first
The problem a constitution null and void
Who's to look for your disclaimer?
Get over it
The question then becomes fragmented
Jaded, or confused
Everyone gets together
Vibrations named ourselves
Don't cry this inauration day
Best pillows I ever felt
Is it fulfilling?
Collectivism, discipling, unionism
Trading souls to never fill your void
Labor $10 minimum
She's still dying and wets the bed again
Who's more frustrated?
Me or you or you or me
Take a look
What is conception
Some frivolous game puts children on the street
Her disease is still the same
Old and stiff and angry, birth to death
What have you left, but a small space inbetween
Don't waste your time it's short
Primal language of new born infants
Choking ignorant
Raised deaf, dumb and blind
Age old desire
In solitude of other brainwashed has-beens
Incontinent failure
None of us survive
Survive fire
We all die too young



",The Party's Over,1997
Ninety Pound Wuss,"A quick glance forward
Only lends a hard hand backwards
Leaning not on self alone
Yet feeling sufficient for life giving forces
Recklessness ends all possibility of future
In this dark age
We've destroyed through murmuring
Gestures which confront ourselves
And I cry out Lord take me now
I know it's the end
She said our time lasts
I guess she proved herself wrong
I thought I know the love of two
I forgot three makes a trinity
Three's a perfect union
I can sense the end in your eyes
I hear your thoughts in my memory
How could I forget
The close proximity of your face
I guess we all stumble sometimes
Lord I cry at your feet

The breath of life. 
The breath of life. 
I am weak from the fight and I can still hear them celebrating victory. 
Wiping the blood from my face. 
The pain creeps in taking over my thoughts. 
My spirit lays broken, shattered, shrouded by you. 
Your icy pale skin in the cemetery plot I dug for you. 
I push you in and I like it. 
Hating the darkness which becomes my flesh. 
Inside this shell you try to hide. 
Your still churning. mind and spirit burning. 
Torture love never fails. exception in your case. 
Failure comes quite naturally or so it seems. 
Fading in and out from black to white, to black to white again.

Qui affecte l'activation de mon système réticulaire

Ce qui veut dire?

Ca veut dire que je dors pas, jamais
Les yeux ouverts
Je pourrais pas vous dire il est quelle heure mais je suis réveillé

Somnambule, somnambule, je trouve pas de sommeil je baraude en voiture
Tu sens que c'est dur mais tu sens que c'est mûr, ils se grattent les veines je regratte le mur
J'ai gonflé j'ai rajouté de la levure, les porcs j'aime pas les voir
Je suis toujours à l'affût pour pas mettre mes clés et mes lacets dans la fouille
Y a comme une faille envoie la feuille, je la fume ou j'écris dessus
C'est le début du son mais c'est l'heure du décès
De l'autre côté c'est sombre, est-ce que tu le sais?
Un jour on va se ranger, on aime trop les sous
Mauvaise adolescence, allumette dans l'essence
P-38 Lyrical, ça court dans tous les sens
On sait qui fait quoi qui dit vrai
Je fume mon bédo je m'envole dans le ciel, je fume ton bédo j'ai une petite migraine
Tu vois ce que je veux dire à vrai dire chez vous ça sent la ille-ca à toute patate
Les frelons prennent des peines de fou malade, je vais barauder toute la night
Je suis avec le poto dans l'auto, ou avec Zaïko kholoto
Toi, ne fais pas le Toto Riina, ça ne te va pas
Sur nos joggings que des alligators, que de la frappa aller-retour Paris-Nador

Somnambule, somnambule, je trouve pas de sommeil je baraude en voiture
Je ne dors plus, oh je ne dors plus

Somnambule, somnambule, somnam-somnam-somnam-somnambule
Somnam-somnam-somnam-somnambule

Somnambule, somnambule, cerné par la fatigue
Sur le terrain comme Cavani, ne confonds pas les fans et les fanatiques
Je suis dans le hall les yeux bridés-bridés
Les stunts sont débridés-bridés donc on s'échappe quand c'est miné-miné
Des MC farcis au menu, coupé au schlass ou à mains nues
Si tu savais de quoi j'étais muni, tu risquerais de tomber des nues
Que des arnaques, des magouilles, des escroqueries comme les présidents de foot italien
Vous pensez qu'il y a haja, moi je vous dis qu'il y a rien
Qu'est ce tu croyais hein, qu'est ce tu croyais? Bien sûr que la fin justifie les moyens
Si tu brasses, tu brasses, les schmits voudront te noyer, au comico je ne serai jamais loyal
Rappelle plus tard poto je suis pas joignable, j'ai la vingtaine mais je mérite la place du doyen
La vingtaine mais je mérite la place du doyen, fils de putain mais qui t'a dit de me tutoyer?
Moi je vais salir, toi tu vas nettoyer ou bien niquer ta propre mère dans les toilettes
N.I.N, je te résume le rap en trois lettres
Le rap game j'ai bientôt fait le tour et je me sens comme Louis XVI en promenade dans sa cour
Chérie coco mon bébé d'amour, fais moi à graille et je te fais l'amour

J'me suis levé du pied gauche, la journée a très mal débuté
RDV chez la spi' après m'être fait jugé
La vie n'est pas un jeu, je n'tendrai pas l'autre joue (jamais)
Si je pars je reviendrais pour couvrir d'or le cou de ma re-mé
Précieuse re-pier, le plus beau des diamants sur sa te-tê
Mais, elle a beaucoup trop pleuré, elle fait comme si tout allait
Quand elle entend mon blouson s'refermer, elle me dit à tout à l'heure
Ben ouais, son fils a grandi, il entame la vingtième année
Et il y a que les photos qui lui rappelleront le passé
Il faudra se débrouiller charbonner ramasser les billets
Compter, compter, recompter, jeunesse égarée qui trouvera le sourire dans le papier
Je ne regrette rien comme Edith, je ne fais que chanter ma peine dans mes titres
J'médite et j'me dis que si j'fais des hits, j'aurai du liquide
La mort ou la prison, comme dirait Kery
Mais avant ma mort pour ma mère,
C'est les plus belles roses que j'irai cueillir
Courir après le temps ça ne sert à rien, ça ne sert à rien
Ça ne sert à rien
Si la porte est fermée j'ai la clé de sol, j'ai pas besoin d'un serrurier
Laise couler le piano et fais rentrer la basse
Assis au fond du bus, je dois rouler ma bosse et je me casse
Et l’œil tu me le portes pour que mes projets tombent à l'eau
Mais la lumière va t'aveugler
La vie n'est pas un rêve bleu, mais un cauchemar noir quand j'ouvre les yeux

Noyer ma peine dans la mélodie, je ne sais faire que ça
Et si ma mère le savait, est-ce qu'elle serait fière de moi?
C'est la question que j'me pose, quand je rentre à la maison
Est-ce qu'elle trouvera que son fils est bon ou qu'il a perdu la raison?
Maman, t'inquiètes je gère, j'assume comme un bonhomme
Ton sourire, ça vaut de l'or, donc je creuse encore
J'ai tellement mal mais je fais comme si je ne voyais rien
Attiré par les biens matériels de ce monde
Je rentre dans la banque pour rafler tous tes gains
Le c-sa rempli en 80 secondes
Et mon père m'a dit on retiendra le premier, malheureusement on oubliera le second
Mais c'est ça la vie, t'as que deux amis
Et sur un des deux, t'as peut être un ennemi
Donc je me méfie et je vérifie avant de t'appeler la famille

Je ferme mes yeux et je rêve du paradis
Les ignorants pensent qu'on a qu'une vie
Je suis venu poussière je repartirais poussière
On s'enterre pas tout seul
La vie c'est pas facile, perdu sans boussole
Perdu sans boussole, les condés viendront retourner mon domicile
Oui j'assume, mes galères, mes ennuis, c'est ma vie
Mes idées négatifs, le sheitan est rentré
Pour oublier mes gars tisent du cool-al mélangé
Mais là-haut c'est trop tard pour lui dire désolé
Alléluia, alléluia, moi j'ai connu la bagarre le trou noir
Mais j'ai la foi, ça pue la mort dans le couloir
Solo dans le brouillard, solo dans le brouillard
Je suis à l’église dans les louange et mes khoyas font des dou3as
Les péchés s'accumulent le diable les stimule
J'ai pris du recul j'suis dans ma bulle, mon entourage ne me voit plus

J'en perd mes mots je repense à ma vie, est-ce je fais le bon choix?
Mais pas le temps de regretter, tu peux garder tes mouchoirs
Sous le préau de la primaire au collège, il y a que le Trés-Haut qui me connait
Il sait ce que j'ai commis, il sait ce que je suis capable de commettre
Surement des actes pas très catholique, pour éviter situation chaotique
On naît on meurt on meurt on vit, la réalité m'empêche de rêver
Conseil du daron pour pas dériver, Maman, Maman, j'ai mal à la vie
Maman, Maman, j'ai mal à la vie, j'ai des armes parce que j'ai des rivaux
Et j'ai tant crié dans mes prières, tout va mal depuis la traite négrière
Et la cité n'est pas née hier, elle a baisé le grand et le petit frère
C'est le ciel ou les flammes, on a pé-cou les grammes, on a écoulé ça
Fait du bénéf', payé des femmes, le jugement dernier sera chaud
Mais tout ira mieux d'ici là
En attendant je fume la médicinale
Faut que je me repentisse, que mes péchés s'annulent
P't-être qu'on s'en sortira pas si mal

À tes armes et d'la schnouf, d'la racaille, des cagoules

Dans le rre-ve, je remets du Baileys, et j'm'arrache de là si ça sent la lose
Fais pas l'fou si t'es pas ouf, fais pas l'fou si t'es pas ouf

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Thanks for coming to my studio apartment
Got some shit to say (that's right)

The times we've had
The times we've missed
The times we've embraced
And the times we've kissed
The times we've loved
And the times we've laughed
Now it's time
To accept my shaft

Wo-oah

The times we've spent
The times we've shared
The times we've shown each other
Just how much we care
The times we've lived
All the times for reflection
Now you must survive

I can be myself around (oooo-ooooo-oo-oooh)
I've come undone you are the only one (oooo-ooooo-oo-oooh)
Who can lift my heart up off the ground (oooo-ooooo-oo-oooh)

The times behind
The times foretold
Forgive me if I'm being
Just a bit too bold
But our sweet love
Won't be forsaken
Once you are
Gargling my bacon

Ooh, the times we've seen
And the times ahead
Grab a couple pillows
And get on that bed
You'll want to lay back
And clear your calendar
Once I introduce you to my friend
Excalibur

'Cause you lift my heart up off the ground (ooo-ooooo-oo-oooh)

But it was quiet because in space there is no sound
Did we mention that this took place in space?
It did, so shut your face
Also, there were robots and sharks

Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's a goddamn dinosaur laser fight!
In space, with sharks, it's a balls-out dinosaur laser fight!

It's fucking science!
Just ask Albert Einstein, he invented space

And then a bunch of fucking aliens from Mars
Showed up all ripping solos on V-neck guitars
The dinos, sharks, and robots saw they came in peace
So they killed them with lasers

As I approach, you see that the stallion is, in fact, Ninja Brian

With eyes of flame and teeth of steel

And then teach the class

And then he'll kick your feet with his gigantic ass
Don't give him sass

He ate a whole guy with his face and didn't even chew
Turns out that guy was you
And yet you're there
There can only be one explanation
And that's that you're a zombie
Now I'm scared

It's not like there wasn't enough on my mind
With the Manticore

Manticore, where are you now?
Are you gone forever?
Oh no, wait, there you are

And then he'll steal your soul
He'll have a threesome with them both

Our relationship has deepened
In a spiritual way

As time swept gently forward
And winters turned to spring
I know you so much better
'Cause I've fucked all your things

I put my package in your mailbox
Made love to all your chairs
Dropped a load inside your washer
I went down on all your stairs

I took your cabinets from the front, and
Your sofa from behind
I looked deep into your vacuum's eyes
And then we sixty-nined

Thanks in advance for
Not judging me, or
This aspect of my soul
When I dick-smash all of your belongings
Is when I'm finally whole

I boned your couches and your telephone
And all your scented candles
And your dictionary, fishtank, and the pictures on the mantle

I had sex with your whole kitchen
With no boundaries or limits
And your lamp was looking so good
That you know I had to hit it

Your wallet and your toothbrush
And your jacket and your red hat
Oh, you're mad about the toothbrush?
Just forget I ever said that

And your carpet and your furniture
Your windows and the curtains
And I licked your stamp collection
I dicked your floor for certain

And give them the details of how it went down, uhh

I'll get my captain's hat, put on my floaties
And we'll set for sexy seas, for at least

I invited a large number of girls over here for an orgy tonight 
But I have to say the responses thus far haven’t been exactly what I’d hoped for

Stacy had a headache
Jenny was in jail 
Brenda had to work late
Kate was getting Jenny’s bail

Angela got scurvy
Ashley caught a cold
Sally’s dad exploded
That’s what I was told

Michelle had to play checkers
Ann was baking pies
Wendy’s dad exploded too
That might’ve been a lie

Pam had frisbee lessons
Stella had ballet
Now I’m by myself
But I can have fun anyway, so

Dim, dim the lights (The lights)
Remove my tights 
Yeah! 

Nobody showed but I’m gonna have some fun
Let’s get this party started it’s an orgy for one
It’s me and my hand and it’s hotter than the sun
So break out the tissues it’s an orgy for one
I’m workin’ out my issues in an orgy for one

Margaret’s cat got nauseous
Jane was way too shy 
Steve was not invited 
Because he was a guy

Claire was parasailing
Brooke said she was in space
But it doesn’t matter
'Cause I’m rounding second base

All through the night
My grasp is tight 
Oh

I’m beating so hard you’d think I was a drum
And I don’t even care it’s an orgy for one
I’m here all alone and I’m tuggin on my plums
It’s not just masturbation, it’s an orgy for one
It’s a fuckin’ celebration, it’s an orgy for one

Orgy for one (Orgy for one)

Sixty nine 
Without the nine
Now pour the wine 
I’m mine all mine

I’m batting a thousand and nailing everyone
Thank you everybody at this orgy for one
These pillows are stacked to look vaguely like a butt
You know I’m goin for it, it’s an orgy for one

Ninja Sex Party,"King Danny, the realm is under attack!
My God
The day has finally come
It is time to release the kraken!

Look in the distance
Beyond the castle gates
The armies of the damned have come
On the horizon
They gather beneath the blood red sun, the blood red sun

A thousand warriors
Demons and orcs, charging like a tornado
But they will never know
That their death awaits in waves below, in the waves blow

We must now unleash the monster
May God forgive us!

Release the kraken!
Hey guys
The tolling of the iron bell
Release the kraken!
I'm the kraken!
Calls upon the depths of hell
Grrrah!
Does anyone have a lozenge?

Out on the battlefield
The armies collide
And hundreds die where they stand
In screaming agony
The shadow of war across the land, all across the land

Now they turn to fight
It's time to decide whose blood will finally be spilled
Our secret weapon
A specter of hate who's born to kill, he was born to kill

The time is now! Go forth, kraken!
Leave nothing but corpses!

Release the kraken!
I'm in a song!
A creature of Satanic rage
Release the kraken!
Who wants sandwiches?
Bursting from its sinking cage

Release the kraken!
Hey, look, I found a bell!

Release the kraken!

Impervious to sword or bow
Release the kraken!
I've got a splinter
To become the warrior lord

All should drown in his domain

Ninja Sex Party,"A lot of people don't know this but I, Danny Sexbang 
Have been quietly working on the sexiest romance novel ever 
For the past sixteen years
I would like to share a taste of it with you now
Please enjoy this excerpt from my deeply sensual tale
""Claudia Goes to Schlongtown: Part 6, The Erectening""
Ninja Brian, would you?

""I love penis!"" Claudia said to Jeff
Seductively caressing both of her yamyams
""Allow me to get you some from the kitchen"" 
Jeff said with a twinkle in his eye
""No, not peanuts Jeff! Those aren't the nuts I'm interested in"" 
She grabbed him on the penis-iest part of his body
""But a peanut isn't a nut,"" Jeff mansplained. ""It's a legume.""

Woah Brian, what's the problem?

What do you mean it's not romantic? 
I'm an amazing lover and I've lived through this exact scenario hundreds of times

""I feel like we're getting off-topic Jeff"" Claudia said 
""But now that you mention it, I could go for a peanut butter sandwich""
""Penis butter? I don't think I have any of that."" Jeff groaned, hornily

Eat dicks Brian! This is romantic as fuck! Do not throw that piano at me again

Fine! I'll cut ahead to the end of the chapter

Claudia and Jeff lay naked in the penis butter tub 
On top of the Empire State Building 
Their bodies entwined like two sexlampreys

""Should we invite Ninja Brian over?"" Claudia asked
""No!"" Jeff yelled
""Ninja Brian sucks and his face is lame 
And he's stupid and his dick is so small that""

Not the piano!

It's not enough to just be the world's most amazing lover
You also have to be a smooth talker
Well, of course I know how to talk to women!
Give me a delicious groove, this is what I tell them

Girl, I'm gonna take my flang-diddly out and slam it your flump
That's right
Then, without a sound, I'll run my tongue all up and down your horse pa-cunk
You like that?
Then, I'll flip you 'round and lay you down
And rub my canck up on your schmears (all over your schmears)
Your cliver will start to quiver
When I grab your slinky noo-putts by the veera

(Oh!) open your heart and give me a taste off your fork
I'm gonna lightly stroke your flendel till you twerk
Then I will gently flick your turffles, baby!
Till you scream ""oh my God I'm gonna crumble it so hard!""

Plenty more where that came from

But it doesn't seem natural to me
That you can walk away from the love we made
Here in Tennessee

And leave everything that we worked for
To start a brand new life
I saw you drive across the Memphis bridge
But I don't believe my eyes

Oh, I can see Arkansas across the Mississippi
I can see a big river barge headin' down to new Orleans
I can see the cotton fields on the other side
And the sun going down again

Oh, I can see Arkansas
But I still don't see
Why the love we had should end

If it proved how much I love you
I'd swim this ol' river tonight
I'd bet my soul against the undertow
For the chance to hold you tight

But there's more than a river between us
And I can't swim that far
And as hard as I try I just can't drown

I looked into your eyes I couldnt deny
Those hips those thighs
Make me wanna eat you up like my mama's pie 
I'd be like 40 days and 40 nights just to make you my queen
You make a fool of a man turn him straight when you hit the scene
I'm like a voter girl you got me rock hard
Ide be like a baby boy with a brand new toy tear you hard
You got me slobbering, drewling
Thinking X rated
You always on my mind and oohh I just hate it
You butt nakid with water glistening all over your body
Visoins of us ice crust getting naughty
Heavenly father forgive me for theses type of sins
But this girl that I feel is under my skin

Looking at me weird like you want some

Look at me now I'm making millions
Split my style 'cause you know its different
Tell me girl what's really going on
Body so good got me feeling
You know I never be teasing
Baby back it up in my direction
Give it to me to have our own session

Sex on the beach is my prediction
Got me dreaming, sceaming

Don't know the reason its open season
So cold I'm freazing but I'm not seasing
So go ahead and give me your pleasing

Dans un bête de combat là j'recompte mes billets
Lève ta grosse tête de con, vois le talent briller

Busqué tu mirada y no la hallé

La lluvia ha dejado de caer
Sentado en la playa del olvido
Formé con la arena tu imagen serena
Tu pelo con algas dibujé

Y busqué entre tus cartas amarillas
Mil te quiero, mil caricias
Y una flor que entre dos hojas se durmió
Y mis brazos vacíos se cerraban
Aferrándose a la nada, intentando detener mi juventud

Al fin hoy he vuelto a la verdad
Mis manos vacías te han buscado
La hiedra ha crecido, el sol se ha dormido
Te llamo y no escuchas ya mi voz

Y busqué entre tus cartas amarillas
Mil te quiero, mil caricias
Y una flor que entre dos hojas se durmió
Y mis brazos vacíos se cerraban

Si yo viví como todos
Soñando, soñando
Y conseguí lo que tengo
Luchando, luchando. 

Por qué no puedo encontrar un amor
Como tú o como aquel 
Si yo soy igual
Por qué no puedo obtener felicidad
Por qué no puedo encontrar un amor
Como tú o como aquel 
Si yo soy igual.",Como Todos,1994
Nino Bravo,"Donde brilla el tibio sol
Con un nuevo fulgor dorando las arenas
Donde el aire es limpio aún
Bajo la suave luz de las estrellas

Donde el fuego se hace amor
El río es hablador y el monte es selva
Hoy encontré un lugar para los dos
En esta nueva tierra

América
(América, América)
Es América
(América, América)

Todo un inmenso jardín
Eso es América
Cuando Dios hizo el Edén
Pensó en América

Cada nuevo atardecer
El cielo empieza a arder y escucha el viento
Que me trae con su canción
Una queja de amor como un lamento

El perfume de una flor
El ritmo de un tambor en las praderas
Danzas de guerra y paz
De un pueblo que aún no ha roto sus cadenas

América
(América, América)
Es América
(América, América)

Todo un inmenso jardín
Eso es América
Cuando Dios hizo el Edén
Pensó en América

(América, América)
Es América
(América, América)

Todo un inmenso jardín
Eso es América
Cuando Dios hizo el Edén
Pensó en América

Libre!!! como el ave que escapo de su prision why puede alfin volar.
Libre!!! como el viento que recoje mil lamentos why libertad.
camino sin sesar detras de la verdad
why saber lo que es al fin la libertad.

And as I sit here in the comfort of my cozy chair 
My fancy takes me to a humble eastside tenement 
Three flights up in the rear to where my childhood days were spent

There sat the sweetest angel, one that I fondly call 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles 
Oh I know that I owe what I am today 
To that dear little lady so old and gray 
To that wonderful yiddishe momme of mine

Pero quedaste en mi alma, mi alma
Por más que brille la luna en mi ventana
Si no estas todo me falta, me falta

Paso tras paso
Yo se que te vas acercando a mi
Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar
Siempre aquí

Vuelve, que yo te sigo esperando
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Es hora de pensar en un cuerpo real
Que no desaparezca entre mis manos
Que yo pueda sentir, que yo pueda tocar
Como la melodía de un piano

Si quieres, vamos, nos cojemos
Nos tiramos, nos merecemos
Nos maltratamos
Sin lavarnos las manos, cariño
A veces no basta con que queramos

Digo tu nombre de nuevo
Y a veces creo, que estoy perdiendo la calma, la calma
Y cada noche despierto cuando siento
Tu voz que siempre me llama, me llama

Paso tras paso
Yo se que te vas acercando a mí
Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar
Siempre aquí

Vuelve, que yo te sigo esperando
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Un beso flotando en el aire nos quedara
Mi amor, te pienso
No me dejes de pensar

En cada radio del barrio, suena mi canción
Quiero que llegue a tu casa y tu corazón
Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado

Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado
Vuelve, vuelve

Nino Bravo,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1995

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only `cos you're lonely they have blamed you

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Nino Brown,"Intro:
[Frost]: This is a dramatization. The names have been changed to protect
the innocent ones not involved in the stories I'm about to tell. So 
listen up and listen up well. Here are the true accounts and incidents 
and still to me, it makes no sense. Ignorance is a major role, but 
here's a fact I feel you can ignore no more. 

Verse One:  Frost

Homicide, on the murder scene
Another frustrated gang-related senseless slaying
Victim: a young product of the project system
The sad fact is nobody's gonna miss him
True, a few may stand in disbelief, but
The majority will sigh a relief
Because of the fact he was a menace to society
And gang violence was his first priority
So, now you take a look to see what this abouta
Someone quicka with the trigga, straight cold shot him
Dead, in a puddle of blood he lay,
Another typical day in the streets of L. A. 

Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene

Verse Two:  Frost
Ho-Homicide, and just for trying to act brave
Tryin' to be a hero sent you to a early grave
The violent death, it took place at around six
And eyewitnesses say that it went like this, 
There was this lady who was chillin' in a alley
Positive I.D. included that her name was Sally
Sally had just got off the bus from a job,
When she met three young thugs who decided to rob
A man heard the screams comin' from her mouth
Ran down the deserted alley just to check it out
And when he came across the scene,
He knew what was happenin', but by then it was too late
The thugs started blastin'
Now, asked in this situation, exactly what would you do?
If you heard someone screaming, would you go to the rescue?
My man, he tried, that's hwo he died
He was shot right between the eyes
Tryin' to do a good deed, shoot, that could've been me
I'm glad I'm not the one who must explain this to his family

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder 
scene 
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Break it down!

Verse Three:  Frost
Homicide, it's also know as manslaughter
It can be a father, mother, son, or daughter
It can happen at anyplace, at anytime
It can happen as I'm runnin' down this rhyme
First degree murder, blood flows red
One day you're alive, the next day, you're dead
Nobody seen nothin', the suspect fled
Shot on the spot with a bullet to the head
As soon as it happened, everybody broke
Nobody seen nothin', and of course nobody spoke
Bein' questioned, it doesn't pay to rat-a-tat-tat
For if you rat, you might too get the gat,
And get added to the list of those who fatally died
In the statistics, that's known as homicide

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder

Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder 
scene 
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene

Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder 
scene

Got my back love even when I caught a case
I know the tears you cried why you can't sleep at night

Writting love letters sealed with a kiss
Sprayed with perfume so I could reminice about the good old days and the way we've changed
But one thing hasn't I'm still your man

Your my lady baby boo and I'm your guy

Nino de Angelo,"E cosi' te ne vai,
forse, mi mancherai
non si puo' stare soli
amo te, niente piu'

e non c'e' piu' bisogno d'inventare
le sere per poterti divertire
la scusa dei blue jeans che fanno male
per poi finire sempre a far l'amore.

E non c'e' piu' la luna che ti guarda
l'avevi detto tu che e' un po' bugiarda
il vento che portava il tuo sapore
la voglia matta di ricominciare.

Piangerai? Forse si', forse no, se non piangi tu
Scriverai? Forse si', forse no, se mi scrivi tu
Dove andrai? Forse qua, forse la', ti ritrovero'
Ci sarai? Forse solo un momento ti aspettero'

E non ti posso dire piu' domani
ripeti mille volte che mi ami
sei dolce tu che prendi la mia mano
lo sai che come te non c'e' nessuno.

Nino de Angelo,"Quella sua maglietta fina
Tanto stretta al punto che m'immaginavo tutto
E quell'aria da bambina
Che non glie'ho detto mai ma io ci andavo matto
E chiare sere d'estate, il mare, i giochi, le fate
E la paura e la voglia di essere nudi
Un bacio a labbra salate, un fuoco, quattro risate
E far l'amore giù al faro
Ti amo davvero, ti amo lo giuro, ti amo, ti amo davvero

E lei
Lei mi guardava con sospetto
Poi mi sorrideva e mi teneva stretto, stretto
Ed io
Io non ho mai capito niente
Visto che oramai non me lo levo dalla mente
Che lei, lei era

Un piccolo grande amore
Solo un piccolo grande amore
Niente più di questo niente più
Mi manca da morire
Quel suo piccolo grande amore
Adesso che saprei cosa dire
Adesso che saprei cosa fare
Adesso che voglio un piccolo grande amore

Quella camminata strana
Pure in mezzo a chissacchè l'avrei riconosciuta
Mi diceva ""Sei una frana""
Ma io questa cosa qui mica l'ho mai creduta
E lunghe corse affannate incontro a stelle cadute
E mani sempre più ansiose di cose proibite
E le canzoni stonate urlate al cielo lassù
""Chi arriva prima a quel muro""
Non sono sicuro se ti amo davvero
Non sono, non sono sicuro

E lei
Tutto ad un tratto non parlava
Ma le si leggeva chiaro in faccia che soffriva
Ed io
Io non lo so quant'è che ha pianto
Solamente adesso me ne sto rendendo conto
Che lei, lei era

Devant ce que maintenant tu sais,
Tu n’as pas trente-six solutions,
Tu n’as le choix qu’entre ces deux voies,
Il faudra bien que tu en arrives là.
Tu peux choisir de ne plus penser
Qu’à ce qu’on a déjà pensé pour toi,
En regardant ton cinéma.
Ou bien tu peux te sentir mal
Et découvrir autre chose en toi,
Caché sous un tas de conneries,
Qu’on a mis là pour faire joli,
Le dégoût, la nécessité,
La peur de ne plus jamais trouver
Ce qu’il faudra pour commencer :
L’an 2000, l’an demain,
L’an 2000, l’an demain.

Avoir une autre liberté
Que la liberté de choisir
Entre pouvoir mourir de faim
Ou pouvoir vivre comme un chien.
Pouvoir t’aimer, t’aimer, t’aimer,
T’aimer bien,
Qui que tu sois, d’où que tu viennes.
Être le Dieu dont nous sommes les idées,
Car il n’existe pas
Si tu ne lui prêtes la vie,
Même si toi, tu n’existes pas sans lui.
Pouvoir t’aimer, t’aimer, t’aimer,
T’aimer bien,
Pouvoir t’attendre et commencer :

L’an 2000, l’an demain.

Plonger dans cet autre univers
Que je sens là, tout près de moi,
Dans ce miroir à double fond
Qui nous attire, et qui nous fuit.

C’est en l’apprenant qu’on l’apprend.

Le monde est tendre et différent,
La mer est calme, on part à l’aventure,
Pour le meilleur et pour le pire.

Voilà le printemps qui se lève,
Il en faut vingt pour l’achèvement,
Lune et dollars, matraque et rêves,
La matraque, c’est ce qui prend plus longtemps.

On fait la croix sur ce qui reste,
La croix de guerre évidemment,
Ensemble il faudra vaincre, ou bien subir
Tout le meilleur et tout le pire.

Et puis voilà le soir tombe,
Après deux heures, après cent ans,
C’est une question sans importance,
Ce n’est qu’une question de temps.

Allons gaiement vers le destin,

Oui oui oui Sylvie »

Arrête un peu ta sacrée machine 
J'entends quelque chose qui ne tourne pas rond 
Dans un de tes systèmes bidons
Mais arrête, t'es con, mais freine 
""Je ne peux pas la manette est coincée!"" 

Et puis le temps qui passe, et les traces de tout s'effacent
Oublie Nostradamus

À Tchernobyl 
Tout est tranquille 
Endors-toi sur tes deux oreilles 
S'il y a quelque chose je te réveille
Si je ne dis rien c'est que tout va bien 
Comme dit le professeur Pellerin

Et s'il arrivait un malheur 
Il y a les unions de consommateurs
Je n'ai pas peur, j'ai fait mon temps 
Mais je regrette pour les enfants 
Mais peut-être que tout ira bien 
Qu'on aura des matins sereins 
Dans un univers différent
Moi, j'aimais bien celui d'avant 
Avec des arbres et des jardins 
De la musique faite à la main
Et puis quelques ordinateurs 
Comme domestiques, pas comme seigneurs
Alors viens, oublions tout ça
Nous ne sommes que de pauvres rats 
Oublions tout, sauf la passion 
Juste le temps d'une illusion 
Comme disait Jacques le Magicien
Viens mélanger ton corps au mien

Nous ferons des feux d'artifice

Sa vie fut pathétique, problématique, pathologique

Cela devait commencer
Lors de son baptême
Car sa tante d'Angoulême
S'appelait Zoé!
On la nomma donc Justine
Pauvre gamine
On avait dans cette maison
L'esprit de contradiction!

Son père était ivrogne, sa mère indigne, son frère au bagne
Elle était opprimée, abandonnée, désespérée

Mais cette famille perverse
Lui parut être divine
Quand elle en fut orpheline
Par un sort adverse!
Elle avait juste quinze ans
Plus de maman
Elle dut se mettre au labeur
Et ce fut son premier malheur!

Mais le travail est triste, l'effort funeste, la sueur néfaste
Lasse de se morfondre et de se restreindre, elle voulut se vendre!

Elle se mit à courir les rues
Des quartiers spécialisés
Avec des robes osées
Et des clins d'œil corrompus
Pour attirer les caves
Elle devint lascive
Elle leur prit toute leur monnaie
Et elle manquait de moralité!

Mais c'était couru d'avance, elle n'eut pas de chance dans cette expérience
Car allant de mal en pire, un jour à Saint-Lazare elle se trouva mère!

Elle connut alors des temps
D'inquiétude et de misère
Car les enfants se suivirent
Extramatrimonialement!
C'est alors qu'elle comprit
Que bien mal acquis
Ne profite jamais
Et elle l'avait bien mérité!

Seule avec ses enfants de pères indifférents, elle n'avait plus d'argent
Pour les rutabagas, la soupe au tapioca et les petits extras

Elle voulut donc en finir
Avec cette vie précaire
Et dans un vieux monastère
S'en alla pour y périr!
Elle avait au préalable
Geste abominable
Dans une station de métro
Abandonné ses marmots!

Ceux-ci, comme on le pense, n'eurent pas de chance dans l'existence
Ils furent opprimés, excommuniés, homicidés!

Ce fut une triste famille

Nino Ferrer,"""Bon, voilà ton plan"" dit-elle 
""Tu vas te lever avec tes longues jambes de cow-boy 
Pour appuyer sur la gâchette de la lampe"" 
Et elle se retourna sur le ventre pour se préparer à dormir

C'était à Rome, dans la petite maison de la Campanella
Avec le bruit des gens qui réparaient des voitures dans la rue
Ou qui construisaient des meubles 
Et d'autres choses bruyantes et pittoresques
Il faisait chaud et beau 
Et le tendre vent qui venait des rues à l'ombre 
Caressait ses jambes et ses cuisses 
Car elle était nue sous sa robe bleue 
Et se tordait les chevilles en marchant 
Sur les pavés 
De ses talons trop hauts 
Pour une aussi jeune fille

Mais c'était avant qu'elle ne mente
Avant qu'elle ne fasse l'amour 

Avec un autre mec, avec qui elle le faisait déjà 
Avant qu'elle ne le fasse avec moi 
Et après ça ne pouvait plus être exactement comme c'était avant",Le Plan de Rome,2006

Losing their strength and form
Sixty year man on twenty year old skin
Skeleton, your eyes have lost their warmth
Look to your father for some support

[Chorus]
Hush, hush, hush

Says your daddy's touch
Sleep sleep sleep
Says the hundredth sheep
Peace peace peace
May you go in peace

Cruel joke you waited so long to show
The one that you wanted wasn't a girl
All your life you kept it hidden inside
Now when you step
You stumble
You die

Wake up tomorrow, Alexander the great

Niño Josele,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?

And when we go we won't go slow we'll put up such a fight
When they fade into the dust and into ash
But all children know this pain will surely pass
Strong and wise and you are love
And When the tide it come you will float above and
And you will be one day exactly what you are
Just keep your head up high kiss your fist and touch the sky

Too late to keep the world from dying this time
Too late to spread the love you have
One day when we are ready for crying
One day I know that we'll be there

Too Late

The sound we hear it is our hearts they are the time
They're marching clear and swift the beat forever in our mind
It gives us hope it gives us strength you know to carry on
Keep fighting till the end and past the end you will be strong

Too late to keep the world from dying this time
Too late to spread the love you shared
And one day, ooh, we'll all be there

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yes we will",Kiss the Sky,2007
Nino Rossano,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1977

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind

I could live without love

Just friends, but not like before

Breathing my name with a sigh

Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet

Ninos Cantores,"El camino que lleva a Belén
Baja hasta el valle que la nieve cubrió
Los pastorcillos quieren ver a su Rey,
Le traen regalos en su humilde zurrón
Al Redentor, al Redentor

Yo quisiera poner a tu pies
Algún presente que te agrade Señor,
Más tú ya sabes que soy pobre también,
Y no poseo más que un viejo tambor
(rom pom pom pom, rom pom pom pom)
En tu honor frente al portal tocaré
Con mi tambor

Voy marcando con mi viejo tambor,
Nada hay mejor que yo pueda ofrecer,
Su ronco acento es un canto de amor

Ninth Hour,"E, that all this time has passed us
And all we were has left us, wishing we were there again
We're all older now, but we still fall down and scrape our knees

Well I can't believe that all these lines keep getting deeper
I watch children become fathers as their mothers weep
And I can see somehow, that it's all about here and now
But I feel something rushing over me and I'm alive
I'm alive
I feel something rushing over me and I'm alive
I'm alive
Thank God I'm alive

You're speaking to me through the beauty of creation
From the highest elevation, to the depths of seas
So I'm not afraid to face this life of brevity

'Cause I feel something rushing over me and I'm alive
I'm alive
I feel something rushing over me and I'm alive 
I'm alive
Thank God I'm alive

Y que la tengo bien loca, sola se toca

Me mata cuando gritas y te pones en cuatro patas

Desde aquella noche que te entregaste
Tú también quieres repetir desde que probaste
No digas que no, lo noté por más que disimulaste
Desde que te vi, tú me gustaste
Toma diez mil pesos, vete pa'l mall, pa' que los gastes
Inolvidable, yo soy un cazador y tú eres una fiera indomable

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

May our legacies live forever, huh

All my niggas quiet but we burning loud
Makaveli to the max: never turn it down
Mac 11 in a Benz: how you like me now?
I run the city so my closet look like Nike Town
Niggas talking like bitches, is it my income?
Am I fucking your bitches? Is it official?
My nigga did a dime, didn't learn a thing from it
Came home, in two weeks got him a 600
Get a text from the boss: you know them bricks coming
Chicks at the beach house like they gonna miss something
From the churches I rose, only loving the dough
From the Chevy to Rolls, now it's fur on the floor
Smoke an ounce of the truth: that's my fountain of youth
R.I.P. to Mr. Shakur, this one is for you
Nippsey Hussle and I got my nigga Stalley on it
Double MG burning out in Cali on it

Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental
Keys got me sentimental

These rap books buried in gold
The treasure of a million men, Versace shades trimmed in gold
My life's big like them cameras explode
Capture this rags to riches story that I unfold
The youth fountain for the few counting
Made money, but who's counting?
It's hard stunting living in subsidized housing
Every bag you bring though the door, dude's counting
And every new girl you bring through, dude's hounding
They want your youth, so they watch your moves
From your pinky ring, down to how you lace your shoes
Rope chains with the precious jewels
The dope game had impression rules
What they did with cocaine and a couple spoons
Had the whole hood acting like goons
Trying to be the richest, trying to the be fliest
Claim to be balling, end up like Len Bias
Screaming from the bottom of this fountain here, nothing but silence

Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental
Keys got me sentimental

Laces in my blue Chucks, represent my bros first
Staring at my Rollie bezel as I soul-search
Run this money marathon til my soles hurt
But no materials could measure what my soul's worth
I wanted everything, feel like I had no choice
Young niggas wishing on a star like Rose Royce
Being honest, killing mamas when we sold work
I made a promise, give me options and I cold-turkey
Sick of sitting on the side while it's game point
Recurring dream, tryna scream but ain't had no voice
Crazy lady speaking tongues said it's gon' work
Never vocalize my visions, actions was my spokesperson
Study rich niggas' moves like my homework
Sacrilegious; however, streets was my own church

Lost in the instrumental

I had love for this music but ain't know how to pursue it,
Was frustrated as a teen I needed money for Buicks,
My shirt was stained from the sewage,
Niggas rockin' the newest,
I dealt with it for the moment but couldn't call it the future,
I'm down a block from the shootin',
It started to sound like recruitin',
Seein' niggas I grew up with sleep to funeral music,
And I was only fifteen,
I parted ways with my schoolin',
My first seven grams of work were like my holy communion and now I'm turnt out,
The block hot, niggas burnt out,
With no heart it's cold cash that we search out,
We got rules we hear shots then we 'sperse out,
Retaliation, get back exactly what the turf bout,
And it's a gang of young niggas I was hurt 'bout
On the real I almost shed tears in the church house
Back when I thought real niggas couldn't die
Learnt I was wrong but still couldn't cry

Somebody tell me why (why)
Why the good die young (why)
Sometimes it makes me cry (cry)

Since everybody trill, where the flakers at?
Trynta break 'em down, where the tables at?
Dufflebag full of cash like, where Vegas at?
Crap tables, life's a gamble, but a nigga won!
Now I'm lookin' round like, what have a nigga done?
My lord my God, I'm used to hustlin' hard
Guess they find it odd how a nigga beat the odds
No Illuminati never been a fan of saints
That's what happens when you room big as central station
Same rubber band my cousin tied her braids with
We ain't cop the same car my auntie played spades with
What you know about five eatin' off a half
That's five mu'fuckas now you do the math

Level four, y'all live and give in to false imprisonment
Listen close my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours my nigga
Since elementary we close my nigga
You're straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back

Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Ams
I'm at the premiere politicking with Top, Nip, and Snoop, damn
Pac watchin' the way we grove, dedication

If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look what Nipsey? (Hol' up)

Look, this ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals, I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to their amazement
I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be stay safe, now it's stay dangerous
'Cause ain't no point in playing defense nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end nigga
Without a life jacket
Couple mil, tour the world, dogg my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heights backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin', dedication
It's dedication",Dedication,2018

Nipsey Hussle,"I put my right hand to God
Shine on these broads
Stay on my job, grind with my squad
Hundred racks on my car, no license at all
No tint on that thing, nigga, 'cause that's how we ball
All these fuck niggas' flawed, suckas' and frauds
My circle so small, stick to my script and just ball
First, I pick up my bitch, and we shut down the mall
Had to pick up the tip, she tried to pay for it all
Bring some Yac' with my plate, garlic noodles and steak
Bouncin' out the ballet, with all these tats' on my face
People looking like, ""hey!"", black nigga' stay in your place
But it's some shit they gon' think, and it's some shit they gon' say
Got to a brick from an eighth
See that music's my fate
Switched it out from out my trunk, went to the top of my state
And I Versace'd my waist, like 2Pac in his hey'
Brian Williams, how I built this All Money Estate, quote

I put my right hand to God
I put my right hand to God

Put my right hand to Jesus
Fly like a eagle
Fight with these demons, shine light on my people
This life is a free throw, success is a kilo
My wife is a c-note, but my mistress is Creole
I sip on that Clicquot, while I'm banging that Z-Ro
Ghetto nigga' like Cheeto's, that got more famous than Cee-lo
Turn legit from illegal, just like Pesci in Casino
Get JS off of prole, watch him blow up like C-4
I rose from a Regal, Auroras and Lincoln's
Low-pros on Alpina's, to German drop-top two seaters
Was young and prestigious, phone was matching my beeper
""How the fuck you gon' reach him?"", he makin' more than his teachers
Movin' forward with speed, all your morals'll leave
Only focus is cheese, now the forest is trees
Got infected with greed, distort what you see
Your worst nightmare than me, is justifying your means

Yeah, what can make a nigga wanna go and get it?
Said he want a Beamer with the subs in it
Said he grew up in a house and it was love missing
Said he grew up in the set, he keep his guns with him

Looking at the legend I become, nigga
I can't help, but feeling like I'm the one, nigga
Remember I was on the run, nigga
Couple years before you had a son, nigga
Open up your doors and kept it one, nigga
Held a nigga down and that was love, nigga
Nobody want to stand in front a judge, nigga
Make you think of better days like when you was winning
Standing on the couches in the club with us
But then I got my shot, I had to run with it
Out the gate, lost count, many days in the studio, we slave, but this shit we gotta save
Staring in the space that you fishing for a phrase
Uninspired and your mind, still it's all a paper chase
First you over dedicate, then you notice that you great
And you been the whole time, then it slap you in the face
Then you stack it in your safe, got it cracking, it was fate
You the definition, nigga, laughing to the bank
I'm a master of my fate, plus I'm the type of nigga own the masters to my tape
I'm in Nevada for the day, I just caught a flight from Philly, we just sold out TLA
Fresh up off a stage on my way to B of A
AMB, we L.A, tryna eat, we the way

Had a drink, I just lead to the lake
It's eighty-something degrees in L.A
Fuck it, time to put some jetskis on L.A
Look, I got a team at my bank, I don't even need an I.D at my bank
This used to be a dream we would chase
I know J. Stone and Copy Supreme could relate
I know the whole team could relate
I know Evan Makenzi and Bron Lees could relate
Cornell, Saddam, Adam Man, DeBron, Steven Donaldson and Black Sam been on this Marathon
Balling since my brother used to hustle out the Vons
Couple hundred thousand up, he took a shovel to the lawn
No exaggeration for the content of my songs
When he went to dig it up, shit, a hundred something gone
Molded, you can ask moms
Had to plug in blow dryers for the ones we could wash
Salvaged the little bit
Young rich nigga shit, pressure on your shoulder
How you gon' deal with it?
Say it's all uncomfortable when you transition, but it's all beautiful when you get rich in it
When you start killing shit and they all witness
Money roll faster than niggas could spend the shit
Open more businesses with you and your niggas that watching your vision and being more generate
Like a Ford dealership, we up in Forbes
Watching and they wishing that it wasn't yours
I forgive you, I remember I was poor
Plus I ain't in the way of what you reaching for
Gotta play the game, you gotta read the score
See, I'ma do the same and pop the clutch of four
Told me if I want it, gotta hustle for it
Only difference now, the money more mature

Where there is mostly quiet
Flowers and butterflies
A rainbow lives beside it

And from a velvet sky
A summer storm
You can feel the coolness in the air
But you're still warm

And then a mighty roar
Will start the sky to cryin'
But not even lightening
Will be frightening my lion

And with no fear inside
No need to run, no need to hide
You're standing strong and tall
You're the bravest of them all

If on courage you must call
Then just keep on tryin'
And tryin', and tryin' you're a lion
In your own way be a lion

Come on, be a lion

Whoo! Don't that feel good

Slide some oil to my feet, look
I got toes again
Come on and slide some oil to my knees
And let me see if I can bend

Slide some oil to me
I'm beginning to feel just fine
Slide some oil down my throat
And let me lubricate my mind

Slide some oil to me
Go ahead, hit my shoulder blades
Those who don't have to lubricate
Sure got it made

Slide some oil to me
Let it slip down my side
Laying there in one position
Sure does make me tired

Now watch me dance
And let me lubricate my mind

And to know once again that what I feel is real?
I could cry, I could smile, I might lay back for a while
Oh, tell me what, what would I do if I could feel

What would I do if I could reach inside of me
And to know how it feels to say I like what I see?
Then I'd be more than glad to share all that I have inside of here
And the songs my heart might bring, you'd be more than glad to sing

And if tears should fall from my eyes
Just think of all the wounds they could mend
And just think of all the time I could spend
Just being vulnerable again

It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off

He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru

Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

Ich hab' dieser Straße ma' gesagt, dass ich sie nie verrate
Doch bin mir nicht sicher, ob es Schwäche oder Güte ist
Ich hab' mir geschworen, dass ich das niemals mach'
Doch an schlechten Tagen geb' ich hier und da ein Kilo ab
Wieso das? Keine Ahnung, doch das hier ist eine Warnung

Wenn du nur Scheiße baust, ist ab und zu ma' Zeit für Pause

Freunde gibt es nicht, denn wenn du weinst, bist du allein zuhause
Und ja, hier ist die Lage miese
Keine Disziplin, wir machen Papers aus den Arge-Briefen
Ich mach' echte Tracks und bin wie ich bin
Denn ich hab's nicht nötig, irgendwelchen Hatern in den Arsch zu kriechen
Es gab nicht viele, die mir wichtig waren
Doch die Straße sagte mir in Krisenzeiten, „ich bin da“

when I was weak you were so strong

I need you in my life

And if the rivers all run dry

If you were here just for one more day
I could have said these things to you

See I'm all grown up but still a part of you
Now I feel like a child
I never thought tI could feel so lost
I only wish that I had tried to say that

Niro,"Trop vrai pour baisser le falzar, calcule pas les khanza
On va t'la glisser profond, beleck à ton kharza
Retrouve moi à Taza, 9enitra, Sou9 el Arba3 ou Casa
Ici on te course avec une machette comme mes soces à Brazza
Serre moi pas la main, tu serres des bites, t'as les mains sales
Toi tu veux nous rouler, nous mettre dans tes massas
Je traîne avec les mêmes cassos depuis l'bac à sable
Un marteau dans mon cartable quand j'allais à la madrassa
Ici on n'est que d'passage
Arrête de faire le gangsta, masta
Tu vas te faire fumer par un fou du même style
Tu peux faire de la boxe Thaï, du Muay Thaï ou du chicken Thaï
On s'en bat les klawi, un 3atay ça reste un 3atay, bah oui
J'les graille comme du chebbakia ou du meloui
En plein r'mdan, pas la même dalle, à coup d'nerfs on sort le jenoui
Envoie une palette de prod lourde khey, j'suis un fenwick
Bientôt j'suis partout comme la sère-mi ou les chinwi
Si si y'a du style, oui, ils se demandent, c'est qui lui?
Tu peux être un deux et demi, tu vas te faire doubler par un piwi
Sous-estime pas les p'tits, dans nos têtes c'est la Palestine
Préviens la balistique, Niro perd jamais comme Parker Lewis
On cherche des terma au lieu d'aller chercher du khedma
Tu veux gratter 9a7ba, j'fais du jus d'orange avec ta che7ma
Ze-ze ze3ma t'as des kalachs et des Famas comme Oussama?
J'ai la disquette à Bernard Tapie, t'es dépassé comme Bernard Lama

J'reprends mon souffle
L'rap c'est un sport hein
Juste un petit message
Ceux qui s'croyaient lourd là
Laisse-moi t'dire un petit truc

Chez moi si t'es lourd on te soulève, hassoul y'a des fous partout
J'vais pas t'faire un dessin animé, un cartoon
C'est miné sur mon parcours, pour une paire de seins, un bain d'sang
Le sang coule en bas de ma tour, ça sent la violence, les missions casse-cou
Depuis tout petit on casse tout
Je repense à l'époque où je rodais avec mon poto Black Dogg
Les keufs nous prenaient en photo comme des parrains d'la drogue
Majeur à ces 9a7, même mineurs on arrache la prod
T'écris toujours du sale parce qu'on n'a jamais les mains propres
J'peux encore accélerer, tuer le beat
Comme d'habitude on crame la piste
J'envoie du lourd, pour tous les suces-bites
Même les jaloux appuient sur repeat
Pressé de passer le cap et de casser le bras des tasses-pé, j'gratte pas d'feat
Le rap m'a lassé, j'peux pas lâcher, ils parlent de percer y'a pas de biff
Rap des bas fonds, j'fais de l'ombre à ces bouffons

Dans la vie c'est chacun son vice, chacun sa merde
Si t'es enceinte, dis pas que c'est mon fils, la chatte à ta mère
J'veux faire des sous, pas faire des gros feats j'sors de ma galère
Si demain, j'en tirerai profit, je m'arracherai avec mon salaire, allez!

J’ai du flow, du biff’, du respect tout ça, tout ça
Toute l’année j’suis en vacances ouais, fuck la Toussaints
Dis-leur de s’rhabiller, j’connais déjà leurs tchatche
J’ai besoin d’faire des billets, j’ai pas besoin d’leurs chattes
Motherfucker, ramène ta clique de lopes-sa
T’avais jamais entendu un Rebeu rapper comme ça
J’ai sorti une mixtape ils m’ont dit c’est un album ça
WAllah Niro ça s’voit qu’toi tu charbonnes sale
Tu mérites poto, mach’Allah t’es jeune
Quand tu parles, on dirait qu’t’as des rides poto
WAllah t’es vide poto, t’inquiète pas
T’es déjà leur putain d’bête noire
J’m’inquiète pas, tous les ghettos sont avec moi
J’viens d’l’espace, serre les fesses, j’suis pas ouvert moi
Partout où j’passe, tous les regards sont pointés vers moi
Serre-moi une vodka corsé, j’bois pas la bière moi
J’ai d’quoi être fier moi, tous les vrais gars sont derrière moi
Pourquoi tu m’guettes che-lou? J’suis enfant d’la sè-sère moi
J’te baise moi, paye moi tous les jours pas tous les mois

Le temps c’est d’l’argent, on n’en aura jamais assez

On t’pousse à t'mettre une paille, on m’force à mette les bracelets
Enlevé ma chaîne, ma liasse, mes putains d’lacets
Survivor, ma place est parmi les carnassiers
J’ai toujours été vrai, tu peux m’souhaiter d’être frais

À Rifle, Bois d’Ar les Baumettes et la Santé

Là on sait pas c’que tu m’racontes, cousin
Hé, wAllah toute ma vie j’vais passer à vous raisonner, cousin
Parce que vous êtes plus fous qu’moi
Toute l’année vous dites que c’est moi l’plus fou
Mais c’est vous les fous
Laissez-moi dans mon coin bande de sales fous
Mais wAllah, mon ami, j’vous aime
Oh mes gavas, oh oh mes gavas
C’est mes gavas, j’avoue
Hahaha, hé toi va repose c’que t’as volé, sale bâtard, ha ha ha
Hé va poser ton arme toi aussi là, arrête de faire le fou
On va pas prendre 15 piges là pour une histoire de boîte de nuit
De Jack Daniel’s, de Absolut, de Grey Goose, tu vois mon ami ou pas?
Hé vas-y, j’ai même plus envie d’rapper, j’ai envie d’parler
Bientôt j’crois j’vais sortir un album j’vais que parler
Et sur la tête de pépé, on va tout baiser, mon ami
Ha ha ha ha

Hé, attends attends j’vais t’dire un p’tit truc encore
Ça c’pour mes gars, y’a un d’mes gars il m’a dit quoi
Il m’a dit ""Niro
Ils croient tous que t’es mort mais sur la tête de pépé
Quand tu vas revenir ils vont savoir c’que c'est
D’se faire baiser par un mort-vivant mon ami""

Ca les arrangeait qu’on les frappe en plein été

Ce qui nous rassemble à part salat de janaza
À'orgueil des billets de banque

On pardonnera pas aux traîtres d'nous avoir tourné le dos
J'suis innocent même si y a du sang sur ma veste Kenzo
Nous c'est la rue, à balles réelles, c'est comme dans les soirées Dance Hall
Eh, tu veux liquide, un plan, amène
T'es bonne, tu kiffes, on peut te la mettre
Ton père, c'est mon tit-pe, sa mère
C'est ma typère, j'm'y perds jamais

Maintenant, j'suis grand, tu bouges, j't'arroses

Faut pas blâmer, ou acclamer

Fréro, jamais j'irais sucer 
Bouneau, t'es en leu-leu dans son bureau
Rotte-ca, sirop, fleur de sureau
J'tire au fusil dans ton cul rose
Eh, on a pas des gueules d'anges, que d'la peau sur les os
Pour avoir le succès j'ai du taffer mille fois plus que les autres
Ils voulaient m'ter-sau vu qu'j'ai jamais sucé
J'rôdais à B.L.O en Clio un litre neuf
Aujourd'hui à Paname à bord d'un bolide neuf
J'l'ai dit, j'le répète : on sera jamais comme eux
On veut sauver nos proches, ils veulent sauver les meubles
T'en veux à la vie, Dieu fait bien les choses
Les plus généreux ne seront jamais pleins
Les mecs balèzes sont souvent les plus 7nin
Les plus gros voyous font pas un mètre vingt

J'ai pas son temps j'lui laisserai un faux numéro
J'lui enverrai mes khos qui font peur aux riverains

C'est moi qui joue, c'est toi qui perds
J'maille en été, j'maille en hiver
T'étais vaillant, là t'es du-per
T'as trop sucé pour faire du pèze
Y a que les tits-pe qu'tu peux duper
Toi même tu sais who is the best
Voyou, mon cul, fais l'fou, j'te baise
Tu tournes en rond, tu guettes tes savates
Au fond d'un bar, j't'ai vu khabat
J't'ai vu apprendre, j't'ai vu la vendre
J't'ai vu la prendre, j'l'ai vu t'abattre
J'ai grandi hardcore avant qu'tu naisses
Trop agité pour écouter les ordres
Pour compter les sommes dans ma jeunesse

Les petits perdus s'aventurent vite, meurent avant d'survivre à leurs propres vices
Et c'est pas Gomorra, j'ai fait l'tour de la zone, y a plus rien d'honorable

Niro,"Back to the future
Hé, mentalement emprisonné même pour les plus honnêtes
Y a pas qu'dans mes cauchemars qu'j'entends les balles résonner
Tu trahis mon orgueil, j'ai du mal à t'pardonner
Quand j'reçois trop d'amour, j'ai du mal à en donner
J'prends sur moi, déguise mes soucis, fais semblant d'rigoler
Quand j'pète les plombs, ils sont choqués, m'regardent d'un air étonné
Personne n'est parfait, pourquoi j'les regarderais d'un air désolé?
Du sol au sommet, j'ai mes défauts, mes gars pour m'épauler
Quelques années d'carrière derrière, là, j'ai repris les devants
Toutes ces années pour être rabaissé à une semaine de vente
J'en veux plus aux médias d'jamais nous soutenir
C'est bon, ils m'ont jamais promis, si mes souvenirs sont bons
Mes fils pleurent quand j'franchis la porte, j'repars au charbon
Papa n'est pas mauvais mais papa n'est pas bon
Au début, on est pur, on grandit, on l'est plus
Si demain, j'disparais, j'aurais fait c'que j'ai pu
J'suis rré-bou, j'ai trop bu, j'suis debout, j'suis têtu
Tu m'appelles, j'réponds plus, fils de pute, j'suis déçu
J'me débrouille, j'fais mes thunes, tu m'censures, habitude
J'ressens tout, je titube, du sang sur le bitume
J'frime pas même si mon fils est plus riche que ton père
J'ai moins d'mal à faire tomber ces salopes que mon verre
J'transforme le temps en oseille, voilà c'que j'préfère en faire
Y aura toujours assez d'place pour tous les hagar en enfer
J'encule la ligue, on m'parle déjà du prochain transfert
Le rap français tapine entre Amsterdam et Anvers
Obligé d'faire la guerre, j'encule tes promesses de paix
Si j'écoute mon ange de gauche, j'prends perpét' sans remise de peine
Va t'faire enculer, c'est pas l'heure des gentillesses
Trop terre-à-terre, y a trop d'affaires à faire en dièses
Tu crois qu't'es un voyou, toi, tu cherches de l'estime
J'vais t'en ramener des vrais, tu vas parler la langue des signes
J'suis pas dans leur délire, clair, net, et précis
Tu pensais nous éteindre, nous, c'est la rue, imbécile
J'suis pas dans leur délire, clair, net, et précis
Tu pensais nous éteindre, nous, c'est la rue, imbécile (haha)

Hé, avant d'partir, hé
C'est p't'être mon dernier titre (peu importe c'que ça apporte)
Peu importe c'que ça apporte
Dire c'que j'ai à dire
Avant qu'la mort frappe à ma porte

C'est p't'être mon dernier titre
Peu importe c'que ça rapporte
J'vais dire c'que j'ai à dire avant qu'la mort frappe à ma porte
J'ai essayé d'faire le bien, c'était chaud
Elle était froide la che-dou
J'partage mes peines qu'avec moi-même le haram m'a fait les yeux doux
J'demande pardon à mes proches, j'ai besoin d'partir
J'suis pas heureux ici, la mort m'aura avant d'me repentir
Chaque fois qu'je fais confiance, j'essuie mes pieds sur un tapis propre
J'm'en suis voulu à chaque fois qu'j'me suis méfié d'mes amis proches
Si tu m'aimes pas, merlish
Si tu m'aimes, c'est réciproque
Il est temps d'faire de l'oseille
Que tous ceux qu'j'apprécie croquent
J'vis pas dans les normes mec, j'ai déjà rêver qu'j'dormais
J'suis mort-né, j'accepte mes torts mais des fois, j'suis borné
J'avoue, j'suis pas toujours resté droit
Surtout quand j'ai déversé ma haine en format MP3
Le jour de joumou3a, sous tension, je suis passé au prétoire
J'attend que ces fils de putes viennent pour me dicter mes droits
On m'a dit ""t'es là pourquoi?"", j'ai répondu ""j'suis là pour toi!""
Niro t'inquiète pas baise les tous on sortira tous après toi
Je dis pas toujours ce que je pense
Pour pas faire du mal mais wallah
Si tu savais mon parcours t'aurais mal de me voir là
Laisse la pitié pour les chiens, j'ai de l'amitié pour les miens
Faut pas s'y fier, je connais bien, y'en a c'est v'la les comédiens
À part les vrais le reste je le baise en brochette je serai déjà loin
De ce rap de zoulouss, j'avais pris un gros chèque
Hachek, que dieu me pardonne, gâché ma vie
Qu'il me pardonne de faire le haram
D'avoir vendu du shit, des armes sans peur que ça vire au désastre
Que dieu me pardonne de faire cette musique
Je le fais pour nourrir mes proches
M'écarter d'l'illicite, pourquoi pas me remplir les poches?
Des fois je suis perdu comme je t'ai dit auparavant
Paraplégique, premier album, mental de hessler
J'ai pas pris d'avance avant de fermer la parenthèse
Le rap ça pue sa mère la pute, y'as pas d'oseille petit frère
Va faire du foot ça paiera plus
J'ai des connaissance dans la droiture, d'autres dans le trafic de drogue dur
Ceux dans la droiture sont en hess, les trafiquants recomptent leur fortune khey
J'ai connu des meufs hlel, j'ai reconnu les impostures
Les grosses kehba déguisées, cachées derrière un costume
Un traître ça se reconnaît pas à ses joies mais à ses colères
Sous la haine, les mots font mal faut savoir les contrôler
Si t'es mon pote on est ensemble tu peux avoir confiance
Je parlerai pas en mal en toi j'ai les même amis d'enfance
Mon pote Koro m'a dis ""Poto, qu'est ce qu'on va devenir?""
J'ai répondu ""t'inquiètes insh'Allah ça pourrait pas être pire
On prend d'l'âge t'as eu un gosse masha'allah
Ton fils s'appellera Imrane il est despi soubhan allah
Tu te rappelles quand tu m’as vu en garde à vue
J'étais là bas pour toi je serai toujours ton frère, ma réussite sera la même pour toi
Ya rebi el aàlamine, j'ai mal au fond de moi
Je me sens pas propre je ressens l'enfer chaque jour que la mort approche ici-bas
Khey mes faiblesses m'on eut
Je suis mort sans avoir vécu, j'ai passé mon temps à vesqui, à nous trouver des excuses
On aime pas les responsabilités dans nos ghettos
Y'en a toujours un qui veut une plus grosse part sur le gâteau
Pourquoi tu m'aimes pas fils de pute, je t'ai jamais rien fait
J'suis un enfant d'la sère-mi, j'connais ses défauts, j'connais ses bienfaits
Mama, j'te remercierais jamais assez
J'ai grandi, ça m'manque le temps où tu m’enlaçais depuis qu'les non-dit sont dit
Il est temps qu'on s'pardonne, wallah, j'ai mal chaque jour que Dieu fait sur Terre
Il m'faut qu'tu m'crois Mama, j't'aime encore plus que moi-même
Ma sœur, c'est la meilleure, mashallah j'suis fière d'elle
Et même si j'suis pas souvent là, j'serais jamais très bien loin d'elle
J'la préserve comme la prunelle de mes yeux
Et j'sais qu'elle va pas s'en remettre quand j'vais retourner dans les cieux
Mashallah, elle est pieuse, dans le ghetto, personne la voit
Elle sort pas, celui qui la voudra sera prêt à perdre sa vie pour l'avoir, Zoulou

Devenu jeunes effrontés parce qu'on nous les apprend tôt
Une lumière s'éteint dans le ghetto pour un tour en moto
J'vois mes frères charbonner, faire des allers-retours en taule
RDV à treize heures trente, parloir avec les fantômes

Là je suis blasé, là je suis blasé
Blasé par le présent, lassé par le passé, fatigué de nous voir fatigués

Je rentre sans faire de bruit au milieu de la nuit
Pour pas perturber les rêves de mes héritiers

Mes deux fils font la paire, on est nés prolétaires
Je veux mourir millionnaire, je me réveille plus déter
C'est la guerre je prends les armes
J'veux la faire je peux la gagner la perdre
Dans les deux cas ma peine sera pas allégée
J'ai les armes et Dieu pour me protéger

Certains ont fait comme si on valait rien
Pas la faute à la thune t'es mauvais par nature
Et aujourd'hui je te baise je suis plus un galérien
J'ai déjà une idée de ce que tu deviens
J'leur ai fait que du sale et c'est tout ce qu'on retient
Dites à tous ceux qui nous donnent de la force
Que je les aime à la mort que sans eux il y aurait rien
Mais là je suis blasé, là je suis blasé
Comme personne âgée, tu sais mon ami
Pour de l'oseille ou par jalousie
Des frères m'ont lâché, sucé mes ennemis

Des péchés par tonnes et le Sheitan applaudit,
J'en ai vu des daronnes pleurer, perdre la parole et mourir à p'tit feu
Parce que leur fils est trop fou, trop fougueux
Et dire qu'avant c'étaient des grand footeux
Aujourd’hui sur l'terrain ils veulent tous se shooter
Tremper leur nez dans des affaires douteuses, mais y'a pas l'choix
Bah ouais ma foi, ici-bas la vie est beaucoup trop coûteuse
Armés jusqu'aux dents on sort de la ville

J'fais plaisir à la rue comme remise de peine
Ils ont passé la trentaine mais pas l'âge rebelle
La vie est comme ma femme, elle est triste et belle
Ils sont contents quand je mens, la vérité blesse
Ils me détestent à la mort quand je leur parle franchement
Ils veulent pas de ma gentillesse malheureusement
J'vais devoir niquer leurs mères chaleureusement
J'prenais les plus bonnes meufs pour qu'on s'en rappelle
Ils se tapent des queues sur elle sans son consentement
J'lui souris en plein jour tard la nuit je la baise
Elle ferme les yeux j'disparais comme par enchantement
J'vous demande pas de pardonner mon comportement
On a tout eu par la force depuis le commencement
J'ai monté mon label mon environnement
J'ai quatre ou cinq découpeurs en développement
Tu nous ouvres pas la porte je vais faire autrement

Tard la nuit pour soigner ton image (brr!)

Comment le rap français peut être aussi mort

À zéler sur les champs à faire couler le champagne

Attiré comme un aimant par la rue et par le gent-ar

J'recompte ma liasse il manque deux billets de cinquante

Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know 

Verse 1:
Hey yo I'm gazing at the skyline watching sun shine 
let my mind unwind and rewinding to the time when my eyes was blind 
see the pride I hid behind it just killed my mind 
but left me thinking I was fine but really I couldn't see the signs 
when all that time your son is shining on me 
it's right above me it's bright and lovely but I just won't see 
I'm running from the son's beams scared of what I don't see 
just while the son be blazing on me because he knows me 
and I can feel the sun shining on my skin 
I run and hide inside close the blinds to keep the son from shining in 
so much time I spend running from the son light's that's peeking in 
I'm weakening and I probably will never see again 
but just then it's a ray of light just blazing bright 
the first time in my life just when my dark night just came to life 
see I'm just the type with all my might to pick a fight 
but for some reason I'm standing here soaking up this light

Chorus:
Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know 

Verse 2:
The thing about the light of the son is right when he comes 
even if you right in the slums you'll still see the light that he's brung 
ain't a thing existing on this earth without the son's light 
most might ignore the son whenever they live they life 
others want the son to shine but they don't want it bright 
they choose a darker light so they can live they life with darker nights 
but that's a harder life I'd rather just embrace the light 
and blaze the mic cause even the deadest person I seen come to life 
you see the son be shining on my skin and warms me from deep within 
I can't keep it in I got this peace within 
the son of man I made my peace with Him 
that's why you see me grin and every single day you gone see me seeking him 
I got's to speak again about the son who's freeing men 
I'm taking in the son just like the oxygen I'm breathing in 
and my deepest scars the son light be healing them 
I think it's just going to be a sonny day now once again

No more room in the pan I cook up rhymes in a bigger pot
On a roll, what you figure got
Tricks up my sleeve you won't believe
My story weave to a thicker plot
Words leep off pages hop on stages
We crazy need to be locked in cages

Understand from afar nashville to the lone star state
Relate indicator instilled in me by men greater

Moved to the heat
Got used to the flame

But everything I hear y'all soundin the same
From the beats to the videos

Same concept for your flows and hook
See these round here they can raise the dead
So come on everybody now bob your head
y'all need to heed these words from the wise
Rhymes so meaty like jambalaya
Got truth for hire
Can you stand the fire
To see you come alive that's my desire now

Boy looka here
Have you ever heard a dead man talk before
You ever seen a dead man walk before
You ever heard dead man lock the flow
Like these before

Explode and make your brains hang

I got a lesson learner fact or fiction swoop through your demise
Open eyes and givin' clear vision the windows broken from
The pain of livin' here wishin'

You could survive with those who gave lives
Avoid the cracks and moats of new age turncoats
And modern day cut throats
What makes it shroom blossom and boom a murmer in a gossipin' room

Anticipate we praise desire for grown up
The author and finisher of faith
Offerin' a diminishin' gas face rememberin' who in last place

Can deliver you joy and bring pain in the same way

And raining on his swag, falling deeper in the saddle
It’s written on his face, he don’t have to make a sound
Somebody call the 5-0, we’ve got a man down

Now you can go and play it like your own rock ‘n’ roll
It does the job on each and every man’s soul
And when your head is a pillow with a nice fall
You can beat your life that it’s gonna be a fight y’all

'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we’ve all stepped across that line
But nothing’s sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness, forgiveness

And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing’s sweeter than the pain
Sweeter than the pain, recall

This the Lecrae

My mama told me what I would be in for
If I get to the sun, get inside of me pimped up
My heart’s been broken and my wounds been open
And I don’t know if I can hear I’m sorry been spoken
But those forgiving much should be quicker to give it
And God forgave me for it all, Jesus beg forgiveness
So when the stones fly and they aimed at you
Just say forgive them Father, they know not what they do

Now you can go and play it like your own rock ‘n’ roll
It does the job on each and every man’s soul
And when your head is a pillow with a nice fall

But nothing’s sweeter than the pain
Sweeter than the pain, recall

Time for forgiveness
You know we need that that that
You know we need that that that
You know we need that that that

No matter how lost you are
You’re not that far, you’re not too far (from forgiveness)

I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
And that's old news

Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth?

I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me

If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do

I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
And that's old news

Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth?

I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see

I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me

Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel

Nirvana,"Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And flew away howling on the yellow moon
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
People cry and people moan
They look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make them their own
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July",Lake of Fire [DVD],1994

Without any words
I got so high that
I scratched 'til I bled

That I ever had
Was when I learned
To cry on command

Better than you

I can't complain

Every night
It's safe to say
Don't quote me on that

Better than you

So what should I do?

Blackmailed again
Forgot to put
On the zip code

Better than you

So what should I do?

I'm on a plain

In a dream my memory has stored
As defence I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense

Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home

Distill the life that's inside of me

Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally

I'm so tired I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief

I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids

Have been told
Promise you

I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew my meat for you
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

With eyes so dilated, I've became your pupil
You've taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow
I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful
Vacuum out the fluids
Chew my meat for you
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you, you, you, you, you, you

They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please don't go

Grandma take me home

Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

She said, well, don't you start your crying
Go outside and ride your bike
That's what I did, I killed my toe

After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms

Grandma take me home
I wanna be alone",Sliver,1994
