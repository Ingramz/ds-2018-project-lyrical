Liquido,"Anything fades
And withers away
Tomorrow is past 
To close to stay
I've never heard that voice before - nevermore
I've been trying to tease you
I've been trying tom please you
How can I make your time worthwhile
Life is to be lived
The road shall belong
Let's sing our fate
A happy song


2x
I want to be a clown
I want to be a clown
Fool around
And make you laugh


Now what can I do to catch a smile
Forever young
In sweet desire
It's but a law we have to break
There must be more ways
We can take
How can I blame you
For I cannot save you
How can I make your time wothwhile
The bitterest taste
Of the years I waste
Is that I spare my mind
Of what remains


2x
I want to be a clown
I want to be a clown
Fool around
And make you laugh


I want to be a clown


I want to be a clown


2x
I want to be a clown
I want to be a clown
Fool around
And make you laugh",Clown,1999
Liquido,"l want a candle on my cake

and l know quite well. that l'll have it all
l'll have ft all today: I'LL HAVE IT ALL TODAY/I want some lemonade today

Liquido,"Wake me up somehow
Wake me up when you're around
Wake me up a thousand times
Wake me up somehow

Coucher coucher. I will lay me down
I will call you back and then
We'll talk again
In my dreams I dwell

Asleep, there is no au revoir
I do believe I hear you say ""je veux te voir ce soir""
Eyes, dim and colorless
Whispering to spoil the noise

Meaningless to hear a voice
What splendid night it was: wake me up somehow
Wake me up when you're around
Wake me up a thousand times

Wake me up somehow, comme ci comme ca
I'd shiver everywhere
The quivering seems to linger there
Il pleut dans mon coeur, I feel so insincere

My memories of you are weird
The beauty of your tongue, my work's undone
Another chapter starts. I close my eyes and watch the stars
Overwhelming past, what splendid night it was: wake me up somehow

Wake me up when you're around
Wake me up a thousand times
Wake me up somehow
Wake me up today

Wake me up and please, please stay
Wake me up be pleased and stay
Wake me up somehow",Wake Me Up,1999
Liquido,"Left abandoned and abused . maybe I'm so confused.
Take my chance and do my best . better than the whole rest.
Never change itÂ´s just too late . we canÂ´t be friends well think again now.
I will realize my plan doing what I can .
Never gonna change never gonna change . Fix me right and then .
we'll see what's coming now . take a little bit of this and that .
Take a little bit of supersonic banners ...make me so sad .
Supermega Tony Vega like a beggar like on an easy chair I like it when you're so aware .

BIG BOY DOUBLEDECKER, MAKIN' MY HEART GO QUICKER.
IT'S A BAD GAME, DREADFUL LIKE MIGRAINE.


To the ladies ...I feel I'm slippin' through the cracks . two times rhymin' on this track .
Laughin' 'bout the thing we did . another day so uninspired .
Never gonna change never gonna change . Fix me right and then .
we'll see what's coming now .
take a little bit of this and that .
Take a little bit of supersonic banners ...make me so sad .

Liquido,"I sleep beneath the window
The night has come to fall
The echo rings
I clench my pillow
Just living in my head now
My eyes have come to rest
I'm all alone but you are here with me

You chase me though I'm falling
I'm haunted by that scene
I'm lingering in sweet obsession

You made me feel like junkmail
With every slight remark
So watch me in the corner of your bin

And I know it

Like you do

We're cracking up

For salvation

I loved you by the window
Like many loved before
I'm all wracked up but still I shiver

I hate to be alone now
I hate to be myself
The night I've cried has made me wither

I'm standing by the window
The night becomes the day
You're staring at me from the other side

I know we'll have to go
And our names are on the list
So sneak away and may that curtain fall",Curtainfall,2000
Liquido,"Please me
And feel the friction of dawn
How long did it take
To walk that way?

Too fast
When we were heading for the sun
And we didn't proceed
For we could not succeed

Refine, refine the senses we have
Define, define
Refine, refine the senses we have
It's finally fine

Tease me
Just where your fingerprints were on
It's not that weird
On my way

We found
There won't be anything to miss
And I wouldn't say
Keep on waiting

Refine, refine the senses we have
Define define
Refine, refine the senses we have
It's finally fine",Finally Fine,2000
Liquido,"Send me back I'm waiting here in line
Since when you said it was supposed to be so
I called you up when I was feeling dead
What can I do I'm acting like a mojo

My chimney-stack is burning all the way
I'm on your track I've got nothing to say now
I need you to make me feel relaxed
So call me back and don't say you ain't got no tracks

All the things that we cannot afford
We can deny 'em but it's your decision on the other
You made me high though I was coming down
You made me fly as if you were a clown

Building me up
Burning me out
Why should I quit
I'm rockin' no doubt
Tell me what's wrong
What can I do
Forget about that
The joke is on you

You made me cry and did not know my name
But I loved you so you're the one to blame
What can I do to make you feel the same
You're treating me as if it was a game

Whatever comes I'll watch you on your way
Whoever comes might know what is supposed to say
He will show his collection by gas-light
Makin' love, loving at first sight

Building me up
Burning me out
Why should I quit
I'm rockin' no doubt
Tell me what's wrong
What can I do
Forget about that

Liquido,"Parkdrive 31 and we've been waiting for so long so you got me on my knees   I'm calling you my Baby please when we're demanding our relationship ahead everybody knows one love must die the other grows and though I sometimes like the rain I seldom go against the grain distracting me I got to pass the test in me We'll make it so leave your chance to break it and on the other side we'll stake it ain't no need to fake it so let us be so free it has chilled me to the bone all the tantrums we have thrown then you gave me proper fill for you got that certain thrill
smooth on the top and rough-skinned underneath our bliss was in the cards we dreamed of driving open cars we had to face the human lie we'll never change but time goes by when we embrace I feel your pulse- pulse of the feedback
we'll make it leave you're chance to break it and on the other side we'll stake it ain't no need to fake it so let us be so free in my mind in my mind in our minds paralyzed when you made me compromize and I know that I'll survive that is what you told me lately in that line when I was that far behind and you said my delight that is what you told me lately",Parkdrive 31,2000
Liquido,"Longing for the schoolyard 
Reaching for the scenes 
Reminded by the songs that will never disappear 
Random like the infants 
Outdated like the old 
Lying there in aimlessness listening to the cure 
Doing some rehearsal 
Exercising in the cold 
Lowering the standards 
For the six-string never rolled 
Whistling at the girls 
And saving for the fuel 
Making plans and knock knock knock on wood 

Play some rock 
Play some rock 
Please don't stop 
Coming home coming home 

Sentenced by our faults 
We were to make in time 
Pleasantly aware 
Of our solitude in mind 
Saved me from the boredom 
Of what we disavowed 
Encouraged by the sound 
That was the sweetest one of all 
Admiring your senses 
Infected by your tongue 
Defenseless I believed 
That we'd face anything to come 
You innocently told me 
You'd catch me when I fall 
And solemnly we'd knock knock knock on wood 

Play some rock 
Play some rock 
Please don't stop 
Coming home coming home
I'm not the only one",Play Some Rock,2000

This time I don't do the strayer
All wrapped up in Gucci Gucci
Trying to look fresh and juicy

They say my ways are like another one man show

A crown is no cure for a headache
Higher prices can be charged
Pretty penny come to daddy

People love the after hours
Sparkling drinks to take some showers
The girls adore my black toxido
The music's fresh but not liquido

Liquit Walker,"Bruder, pass auf, ich komm' aus 1035, Ost-Berlin, wahres Leben
Nicht die normalste, aber auch nicht grad 'ne harte Gegend
Ich meine hart, wenn wir von Straße reden
So wie sie von Straße reden, wenn sie von „Scarface“ oder „Pate“ reden
Kein Gangsterfilm
Es gab nur Läden mit paar Löchern und die konntest du ohne Euros und Cents nicht füll'n
Ein bisschen schwerer, aus 'ner Gegend so zu starten
Und das ist alles, was ich dir erzählen kann von Straße
Ein ganz normaler Junge, der erzählt
Was er sieht und erlebt, kein Fake-Entertain
Leg' den Beat ein wie'n Mundschutz, schnall' mir paar Zeilen um
Denn dieses Spiel basiert auf Angriff und Verteidigung
Und immer in die Schatten seh'n
Denn all die Ratten, sie verlassen nicht das sinkende Schiff, sie spring'n auf den Kapitän
Wähl deine Seite, um dich sicher zu wägen
Das Problem mit der Straße ist, in der Mitte zu stehen

Immer noch der gleiche Schuh auf Asphalt
Immer noch schmeck' ich Wut in mei'm Hals
Blaugraue Federn, im Flug Richtung Hafen
Ein Fuß auf der Bühne, ein Fuß auf der Straße
Immer noch der gleiche Schuh auf Asphalt
Immer noch schmeck' ich Wut in mei'm Hals
Blaugraue Federn, im Flug Richtung Hafen
Ein Fuß auf der Bühne, ein Fuß auf der Straße

Wenn ihr sagt, ich wär' nicht Straße - was meint ihr damit?
Dass ich nicht schieße oder steche, keine Teile vertick'?
Dass es durch Lügen und Betrügen keinen Schein für mich gibt?
Oder dass ich nicht 24/7 Eisen wegdrück'?
Ve Ve [?], toute la vérité
Ich kann euch sehen, denn ich steh' daneben
Sie woll'n hör'n, wie ich Rapper fick', seh'n, wie ich Rapper fick'
Ich entehre nicht meines Vaters Worte für Dreck wie Klicks
Ich bin noch immer mit dem Fuß auf Asphalt
Geb' mir Bumm-Bumm-Tschack wie ein Loop um den Hals
Es ist nicht schwierig, vom guten Pfad abzuweichen
Es ist schwierig, ihn zu halten, wenn die Schatten steigen
Straße dies, Straße das, muss den Hass wieder ausatmen
Wo die Vögel, wenn sie fliegen, blaugrau tragen
Ich war mein Leben lang nur so Straße wie die Augen meiner Mutter es erlaubt haben

Immer noch der gleiche Schuh auf Asphalt
Immer noch schmeck' ich Wut in mei'm Hals
Blaugraue Federn, im Flug Richtung Hafen
Ein Fuß auf der Bühne, ein Fuß auf der Straße
Immer noch der gleiche Schuh auf Asphalt
Immer noch schmeck' ich Wut in mei'm Hals
Blaugraue Federn, im Flug Richtung Hafen
Ein Fuß auf der Bühne, ein Fuß auf der Straße

Immer noch der gleiche Schuh auf Asphalt
Immer noch schmeck' ich Wut in mei'm Hals
Blaugraue Federn, im Flug Richtung Hafen
Ein Fuß auf der Bühne, ein Fuß auf der Straße
Immer noch der gleiche Schuh auf Asphalt
Immer noch schmeck' ich Wut in mei'm Hals

Ein Fuß auf der Bühne, ein Fuß auf der Straße",Blaugraue Federn,2010
Liquit Walker,"Sag deinen Leuten, ich bin da gewesen, wenn sie fragen, wann es zerbrochen ist
Nein, warte, sag ihn'n gar nix, aus Trotz schon nicht
Frag nach gestern, ich sage nix
Ich war nur ein guter Junge, dem dann Schlechtes widerfahren ist
Nach dem Stich die Wunden, Narben küssen, Lumpen
Nie das Leben gesucht, es hat mich gefunden
Tut mir leid, falls sie mich lieben
Nie den Unterschied verstanden zwischen fallen und fliegen
Hör' meine Stadt noch singen
Doch eines Tages war das Karussell zu schnell, um noch abzuspringen
Also Kopf hoch und drüber stehen, he
Nur eine hässliche Floskel für ein Aufwiedersehen
Gut gesegelt gegen andere in Ferne
Aber nie verstanden, Anker zu werfen
Als das Meer grad perfekt war als Käpt'n an Land gehen
Nur ein paar letzte Gedanken",Da gewesen (Outro),2010
Liquit Walker,"Blick' nach oben mit gesenktem Haupt, Hände taub
Töte die Wut in mei'm Rachen, obwohl es brennt im Bauch
Verschwommene Sicht, alles, was noch passiert, wollt' ich nicht
Kupfer, Bernstein, goldenes Gift
Schmeckt nach Hass auf den Zähnen, was saufen geh'n
Er will nach draußen, um mit Absicht fast draufzugeh'n
Die Lunte zischt in der Grauzone, buntes Licht
Er gibt 360 Grad auf mein'n Tunnelblick
Sein Name ändert sich, eben hieß John
Wir könn'n darüber reden, doch erzähl mir nix davon
Ob elf Uhr abends oder vor morgens, wenn er mich im Griff hat
Schießen 12cl aus den Four Horsemen
Was denkst, warum unsere Stimmen so kratzen?
Großer Fehler, der Versuch, ihn ertrinken zu lassen, ah
Lass' den Sprit jetzt brenn'n
Was denkst du, was die Motherfuckers mich Liquit nenn'n?

Das bin ich und mein Dämon (Dämon)
Er lauert in mir, wenn der Blick in meinen Augen gefriert
Der Kampf mit dem Dämon (Dämon)
Raus, wenn er atmen will, lauf' in das schwarze Bild
Das bin ich und mein Dämon (Dämon)
Er lauert in mir, wenn der Blick in meinen Augen gefriert
Der Kampf mit dem Dämon (Dämon)
Raus, wenn er atmen will, lauf' in das schwarze Bild

Gott, Gnade meiner Seele, wenn ich wieder mit dem Teufel durch die Gassen zieh'
Nein, Gott, Gnade der Welt, denn dann veracht' ich sie
Back am Liquorstore, back auf [?]
Back zu den Hits auf Triple und zu dem Liquit Walk
Heißer Dampf auf der Pumpe wie auf Kerosin
Fadenkreuze in den Augen, die auf jeden ziel'n
Such' Vernunft, er zerreißt sie dann wie Papier
Ich und er steh'n im Einzelkampf neben mir
„Im Grunde bist du ich!“, schreit er am Lenkrad
Bei Vollgas im Vollrausch im Dunkeln Richtung Licht
Er denkt, er kann dem Tod auf die Sense pissen
Nach dem letzten Schluck hoch und die Engel küssen
Rrraaa! Schwer zu atmen im Würgegriff
Wirklich, er spielt erst sein Spiel, wenn es tödlich ist
Er lacht erst mit mei'm Hass im Gesicht
Aber stirbt nicht daran, wenn die Flasche zerbricht

Das bin ich und mein Dämon (Dämon)
Er lauert in mir, wenn der Blick in meinen Augen gefriert
Der Kampf mit dem Dämon (Dämon)
Raus, wenn er atmen will, lauf' in das schwarze Bild
Das bin ich und mein Dämon (Dämon)
Er lauert in mir, wenn der Blick in meinen Augen gefriert
Der Kampf mit dem Dämon (Dämon)
Raus, wenn er atmen will, lauf' in das schwarze Bild

Liquit Walker,"Du bist dort, wo dich niemand hört
Immer dort, wo sie nie sehen, was dir widerfährt
Wo sich das Sonnenlicht an den grauen Blocks bricht
Wo dich das Leben mit zwölf entjungfert per Kopffick
Ah, und ich weiß ganz genau, wo das ist
Wie es riecht, wie es schmeckt, wie es dich zu Boden drückt
Und ich seh' selber, dass dich jeder hier vergessen will
Gibt's kein'n Applaus, sind die Rapper still
Rap ist nicht mehr menace to society
Rap ist heut: Wenn es genug Scheine gibt, verdräng' ich meine Fans und unterschreib' den Deal
Doch vertrau mir, wir scheitern nicht
Solange sich nur einer traut und für uns weiterspricht
Denn der Ton macht die Musik und meine Stimme, sie ertönt
Sie könn'n weghör'n, doch mein Inneres nicht zähm'n
Ich weiß nicht, wer du bist, doch ich weiß, dass es dich gibt
Erzähl der Welt von all dem Hass, den du siehst

Ich bin deine Stimme, wenn dich niemand mehr erhört
Berichte von dem widerlichen Schmerz
Ich bin deine Stimme, wenn das Leben dich erdrückt
Deine Stimme, wenn dich jeder hier vergisst
Ich bin deine Stimme, wenn dich niemand mehr erhört
Berichte von dem widerlichen Schmerz
Ich bin deine Stimme, wenn das Leben dich erdrückt
Deine Stimme, wenn dich jeder hier vergisst

Sag, was wissen all die Rapper von der Wut hier im Hals?
Ihre Zeilen zielen auf Schwächere, Betrug und Gewalt
Wir erfrieren in der Kälte und die hau'n Kufen ins Eis
Sag, was wissen deine Rapper schon von Nudeln mit Salz?
Was wissen die von Battle, nur für Name und Respekt?
Oder von Crystal Meth in der Nase deiner Ex?
Rap hat Angst vor der Unterschicht, Hashtag „wir“
Deswegen durft' ich 2'14 auf dem Splash nicht spiel'n
Ich meine, Rap ist Dreck, Rap ist echt
Rap bedeutet, nur mit Worten in den Händen ins Gefecht
Darum bin ich deine Stimme, auch in Runde 13
Auch in Minute 91, deine Stimme, Bruder, auch, wenn du kein Deutsch sprichst
Schrei' für die Unterdrückten, den andern bleibt genug
Rap ist ein Buch und jedem steht eine Zeile zu
Und all die Schreiber sitzen feige auf Gold
Jeder da draußen soll es wissen: Ich bin einer von euch

Ich weiß nicht, wer du bist, doch ich weiß, dass es dich gibt
Und ich werd' hier am Boden bleiben, ich reiße ihn auf
Ich erzähl' es der Welt, damit es keiner vergisst
Ich werd's von unten nach oben schrei'n

Ich bin deine Stimme, wenn dich niemand mehr erhört
Berichte von dem widerlichen Schmerz
Ich bin deine Stimme, wenn das Leben dich erdrückt
Deine Stimme, wenn dich jeder hier vergisst
Ich bin deine Stimme, wenn dich niemand mehr erhört

Liquit Walker,"Ich seh' dich an wie am ersten Tag
Seh' unsere endlosen Spuren noch zwischen Berg und Tal
Bruder, ich weiß, und du weißt, dass ich weiß
Halt die Faust vor meiner Brust, der Finger zeigt eine Eins
Seh' dein Herz in Scherben, deine Werte sterben
Ich kann das fühlen, wenn du schreist, ohne gehört zu werden
Kenn' den Anfang, werd' das Ende nicht verpassen
Steh' im Rausch von dem Schall all der Menschen, die dich verachten
Dein Geist, meine Flügel, deine Wut, meine Ketten
Nur ein Funken hat gefehlt, nur eine Stufe der Treppe
Ich weiß, du kannst das nicht, kennst keine Regeln mehr
Ich zähl' nicht mehr, wie oft war es die ganze Scheiße hier eh nicht wert?
Eine Unendlichkeit aus falschem Stolz
Doch so viele, denen du deinen Handschlag hättest verweigern soll'n
Das zwischen uns ist ein Ding zwischen uns
Niemand auf der Welt kann uns richten für die Kunst

Und wenn es sein muss: Auf Wiederseh'n, leb deine Gier
Stolper nicht auf dem Weg durch die Tür
Alles, was mir bleibt, ist ein Echo (Echo, Echo)
Alles, was mir bleibt, ist ein Echo (Echo, Echo)
Und wenn du gehst, behalt die Seele bei dir
Stolper nicht auf dem Weg durch die Tür
Alles, was mir bleibt, ist ein Echo (Echo, Echo)
Alles, was sich reimt, ist ein Echo (Echo, Echo)

Wir standen fest auf den mattschwarzen Holzplatten
Die graue Worte für den Augenblick zu Gold machten
Doch wenn das Licht ausgeht, tötet's dich
Weil hier Charakter nur bedeutet, dann zu lächeln, wenn es nötig ist
Ich fühl' dich jeden meiner Verse zerstör'n
Doch irgendwo unter der Baseline ist dein Herzschlag zu hör'n
In unsern Venen schlug der gleiche Takt
Beim nächsten Song bist du eingesackt
Bruder, ist okay, dann stirb endlich, ruhe in Frieden
Doch gottverdammt nochmal, ich will dich nicht so seh'n, auf deinen blutenden Knien
Gib mir ein Zeichen, dass ich aufhör'n kann, zu kämpfen
Ich steh' hier zitternd vor Wut, nur mit meinem Traum in den Händen
Du verspielst dein Erbe
Wenn deine Liebe dazu nicht größer ist, als die Liebe dafür, geliebt zu werden
Du hast uns beide gefickt
Und der Tag, an dem du gehst, wird einer sein, an dem der Feind mich zerfrisst

Und wenn es sein muss: Auf Wiederseh'n, leb deine Gier
Stolper nicht auf dem Weg durch die Tür
Alles, was mir bleibt, ist ein Echo (Echo, Echo)

Liquit Walker,"Mir geht's eigentlich okay, doch manchmal denk' ich dann nach
Denn mir fehl'n grad mal wieder neunundneunzig Pfennig zur Mark
Schon wieder Zeit für ein verschwendetes Jahr
In der Schlange für den Club des Lebens, aber keinen Stempel am Arm
Steh' auf Badelatschen im Weg zwischen Benz oder Bahn
Ein Leben mit Pokerface zwischen Penner und Star
Die Ruhe vor dem Sturm, der Wecker klingelt ständig Alarm
Zwischen „gerade erst angefang'n“ und „das Ende ist nah“
Ich kenn' die Bar und jedes Glas, zwischen Eistee und Moët
Tausend Kreuzungen, ich hab' all die Pfeile nich' gesehen
Ich bleib' stehen und überleg' mir, einfach weit genug zu gehen
Geht's ums Ziel oder darum, auf der Reise was zu sehen?
Ich bin laut und überheblich, bin ein Schwein und ein Prolet
Ich bin leise und gediegen, bescheidener Poet
Zwischen Wasser bis zum Hals und beiden Beinen auf dem Steg
Dieses Leben, es ist eigentlich okay

Auch wenn mir zum Glück oft die großen Scheine fehlen
Weiß ich, wo ich steh' auf mei'm Weg zwischen Geiern und Hyänen
Es ist eigentlich okay, reicht und geht
Was kostet die Welt? Ich zahl' Blut, Schweiß und Tränen
Auch wenn mir zum Glück oft die großen Scheine fehlen
Folge kei'm Befehl auf mei'm Weg zwischen Geiern und Hyänen
Es ist eigentlich okay, reicht und geht
Was kostet die Welt? Ich zahl' Blut, Schweiß und Tränen

Ich rechne felsenfest mit Steinen sowie Kanten auf dem Weg
Das heißt, irgendwer muss fegen und ein anderer muss gehen
Manchmal fühlst du dich verlassen, betrogen, beklaut
Mit einem Knie schon auf dem Boden, doch erhobenem Haupt - wenn's geht
Und auch wenn morgen nochmal gestern ist
Ich bin dankbar für jeden Fehler im Leben, doch vergess' ihn nicht
Niemals die Wut auf das, was uns die Hände bricht
Unsere Schreie werden schwächer, doch sie enden nicht
Und vielleicht sind wir verlorene Jungs
Denn diese Welt blickt so verachtend von oben auf uns
Doch wir bau'n Schlösser aus Matschepampe am Boden im Sumpf
Aber der Winkel eines Bildes macht das Foto zu Kunst
Lass' im Zweifel jeden Grund verstumm'n
Meine Mama hat gesagt, ich soll ich nicht schwarzsehen, es ist allerhöchstens dunkelbunt
Nimm dieses Lächeln und ein zweites für den Weg
Dieses Leben, es ist eigentlich okay

Auch wenn mir zum Glück oft die großen Scheine fehlen
Weiß ich, wo ich steh' auf mei'm Weg zwischen Geiern und Hyänen
Es ist eigentlich okay, reicht und geht

Denn so wie ich's in meinem Album schreibe, so schallt's wieder raus
Kein Image dieser Welt wird meine Texte schreiben
Ihr kommt alle mit 'nem Benzer, aber keiner mit paar freshen Lines
Klatsch' auf die Snare, majestätische Base
Wenn ich nur hot Line bling wie'n chinesischer Drake
Liq Van Damme, er wächst mit zwischen Würde und Geld
Meine Stimme wirkt, eure wirken verstellt
Ich release paar Songs, andere Rapper leasen sich Songs
Keine Lügen, wenn man mal im Booklet liest zu den Songs
Is' okay, deutscher Rap ist nur ein Businessmove
Doch bevor es explodiert, geht es Liq-Liq-Boom!

Kickte den Part, dass du glaubst, du hast 'n Fuß im Ohr
Mit der Epik eines Tubachors
Meine Stimme scheppert durch die Boxen wie Raketen durch Bazookarohr
Ich fall' auf keinen mehr rein
Ich glaube, ihr verwechselt scheinheilig sein und den Heiligenschein
Kein Reim, schwing' das Henkersbeil
Sag mir nicht, dass deutscher Rap der rote Faden fehlen würde, denn er hängt an einem
Geht mit Walker in den Schuhen
Meine Feinde haben alle Schaum vorm Mund wie 'n Recording in der Booth
Fick auf Punchlines und Doppelmoppelreime
Letzten Endes geht's darum, dass meine Mutter besser kochen kann als deine
Deutschrap in Flamm'n, alles Teufel und Lüge
Ich bin nur hier, um 'n bisschen Liquit in das Feuer zu gießen
In 'nem Krieg zwischen Raps und Beats
Ihr könnt ballern wie ihr wollt, es geht darum, wer als letzter schießt

Ihr Herz auf der Faust, wir geh'n durch Rauch, wenn wir laufen
Wir sind Totgeglaubte
Du kannst es sehen, Mittelfinger im Rückspiegel, Totenkopf auf der Motorhaube
Basy im Nacken, „stay true“ auf den Knuckles
Familie in der Hand, Herzblut ihre Waffe
Weder, was wir fühlen, noch die Schritte von uns beiden
Die Geschichten, die sie schreiben, sind das Leben, das wir führ'n
Sie könn'n nie auf diese Stufe komm'n
Denn mein Mädchen hier steht über all den Schlampen und Huren aus euren Schmusesongs
Du stellst dich besser wenn sie geht nicht in den Weg
Ich brech' jedem seinen Finger, der ihn gegen sie erhebt
Unser Spiegelbild mit Scherben verziert
Ich hab' geseh'n wie sie zerbrechen am Versuch daran zu werden wie wir
Die letzte Frau dieser Welt, die meine Verse prägt
Das kleine Mädchen, das 'ne abgesägte Pumpgun im Herzen trägt

Lass sie alle mit den Fingern vor uns droh'n
Es ist egal, Baby, sie bring'n uns nicht zu Boden
Den Himmel im Herz für die Hölle im Kopf
Tanz der Königin im Chaos, du bist Mallory Knox

Krieg der Liebe, es geht darum, für was du bereit bist abzuzieh'n
Und ich dreh' durch nur für die Wut meiner Frau
Sie ist meine Ketten und Flügel, die letzte Kugel im Lauf
Meine Fährte aus dem Nichts
Und ich vergesse niemals diesen einen Tag, an dem du stärker warst als ich
All diese Fetzen sind wir
Ich schreib' dein'n Nam'n grad mit dunkelroter Tinte auf das letzte Blatt Papier
Mickey und Mallory, Clarence und Alabama
Ein Hauch von Vince und Mia, John und Jane, wenn es dämmert
Steh'n ohne Schutz im Regen
Es zählt nur diese Art von Liebe, die bereit ist, am Ende mit dir kaputt zu gehen
Ich halt' dich fest, denn jedes Wort zerbricht

Läufer, Walker - Wagemut, mich zu testen
Halt' mein Herz mehr im Takt als meine Beine
Echo in den hintersten Ecken des Hasses meiner Feinde
Zwischen hellschwarz und dunkelweiß
Stumpfes Eis, unser Leid ist die scheiß Wut im Unterleib
Lass' den Staub vergeh'n
Weiß nicht viel über Siege, doch alles über nach Niederlagen aufzusteh'n
Meine Entourage steht für sich, eh wie ich
Wir sind ein Haufen Taugenichtse auf dem Weg ins Nichts

Wollt' ein kleines bisschen Frieden im Niemandsland
Doch stand einsam mit der Wahrheit an der Front beim letzten Widerstand
Zieh' an der Friedenspfeife
Führ' ein Leben, über das sie dann aus der sicheren Ferne dann ihre Lieder schreiben
Die Lüge wartet mit der Schaufel an mei'm Grab
Gut zu wissen, den zu kenn'n, der es auszusprechen wagt
Der Thron funkelt ohne mich
Doch irgendjemand muss den Rücken grade halten, wenn ein Zacken aus der Krone bricht
Beim letzten Morgenrot zuhause, wenn es endet
König der Verdammten, mit den Bauern in der Schenke

Liquit Walker,"Man sagt, die Feder sei mächtiger als das Schwert
Aber was ist mit dem Wort und den Schwätzern, die es entehren?
Manche Worte haben nichtmal ein Gesicht
Manche Worte keine Wirkung, aber manche Gewicht
Die uns zwing'n, in Sekunden zu fall'n
Denn manche Worte treffen Menschen an den Stellen, wo ihre Wunden nich' heil'n
Aus falschen Blicken werden Worte und dann falsche Sätze
Es ist einfach: Halt dein Wort oder halt die Fresse
Aber ihr ballert wie mit Kugeln im Krieg
Keine Toten, aber viele fordern Blut für den Sieg
Kaltes Lächeln auf den Phrasen für die Tarnung
Mein Vater meinte, ich soll alles hinterfragen (ja), aber warum?
Ich red' gelegentlich in Rätseln für ein Herz aus Gold
Weil sie zwar sagen, dass sie stehen, doch nicht hören wollen
Und unsere Augen hoffen letztlich auf Taten
Doch was manche Worte bedeuten, können Sätze nich' sagen

Ich hab' das alles schon gehört und gesehen
Und die ersten, die reden, sind auch die ersten, die gehen
Die Augen taub und die Ohren sind blind
Fliegt vorbei, alles Worte im Wind
Ich hab' das alles schon gehört und gesehen
Und die ersten, die reden, sind auch die ersten, die gehen
Die Augen taub und die Ohren sind blind
Fliegt vorbei, alles Worte im Wind

Große Worte sind der größte Feind von großen Taten
Laufen statt reden bedeutet „Walker“, sozusagen
Unter 'nem besseren Stern
Denn eines Tages geh'n all die Worte zu Boden wie die Blätter im Herbst
Ich trag' die Wut noch zwischen Magen und Kiefer
Kein Tiefschlaf, wenn du weißt: Die scheiß Wahrheit sieht niemand
Denn jeder redet mit jedem ums Überleben
Nur auf Vorteil besinnt, das sind Worte im Wind
Gute Miene, dafür böse die Gefühle
Denn sie achten nicht auf Inhalt deiner Worte, sondern Größe deiner Bühne
„Ein Mann, ein Wort“ bedeutet „viele Männer, viele Worte“
Und am Ende fordern Worte wieder Widerworte
Jede Faust ist nur ein Wort, das wir nicht sagen können
Weil uns sonst der Atem brennt
Und meine Worte sind geladene Pistol'n, eiskalt, wenn ich ziele
Heute weiß ich, wann es Zeit ist zu schießen

Ich hab' das alles schon gehört und gesehen
Und die ersten, die reden, sind auch die ersten, die gehen
Die Augen taub und die Ohren sind blind
Fliegt vorbei, alles Worte im Wind
Ich hab' das alles schon gehört und gesehen
Und die ersten, die reden, sind auch die ersten, die gehen
Die Augen taub und die Ohren sind blind
Fliegt vorbei, alles Worte im Wind

Die Augen tauben und die Ohren sind blind
Ehrlich, nimm mich beim Wort, ich mein' es wortwörtlich

The deepest ocean for my love to find.

To ferry me over to my love and die.

Of happy times spent long ago.

Soft is the grass and my bed is free.

Only for nights in ballygrand,
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
The deepest ocean for my love to find.

But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
Nor do I, have wings to fly
If I could find me a handsome boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times spent long ago.
My childhood friends and my own relations.
Have all passed on now, like melting snow.

But I?ll spend my days in endless roaming
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
But to be back now in Carrickfergus,
On that long road down to the sea.

Then maybe at the closing of your day,
You can sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh,
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay.

Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadow making hay,
Just to sit beside the turf fire in a cabin,
And watch the barefoot gosoons as they play.

Ooh

For the breezes blowing o'er the sea's from Ireland,
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow,
And the women in the uplands digging praties,
Speak a language that the strangers do not know.

Yet the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways,
And they scorned us just for being what we are,
But they might as well go chasin' after moon beams,
Or light a penny candle from a star.

And if there's gonna be a life here after,
And faith somehow I'm sure there's gonna be,
I will ask my God to let me make my Heaven,
In that dear land across the Irish sea.

As some fair woman, lost in cushions deep
With gentle hand caresses listlessly
The contour of her breasts before she sleeps
On velvet backs of avalanches soft

She often lies enraptured as she dies
And gazes on white visions aloft
Which like a blossoming to heaven rise
When sometimes on this globe, in indolence
She lets a secret tear drop down, by chance
A poet, set against oblivion

Takes in his hand this pale and furtive tear
This opal drop where rainbow hues appear
And hides it in his breast far from the sun",The Butterfly,2005

And watches the ships that go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea

Lisa,"When the light begins to fade
And shadows fall across the sea,
One bright star in the evening sky
Your love's light leads me on my way

There's a dream that will not sleep,
A burning hope that will not die
So I must go now with the wind,
And leave you waiting on the tide

Time to fly, time to touch the sky
One voice alone, a haunting cry
One song, one star burning bright,
May it carry me through darkest night

Rain comes over the gray hills,
And on the air, a soft goodbye
Hear the song that I sing to you
When the time has come to fly

When I leave and take the wind
And find the land that faith will bring,
The brightest star in the evening sky
Is your love waiting far for me",The Soft Goodbye,2008

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home,
And grace will lead us home

Time to close your eyes.
And save these questions for another day.

I think you know what I've been trying to say.
I promise I would never leave you.
And you should always know, I never will be far away.

And still so many things I want to say.
Remember all the songs you sang for me.

You'll always be a part of me.

Eighteen ninety-two,
They opened Ellis Island and they let
The people through.
And the first to cross the threshold
Of that isle of hope and tears,
Was Annie Moore from Ireland
Who was all of fifteen years.

[Chorus]
Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.

In a little bag she carried
All her past and history,
And her dreams for the future
In the land of liberty.
And courage is the passport
When your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past
When you're fifteen years

[Chorus]

When they closed down Ellis Island
In nineteen forty-three,
Seventeen million people
Had come there for sanctuary.
And in springtime when I came here
And I stepped onto it's piers,
I thought of how it must have been
When you're fifteen years.

We looked at each other in the same way then

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then

Lisa Asher,"I can recall the sound of the wind
As it blew through the trees and the trees would bend
I can recall the smell of the rain
On a hot summer night
Coming through the screen

I'd crawl in your bed when the lightning flashed
And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast
Its light all around your room

We lived on a street where the tall elm shade
Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade
That you held in your teeth as we lay on our backs
Staring up at the blue and the blue stared back

I used to believe we were just like those trees
We'd grown just as tall and as proud as we pleased
With our feet on the ground and our arms in the breeze
Under a sheltering sky

Twirl me about, and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
And when I look up at you looking down,
Say it was only a dream

A big truck was parked in the drive one day
They wrapped us in paper and moved us away
Your room was no longer next door to mine
And this kid sister thing was old by that time

But oh how our dreams went bump in the night
And the voices downstairs getting into a fight
And the next day a silence you could cut with a knife
And feel like a blade at your throat

Twirl me about and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it as only a dream

The day you left home you got an early start
I watched your car back out in the dark
I opened the door to your room down the hall
I turned on the light
And all that I saw
Was a bed and a desk and couple of tacks
No sign of someone who expects to be back
It must have been one hell of a suitcase you packed

Twirl me about, twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it was only a dream

I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room
 
I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room
 
Baby it's a dream come true
Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel a something pounding in my brain
Just any time that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound I hear thunder boom
Every time that you walk in the room

Of western Kentucky
On wobbly knees
With mama beside you 
To help you along 
You'll soon be growing up strong
 
All the long, lazy mornings 
In pastures of green 
The sun on your withers 
The wind in your mane 
Could never prepare you
For what  lies ahead 
The run for the roses so red
 
And it's run for the roses 
As fast as you can 
You fate is delivered 
Your moment's at hand 
It's the chance of a lifetime 
In a lifetime of chance 
And it's high time you joined
In the dance 
It's high time you joined 
In the dance 
 
From sire to sire 
It's born in the blood
The fire of a mare 
And the strength of a stud 
It's breeding and it's training
And it's something unknown
That drives you 
And carries you home 
 
And it's run for the roses 
As fast as you can 
Your fate is delivered 
Your moment's at hand 
It's the chance of a lifetime 
In a lifetime of chance

And never get love
You'd better let love depart

I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone

I guess I'll never be the same

Growin' up livin' in my own little world, so it seemed
I had my dolls and dreams
Momma was always there to comfort me and give me love
And there wasn't nothin' quite like it in the world that I knew of

Before I knew it I was standin' in my teens
Sweet little boy with his strong young arms holdin' me
I remember the first time I felt his kiss
Ooh, it like to drove me crazy and I remember sayin'
""I never felt nothin' like this""

So I went and asked momma, ""Can you tell me what it means?""
She said, ""You're in love and that's every little girl's dream?
""Baby, what you found is every little girl's dream""

So I said, ""Momma, does love ever last?""
She said, ""Worry about now and let the future come to pass
Just understand and enjoy what you've found
And listen to it as long as your heart hears the sound of love?

?There ain't nothin' quite like it in the world anybody knows of""
So there I was, all through my teens
Same little boy with his strong young arms lovin' me
I remember the first time I felt his kiss
Ooh, it like to drove me crazy and I remember sayin'
""I never felt nothin' like this""

And I remember sayin' to momma, ""I know just what you mean
I'm in love and that's every little girl's dream
What I found is every little girl's dream""

And I found mine and momma said
""Me too, baby, once upon a time
Lifts you up, it lets you down
There'll be another dream to bring you back around

There's somethin' about the first time
That keeps you rememberin'
You found every little girl's dream

Found every little girl's dream

I found every little girl's dream

Lisa Brokop,"I caught you glancing in a pawn shop window,
You caught me looking there too.
Just a little quarter-carat diamond,
But it was sparkling true.
I could see you were a little uneasy,
You said: ""We're running late.""
And later on, parked over in my driveway,
Said: ""Boy, you're gonna have to wait.
""If you really want to be my baby,
""I really want you to be mine, all mine.
""If you want to talk about forever, 
""That's what's on my mind.

Gentle roses and sweet perfume.
I was thrilled the first time you kissed me.
But just a little too soon.
Where I come from, love stands for something.
And it's worth the wait.

And by the time the thunder rolled in I reached for you and you were gone
I guess I barely got to know you, guess I hardly know myself
I still have some things here for you that I can't give to no one else

Never did say goodbye
I never did tell you how you changed my life
About the time you came along
We got caught out in a storm and I got lost without your light

Now every time they call for rain
I reach out to touch the sky
Maybe I'll see you again
Maybe that's the reason why you never said goodbye

I get so tired of pretending that you never flew away
Seems like I'm always defending myself and how I think of you this way
If I can see you in my mirror then maybe you can see me too
On a sunny day I'm feeling better, on a cloudy day I look for you

Never did say goodbye
I never did tell you how you changed my life

And you need somewhere to cry

And we stayed up yellin' at each other till late last night

And I woke up this mornin' thinkin' who needs you

Who needs you stealing my covers, taking up half the bed

Wake up and let me apologize

She'll come to life and tell them when

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

You're always running I'm standing still
You live for the moment, no future no past

If you ever have forever in mind
I'll be here and easy to find
If your heart isn't ready to lay down with mine
If you ever have forever in mind

The music has ended still you want to dance
I know that feeling, I can't take that chance
You live for the moment no future no past

Listen to my nine millimeter go bang
Out goes your brains, feel the motherfucking terror
And you ain't felt the coming of death like this ever
You paused, and now I got a Colt 45
Semiautomatic exploding between your eyes, surprise
You never thought your yesterdays would come back to haunt you
But believe me, I've come back to haunt you
I'm bout to bring your dog days to you mista
Cause rules in the streets you come off we come get ya
And hit ya', and I done let you slide a few times
But eventually you gots to die in due time

Sunshine
My life, my life, my life

His mama must've got the news
The little boy that she gave birth to was on of them niggas they pulled
Out the room
And all my other little homies stood shocked
While they watched my other little homie bleed non-stop
On the other side of sorrow is a father being torn
Apart by the sight of his son's lying in the morgue
He mourned cause now he got to deal with the fact
That his child is gone and tears can't bring him back
Turn on the T.V. and seen the unabomber
I flew to D.C., still they got no karma
And everybody say they think its all gonna change
You paint me pictures, but they all look the same
Its strange, I'm standing in my own frame of thought
Remaining in the street game framing which I was taught
I was taught to always keep my eyes open wide
Cause in these streets you got to ride or you die
I've seen a child born and I've seen a man die
Can't live forever and I understand why
So when your time comes will you crawl or be brave
And in between judgment will you fall or be saved
Sunshine

[Chorus]

Tears rolled town his face as he stared at his potna
With his chest full of holes and his head full of coppa
Broke his ass off something proper he's in the morgue
With his brains in a shit bag and a toe tag on-gone
This motherfucker must've thought he was a cat
And had nine lives but ended up on his back
And then the reaper came and took control of your mind
And you can't think you got a hole in your mind
You dyin' and can't nobody bring you out your coma
When this nigga brought the end and turned the lights out for ya
See ya and I wouldn't want to be in your position
Cause starin' the shaft of a strap and you the mission
Means one thing you let a motherfucker catch you on the sneak tip
And put your ass off in some deep shit, got the deep six
And everybody sad sendin' flowers to your ceremony
They lost their motherfuckin' homey
Damn Audi 5 on some dumb shit
And motherfuckers steady risking their safety behind this dumb shit
But I refuse to give a nigga mine
I give a nigga nine

Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

With distingue traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

There's too much pain for you to stay
And nothing we had remains the same
They say that everything must change

Even so
We can always start
Over from zero
And we'll be closer than
The rhythum of our hearts



",The Rhythm of Our Hearts,2000
Lisa Ekdahl,"This night
I awoke
Out from dreams
Of tall cascading fontains
Of love
I'm floating like a dove
Covered from above
With fountains of love

And you
Fly with me
Through a scene
Of deep caressing rivers
Of love
Soft as a dove
It's you I'm dreaming of
With rivers of love

Flowing from above
Knowing only of
Rivers of love



",Rivers of Love,2000
Lisa Ekdahl,"In the silence of my mind
I can see our love was just a line
To a grasp of air
That's nowhere

And while I wait for love's embrace
My life is but a race
Since you're gone now
All my light is left to waste

I never learned the rule
That love can be so cruel
When it's over and done
Now I can't believe
That what they say is true
How love can be renewed
Because once it's abused
Then it's through

There's no laughter in your smile
And all that's left are shadows in my mind
Of a different place
And your face

And in the quiet of my heart
The sadness lingers on
Now I just have a different point of view
Since you've been gone



",Since You've Been Gone,2000
Lisa Ekdahl,"The sun rose
And I awakened
Covered up in flames
I was lost
Like anyone knows
How I was shaken
Fallin' from in pain
I was almost blind
My hands entwined
But suddenly the
Sun rose right before my eyes
I can't believe that I
Could feel the way I do
I can't believe it's true
It's you and only you

The sun rose
In such an hazy
Sky this morning
I though
My soul
Would fly away
When it was
Just barely
High and dawning
I though I almost died
My hands were tied
But suddenly the
Sun rose right before my eyes
I can't believe that I
Could feel the way I do
I can't believe it's true
It's you and only you




",Sun Rose,2000
Lisa Ekdahl,"Sunny weather
Tastes much less sweeter
Since you went away
Sunny weather ain't no sunny anymore

Sunny weather
Seemed so much brighter
Now colors just fade
Sunny weather ain't no sunny anymore

All day
Rain falls
And I'll fall like a feather
'Till I can kiss you once again

This sunny weather
Feels colder than winter
My heart's turned to snow
Since you had to go
Sunny weather ain't no sunny anymore



",Sunny Weather,2000
Lisa Ekdahl,"I've looked all around this
Big old world and found that
All I really want is love

Nothing can compare
This world I've had my share of
All I really want is love

In this life of chasing dreams
Such strife in seeking schemes
Designed for happiness

Now I finally realized
Deep underneath my lies
All I really want is love.

I've had twice my share
From fortune to despair now
All I really want is love

Nothing satisfies this
World won't compromise me
All I really want is love



",All I Really Want Is Love,2002
Lisa Ekdahl,"It's, oh, so quiet
Shhhh, shhhh
It's, oh, so still
Shhhh, shhhh
You're all alone
Shhhh, shhhh
And so peaceful until...
You fall in love
Zing boom
The sky up above
Zing boom
Is caving in
You've never been so nuts about a guy
You want to laugh you want to cry
You cross your heart and hope to die
'Til it's over and then
Hmmm, hmmm
It's nice and quiet
But soon again
Starts another big riot
You blow a fuse
Zing bam
The devil cuts loose

Lisa Fischer,"Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

People used to laugh at me when I was a little girl
I guess they didn't understand
But when you're young and all alone
You make up things for the things that are missing
Ooh, how I used to love to dress up in my Mother's clothes
It made me feel like somebody
I'd pretend I was the prettiest girl at the dance
And all the boys loved me
And I was gonna be a big success
But of course I never got that dress for my very own
I didn't do half the things I thought I'd do
But I guess the good part of my life is that I did find you
And you know
Now when I look into a little girl's eyes
It's like a mirror
And I remember, I remember

She's faced the hardest times
You could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her little shoulders
Bore the weight of all her fears
And the sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight's silence in, in her ears

Let her cry, she is a lady
Let her dream, she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

Be careful how you touch her
For she will wake up
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you see life through her eyes
You won't believe
The way she's always paying
For a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows
That only she can hear, it's all she knows

Let her cry, oh my, cause she's a lady
Let her sing, sing, cause she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a sweet and gentle flower, growing wild

And if by chance you get to hold her
Hold her for a time
And with your new possession, what would you do
I would pick her up from the garden, to be mine

Each time her little shoulders
Bore the weight of all her fears
And the sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight's silence in, in her ears

Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her sing for she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her

She's a sweet and gentle flower, growing wild
And I feel the same
Just a sweet and gentle flower, growing wild
But no one's to blame

Except for in between the sun and the moon 

Packed up and moved out after all 
Bulldozed the house and watched it fall 
That blessed sight I still recall

Lisa Germano,"Every stop of the way we walk the line 
Your days are numbered  so are mine 
Time is piling up  we struggle and we scrape 
All boxed in  nowhere to escape 

The city's just a jungle  more games to play 
All trapped in the heart of it trying to get away 
I was raised in the country  been working in the town 
I've been in trouble since I set my suitcase down 

I got nothing for you  had nothing before 
Don't even have anything for myself anymore 
Sky's full of fire and the rain is pouring down 
There's nothing you can sell me, so I'll see you around 

All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime 
Could never do you justice, reason, or rhyme 
There's only one thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long 

The devil's in the alley, the mule kicking in the stall 
Say anything you want to, I've heard it all 
I was thinking about the things that she said 
I was dreaming I was sleeping in your bed 

Walking through the leaves falling from the trees 
Feel like a stranger nobody sees 
So many things we never will undo 
I know you're sorry, well, I'm sorry too 

Some people will offer you their hand, and some won't 
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't 
I need something strong to distract my mind 
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind 

Well, I got here following the southern star 
I crossed that river just to be where you are 
There's only one thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long 

Well, my ship's been split to splinter - it's sinking fast 
I'm drowning in the poison - got no future, got no past 
But my heart's not weary - it's light and it's free 
I've got nothing but affection for those who have sailed with me 

Everybody's moving if they ain't already there 
Everybody's gotta move somewhere 
Well, stick with me baby, anyhow 
Things should start to get interesting right about now 

Well, my clothes are wet, they're tight on my skin 
Not tight as the corner I painted myself in 
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind 
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine 

The emptiness is endless - cold as clay 
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way 
Well, there's only one thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long 

Yeah, the only thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long 
The only thing that I did wrong 
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long 
Woo!",Mississippi,1998
Lisa Germano,"I spent a year in the mouth of a whale with a flame and a book of signs 
You'll never know how hard I've failed trying to make up for lost time 
Once I believed in things unseen  I was blinded by the dark 
Out of the multitude to me he came and broke my heart 

When the dust in the fields has flown 
And the youngest of hearts has grown 
And you doubt you will ever be free 
Honey  don't bail on me 

River is wide and oh so deep and it winds and winds around 
I dream we're happy in my sleep, floating down and down and down 
And the tide rushes by where we stand 
And the earth underneath turns to sand 

And we're waiting for someone to see 
Honey, don't bail on me 
Tell Ma I loved a man even though I turned and ran 
Lovely and fine, I could've been, laying down in the palm of his hand 

Laying down in the palm of his hand 
Laying down in the palm of his hand 
Staying down in the palm of his hand 
In the morning you wait for the sun 

And secretly hope it won't come 
But time washes everything clean 
Honey, now don't bail on me 
Don't bail on me 

No, don't bail on me

When to open your eyes

Go away
Would you just go away
Go away, go away
They go away

Someday someone
Is gonna love you
Someday someone
Is gonna need you, too

When you empty your head
You can actually see

I am far away from where you lay
Awake the day while you fall to sleep
An ocean and a rock away

I keep you in the pockets of my dresses
And the bristles of my brushes
Spin you into my curls today

I spoon you into my coffee cup
Spin you through a delicate wash
I wear you all day

Lisa Hannigan,"Sit down and fire away, I know it's tricky when you're feeling low,
When you feel like your flavor
Has gone the way of a pre-shelled pistachio,
I know you're weighed down
You're fed up with your heavy
Your boots
Laced with melancholy notion's all you own

I do, like sugar, tend toward the brittle and sticky when spun
And I know my demeanor
Has gone the way of a photo left out in the sun,
So I try to keep myself in lillies and flax seeds,
Oh what a folly- fooling just yourself

Sit down and smoke away,I wouldn't knock it till you're in them shoes
Oh watch as ours subtlety blows away as a blusher gives way to a bruise,
But seemly, we'd freely make a trade-off
A dry rot to take the weight off
Swap the boots for red shoes",Pistachio,2008

The wishful thinking in my life, I see so
And he's like the wine on the weekend
And though he is like the sea and it's right he be so

There's one girl I like she's a smile on a Monday
And she'll fight to stay so
And she's like the sun on the weekend

Still I like that she sails with me

Didn't we all fake
Isn't it alright now

And he'll always be so

Lisa Hannigan,"Waking up today, it was cold out
There's something I should say, but I can't get my head around
The bends in your brain, and your elaborate pain
Makes me tired

As an old balloon, I hold my breath
Like a penance paid too soon, and with too much eagerness
To know what is true
When air is changed by you
Makes it hard

I don't know where it comes from
Where to go
When the rains come
When the rain put me back
In the battle
Where the sea meets the sun
Where the bones and their rattle
They don't mean anything to no one
I, I had a swing
When my salt was my own
I'd my teeth bared for battle
Till love lost made me dull
It made me dull
It made me dull

Put me back in the bottle

Lisa Hannigan,"I have lost you to sleep again. 
Sleeping as we do on opposite sides of a venn diagram 
I read the time in shadows on the wall
The shards of light through the slats on your window

I ease myself from under your languid arm, 
Fumble on my boots and hear you breathe through your alarm I disarm it for you, 
You rarely heed it anyway I wouldn't want it to intrude upon your dream, 
School bell ring messing up the play

A note, 
Penned clumsily in this century's type-ruined hand 
Saying gone down the shops for a walk I'll bring back some sandwiches 
And then I kiss your face, the black and the blue tie it into my laces, 
I don't want the wander blocking up the view

I stumble out into the afternoon.

You are falling
Falling away from here

And your words, they boil away like steam
And a lie burns long while the truth bites quick

You are lonely as a church
Despite the queuing out your door
I am empty as a promise, no more

When the time comes
And rights have been read
I think of you often
But for once I meant what I said

I was salted by your hunger
Now you've gone and lost your appetite
And a little bird is every bit as handy in a fight
I am lonely as a memory
Despite the gathering 'round the fire
Aren't you every bird on every wire?

When the time comes
And rights have been read
I think on you often

She hath my heart in thrall.

For love is Lord of all.

And often when the beetles horn
Has lulled the eve to sleep,

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh

Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells

If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head

And you'll only stop with top folks

Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown

Watch your Mounte bank account soar

A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose

If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck

Hereand there and yonder,
Wasting precious time
For no reason or rhyme?
Isn't it a pity!
Isn't it a crime!
My journey is ended,
Everything is splendid;
Meeting you today
Has given me a wonderful idea 
Here I stay!

It's a funny thing;
I look at you,
I get a thrill I never knew,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Here we are at last,
It's like a dream,
The two of us, a perfect team,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

Let's forget the past, let's both agree
That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
Fishing for salmon,
Losing at backgammon!
What joys untasted,
My nights were sour,
Spent with Schopenhauer!

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings

No I'm not just the L out of TLC
Songstress for the longest
Felt more adappa as a rappa
Start to make what it seems
It's more mind over matter
Have fun
Comin' with beats & rhymes
But it's not so sweet in this light of lime
Sometimes when you make it people get mad
Throw buckets grab, backs get stabbed
It was a hard struggle, meaning shit
Now it's hard just tryin' to juggle this, among shit
So people see the smile
All the while I have an inner child
That's cryin' denial (cry in denial)
Cryin' no smile, cryin' with style of beguile
In piles in aisles of niles
Meanwhile seem so senile, fakes monsters
I'm docile, fragile
I show gentile smiles, I take it a mile
People don't see the truth, in this booth
Under my tongue, over my tooth (ah-ooohh)

Sportin' laughs, bubble baths, autographs
Awards and claps
The glistenin' only comes if people listenin'
But to a lyricist, chastising conniving, critics
Gotta earn your bliss, unchill your wrists
I know you mince, add bills to rent
So now you owe me
That's why I'm so into it
This tapestry
Put you abstract, non-skilled folks can't see
I hinted at them, add tracks
Don't care if you're mad at
I speak the past
I speak rash spirits
Universal, helped my lyric rehearsals of the here's
Become an adult from peers, much fears, such tears
Scorned from revelations dawn
Things I do like, morning lawns
I'm morning poems
That now yawnin' on
They're not spawning wands (they're not spawning wands)
This here wand has a magic stick
Throat-wise called the Larynx
Helps me spill it, my utter of a mind
I milk it
So that it hits your back with spiritual parmalat

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
He's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to his arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

As you lie in slumber deep
My blessing goes with you

This is my prayer for you
There for you, ever true
Each every day for you
In everything you do

And when you come to me
And hold me close to you
I bless you
And you bless me too

When your weary heart is tired
If the world would leave you uninspired
When nothing more of love's desire

When the storms of life are strong
When you're wounded, when you don't belong
When you no longer hear my song

The changes that have come over me
In these last few days I've been afraid
That I might drift away
I've been telling old stories, singing songs
That make me think about where I've come from
That's the reason why I seem
So far away today

Let me tell you that I love you
That I think about you all the time
Caledonia, you're calling me, now I'm going home
But if I should become a stranger
Know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had

Now I have moved and I've kept on moving
Proved the points that I needed proving
Lost the friends that I needed losing
Found others on the way
I have kissed the fellas and left them crying
Stolen dreams, yes, there's no denying
I have traveled hard, sometimes with conscience flying
Somewhere with the wind

[Chorus]

Now I'm sitting here before the fire
The empty room, the forest choir
The flames have cooled, don't get any higher
They've withered, now they've gone
But I'm steady thinking, my way is clear
And I know what I will do tomorrow
When hands have shaken, the kisses float
Then I will disappear

Lisa Kirk,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band

Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

Lisa Kirk,"Love is the reason you were born
Love was the gleam in papa's eye

People suddenly meet
People suddenly fit
People suddenly hit
And brother, that's it

Personally
Love is a kick right in the pants
Love is the aspirin you buy

If you're flappin' your fins
If you're climbin' a wall
There must be a reason for it all
What is the reason for it all?
Love is the reason for it all

Love is the night you can't recall
Love is the extra drink you drank

Love's a shot in the arm
Love's a poke in the ribs
Buyin' bottles and bibs
And fillin' up cribs

Obviously
Love is an old established trap
Ten million suckers walk the plank

If you land on your tail
Every time that you fall
I can't see the reason for it
Who needs a reason for it?
Love is the reason for it all

Hallways are lovely for a call
Call it the season

While shepherds watch their flocks by night,
They saw a bright new shining star,
And hear a choir from heaven sing, the music came from afar.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a new king born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a new king born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

By and by they found a nook in a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little child was born.

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live for evermore

Lisa Lambe,"My young love said to me, ""My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind.""
Then she stepped away from me and this she did say:
""It will not be long, love, till our wedding day.""
She stepped away from me and she moved thru' the fair
And fondly I watched her move here and move there.
And she made her way homeward with one star awake
As swan in the evening moves over the lake.

So softly she came that her feet made no din,
And she laid her hand on me and this she did say:

Don't you know you're my everything? 
Oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything? 
Yes, you are

I wish you were my lover
But ya act so undercover
To love you child my whole life long
Be it right, or be it wrong
I'm only what you make me, baby
Don't walk away, don't be so shady
Don't want your mind, don't want your money
These words I say, they may sound funny, but

[Chorus]

You are my heat
You are my fire
You make me weak with strong desire
I'll love you child my whole life long
Be it right, or be it wrong
I just want to satisfy ya
Though you're not mine
I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby? 
Love me now or I'll go crazy

You're my heat, you are my fire
You're not mine, I can't deny ya
Don't you hear me talking, baby?

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven

How near, how far

Lisa Lindley Jones,"I am waiting for the clouds to divide 
I am willing my subconscious to pay up
I must admit that I am passing it on
I never thought that I would have to give up

I am sharing knowledge that I cannot explain
Feel forced to express my intent
It's not my fault that you're not listening
I'm coming through clear across the long descent

Out on a limb, on a wire, by a thread you collide
Out on a limb, on a wire, by a thread you collide
Through your eye
With your mind and your soul

I must measure miles, distance and time
All solid form and light reflecting shape
Despite the trip this is bending my mind
I need to find a route of escape

Those savage nights bring relief in the dawn
All subtleties are lost on you
There are links missing in this chain
Are you falling for the broken man again?

I broke down

I gave up
I gave out

I was strong
Didn't need

Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying

And you, don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

Ah, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you

Oh, you. All over you, oooh
Never wanted to see things you way
I had to go astray, oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener [why oh why]
Is it too late for me to find my way home,
How could I be so wrong? [Leavin' me all alone]

Don't you know the heart will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame
You were the one who left me neglected [I'm so sorry]
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you collected

Ah, I gave you all of me [gave me all of you]
How was I to know you would weaken so easily
Ah, I don't what to do
I'm all cried out [I'm all] over you [I'm cried out too]

I can't seem to face the fact that boy I'm losing you

Some things don't need a payback. some things are sure But the answers I find, aren't what you want to hear. they're not even close. Some things you can' t feel safe about. Some things don't need a clear up. You got that? I remember good things like the van breaking down. I sat on your lap in the auto repair and you touched my hair. While the heavy drops rain on the pavement outside. Don't take revenge. just let it lie. Don't give me a chance. You don't owe me that. The easiest thing, is if you just let it die.

At the toast and the butter

And closes the door to her room
There's nothing inside her
She's weak and she's tired of feeling like this

And they rise in the morning
And they sleep in the dark
And even though nobody's looking

They call her for dinner, she makes up a reason
She looks at her arms and she rolls down her sleeves
And her mother is starting to see through her lies
And last night her father had tears in his eyes

A prize in a cracker jack

Just look at their poor faces

It's not in the cards for them 
Look down at their hands 
You'll see nothing but emptiness and misery

Drink til' they can't tell what's wrong

Diamonds are just rocks that shine

Don't take it serious, life's too mysterious
You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go

So keep repeating, It's the berries
The strongest oak must fall
The sweet things in life to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?

Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh, aha

Laugh and love, live and laugh at it all

The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It's not some one who has seen the Light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah",Hallelujah [Acoustic Version] [Version],

Corroe mi alma lo que estoy pensando

Encuentras un nuevo amigo
Que ocupa mi sitio
Que cruel es la duda
Es el peor enemigo

Será que al dejarte sola
Cuando me encuentro ausente
Tienes un amigo que ocupa tu vida

Será que me amas
O es solo tu orgullo

Encuentras un nuevo amigo

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,

No need for greed or hunger

Lisa Maffia,"You think im deep?
I go deeper than the graves
Where they bury the foot and mouth sheep
Take a look in my mind
Take a peep
Girls mind when you sleep 'cause
Boom-only i wonder why
Boom- on it we'll never die
Nein in German is nine
Never go there, never combine

These lyrics are just to fill in the time
Until im ready to blow your mind
So Solid in time
Bubbler, Swiss, MC Romeo
Lisa Maffia with the Jarrell
Oh No

Promoters when you pay me
Dont screw up your face all bent
All your doin is refunding me
For all of the raving money i spent
That was to pay rent
Haterz dont go and be like that
Screwing up your face in the dark
Dont let me get dark
Dont let me go in the boot of my car 
Thats in the car park

Ladies chill
Take your Monday pill
Please dont grill
Romeos on the mic and im still
Keeping it real
Until
I make a mill-
-llion of the pounds them
With my lyrical sounds them
Turn up the speaker then
'Cause i wanna go deeper then-a
Let me go deeper then

I wanna go
Back in the days when i never had nothing then
Never had enough money to buy all the sweets in the shop
So i put back some of them
Life was harder then
Hey afro, never go barber then
Grew up in a single parent family
Without no father then
So my mum took up harder then

On a scale of 1 to 10
Mum gets 10
Shes like one of the ravers them
up there chilling in V.I.P with her friend X2
Dont bother them then

*chorus*
Romeo and Lisa
Don't leave out the maffia
Lyrical flow so buff-ia
So Solid taking you deeper
On the mic i get a 
Slow flow to
Bubble on the double to

To my niggaz, kinda figures
With their fingers, on the triggers

Yo I'm spittin', if it ain't said then it's written
I fight my mother for the flows that I'm givin'
Never give in, bust shows never missin'
Mad shots to ya chest, learn a lesson
Your mother's at home and she's sweatin' and she's frettin'
Talk to the Feds, then she's missin'
Say my name, then she's missin'
Spoil my game, then she's missin'
I'm gonna get 'er when she cookin' in the kitchen
At night, in her bed when she kippin'
My gun's rippin', yo there's no slippin'
My gun's rippin', yo there's no slippin'
When I'm blazin' I'm grazin'
Burnin' bodies like raisins
Puttin' bodies in basements
And your crew is erasin'
Well white domination
So solid amazin'

I know what's comin' though, it's more dough
Flossin' my clique, spittin' my flows
This is my dough, my flow's
Keepin' niggaz on their knees and tha bitches on their toes
You see my dough, uh no no
First lady lettin' all'v her chicks dem know
Dem know, dem know
Keepin' niggaz on their knees and tha bitches on their toes

What ya gonna do, if it was me?
