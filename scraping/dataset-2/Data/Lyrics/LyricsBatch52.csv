Chris Cornell,"Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Black dog
Drinks from the water
Trying to cool his tongue
Like the king
Finds no peace
His work is never done
Night falls
Smoke on the water
Darkness closes in
Cold white hand, in the deep
Will drown you for your sin

It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
Pages keep on filling

Crying out
Go and wake the king
Call to arms
For those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground
The walls are coming down
It's do or die
Do or die

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Mad man
Blood on the altar
The Queen will have his head
His ghost will shake those rattling chains
Long after he's dead
No soul, knows his trouble
High upon his throne
Loved by few and judged by many
He bears that weight alone

It's a lifelong expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
And the pages keep on filling

Crying out
Go and wake the king
Call to arms
For those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground
The walls are coming down
It's do or die
Do or die

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Heavy is the head that wears the crown",Heavy Is the Head,2015
Chris Cornell,"Time ain’t nothing if it ain’t fast
Taking everything that you ever had
And giving nothing in return
But a cold bed in a quiet earth

But there's a door in every cell
A pearl inside of every shell

How hard can it be
To share your love with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning
How long when it feels like
We'll live forever I fear
That time will hide the years

Life ain’t nothing if it ain’t hard
It’ll show you who you truly are
Knock you down when you get too tall
Till you spun around in a free fall

But somewhere out there past the storm
Lies the shelter of your heart

So how hard can it be
To share your love with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning
How long when it feels like
We live for ever i fear
Like we were never here
So hold on tightly my dear

I'm not one to waste my time
Searching for something lightning
Somewhere out there lies the stone
Lies the shelter
Of your heart

So how hard can it be (how hard)
To share your love with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning
How long it feels like
We will live forever
But I fear
That time can hide the years
Like we were never here
So hold on tightly my dear

Before we disappear
Before we disappear",Before We Disappear,2015
Chris Cornell,"Night falls while drunken angels
Sleep by the side of the road
And I'm nodding in a stairwell
Just trying to stay out of the cold

Circling around the drain
Can't find my way back to home
The road is long
And never ends
Dark is the heart that wanders

Light breaks in through the window
Takes a minute to know where I am
A dying blackbird
Gives her soul to the wind
On the roof of the house
That I can see from the bed

Circling around the drain
Show me the way back home
The road is long
It never ends
Dark is the heart that wanders

I'd crawl a hundred thousand miles
Just to see your two eyes look me over
I'd steal you flowers in the bloodshot light
Of the lonely hours on a moonless night

Just like a stray dog in the rain
I can run all night and get nowhere
I picture you out underneath the porch light
Calling my name all night
And waiting for me

I thought I heard your voice in the water
As I walked by a fountain uptown
Now I'm an orphaned at the door of church
Just watching the water come down

Circling around the drain
Hope that I make it home
I never felt so far away
Dark is the heart
That wanders",Circling,2015
Chris Cornell,"Staring in the mirror with two borrowed eyes
Looking for the part of me that's still alive
Waiting for my chest to fall and rise
Standing in the corner With my shirt tucked in 
Summer turns to autumn winter turns to spring 
And it all flies by like a speeding train 
 
Dead wishes on a broken chain 
White roses in a dead man's dream 
Down and out with nothing to lose 
If these long dead wishes 
Ever do come true 
 
Waiting for the night to come and chase away 
All the flies gathering around my head 
With my memory for a pillow 
And all my regrets for a bed 
 
Dead wishes on a burning lake 
White roses from my soul to keep 
Down and out with everything to win 
If my long since sunken ship 
Ever does come in",Dead Wishes,2015
Chris Cornell,"You can make somebody cry
Go on
Do what you like
I’ll be there by your side
I know
What the future holds

You can set the world on fire
Yeah if you want
It isn’t hard
I won’t be there looking on
To see the trail of lies
As you fall

But I’ll take the truth
The higher truth
The higher truth
I want the truth
The higher truth
The higher truth

You can fill the world with pain
Yeah if you want
I've seen it now
You can fill the world with hate
I’ve seen it done before
And I know how it all works out

Make a promise if you can
You know
You’ll only break it
Make a promise if you dare
Go on right ahead
And let’s see where it gets you

But I’ll take the truth
The higher truth
The higher truth
I want the truth
The higher truth
The higher truth

Maybe you and I one day
Will finally choose
A higher truth

Come let’s sit in the sun
Feel the world spin around
As the birds fly overhead
Can’t you hear the waves
Can’t you feel the rain
As it falls upon your face

I’ll take a truth
A higher truth
A higher truth
I want the truth
The higher truth
A higher truth

I’ll take a truth
A higher truth
A higher truth
I want the truth
The higher truth
A higher truth

Maybe you and I one day will finally choose

Can’t you feel the higher
As it falls around?",Higher Truth,2015
Chris Cornell,"Josephine where can you be now?
Again the sun is rising on my troubled heart
Don’t deny you know you and I
Are the making of what fate
Just can’t pull apart

My sweet Josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every kind of love that you would ever need
Dying here on bended knees

Sheets of rain
Cold and gray
Run down the page
Just about your name
With just the weight of your silent smile
Crashing all around me while i screamed it out loud

My sweet Josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every kind of love that you would ever need
Dying here on bended knees

Like a raven in a cage
Blood on my birth
Just won’t wash away
Like a stitched together doll
My feet to the flame
As I follow the blame
For someone else’s pain
For someone else’s pain

Rivers of black ink flood
A tapestry of flesh and blood around my frame
A living shrine just for you of human mind
Golden pen upon your hand
Leave this endless winter behind

My sweet josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every single kind of love that you would ever need
Dying here on bended knees
Dying here on bended knees
Dying here on bended knees

Chris Cornell,"When you find love
And it gets away
If it comes back to you
Then it will stay
Well maybe it’s true
As dumb as it sounds
I ain’t gonna stop you
From looking around

So let your eyes wander
Wild and free
Sooner or later
You will look back
To me

Love can be sharp
Make no mistake
Flatter a good heart
Then watch it break
It'll cut you to the bone
Just to see you bleed out
But that doesn’t mean, no
I’m somebody else

So let your eyes wander
The moment you think
You see something better
Better than me
So let your eyes wander
Wander away
And I’ll look no further
You will come back one day

Followed every word that I have ever heard
And I still don’t know what to say
I always think I’m losing
When my lips are moving
Time to shut up anyway
Followed every line
That I remember trying
But they never worked in the end
No more need for talking
If you feel like walking
You’re gonna walk anyway

I know you can tell
The difference between
One lonely tear falling
And a season of rain

So let your eyes wander
Wander away
Your heart is young
And longing to stray
Let your eyes wander
Wild and free
Sooner or later
They will look back
They will look back
They will look back
To me",Let Your Eyes Wander,2015
Chris Cornell,"You flew in on the wind
Was a day that I won't forget
Told me to let you in
And that I would not regret it
But you had a touch as cool as rain
And only once the weather changed

Murder of blue skies
I can’t wait
To never be with you again
And I can’t wait
To lead a life that you’re not in
And I won't break
The limb they bend
From time to time
I can’t wait to never be with you again

Now, the truth will set you free
But you had was lying in you
So you built a cage for me
All the while pretending to be
A living saint with a thorny crown
And me condemned to be your clown
I applaud you as you take a bow

I can’t wait
To never be with you again
And I can’t wait
To lead a life that you’re not in
And I won't break
The limb they bend
From time to time
I can’t wait to never be with you

I always thought that I pride myself on patience
But it’s wearing thin
Never thought that falling for you only meant
Falling down

I can’t wait
To never be with you again
And I can’t wait
To lead a life that you’re not in
And I won't break
The limb they bend

I can’t wait
To never be with you again
And I can’t wait
To lead a life that you’re not in
And I won't break
The one they bend

I can’t wait to never be with you again",Murderer of Blue Skies,2015
Chris Cornell,"In a castle
Down a long road
A little girl was born
To a king and
To a queen and
Her mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy
Staring at the tiny face
Of a miracle she made
She would say I love you
She would say I love you

Summer came and went
Autumn rolling in
Trees all stripped to bone
Daddy’s little girl in his arms, well
They sit upon his throne
Who is that thief hiding in the dark?
Just a little girl who stole his heart

And he would say I love you
He would say I love you
He would say I love you

With only these three words repeating
A simple greeting, but it’s all you wanna keep
Clever lips can be misleading
A tongue can fly away
And won’t come back
But, it’s only these words we recognize

Six o’clock A.M
The alarm rings out
Awoken from the dream
No more castle down a long road
No more kings and no more queens
But she’s a princess none the less
And a handsome prince is what she’ll get

He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love you",Only These Words,2015

Upon the dunes of earth and sand
In the morning

Chris Cornell,"The clouds that gathered turned to rain
The candles on your sill burned out
The weather on your face
Turned to match the mood outside

Reading through poems that you saved
That make the gloomy hours make sense
Or do they lose their power
With the yellowing of age

I saw you suffering
Through a foggy window in the rain
When you thought no one was watching, yeah
Going through your memories
Like so many prisons to escape
And become someone else
With another face
And another name
No more suffering

You sold the best of yourself out
On a chain of grey and white lies
One syllable at a time
You should have made them pay
A higher price

I saw you suffering
Through the cracked and dirty window pane
I was ashamed that I was watching, yeah
Going through your imagination
Looking for a life you could create
And become somebody else, yeah
With another face
With another name
No more suffering

I wish that I could find a seed
And plant a tree that grows so high
So that I could climb
And harvest the ripe stars
For you and I to drink
And spit the ashes from our mouths
And put the grey back in the clouds
And send them packing with our bags
Of old regrets and sorrows
'Cause they don't do a thing but drag us down
So far down
The past is like a braided rope
Each moment tightly coiled inside

I saw you suffering
Through the yellow window of a train
With everybody watching, yeah
Too tired for imagining
That you could ever love somebody else
From somewhere far away
From another time
And another place
With another life
And another face
And another name
And another name
No more suffering",Through the Window,2015

Howling at the moon at midnight

Chris Cornell,"Won't you take one link, from this misery chain
Keep it to remind you, of a long forgotten time or a place
So that you recognize its shape, when it's near
Any time or place this misery chain should appear

Take the locks and shackles, and melt all of it down
Shine a light upon, every shadow, every acre of ground
The hidden corners on in all around
Anyway you feel this misery chain could be found

When we're gone, and it's all said and done
What will we leave
Stories told, will they speak of us when God only knows
What those words will be

And if I should fall, from the top of the world
To the depths below, so far below where our belief could exist
Down further still will be, the one who hides the key
And there's to try to put these misery chains on me

When we're gone, and it's all said and done
What will we leave
Stories told, will they speak of us when God only knows

Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
Nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compare to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling

Where did I go wrong

I can put my arms around any girl I choose 
But it just reminds me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what it told me
He said, boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama
In your back yard
All died when you went away

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you

I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City

The best that you can do is fall in love

All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

Gotta photograph, picture of

You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh Oh, look what you've done

Photograph, I don't want your

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare

You make every man feel like a child
You got some kinda hold on me

Like open doors?
Leading you down, into my core

It, back, home

They said I was going crazy on the campus when You saved me
Cause I stopped partying, chasing all the ladies
And they told me I was loosing it calling me a lunatic
Because, for you, that world; I told them I was through with it
Man I heard the rumors calling me a joke
I'm praying saying, I wish they knew what I know
'Cause if they did they would see, how you were meant to be
Much more than the god of emergencies
You're the God that elected me chose, and selected me
When nobody else would mess with me
Never neglected me you even loved me when you corrected me
Hands down you're the best to me
I spent years of my life trying to be liked or be like the people who
Seemed to be liked
Following the crowd, trying to be allowed Into a world where every thing
Seemed right but

Couldn't get from A to B you opened the door
I deserved to be left there in distress with the rest there
Right there in my mess yeah
Still believing all the lies the world can satisfy
I almost died, pushing you to the side
What a fool, making crazy moves about to lose, all I had for a buzz and a thrill
We too easily satisfied and that's just how Adam died, He was in the place
Where the love wasn't real
But the more I get to know You the more I get to know truth

Nigga said, ""Me since eighty-three, get it right""
Politely flashed his Roley, then dipped to the light
Next night seen him on stage with some platinum shells
with baguettes on the side that spelled ""Raising Hell""
I said, ""Run the crowd yell like you paid 'em well""
Then he said to ask Bertha Dell, who the hell?
Oh well - I thought I was done bein impressed
until my man called me up and told me listen to Flex

Well, it's after midnight and the skies are shining bright,
And a big fat moon is dancing on the sea, and I'm thinking oh my...
And that old man in the sky he's looking me right in the eye,
And he's wondering why, and he's saying ""Little singer,
Why aren't you sleeping, why aren't you sleeping?""
Oh, the day is hanging heavy on my eyes, I guess the time,
Has come to say goodnight...

And may your dreams take you travelling all night long,
With an angel by your side when the wind blows strong,
Oh stay away from that city, that sad and lonely place,
I will lead you to the river, here's the door,

Close the shutters, do not cry, there's a new moon in the sky,

Will never come back for the game has no ending;
The smiler is calling, you turn for the deal,
And the aces keep falling with every spin of the wheel;

Then you gather your winnings,

At night he slept in the moonlight, till he heard that midnight train

""I will leave my land and my horses, on that midnight train I will ride,

To the city, far across the plains,
To that city, on that midnight train, here it comes,
Choo choo choo, on that midnight train,""

And then that lonesome cowboy, stepped into a bar,
A pretty girl slid over nice and easy, ""Boy your money won't go far.""

She took him outside to an alley, he got dragged into a fight,
And a bullet sent him dying, and he cursed that moonless night,

In that city, far across the plains,
In that city, he should hear that midnight train, down the line,
Choo choo choo, he could hear that midnight train,

And now that lonesome cowboy, is lain beneath the clay,

All you cowboys: take it easy, there's no grass there at all,

My love is crying and I'll tell you why

And I said ""Maybe, but baby I'm losing, and the only wave is goodbye""

Chris de Burgh,"When the angry sky, opens up its mouth,
And lays down a belt of rain from the north to the south;
Close your windows and close all your doors,
And pray for those men who fall upon rocky shores.

And when the hungry road, points its finger at your heart,
And say ""Stranger follow me, I will show you where to start;""
Well don't make a move, to the left or the right, or them
Hounds are gonna get you, send you running, screaming through
The stormy night.

And one windy night, a flickering light, caught the eye of
A passing angel as she was in flight; she came to the
Door, and there she saw a young soldier crying, as he
lay dying from a wound of war.

Then that angel of the Lord, took the form of a girl,
And knelt by the boy and said ""I will help you to that other world,
Oh rest your weary soul, lay your head upon my shoulder,
Press your trembling hand in mine until the night is over,
For that Devil wants you, but you are a soldier, and with a
Friend by your side there's no need to hide until the fight is over""
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night,
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night.

Candle burning so a friend can see the light; there may be a
Stranger come looking for you, and it may be an angel of the
Lord come to bring you better news;

He said all men were brothers and that love could conquer all,
Many gathered round to hear, many for his life did fear,
In troubled times like these men seldom talked.

Oh they came for him one morning at the breaking of the day,
She woke to hear him calling as they carried him away,
Accusing him of spreading lies and hate,

His public meetings were a danger to the state,
Some soldier said ""Who was he anyway?""

Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And the tears were falling from her face like rain,
Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And they hung him on a hillside far away,
And on the ground she lay, poor boy, oh my Lord
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord

Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And the tears were falling from her face like rain,
Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And they hung him on a hillside far away, just another poor boy,
Just another poor boy, just another poor boy,
And she never dreamed she'd see his face again",Just Another Poor Boy,1976

To try and find a little time, and maybe buy a glass of wine,
Old friend, I'm coming through

Old friend, yes I remember you, always a smile on your face,
Oh a memory from years before, an old man and a little boy,
Old friend, I remember you

You used to take me fishing down by the wishing well,
One day you threw a wish in, and we listened while it fell,
And you made a wish

""When the years are heavy, and my heart is growing cold,
Well I wish when the evening comes that there'll always be
Some old friend who'll miss me too""

Well I do, so friend I'm coming through

Chris de Burgh,"I'd like you to meet my last queen,
Over there large as life
She's been hanging there for almost a week,
My poor late wife;

What do think of the color of her skin,
It has the bloom of a rose,
You see she begged me to bring a certain painter in,
And for that picture in her bedroom she would pose;

Well after a while he was driving me mad,
As you could well understand,
Sitting in there, day after day,
With my wife in the palm of his hand
It was 

""Madam please do this and Madam please do that"",
You've never heard such display,
But he didn't mind he was taking his time,
It was me that had to pay,
""Oh Madam I think we should take a walk in the woods,
You understand it's the light"",
And did I mind, no, I was so kind when they,
Came back in the middle of the night,
And I swear I'll take care of the painter, oh the painter

Well as you can see it was hard for me,
But something has to be done,
She only has eyes for him and his lies, and as for me,
Not a glance, not a single one;
My orders were severe and she disappeared,
It really was such a shame,
And when they told me she was dead I broke down and said,
""It's that painter, it's him, he's to blame.""

With his ""Madam please do this and Madam please do that"",
You've never heard such display,
But he didn't mind he was taking his time,
It was me that had to pay,
""Oh Madam I think we should take a walk in the woods,
You understand it's the light"",
And did I mind, no, I was so kind when they
Came back in the middle of the night,
And I hope it's the rope for the painter,
When he's found, it's hell bound for the painter,
I'll get that painter",The Painter,1976

Hello darling, this is the army,
I've just got the time to write,
Today we attack, there's no turning back,
The boys they're all ready for the fight.

Yes, I'm well but this place is like hell,
They call it Passchendaele,
In nineteen seventeen the war must be ending,
The general said this attack will not fail;

So I'm writing down this simple little melody
When you play it my love, think for me...
We'll be together in this song for you,
And it goes la la la, sing it darling, la la la

They got old bill and the sergeant is still out there
Wounded in some shell hole,
They say this war will end all wars,
Oh God I really hope it will,

Oh how's old England, are they still singing
Those songs that we loved to sing,
When all this is over, we'll go sailing in Dover,
Catching fish like we used to with a string,

Oh I miss you, I miss you, I miss you,
If they get me my love you will know
We'll always be together in this song for you

And it goes la la la, I have to go now

Chris de Burgh,"A great lord came walking through the forest
One morning with a weapon in his hand;
Rich was his castle, he lacked for nothing,
But killing was his plan;
When a white bird flew by she fell from the sky,
Nothing was found, only blood on the ground, she was gone;

Cursing his fortune,
He turned to the forest to kill once again,
And standing before him was a lovely young woman
With her hand hung in pain,
When he saw her his eyes were filled with desire,
He said ""I must have her, she must be mine,
She will be mine""

He offered her silver, he offered her gold,
But she threw it on the ground,
He fell to his knees and he begged her,
""Oh please come with me,
What you wish will be found;""
She said, ""Sire, I'll go if you put up your bow,
And spare these creatures, leave them in peace,
You have no need""

But her words were lost in the wind
His eyes were fixed on a queen
And all he saw was a woman
And all she was, was a dream
Oh oh...And all he saw was a woman, and all she was,
Was a dream

He took her and bound her with ropes tied around her
To his castle he did ride;
In the wood was a bower where stood an an old tower
And he threw her deep inside;
Then the birds left the sky and a terrible cry,
Brought thunder and lightning, and rain falling down,
Tears on the ground

All through the days on her face he would gaze,
For she was lovely as the spring;
No words would she speak but ""Leave them in peace"",
And some sad lament she would sing,
Oh one day by the door, at the window he saw
A single white feather lying on the floor.
She was there no more

Now that great lord is dying,
His cold heart is crying for the love of the girl;
For many an hour he has wept on the tower
For she meant more than the world;
And once in the sky, a white bird flew by,
He lifted his hands, he cried out in pain
""Come back again""

But his words were lost in the wind,
His castle was built upon sand,
And all he has is a memory,
And all he yearns is her hand
Ah ah, all he has is the memory,
And all he yearns is her hand.",The Tower,1976
Chris de Burgh,"Ooh, next time I see you, I'll be singing in Brazil,
Misty land of music where the feet are never still,
And pretty senoritas dressed up for the kill,

So glad that you're coming to Brazil

Ooh, next thing you know you're out here dancing in the streets,
Working with the people on that Boss-a-Nova beat,
And some dark-eyed lady brings you wine and a chicken wing,

Way, after midnight, and the wine's gone to my head,
Lying here upon the shore just listening to the waves,
And it's been a perfect day.

Packed up a picnic and set off for the sea,
Taking all the back roads where no-one else would be,
My and you and Paul and Sue,
How we laughed the time away,
And we had a perfect day. 
I brought along my old guitar,
And lying there beneath the stars,
We sang all the Beatle songs we knew,
Lord you should have heard those harmonies,
When we did Nowhere Man and Let It Be
My love, if we should break up,
Should we ever part,
And you're searching for some memory,
To help your aching heart,
Forget about the hurtful things,
That lovers often say,
And remember this perfect day.

And I was strumming at my old guitar,
Trying to think of something everybody knew,
And then you said ""though it's far away,

So many secrets that will never be found,
But as long as you're with me with loving to give me,
We can watch the world going round
Ooh, around and around and around and around,
Everything in the world goes around,
Yes around and around and around and around,
And around, everything goes around
From the moment of birth till you go back to the earth,
Your life is like a circle of gold,
And everything you begin, every song that you sing,
Sooner or later must go

Another time, another place, another life, another face,
Oh my love I know I'll see you again,
And the circle that starts with the beat of your heart,
Takes you back to the beginning again

It was about the English weather,
Always raining on a sunny day, and it went

As a matter of fact it couldn't be better,
For baby and me, sitting on my knees, (with baby on my knee)

On my umbrella above me,
The very first time she said she loved me,
Was in the summer rain, and it's fine with me

Somehow we were always late for tea,
And small boys making mischief in the water,
Watching deck-chairs floating away out to sea,

Let the tears come rolling from your heart,

Only food and a bed for the night,

But it was just a film, make-believe, they all get up and go home,
And now you're asking me why love can wither away and die,
Well I know, I know that some things go, but some things never change, 
Like the starlight, that is shining in your eyes,
Like the storm in a winter sky,
Like the moon on the tide,
Turning it again and again,
Like the way that I love you,
Some things never change,
Like the way that I love you,
Some things never change; 
The road is long and it's hard, I don't imagine for a minute it's not,
But I'll keep my loving for you, right down to the end,
The fire is blazing bright, we could sit here and talk all night,
And though this wood must burn away, some things never change,

You say that I never listen, that I just don't seem to care,
What happens in your world, and I'm hardly ever there;

Way up the Himalayas, in a Mexican bodega,
Something is going on,
People are coming, running round the world,
There's no way to avoid them, they're everywhere,
You can see them on the streets of London town; 
They've found a tourist attraction,
It's a bobby on the beat,
Yes a tourist attraction,
They're all looking at his feet,
And the blue rinse ladies,
Shooting cameras from the hip,
Doing Europe in two days,
""We've had a wonderful trip!""
And he turns to the Palace,
You can almost hear him say,
""Your Majesty why don't you tell them,
Please go away!""
Tourist attraction, tourist attraction, tourist attraction; 
Caribbean island, cool drink in my hand,
Nearest thing to Paradise, the native girls are very nice;
Something is going wrong,
People are coming, running down the beach,
Cameras at the ready, get out of reach,
Time to grab my things, I'm heading for the hills; 
They've found a tourist attraction,
Yes my little hideaway,
It's a tourist attraction, it will never be the same,
There's a big bus driver taking money on the side,
""Everybody stick together and please follow the guide,""
And way over yonder, they hear somebody yell,
""I came here for the peace and quiet, y'all go to hell!""

Chris de Burgh,"Hollywood is such a dream,
And when you're only seventeen, it's wonderful,
A movie man said she could be a star,
A beauty queen, or a cover girl,
She believes and packs up her things,
And the wall of silence begins;

Every night was party night,
She was everyone's delight, he let her stay,
And when he'd had enough, he threw her out,
And she found work in a small cafe,
When she called they put her on hold,
And the wall of silence grows; 
Give me a break,
Give me a break,
This is Hollywood,
Open the door,
Open the door,
What am I going to do,
When the money runs out,
And there isn't any doubt,
That I'll have nowhere to go. 
Hollywood is just a dream,
But when you're only seventeen, it's magical,
She went home to hide away,
She wore her sadness like a veil, and closed the door,
Till the day she smiles and recalls,
And the wall of silence falls",Wall of Silence,1980
Chris de Burgh,"These broken wings can take me no further,
I'm lost, and out at sea,
I thought these wings would hold me forever,
And on to eternity,
And far away I can hear your voice,
I can hear it in the silence of the morning,
But these broken wings have let me down,
They can't even carry me home.

In broken dreams that keep me from sleeping,
I remember all the things I said,
Well I've broken all the promises,
I said I would be keeping,
They're gone, like leaves they fell,
For it's so hard when you're far away,
All I needed was a shoulder I could cry on,
Now these broken dreams have woken me,
My love, will you carry me home. 
Or will you treat me like some traveler,
On a dark and lonely road,
Who sees a light and a woman who will give him love,
Oh and just when she reaches the part,
When she's supposed to comfort his broken heart,
She turns away, and sends him traveling on, on, 
Oh when I left I believed that nothing would go wrong,
I thought the whole world would be waiting for my story,
Take me back, my love, I need you now,
Come back and carry me home,
Take me back and heal theses broken wings,
Come back and carry me home.",Broken Wings,1981
Chris de Burgh,"What do I do next?"" said the bishop to the priest,
""I have spent my whole life waiting, preparing for the feast,
And now you say Jerusalem has fallen and is lost,
The king of heathen Saracen has seized the holy cross""

Then the priest said ""Oh my bishop, we must put them to the sword,
For God in all His mercy will find a just reward,
For the noblemen and sinners, and knights of ready hand,
Who will be the Lord's Crusader, send word through all the land, 
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost""

""Tell me what to do"", said the king upon his throne,
""but speak to me in whispers for we are not alone,
They tell me that Jerusalem has fallen to the hand,
Of some bedeviled eastern Heathen who has seized the Holy Land""

Then the chamberlain said ""Lord, we must call upon our foes
In Spain and France and Germany to end our bitter wars,
All Christian men must be as one and gather for the fight,
You will be their leader, begin the battle cry, 
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost""

Ooh, high on a hill, in the town of Jerusalem,
There stood Salad in, the king of the Saracens,
Whoring and drinking and snoring and sinking, around him his army lay,
Secure in the knowledge that he had won the day

A messenger came, blood on his feet and a wound in his chest,
""The Christians are coming!"" 
He said, ""I have seen their cross in the west,""
In a rage Salad in struck him down with his knife,
And he said ""I know that this man lies,
They quarrel too much, the Christians could never unite! 
I am invincible, I am the king,
I am invincible, and I will win"" 
Closer they came, the army of Richard the Lion heart,
Marching by day and night, with soldiers from every part,
And when the Crusaders 
Came over the mountain and they saw Jerusalem,
They fell to their knees and prayed for her release

They started the battle at dawn, taking the city by storm,
With horsemen and bowmen and engines of war,
They broke through the city walls,
The Heathens were flying and screaming and dying,
And the Christian swords were strong,
And Salad in ran when he heard their victory song; 
""We are invincible, God is the king,
We are invincible, and we will win!"" 
""What do I do now?"" said the wise man to the fool,
""I have spent my whole life searching, to find the Golden Rule,
Though centuries have disappeared, the memory still remains,
Of those enemies together, could it be that way again?""

Then the fool said ""Oh you wise men, you really make me laugh,
With your talk of vast persuasion and searching through the past,
There is only greed and evil in the men who fight today,
The song of the Crusader has long since gone away, 
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem is lost,
Jerusalem.""",Crusader: The Fall of Jerusalem/In the Court of Saladin/The ...,1981

They say there will be rain tonight,
But that's okay, we'll stay inside,
This is the first time I have felt so satisfied,
I know love has found me;

And now the night, is getting wild,
And she is sleeping like a child,
And though I know, I know I should be dreaming,
I'm tossing and turning, 'cause I wonder,

Yes I wonder, how it began,
Growing in the forests and the freeways,
Minute by minute she became a part of me,
And suddenly love is here and I'm falling,

Just like every drop of rain,
Many drops can someday make a river,
And many rivers go down to the sea,
And the sea rolls on forever, forever;

And now I'll sleep till morning light,
I have no fear of stormy nights,
Because the one that I have wanted all my life,
Is right here beside me, and I wonder,

Chris de Burgh,"In a country churchyard there's a preacher with his people,
Gathered all around to join a man and woman,
Spring is here and turtledoves are singing from the steeple,
Bees are in the flowers, growing in the graveyard,
And over the hill, where the river meets the mill,
A lovely girl is coming down,
To give her hand upon her wedding day

Dressed in simple white and wearing flowers in her hair,
Music as she walks slowly to the altar,
And picking up his bible then the preacher turns towards her,
""Will you take this man to be your wedded husband,
To honor and love in the eyes of God above,
Now let the people sing with me,
These words to live forever in your heart
Let your love shine on,
For we are the stars in the sky,
Let your love shine strong,
Until the day you fly away"" 
Many years have fallen on that golden country morning,
The graveyard's overgrown, the church lies in ruins,
Ivy on the walls and ravens wheeling round above me,
As I made my way towards the last remaining headstone,
I fell to my knees, read the lines beneath the leaves,
And suddenly it seemed to me,
I heard the words like singing in the trees
Let your love shine on,
For we are the stars in the sky,
Let your love shine strong,
Until the day you fly
Let your love shine on,
For we are the stars in the sky,
Let your love shine strong,

Is swirling round about my knees,
Trees are crying leaves into the river;

I'm huddled in this french cafe
I never thought I'd see the day,
But winter's here and summer's really over, 
Even the birds have packed up and gone,
They're flying south with their song,
And my love, she too has gone, she had to fly, 
Take care, it's such a lonely sky,
They'll trap your wings my love and hold your flight,
They'll build a cage and steal your only sky,
Fly away, fly to me, fly when the wind is high,
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky

The old cathedral lights are low
She and I we'd often go there
To admire and sometimes kneel in prayer;

Lords and ladies lie in stone,
Hand in hand from long ago,
And though their hands are cold they'll love forever, 
Even the choir rehearses those songs
For Christmas is not long,
And alone, I sing my song, she had to fly, 
Out there it's such a lonely sky,
They'll trap your wings my love and hold your flight,
They'll build a cage and steal your only sky,
Fly away, fly to me, fly when the wind is high,
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky,
Fly away, fly to me, and if you need my love,
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky
I'll come in with the dawn,
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky,

And beseeching me to come and keep the score
And Maud saya ""Oh Lord! I'm so terribly bored!""
I really can't stand it anymore

I'm going out to dinner, with a gorgeous singer
To a little place I've found down by the quay
Her name is Patricia, she calls herself Delicia
And the reason isn't very hard to see

She says God made her a sinner just to keep fat men thinner
As they tumble down in heaps before her feet
They hang around in groups like battle-weary troops
One can often see them queue right down the street
You see Patricia, or Delicia, not only is a singer
She also removes all her clothing
For Patricia is the best stripper in town
And with a swing of her hips she started to strip
To tremendous applause she took off her drawers
And with a lick of her lips she undid all the clips
Threw it all in the air, and everyone stared
And as the last piece of clothing fell to the floor
The police were banging on the door
On a Saturday night, in nineteen twenty-four
Take it away boys!
But poor Patricia was arrested and everyone detested
The manner in which she was exposed
And later on in court, well, everybody thought
A summer run in jail would be proposed

But the judge said, ""Patricia
Or may I say, Delicia
The facts of this case lie before me
Case dismissed, this girl was in her working clothes!""

And with a swing of her hips, she started to strip

Where your love is, put your heart, oh what would you do if your dreams came true?

Make believe that she is gone, play your guitar and write a song for her,
Write down the words about how you cried when you woke up weeping,
'cause you thought that she had died, and you heard her breathing,
Through your pain and you held her close and cried all over again,
Where your love is, put your heart, oh what would you do if your dreams came true?

Out here on the journey, for a glimpse of paradise,
It's getting hard to find a place to go,
Where peaceful waters flow;

I took a walk past the old Saxon well,
Down by the cathedral, I heard the chapel bell,
And joined the people singing for a way to go,
Where peaceful waters flow;

And if you don't know by now, you never will,
Only love can find the door,
If you could see it now, it's in your hands,
Only love can reach the shore, to heaven,

Always, she is standing by my side,
She's my inspiration, and she's my battle cry,
And in her arms is the only place I know,

For we cannot live together, and we cannot live apart,
It's the classical dilemma between the head and the heart,
The head and the heart;

Now the dawn begins, and still I cannot sleep,

I believe that time will show,
She will always be a part of my world,
I don't want to see her go,
So I plead my case to hear the heart,
And stay

I can see it in your eyes,
Just like me you need to know,
Can you still fly,
Can you still arouse the passions,
Of another man,
And if you carry it through, what would I do?

To break a love so long in the making,
It would take much more than talk or dreams,

Watching seabirds as they fly,
On a summer day, on a summer day;

And now the sun is here to stay,
The winter seems so far away,
In the summertime, in the summertime;

Sitting here with my love tonight,
News is breaking from the south,
On the radio, on the radio;

Brother lead and sister steel,
Are playing out their final scene,
On the radio, on the radio;

And when you lie beside me soft and quiet in the night,
I often listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat giving life,
You are so precious to me darling, it will always be that way,
Until the final act is over,
Until every man has spoken,
Until every battle's done,
Until the day,
Transmission ends, transmission ends;

Waiting up for a show tonight,
Coming in via satellite,
From America, from America;

Whispers from some far-off place,
Are drifting into outer space,
From America, from America;

And when I see a shooting star go flashing in the night,
I often wonder if some other beings also see the light,
And are they picking up our signals,
As they spin of into space,
Until the final act is over,
Until every man has spoken,
Until every summer's gone,
Until every battle's done,
Until the day,

There was mass confusion, this beauty was alone,

It's no time for you to be alone,
It is a place on the edge of town,
Just shining in a hell-fire light, (they're waiting,)
And if you're there, keep going on,
They're waiting deep inside, I'm telling you,

Don't look back, women in the red and black,
Don't look back, they're going to take your heart away,
I'm telling you don't look back, women in the red and black,
Don't look back, they're going to steal your heart away,
I should have known better;

Well Jimmy Pellin was a friend of mine,
But he went out there one too many times,
I saw him running down the railroad track,
And I tell you boys he ain't coming back,
The early morning is their favourite time,
To find somebody out on their own, (they're waiting,)
They're waving arms and flashing lights,
Standing out on the road, I'm telling you,

Don't look back, women in the red and black,
Don't look back, they're going to take your heart away,
I should have known better, I should have known better,

So if you're going to the edge of town,
Don't lose in a hell-fire light, (they're waiting,)
And if you're passing, keep going on,
They're waiting there tonight, I'm begging you,

Don't look back, don't look back,
I beg you don't look back,
Women in the red and black,
Don't look back, they're going to steal your heart away,

I should have known better don't look back,
I should have known better don't look back,
I should have known better don't look back,

I want to keep this feeling inside, for a little more,
It must be a Daddy's pride and joy, a little baby boy,

Tears in my eyes when I saw you being born,
So much emotion, words cannot form, so I'll let it be,
Only to say it's you and me, for eternity,
I wish you a wonderful life,

There is nothing left to lose,
So I'm going,
I've got a suitcase here in my hand,
And I've got a hungry heart,
And I'm going to join the millions,
There before me, on the freedom road;

No-one's coming to my door,
And all my friends have gone,
There's no work here anymore,
It's deserted,
And though I know I hate to leave,
From this land that I love,
There's a new tomorrow waiting,
Yes it's shining on the freedom road,
On the freedom road;

Oh sometimes it's going to be lonely,
Sometimes it will be sad,
But I've got to keep on going,
Until I hold that promised land,
In the palm of my hand;

Nothing ventured, nothing gained or won,
Without a hard fight,
We would never reach the sun,
Without trying,
And when we're a million miles from home,
Out in the starry night,
We will see we're not alone,
In the heavens, out on freedom road,

You see if I think you are beautiful
Someone else is going to feel it too

I think I've gone and made my big mistake,
I took her swimming, we had a fight,

And it looks like I'm heading for a night on the river,
Under the moon and the stars,
Looks like I'm heading for a night on the river,
Me and my beating heart, singing in the dark;

Naked and frozen at the side of a lake,
If she was here I wouldn't hesitate,
To tell her how, the way things are,
With a long conversation in the back of a car;

And it looks like I'm heading for a night on the river,
Under the moon and the stars,
Could be I'm heading for a night on the river,
Just me and my beating heart, singing in the dark;

I think she owes me an explanation,
She's got the whip hand in this situation,
If I try to tell her just the way I feel,
It could start the whole thing all over again;

Oh, I think I'm heading for a night on the river,
Under the moon and the stars,
Could be I'm heading for a night on the river,

Fill that train ten thousand deep

His family were crying, knelt in prayer before he died
But above his bed just a waiting for the dead
Was the Devil with a twinkle in his eye
Well God's not around and look what I've found, this one's mine

Just then the Lord himself appeared in a blinding flash of light
And shouted at the Devil, get thee hence to endless night
But the Devil just grinned and said I may have sinned
But there's no need to push me around
I got him first so you can do your worst
He's going underground

But I think I'll give you one more chance
Said the Devil with a smile
So throw away that stupid lance
It's really not your style

And then we'll bet for the biggest stakes yet

That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line
Oh Lord, He's going to win

Well the railwayman he cut the cards
And he dealt them each a hand of five
And for the Lord, he was praying hard
Or that train he'd have to drive
Well the Devil he had three aces and a king
And the Lord, he was running for a straight
He had the queen and the knave and nine and ten of spades
All he needed was the eight

And then the Lord he called for one more card
But he drew the diamond eight
And the Devil said to the son of God
I believe you've got it straight
So deal me one for the time has come
To see who'll be the king of this place
But as he spoke, from beneath his cloak
He slipped another ace

Ten thousand souls was the opening bid
And it soon went up to fifty nine
But the Lord didn't see what the Devil did
And he said that suits me fine
I'll raise you high to a hundred and five
And forever put an end to your sins
But the Devil let out a mighty shout, my hand wins

And I said Lord, oh Lord, you let him win

Oh Lord, don't let him win

Where the fishing boats are lying on the shore,
The news had traveled fast and everyone went to be,
Where the mayor was making a speech,
And the crowd started cheering,
When he talked about the glory of it all,
And the boys coming home from the war;

Last night, they were dancing in the streets,
And making music in the alleyways and bars,
From a house down in the old town came the sound of guitars,
Margarita was waiting inside,
With her long black hair hanging down beneath the red light,
And she smiled, for the boys coming home from the war,
The boys coming home from the war;

And they said we were heroes, they said we were fine,
We were kings in command, we had God on our side,
And we said ""nothing will make us change in any way,
Since yesterday, we're just the same,
Since yesterday, nothing has changed,
Since yesterday, we're just the same,""
But I can feel there's a new kind of hunger inside,
To be satisfied, I saw it there last night;

Last night I was walking through the shadows,
Far away from all the music and the girls,
When I saw a soldier waiting with a woman in black,
And they stood without any word,
Just staring at a photograph of someone, and she began to cry,
For a boy left behind in the war,
Some boy left behind in the war;

And they said we were heroes, they said we were fine,
We were kings in command, we had God on our side,
And we said ""nothing will make us change in any way,
Since yesterday, we're just the same,

Shoot pool and talk about girls,
And nothing ever happens round here,

Are talking with a new light inside,
Talking with a brightness in their eyes;

As people speak about what they have seen,
And everywhere the feeling's getting stronger,
That soon there will be change in our lives,

Something is coming now, something is coming now;

When the light comes shining through,
You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When it's shining down on you;

There are quiet celebrations going on,
So many have been waiting for so long,
To see the whole world waking from a dream,
And find a new dimension inside,
See a revelation in our time,
Something is coming now, something is coming now;

You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When the light comes shining through,
You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When it's shining down on you;

They can help us or they can betray us in the night,
Don't talk, don't talk, but this quiet revolution,
Can destroy the men of darkness with the light;

With the dawn of a waking man and destiny,
To the garden of Eden and Paradise,

We cross the bridge to the silver bird,
And say goodbye to the ones that we love,
No skies or oceans in the place we are going,
Like seeds on the wind;

We are ready to go, in the name of the Lord,
A world is waiting for a new destination,

All around me, the forest and the rain
Then with the flash of a light, I saw it in the night
I must be getting near, Saint Peter's Gate!

When I went through the door, he was standing in the hall
An old man with a beard of shining white
He said ""I've been expecting you, let me show you to your room""
And he took me all the way by candlelight
And lying there on the bed, a book, black and red
My name was written on the front in gold
And when I opened it up, there were pictures of my life
And a voice began to call from down below

Nobody will get through, nobody
Not even you, can escape the Judgment Day
Nobody will be spared, Heaven is only there
For the ones who satisfy them at, Saint Peter's Gate!

""Come with me"" said that old man, as he took me by the hand
""There is someone here that you have seen before
In this room on the left, a man who did his best
To bring joy and happiness to one and all
But in that room on the right, a dictator in life
We've been waiting for him here, as you can tell
For all the blood the he's spilled, and for all the ones he's killed
We condemn him to eternity in Hell

Nobody will get through, nobody
Not even you, can escape the Judgment Day
Nobody will be spared, Heaven is only there
For the ones who satisfy them at, Saint Peter's Gate!""

I woke up with the dawn, there was someone in my room
A woman like an Angel, all in white
And then she told me ""You must run, for your time has yet to come
Go now, before they change their minds
And from the window I saw, a thousand or more
Bringing that Dictator to his knees
And his cries broke the sound of my footsteps on the ground
As I made it to the safety of the trees

You've got the whole world in your hands,
Too many cards from disneyland,
Saying that I was sorry, come one day,

But if, I ever have to chose, love is my decision,
With you I just can't lose, stay here by my side,
Love is my decision, forever you and I,

I'll tell you this,
If you should ever go away, I'll know,
That I could never live a single day without you,

You are the one that lights my world up,
The one that money just can't buy,
And now I promise I will try,
Maybe even a family together,

But if, I ever have to chose, love is my decision,
With you I just can't lose, stay here by my side,
Love is my decision, forever you and I,


If, I ever have to chose,

Chris de Burgh," spaceman came travelling on his ship from afar,
'twas light years of time since his mission did start,
And over a village he halted his craft,
And it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star...

He followed light and came down to a share,
Where a mother and a child were lying there on a bed,
A bright light of silver shone round his head,
And he had the face of an angle, and they were afraid...

Then the stranger spoke, he said 'do not fear,
I come from a planet a long way from here,
And I bring a message for mankind to hear',
And suddenly the sweetest music filled the air...

And it went la, la...
Peace and goodwill to all men, and love for the child...

This lovely music went trembling through the ground,
And many were wakened on hearing that sound,
And travellers on the road, the village they found,
By the light of that ship in the sky, which shone all round...

And just before dawn at the paving of the sky,
The stranger returned and said 'now I must fly,
When two thousand years of your time has gone by,
This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry...'

And it went la la... this song will begin once again
To a baby's cry...
And it goes la la... peace and goodwill to all men
And love for the child...
Oh the whole world is waiting, waiting to hear that song again,
There are thousands standing on the edge of the world,
And a star is moving somewhere, the time is nearly here,
This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry...

As they tumble down in heaps before her feet.

Later on in court, well, everybody thought

Chris de Burgh,"Took a boat over Lake Geneva,
It was raining all night long,
We were lucky and we saw no enemy,
And came from Switzerland, poor refugees,
Far from the guns of war,
We said godbye to it all.
They brought us in to a nurse's station,
Half a mile behind the lines.
Oh lord, how my heart was breaking,
To see the children, and the walking wounded,
Hoping for a ticket home,
And say goodbye to it all.
I woke up on a cold blue morning,
To see her there, standing right beside me,
Long years since I left her at the borderline,
And how she found me I'll never know,
But we decided there and then,
To say goodbye to it all.
To it all,
Say goodbye to it all,
Say goodbye to it all ...
Took a train from Paris to the ocean,
Found a small hotel by the coast,
As we walked along the beaches of Normandy,
We came to Juno, Omaha and Gold,
And whispered a prayer for the boys,
Who said goodbye to it all.
Now we've got our own place by the water,
And I have a job in the old hotel,
She's ready and she's hoping for a daughter,
Well I don't mind, we've made our choice,
We've got all the time in the world,
We said goodbye to it all,
We said goodbye to it all.
'Bye to it all,
Say goodbye to it all,
Say goodbye to it all,

I have been to see the world,
Tasted life at every turn,
And all the time,
Your face came back to haunt me;

The more i know it, i wanna show it,

The clock back to the days when
We were lovers in the true sense
Of the meaning, you must believe me,

Chris de Burgh,"A spaceman came traveling on his ship from afar,
'Twas light years of time since his mission did start,
And over a village he halted his craft,
And it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star...

He followed a light and came down to a shed,
Where a mother and child were lying there on a bed,
A bright light of silver shone round his head,
And he had the face of an angle, and they were afraid...

Then the stranger spoke, he said ""Do not fear,
I come from a planet a long way from here,
And I bring a message for mankind to hear,""
And suddenly the sweetest music filled the air...

And it went La La...
Peace and goodwill to all men, and love for the child...

This lovely music went trembling through the ground,
And many were wakened on hearing that sound,
And travellers on the road, the village they found,
By the light of that ship in the sky, which shone all round...

And just before dawn at the paling of the sky,
The stranger returned and said ""Now I must fly,
When two thousand years of your time has gone by,
This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry...""

And it went La La ... This song will begin once again
To a baby's cry...
And it goes La La... Peace and goodwill to all men, and
Love for the child...
Oh the whole world is waiting, waiting to hear the song again,
There are thousands standing on the edge of the world,
And a star is moving somewhere, the time is nearly here,

Chris de Burgh,"Breaking bread and drinking wine,
Talking deep into the night,
Just dreaming dreams and making plans forever,
We have been the best of friends,
And always said since way back when,
We'd change the world with mad ideas together; 
Another rainbow to follow with you,
Another dream that may never come true,
It is better to have tried in vain than never try at all,
Another rainbow where gold may fall; 
So we went our different ways,
And though I had my darkness days,
I sailed the stars and I found what I was looking for,
You became a jack of trades,
Ace of all and king of none,
With hands that hurt from knocking on so many doors;

Another rainbow to follow with you,
Another dream that may never come true,
It is better to have tried in vain than never try at all,
Another rainbow where gold may fall;

And there will always be these moments,
When you can turn to me again;

Another crazy dream that just might come true,

And everything was shining in the light,
But when the heart is cold, together we're alone,
Thinking of reasons to stay away;

There was a time that love was in our bed,
Eternity in every word we said,
But when desire has gone, it's hard to carry on,
Going through the motions, when there's nothing there;

You have got my heart, and all I want from you,
Is just a kiss before we say goodbye;

And let me keep my memories of all the times we were amazing,
And I will keep in memories the best that love can be;

There was a time we had so much to say,
Together at the ending of the day,

In the heat of a Lebanese night,
There was dancing, people were singing,
She came in from the garden outside,
In her eyes I saw the stars,
And I felt something happen in my heart;

Then I knew I was going to meet her,
In the heat of a Lebanese night,
And the girl inside the woman,
who came over to sit by my side,
And when she smiled the whole world stopped,
It was then I heard the echoes of a child; 
And did you go to your bed with a sweet lullaby,
And the sound of the guns in the night?
And did you dance in the fields,
Did you run for your life,
From the hell that came down from the sky?
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night; 
We went down to the edge of the water,
By the light of a Lebanese dawn,
And she told me all the stories of her beautiful land in the war,
Her tears fell down, the sun came up,
And I saw again the young girl in her eyes; 
And did you go to your bed with a sweet lullaby,
And the sound of the guns in the night?
And did you dance in the fields,
Did you run for your life,
From the hell that came down from the sky?
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night; 
In Lebanese:
All of my life, all I have known,
Only a place where peace cannot go,
All over the world, the gift from before,
Nothing is left for the children of war;

And the sound of the guns in the night?
And did you dance in the fields,
Did you run for your life,

""I have spent my whole life waiting, preparing for the feast,
And now you say Jerusalem has fallen and is lost,
The king of heathen Saracen has seized the holy cross;""

Then the priest said ""Oh my bishop, we must put them to the sword,
For God in all His mercy will find a just reward,
For the noblemen and sinners, and knights of ready hand,
Who will be the Lord's Crusader, send word through all the land,

""Tell me what to do"", said the king upon his throne,
""but speak to me in whispers for we are not alone,
They tell me that Jerusalem has fallen to the hand,
Of some bedeviled eastern Heathen who has seized the Holy Land;""

In Spain and France and Germany to end our bitter wars,
All Christian men must be as one and gather for the fight,
You will be their leader, begin the battle cry,

Ooh, high on a hill, in the town of Jerusalem,
There stood Saladin, the king of the Saracens,
Whoring and drinking and snoring and sinking, around him his army lay,
Secure in the knowledge that he had won the day;

A messenger came, blood on his feet and a wound in his chest,
""The Christians are coming!"" he said, ""I have seen their cross in the west,""
In a rage Saladin struck him down with his knife,
And he said ""I know that this man lies,
They quarrel too much, the Christians could never unite! 
I am invincible, I am the king,
I am invincible, and I will win..."" 
Closer they came, the army of Richard the Lionheart,
Marching by day and night, with soldiers from every part,
And when the Crusaders came over the mountain and they saw Jerusalem,
They fell to their knees and prayed for her release;

They started the battle at dawn, taking the city by storm,
With horsemen and bowmen and engines of war,
They broke through the city walls,
The Heathens were flying and screaming and dying,
And the Christian swords were strong,
And Saladin ran when he heard their victory song; 
""We are invincible, God is the king,
We are invincible, and we will win!"" 
""What do I do now?"" said the wise man to the fool,
""I have spent my whole life searching, to find the Golden Rule,
Though centuries have disappeared, the memory still remains,
Of those enemies together, could it be that way again?""

Then the fool said ""Oh you wise men, you really make me laugh,
With your talk of vast persuasion and searching through the past,
There is only greed and evil in the men who fight today,
The song of the Crusader has long since gone away,

Chris de Burgh,"I feel the wind blowing through my doorway,
It's telling me that the summer's gone,
And the winter waits in shadow, waiting with the storm;

I am old and my bones are weary,
And my son he is all I have,
But he has gone to fight for freedom,
Leaving with my heart;

All my life I have loved this land, worked it with my hands,
But can this freedom send the rain, when seed is in the ground,
Can this freedom heal the pain and bring my boy back to me again?
Oh oh oh
I watched them sail from the rocks below me,
't was like the sea in its endless rage,
Many fall on the road to freedom,
Dying on the stones;

All my life I have loved this land, worked it with my hands,
But can your freedom send the rain, when seed is in the ground,
Can your freedom heal the pain and bring my boy back to me again?
Oh oh oh
Late last night, as the world was sleeping,
I dreamed my boy, he was calling out,
'cause he was lost in some dark forest,
And snow was falling down, falling on the ground,

Chris de Burgh,"Hear my voice and listen well, and a story I will tell,
How duty brought a broken heart, and why a love so strong
Must fall apart;

She was lovely, she was fine, daughter of a royal line,
He, no equal, but for them it mattered little for they were in love;

Rose of England, sweet and fair, shining with the sun,
Rose of England, have a care, for where the thorn is,
There the blood will run;

Oh my heart, oh my heart;

Through the summer days and nights, stolen kisses and delights
Would thrill their hearts and fill their dreams with all emotions
That true love can bring;

But black of mourning came one day, when her sister passed away,
And many said on bended knee, she has gone, and you must be our Queen;

Rose of England, sweet and fair, shining with the sun,
Rose of England, have a care, for where the thorn is,
There the blood will run;

Oh my heart, oh my heart;

To the abbey she did ride, with her lover by her side,
When they heard the church bells ring, she was Queen
And one day, he'd be King;

But men of malice, men of hate, protesting to her chambers came,
""A foreign prince will have your hand, for he'll bring peace
And riches to our land"";
She said ""Do you tell me that I cannot wed the one I love?
Do you tell me that I am not mistress of my heart?""

And so with heavy weight of life she kissed her lover one last time,
""This land I wed, and no man comes, for if I cannot have you, I'll have none"";

Chris de Burgh,"Snow is falling, snow is falling on the ground,
In the forest, in the forest there's no sound,
A shallow grave is where we lie,
The boys and men who died,
And snow is falling on the ground,
And we are calling to be found;

And the seasons, and the seasons come and go,
In the springtime birds will sing and flowers grow,
At summer's end, the autumn breeze,
Will whisper through the trees,
And leaves are falling on the ground,
And we are calling to be found;

And in our homes, so many tears,
They don't know where we have gone,
And snow is falling on the ground,
And we are calling to be found,

I had no choice, only to listen, and surrender to her world,
And she will fly over the rainbow,
She will walk in fields of gold,
And when she sings from the high walls of heaven,
Will the angels cry like me?

At first alone, then with hundreds around me,
Enchanted by her song,
But as the day is done, and the darkness is falling,
The songbird sings no more;

And now she flies over the rainbow,

Will the angels cry like me?

I could hardly even bear to see them go

Tears are in my eyes
We're coming to the borderline

It was late at night on the open road,
Speeding like a man on the run,
A lifetime spent preparing for the journey;

He is closer now and the search is on,
Reading from a map in the mind,
Yes there's the ragged hill,
And there's the boat on the river.
And when the rain came down,
He heard a wild dog howl,
There were voices in the night, ""Don't do it!""
Voices out of sight, ""Don't do it!
Too many men have failed before,
Whatever you do,

Don't pay the ferryman,
Don't even fix a price,

Now there'll be no turning back,
Beware that hooded old man at the rudder,
And then the lightning flashed, and the thunder roared,
And people calling out his name,
And dancing bones that jabbered and a-moaned
On the water.
And then the ferryman said,
""There is trouble ahead,
So you must pay me now,"" ""Don't do it!""
""You must pay me now,"" ""Don't do it!""

He must leave his love in Paris
Before the winter snow;

On a lonely street in Paris
He held her close to say,
""we’ll meet again in Paris
When there are flowers on the champs-elysees ""

""how long"" she said ""how long,
And will your love be strong,
When you’re across the sea,
Will your heart remember me? ""

Then she gave him words to turn to,
When the winter nights were long,
""nous serons encore amoureux
Avec les couleurs du printemps ""

""and then"" she said ""and then,
Our love will grow again""

Her words of love are only words to please

For it is said that the souls of the dead
Fill that train ten thousand deep

His family were crying, knelt in prayer before he died
But above his bed just a waiting for the dead
Was the Devil with a twinkle in his eye
Well God's not around and look what I've found, this one's mine

Just then the Lord himself appeared in a blinding flash of light
And shouted at the Devil, get thee hence to endless night
But the Devil just grinned and said I may have sinned
But there's no need to push me around
I got him first so you can do your worst
He's going underground

But I think I'll give you one more chance
Said the Devil with a smile
So throw away that stupid lance
It's really not your style
Joker is the name, poker is the game
We'll play right here on this bed
And then we'll bet for the biggest stakes yet

And he dealt them each a hand of five
And for the Lord, he was praying hard
Or that train he'd have to drive
Well the Devil he had three aces and a king
And the Lord, he was running for a straight
He had the queen and the knave and nine and ten of spades
All he needed was the eight

And then the Lord he called for one more card
But he drew the diamond eight
And the Devil said to the son of God
I believe you've got it straight
So deal me one for the time has come
To see who'll be the king of this place
But as he spoke, from beneath his cloak
He slipped another ace

Ten thousand souls was the opening bid
And it soon went up to fifty nine
But the Lord didn't see what the Devil did
And he said that suits me fine
I'll raise you high to a hundred and five
And forever put an end to your sins
But the Devil let out a mighty shout, my hand wins

And I said Lord, oh Lord, you let him win
The sun is down and the night is riding in
That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line
Oh Lord, don't let him win

Well that Spanish train still runs between
Guadalquivir and old Saville
And at dead of night the whistle blows
And people fear she's running still

The Devil still cheats and wins more souls
And as for the Lord, well, he's just doing his best

They met at night by the river, and there he pledged his love,
And so it was for the summer, but by winter, all was done,
For the word was out in the village that she would have his child,
And the night before she left him, these words were in his heart,
When she said, ""Love is all that we have, it is forever,
Love is all that we need, to be together,
Love is all that this world has to share, only love
Can take us there""

They found her clothes by the river, of her there was no trace,
And for many years he mourned her, haunted by her face,
So he set off over the ocean, these memories to escape,
But the ship he sailed was ill-starred, and soon would meet its fate

They struck the rocks at midnight, in the grip of a roaring storm,
And he found himself in the water with a woman and a boy,
With a power that was more than human, he brought them to the shore,
And her whisper in the darkness was a voice he'd heard before,
When she'd said, ""Love is all that we have, it is forever,
Love is all that we need, to be together,
Love is all that this world has to share,
Only love can take us there""

Chris de Burgh,"There she stood in an empty room, heard a voice from another time,
And the memories came rolling back of Leningrad in the war,

For the girl in the photograph, much had changed in the years that passed,
But her longing for the boy she loved was still the same since the war,

It was a moonless night upon the road of life, when he'd held her to say goodbye,
Many more would survive, for he stayed behind to help them live again,

When they met at the garden gate, tears would fall from a deep embrace,
For she never knew what happened to the boy she loved in the war,

Back in those happy days, before the soldiers came,
To break down the ones who remained,
And they only survived, who could learn to die, and live to fight again,

There they stood in an empty room, heard a voice from another time,
And their memories came rolling back of Leningrad in the war.",Leningrad,2006
Chris de Burgh,"Brother, there's a man at the gate, he has something in his hand;
He says it fell down from the sky, should I let him in?
Maybe it's an omen, maybe it will take away our sin, our sin.....

'Tis a diamond that he has, the biggest one I've ever seen,
And when he holds it in his hand, it's shining like the sun,
He says it's from another world, he calls it the mirror of the soul;

We must place it on the altar high, send the Devil to the fire,
Power over men we'll have when they see it shine, when they see it shine;

Brother, fetch the Abbot now, tell him of this wondrous thing,
Tell him that we'll have control of all the riches it will bring;
When people come to see it, for money we will purify their souls, their souls;

With my knife I'll kill this man, I'll send him to the Promised Land,
And when we take the diamond, we will have the future in our hands,
In our hands;

When we place it on the altar high, send the Devil to the fire,
Power over men we'll have when they see it shine, when they see it shine!

That's how it started, that whole new religion, and people everywhere,
Had to give up all their possessions at the Abbe St. Pierre,
But with their gold they could buy a redemption, and the promise of
Eternal life,
And the center of it all was a diamond divine,
It was up there on the altar high but for the monks it would not shine,
So with subterfuge they used the light of the sun, fooling everyone;

It was late at night when a young boy was in there with his friends,
And they dared him up to the altar, to touch the famous gem,
And when he did, the whole place exploded with a great and wonderful light,
And people came from everywhere to see it,
When he took it from the altar high, everyone could make it shine,
Except the Abbot and his men, for them, no light,
They could not make it shine.

And in the end, many heard the brothers, making confession of the 
Things they had done,
And the Abbot led that sad procession, as they went through the
Gate past the place where it had begun;

And all their dreams of glory, all their schemes and stories,
Would come to nothing after all,
Because a power greater from the world's creator
Gave us love to light the mirror of the soul,
Only love can light the mirror of the soul;

All through the world, there are many others, who always follow
Everything they are told,
By men with rules and regulations, using old superstitions and
Tales to assume control;

But all their dreams of glory, all their schemes and stories,
Will come to nothing after all,
Because a power greater from the world's creator
Gave us love to light the mirror of the soul,
Only love can light the mirror of the soul;

They come to nothing after all;
Because a power greater from the world's creator
Gave us love to light the mirror of the soul,

Are breaking away, and people know that something must change, must change,

There are better men than I, who with courage and conviction
Are patrolling the lines, waking up the sleepers who will not decide,
And do not think there's anything wrong

Sunrises every day, we may have different lives, but for all of us,
Here we will stay

In one world, and no-one's going anywhere,
We're living in one world, working in one world, breathing in one world,

Than yours, it only means we all have the right to believe, 'cause nobody
Knows it for sure, for sure, if there's a Heaven or Hell, or a sweet Paradise,
Or a place where we all meet again, 'cause with minimal change

There is a dream that you must follow,
And always listen to your heart, you'll be forever in my life
And if you need me in some new tomorrow,
Reach out, wherever you are;

And I will fly through the raging storm,
I will rise where others fall,
I will be there where the eagles fly,
I will hear you when you call and I hate to see you go;

You gave me a life from ashes and dust, from a place where hope was dying,
The girl that you found has become a woman now;

There is a dream that you must follow,
I'll try to listen to my heart,
We'll meet again in some new tomorrow,
I'll find you wherever you are!

And I will fly through the raging storm,
I will rise where others fall,
I will be there where the eagles fly,
I will hear you when you call;

I felt your tender kiss, and with your lips on mine,
My world became, complete again,
Beneath the shadow of the mountain, we were lovers till the dawn
Was on the sea

But with the morning sun the dream had disappeared,
And I awoke and still believed that you were here,
But soon the day will come again, beneath the shadow of the mountain,
I'll be with you when my soldier's work is done

When the summer winds begin to blow,
That is when I will be sailing to my home,
To the olive trees and the golden corn
That whispers in the fields up in the hills beyond the place
Where I was born

And here in Rome the talk is all about the war,
As men of Caesar we have heard those words before,
And though I'm strong, my heart belongs
Beneath the shadow of the mountain and my lover who is waiting
There for me

When the summer winds begin to blow,
That is when you'll see the sails that bring me home,
To the olive trees and the golden corn
That whispers in the fields up in the hills above Pompeii
Where I was born
I will return
Beneath the shadow of Vesuvius we'll be together till the day we die.....

And do you have faith in God above,
If the Bible tells you so,
Do you believe in rock 'n roll,
Can music save your mortal soul,
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

And I know that you're in love with him,
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym,
You both kicked off your shoes,

We set off upon that day,
To the Castle keep of Carisbrooke,
To where the treasure lay,
And soon I found the diamond,
At the bottom of the well,
But that traitor of a Turnkey,
To his death below he fell

T'was evilly come by and no good will you find there,
Have a care, have a care,
T'was evilly stolen, only pain and sorrow there, have a care!""

Then across the sea to Holland,
With the jewel in my hand,
Where we went to sell our treasure,
At the house of Aldebrand,
When he said it was no diamond,
Through the window it was tossed,
But that wicked man was lying,
And we were caught in a double-cross

""Have a care, have a care,
T'was evilly come by and no good will you find there,
Have a care, have a care,
T'was evilly stolen, only pain and sorrow there, have a care!""

They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance,
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing,
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes,

And I have never had such a feeling,
Such a feeling of complete and utter love, as I do tonight;

I don't know the answer to that question
Where's the look?

What's the look?
Look for your information

I say, ""Maybe there must be a solution
To the one thing, the one thing we can't find""

perched on a piece of wood

inside my bedroom there I found 
the future was concealed 
my records stacked up in a pile, 
collected from the chart 
with pictures pinned up on the wall 
I found my beating heart, 
and at home the stereo was on 
my feet stomped the floor,

had left me wanting more.

counted everyday I woke

I chased the girls and made them cry 
my hair grew down my back 
the contents of my teenage years 
were spent down in the sack 
and I played guitar and formed a band, 
I pewked up all night long 
as people came to sit and stare 
while I raced through my song, 
at home there was sadly nothing on 
my childhood had to end, 
the Sound of Music passed me by 
just like the Grateful Dead.

All my friends wanna settle down
Honestly finding a good girl is harder now
Tell me how I can help 'em out
When
Most of the people in my life who married aren't together now
It's getting worse every day it seems
But being with the wrong one can devastate your dreams
I waited for marriage, I know, that's old school
She passed the sonny test that's an old move
Just remember we all started out local
It's real when the people who hate you don't even know you
But I've been finding clarity going to church
I feel my insecurities are making it worse
I feel like God knows what he's doing
I'm taking the first step in the right direction not saying reverse
Take a walk in my shoes
Life is beautiful get lost in the views

What if just tonight we were different people
Just like in the movies we used to see
And what if just tonight we could love each other
Making things the way they're supposed to be

If we could just step back, yea
Give it all we got
If we could just step back
We can love like God

So many summers have passed you still require all my attention
You know the way into my heart only one direction
I give you all my affection I know you yearn for
I yearn for it to its what we made for
My life's goal is to make you smile raise the kids to be great in the meanwhile
You encourage the flows I write why I put em out
I read a true friend sticks closer than a brother, but
When I met you you were different from the others
A story of real love still reppin' for my brothers
I know that you feel the same so I say it for the culture
If you have a good girl go and tell her that you love her
No significant other then call up and tell your mother
All the best always rooting for the movie ending
I groove off the vibrations that you be sending
Forever yours although I'm gone forever touring
Why I treasure me waking up to you every morning

Turning it to a future you can invest in

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again

I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""

I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you"" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do, just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around

I need the number for lovers' anonymous
I'll tell 'em my story, hope they understand

Chris Friel,"I was born in a pool, they made my mother stand
And I spat on that surgeon and his trembling hand
When I felt the light I was worse than bored
I stole the doctor's scalpel and I slit the cord

[Refrain:]
I was a Catholic boy,
Redeemed through pain,
Not through joy
I was two months early they put me under glass
I screamed and cursed their children when the nurses passed
Was convicted of theft when I slipped from the womb
They led me straight from my mother to a cell in the Tombs
Repeat Refrain
They starved me for weeks, they thought they'd teach me fear
I fed on cellmates' dreams, it gave me fine ideas
When they cut me loose, the time had served me well
I made allies in heaven, I made comrades in Hell
I was a Catholic child
The blood ran red
The blood ran wild
I make angels dance and drop to their knees
When I enter a church the feet of statues bleed
I understand the fate of all my enemies
Just like Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane

[Repeat Refrain]

I watched the sweetest psalm stolen by the choir
I dreamed of martyrs' bones hanging from a wire
I make a contribution, I get absolution
I make a resolution to purify my soul

Chris Gantry,"She looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles
That weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way?

She picks up her apron in little girl-fashion
As something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age

She closes her eyes and
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day",Dreams of the Everyday Housewife,1968

Chris Geddes,"Oh, she always used to be the same. She'd be loose with a straight dark facial frame. And now the things that used to turn me off, I find endearing. And they laugh behind the trees as she lies naked in the clearing. I adore her, but I ignore her. See, I know it won't last as I reflect upon my past. But on severance she made no difference. There's things I won't let her know, as we're perfecting our show. I want to own her - I think I'll phone her. I can't explore her if I ignore her. And now the things that used to turn me off, I find endearing. And they laugh behind the trees as she lies naked in the clearing. But she won't beckon - is what I reckon. She may adore me, but she'll ignore me. Put on a show there, we're getting nowhere. She helps my snoring, so it never get's boring. And she always used to be the same. She'd be loose with with a straight dark facial frame. And now the things that used to turn me off, I find endearing.

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Will it fade way out of sight

Don't stay out to late
Cause he's got something he want's to give to you
He calls in his dreams, with his phantom screams
Hide from the shadows in the night

Gotta watch the attack of the mad axeman
He can take you anytime he pleases
He wants to make you bleed,
Around town his laughter sounds
Deep into the night, that flash of knife in the
Flickering lights for you
He knows when he's down

Chris Glen,"A time of fear, so long ago,
Lived a man in Salon,
In his dark and magic room,
He gazed on times to come,
All is then revealed, and visions on water speak true!
Cry for the nations, cry for the nations.
A flash of light, fills the night,
And chills the blood in his veins,
Will the power possess his mind, soul in chains
All is then revealed, and tears that he shed were for you
Cry for the nations, cry for the nations.
Battles of kings, and of fools,
And changes in ways he once knew,
As pages of days fade away
He's lost in time...

I gotta know cause I'm feeling good

Don't go giving me all your reasons
I can see them but they'll hurt me I know
Cause if the time should come, that you'll be leaving
Will I have the strength to let you go
I'll play the clown, when I'm insecure

But things you do make me want to shout
Let's give it time, and work it out
Every time you think you've got it made, you stand
Last, don't you think that I can't stand this pain
Forever again well oh no...
I've crossed the line, so I just can't lose it
I'm tied and bound and I can't abuse it
And all the things we've been fighting for
We'll break it loose, I can take some more
Don t go giving me all your reasons
I can see them, but they'll hurt me I know
Cause if the time should come that you'll be leaving

I have no feelings or name,

The voice of death is shouting in my ear!
Making war, making love
You know what I'm thinking of
How many times the traps are set,
You can't remember, and I can't forget!
Can you see me now, can you feel the pain,
Can you heal the scars on me
Life within my heart, hope within my soul, is dying!

When cries of anger sound again
My tears of shame, cut like a knife,
How can I justify this life!
Can you see me now, can you feel the pain,
Can you heal the scars on me

A time to live or die

Chris Gunn,"Check it out
First of all I would like to dedicate this song
To a very special and beautiful young lady
A lady whom in which I am in very love with
So from the bottom of my heart I speak
Only what I feel hoping that you will
Understand that there will never be another man
That'll love you the way that I do
You are my world and without life is not worth living
So please baby give me one more chance and I
The man that loves you will never let you down

Since nobody's weak like you
Baby though you know that I love you
You be the girl that I'm thinking about
Every muthafuckin' day
I can't get you out of my mind
I remember the day that I met you
The day that I saw you the very first time
I knew that I had to make you mine
So I started to walk where you was at
I asked for your name
You gave me your name and number
Now you're stuck inside my brain
'Cause all that I think about
Is how much I want to be your man
And spend my life with you my girl
Because I love you
We talk on the phone at night on a regular basis
But sill I haven't popped the question
Baby will you be my girl
I know that I'm the one for you
And you're the one for me just take my hand
I'll be your man together us two for eternity

[Chorus:]
I want to love you until the end of time
I want to make you mine baby don't go
You are the only one I think about everyday
I want to make you mine baby don't go
Say that you'll be my girl (say that you'll be my girl)
Say that you'll be my girl.


Nobody's ever been able to make me feel
The way you make me feel
This love is real I'll never put nobody else above you
Never did I think that a man like me
Would have a chance
But now that it's me and you I'm trapped
Inside of this romance
My world was lonely until the day
That you came along but now I am living life
With you, you are what keeps me strong
Without you life wouldn't be worth living
So don't leave my side
I hope someday you'll be able to say
That yes you'll be my bride
I've been in love with you for quite some time
And I feel so good that I got a woman like you
To love me when I need you hug me kiss me
Don't you stop
And tell me that I'm the one that you need
You are my world
So tell me baby that you want to be my girl

[Chorus:]

I know that I've done things in the past
But how long will this last
I said that I was sorry
Please forgive me just give me one more chance
My life without you ain't the same
I'm learning from my mistakes
And though these heart aches
You're putting me through I need you
Baby don't go I've always been true
I've never cheated
I've always been that man you wanted
Girl you're what I needed so give me your love
Come back I'm waiting for you the girl of my dreams
Oh how unreal it seems
When you're not here standing next to me
Remember the day you kissed me
The very first time I held you tight
When we made love that night
We both knew what we did was right
Cause we was both in love
And you're the only one I'm thinking about
I have no doubt it's you the one I love
Mireya, would you be my girl?

In love as one they say

Ahead lies mystery

To write the words again

It's either good or bad

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play

Orchids turnin' grey from what I bring out of my medical tray
Perpetuate Prevail Wonder and the alphabet is the predator and the prey
Don't let 'em walk away, broken in the bone yard, smokin' in the boys room
Spoken in the pattern that consumes you like a vacuum
The war ship I dock is the property of His Worship,
It's awkward when we talk about morbid conditions,
Vividly described from this side of the lie detector
Siphon nectar from the blossom, natural toxin, approach with caution
Blow flames in blue light they dance on the oxygen
Lost again in space? Allow us to demonstrate how it all generates
From motors to engines, machine guns to hand grenades, renegades of vengeance

Chris Hillman,"So you want to be a rock and roll star
Then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
Then take some time and learn how to play

And with your hair combed right
And your pants fit tight
It's gonna be all right

Then it's time to go downtown
Where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
Who are waiting there to sell plastic ware

And in a week or two
If you make the charts
The girls'll tear you apart

The price you paid for your riches and fame
Was it all a strange game, you're a little insane
The money that came and the public acclaim

Why do lies make my love stronger

Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy

But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

But now I find that I'm just like all the others 
Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind 
Sweet little love maker, takin my heart and leave me behind 
Heartbreaker couldn't you be 
Just a little more kind to me 
Played with fire, felt its burn 
I would have thought that I would have learned 
I melted every time you kissed me 
Every time you'd leave I thought that you would miss me

Then you walked in the room    cut through the gloom
You made a new mood it wasn't too soon
And I won't let you down  I won't let you down
Even though I may not know everything that's around
And don't let me down  don't let me down
I'll give you my word  my word is all that I have

I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes

Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon

Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care

Trumpets sound I hear thunder boom

Vanished from my hand

My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet

To your tambourine in time

Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees
Out to the windy bench
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory of fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Maybe you have been there once or twice 
Where all your friends just look at you and whisper 
And they want to give you nothing but advice 
When you walk in they all know what you're after 
And the higher that you get the more they'll see 
In a dark room filled with music, wine, and laughter 
Your eyes keep searching for her constantly 
Is it that one in the corner with her eyes filled with tears 
Or is she the one who's having fun drinking too much beer 
Every night it's the same sad old procedure 
The doorman winks at you on your way out 
'Cause deep inside he knows just what you're after 
And he's got something you can't live without 
There's nothing new that can be said about dirt 
And there's nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt

Is my one ambition

Hating the morning light

And then there suddenly appeared before me

Well ya wake up in the middle of the night, 
your feeling lonely, everybody needs somebody, but you'll be alright.
Ya wake up in the middle of the night, 
you feel so lonely, don't ya worry bout it baby, cause tonight's the night,

In the middle of the night you wake up.
In the middle of the night you call my name.
In the middle of a dream I wake up.
Fumble for the phone when I hear it ring.

Let's all stay up all night.
Everything's gonna be alright.

Well ya wake up in the middle of the night, your feeling lonely, 
and your wondering what I'm doing, would it be alright.
Ya wake up in the middle of the day, you say you're sleeping, 
well of course you're sleeping, baby you've been up all night.

That's okay cause I'm half out of mine.
She said I'm tired of love, all the games, and crying.

Said I know how you feel cause I've been there too.

I like the way you bring it to me.

I like the way you don't have to fake it.

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
