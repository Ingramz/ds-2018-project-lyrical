Tiji bis die Cops kommen, diggi gute Nacht
Ich paff' mein Bubu häng im Park und mach Tijara
Brauchst du inzen oder baba ganja?
Ich hab das beste Dope, frag' doch deinen Cousin Pico
Baba Material aus Colombia und Ketama
Jackpot mit Haze-Knollen aus Amsti
Locker easy über Grenze, fick den Zoll, chab ich geb' Gas
Auf der A3 Richtung Offenbach im Range Rover

Tauis akhi Schnapp, ich brauch' Millionen auf der Bank
Solang' du fit bist, mein Bruder, hau' auf die Kacke und zähl' Patte

Jeden Tag das Gleiche, gucken wie man Patte macht
Beschaffungskriminalität, wir brauchen Gras
Zieh' Richtung Park, zieh' bei Nacht irgendjemand ab
Zieh' durch was du kannst mein Bruder, doch zieh' niemals von dem Narc
Para, Gel - musst du wissen wie du's machst
Sammel' Scheine und gib' Gas
Inshallah, Villa in Marokko
Für Mama ein Palast und Papa kriegt dann noch ein Rolls-Royce
Ist das Ziel, doch dorthin ist ein schwerer Weg
Scheiß drauf, gib ihm khey, durch die Wand, Vollgas

Wo ich lebe, da willst du nicht wohnen
Gras im Treppenhaus, Chabo macht Flous
HBF, jeden Tag zwanzig Stunden
Vier sind zum Schlafen, Business mit Inzen
In meiner Straße achtzig Prozent Ticker
Baba Haze, check up, ich vermittel'
Dir 'n ganzes, kein Problem
Ich komm' mit Younes und Bilal und ich ripp' dich Esel
Patte machen schon mit vierzehn im Kopf
Was ich sah, war die Straße und Gott
Zwischen Gut und Böse - dünner Faden
Er macht Para für Mama in Deutschland
Escobar ist sein Vorbild
Ghettokids wollen Gold gehen
Ob heut oder morgen
Entweder reich oder unter den Toten
Was ich will, ist die Welt plus zwanzig Prozent
Kanak dreht ab auf vier Nasen Jay

Grass mower, firefighter
I'm tryin' to loosen up
Or make it tighter

But a Jack of all trades master, I'm not dead

But a Jack of all trades, there's stuff that gets made
Wait for your lucky day

See my trade and now it's gone

He hid the bottle of call

And out of place and down the hall
Problem called, na, na

And I'm tryin' to dig with my hands
I've learned to work with my mind
So much to lose and so much left to find
So much to take, so much to leave behind

Ya, walk down thoughts are free
You don't think of the dead, you think of dignity
Picked you up by the side of your head, you were half dead
Say your prayers and put you to to bed

At the end of the day stands a Jack of all trades
And the fool he has made
It's a Jack of all trades and the fool he has made
Of himself and his friend

But you'd do it again, yes, he'd do it again
He's a Jack

Where the monsters meet their makers?

It’s never ever discrete
But people just disappear
And the people you meet
They come from anywhere
But not just anywhere
They all got stories to tell
They all got secrets to keep
And meet by someone you like
It may go get a fight
Start feeling insecure, you think it’s something you like
But as you’re passing by
You kinda wanna cry
You thinking ain’t a dream
It’s in your life
She keeps meoff the streets,
But she keeps me off the streets
She keeps me off the streets,
She keeps me off the streets,

So I was shooting this shit
Like I could handle it
Like I could live on the door
Running
And throw up crowd in a whole
Where it gets too cold
With nowhere to be and nowhere to go
And once to call my own,
Letting me someone, she’s in love with
Never cheat again,
And yet the lie’s a joke
But she keeps me off the streets,
She keeps me off the streets,
She keeps me off the streets,
But she keeps me off the streets,

Hot lava, when it finally breaks
Breaks over your head and leaves you on your way
Then she calls her dad and lies about the cash
And then she bails you out
And then you feel like an ass
Where have you gone,
Got the self, you got nothing to eat
I’ll see you on the streets
But she keeps me off the streets,
She keeps me off the streets,
She keeps me off the streets,

Soul Asylum,"Well she started out working for an Illinois assembly line
Not really what she wanted
Just dealing with the feeling when you're feeling like you wish it was fine
You just don't talk about it
And along came an offer from the city of steel
They were stranded at the airport she could barely believe he was real
So she said

Make it happen take me to Manhattan
If you like LA that's cool
Or you could slip me right on down the Mississippi
I'd go anywhere with you

Well, they met up on the river in the middle of the summertime
He was from out on the coast
And ever since he said he'd never stop until they got it right
It's what they wanted the most
He had been everywhere and she'd been alone
They were just looking for a place to call home

So he said
How about Manhattan we can make it happen
I'll do California too
I know it's iffy but how about the Mississippi
I'd go anywhere with you

Any old town will do
I could die in the flyover zone with you

Then they started their first argument
And the fighting never stopped
It's just the same old story
All the boys and girls who never figure one another out
Then all the tears started pouring
Then the map came off the wall
She started marking it with a red pen

Then she said
Well, take Manhattan where anything can happen
You take California too
Forever after with or without laughter
We got better things to do
Take Manhattan where anything can happen
You take California too
Take the planet you can fucking have it
Look out cause she's coming for you",Take Manhattan,2012
Soul Asylum,"There's a little old man, who can get his hands
On a brand new silver planet
Walks the walk, and he talks the talk
If I had the world he could have it

For every question there are ways to shoot it down
Well there's a greenback, a green light
So we suggest we get this new thing off the ground

But I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it
The way you handled it, I got to hand it to you
No I can't stand the gravity, understand it
The way you handled it, I'm coming out of my shoes

Shudder, and wind me up
Like a toy on my first day of school
Stranded, abandoned
It's the rent and I'm out of food

It's nothing but convenience though it's not convenient
We ain't going anywhere

But I can't stand the gravity, understand it

Drifting up alone
Burning away
Up in the space

Lie down in a dream
Tell me whatcha need
Just a circuitry
It's only sanctity
Live how you wanna live

Like a shooting star, still flickering, still glowing
The room is still on fire

For every answer there are ways to shoot it down
Down on the cold ground do you believe that this time you are comin' round

You are about to bear witness
From the lands of long island
Takin' you to the sky's survival
I am your captain, enola
On this endless joruney
To invisions, to broaden your outer visions
To where you never been before
It's just a one night trip to love
Sun shinin' forever, and forever sun shines

Yo, leaving lasting impressions like cuts to flesh
Be that crew from the five one six point of view
With skills so tight, they the rhymes of a vagina
Them clits will turn into a diamond, the level of rhymin'
Pressure comes from lesser forms than me and my man
And we go back like life created from um, specks of sand
And there's money to be made cause cacaussians are paid
Only brothers who
Rhyme, seek bounce and catch balls
Plug 1, with them rhymes makin' your heart stall
Like them girls when you in they room when they man calls
It ain't nothin' but the thing wonder why can bring
As we come to the bring the pain everyone will sing

De la is the crew that you must hear
But please don't rush the stage
Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies

I'm on travellin' to places that the eye can't see
But kinder, cause yo' strife don't mean a thing to me
Throwin' me criminal looks, y'all need to get in the books
And drop some water in your melon, 'stead of actin' like a felon
Aiyo son, who you tellin'? I'd make a mil if it was up to me
But since it ain't I teach my seed to bank hard
And than god, I smoke a substance of a different kind
Catch me trippin' on earth when I'm high off sunshine

Down right to dirt, wonder why makes it work
With access to talent like caucasians to yellow cabs
With an arab driver
I liven parties with marvelous confiction
Ain't no fricition when life claims them victims who be some dried up funds
Best believe that the life is strife
Cause the gun made a man outta pussys from around my way
Who usually wouldn't have a fuckin' thing to say
Last year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders
And l.i.'s finest is movin' yo' necks at shows

Next time I won't care about no one

Next time you want to hurt somebody well it's to late I'm already gone

And I could never walk three steps behind (I never follow)

To get to you the harder I'd try and now
I can only hope my love transcends
So the next time around when they bring me down
I won't be their fool, I couldn't do it all again no

I don't care about no one
That's right they can do it on their own, uh huh
Next time you're gonna miss my love
Well it's to late I'm already gone

Just to say that you were sorry
I'd say that's not enough

After all take the abuse and shame recall the promenade
How could he ever be in the right frame of mind?
When his life is unkind

Listen there's another way
You don't have to live your life in this downtrodden way
Maybe your job isn't the answer

But take a look up
And take a glance at the alternatives

And I guess the people behind us
You know they worked real hard

And again I guess the public were ready
To accept something new
You know how we did

Yeah, for real, we're looking forward
To visiting different territories
We've never been to before
Also looking forward to visiting the places
We have been to before
So we will see you there

Being a man don't mean you got the right to all the
All the things that make your eyes grow open wide
Those things don't earn you true respect
They are not a measure of your pride

That you're a man and you don't play
Being a man isn't easy so try to be a man

Being a man isn't measured by your way with women
I need a man who will stand by me through thick and thin
'Cause any boy can make a child and disappear
And deny responsibilities, crying on that life ain't fair

It isn't easy to stay on and raise a child
But you took the time to make a baby
Take the time to make a life
Being a man isn't easy so try to be a man

Won't you try, be a man
Being a man you've got to try
Being a man is a reason why

Sometimes the things you've got to do
They seem so wrong
No one said that life was fair, we all got to carry on

두 번째는 대중들의 작은 집중 뿐
세 네 번째 부터

음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal

실낱 꿈 풍파와 입맞춤
가사를 쓸 때마다
혼자가 아니야 in my room
내게 숨 같던
친구들의 반이 하늘나라
내가 대신 꾸는 꿈 속에서
편히 잠을 자라
맺힌 내 땀을 봐라
I\'m a damn 괴물
Made an independent label
cause I won\'t ever settle

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다

And go goo, goo for my swagger original rude girl of rap

Are you dreaming wishing on a star

So through the darkness, show me who you are

Are you dreaming wishing on a star
A dreams a dream and so a star
So through the darkness, show me who you are

Now as I see the things in front of me
Open my arms and welcome you
That hoping this dream will come through
So many rivers to cross
Somehow you could get lost
But by the time i’m through
I can see right through you 

I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see, 
I can see right through you
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see,

A dreams a dream and so a star
So through the darkness
Show me who you are

I am dreaming wishing on a star
A dreams a dream and so a star
So through the darkness
Show me who you are

Now I can see all these things in front of me
I’ll open my arms and welcome you
And I hope that this dream will come true 

I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see, 
I can see right through you

Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey

In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall

Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium

Now I only want to say I love you one more time

Hold out, hold out, hold out, oh baby

Wait, wait

Yo, now last year, a lot of people been comin' up to me like
""Yo, Print, where's the album at?""
""Homie, workin' on that,"" was my reply

Yo, yo, yo... hold up man
Lets take it back to fundamentals, back to basics
Too many cats out there just rapping, running your trap
You lack the fundamentals, man
You trying to go all the way to Z
Forgot about A through X and why, you know what I'm saying?
The why is very important.  We're gonna splash y'all like this

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We got beats... unlimited
Rhymes... unlimited
Styles... unlimited
Now that we got yaw listening'
Soul Position in the place to
Just two turntables and one emcee

People like my music, but say I talk too much
They used to say the same thing about Flag and Chuck
Every revolution starts with somebody loud
Somebody got to throw the first brick from the crowd
My momma used to tell me to speak my mind
So why would I change over beats and rhymes?
But some of ya'll change very LP
Now you gangster, you used to emcee
Or maybe you the art fag nose in the air
Or maybe you the double-time down-south player
I can't forget my abstract star track naggers
And fake battle rappers that only use written
Ill what you see when you watch it from a distance
And how many people out there are really hypocrites?
Anything different they dis it, but Soul Position
(Pause)  still be keeping it exquisite

[Chorus]

I throw water on the crowd if the show ain't hot
Stage dive and don't care if you catch me or not
And make it look like I really meant to hit the floor
But when I'm laying on the ground I start spittin the raw
Even with a broken leg and a fractured collarbone
I won't let no other rapper touch my microphone
What ya'll motherfuckers laughin at
I'm trying to make sure my show stays action packed
Five dollars at the door get splashed with raps
Women pay two-fifty if that ass is fat
I ain't trippin', I'm trying to provide (?) some incentive
Decrease the hard (?), let's increase the women
Sometimes I write rhymes just to get girls naked
The only MC keeping it real enough to say it
So while you looking for the next jockstrap to play with
Me and RJ gon(na) be leaving with the girls that you came with

Aight..
it went down like this
a day just like today
just...doing my thing, you know?

[Chorus X2]
Look before you leap, walk before you run
run from anything that threatens peaceful existence
Look before you leap, walk before you run
run as far as you can until you reach a safe distance
we've been running from day one
never even thought to ask why or what from
only taught to run, only taught to run
only taught to run, only taught to run

I learned how to walk at age one
and wasn't satified until I learned how to run
at age eighteen I didn't want to run
but I had to run from the shots fired by a gun
forty-eight hours, two cycles of the sun
I couldn't run from the shock that paralyzed my tongue
it made not want to speak a word to anyone
felt like the breath had been stolen from my lungs
who would've told my mother that she lost her youngest son
tears in her eyes standing there feeling stunned
to hear that her baby fell victim to a gun
playing basketball outside having fun
it's sad but it happens all the time where I'm from
so I grew up thinking I'd never reach twenty-one
it's sad but it happens all the time where I'm from
but I'm still here, cause I learned how to run

[Chorus X2]

my inner city people
put your hands up if you're feeling me
I'm not alone running from fear of cops killing me
running from utilities, running from responsibilities
running from flashbacks and memories
it's funny how we run into the arms of strong women
run away when its time to talk about commitment
I've seen women, run away from Mr. Right
then turn around and say that there ain't no good men in sight
even thugs run when the streets turn into hell
some run to the cops cause its safer in a cell
some cats used to run the streets and act fool
got robbed and didn't run but they had to run their jewels
some used to run shit on basketball courts
they got kids now running from child support
it's sad but it happens all the time where I'm from
sometimes I wish that we never learned how to run

To get back to what I'd been seeing.
Heaven,
It was heaven.
I have never known a bliss, 
Witnessed anything like this.
Glowing all over as I started on my feet
Tootootooooooooo
Thought I heard somebody calling.
Heaven, 
It was heaven,
Now I know I've seen the light,
Make it go on shining

I keep on searching for the way to your heart,
Try to believe it's getting better.
Baby, take me all the way to your heart,
I want you oohooohoooh

All the sweet kisses, all the tenderness,
That are being shared all around me,
Only remind me of my own distress,
No loving arms to surround me.
Falling,
I am falling,
You could help me out again, 
Being mine forever...

I keep on searching for the way to your heart,
Try to believe it's getting better.
Baby, take me all the way to your heart...
I want you oohoohooooh

You got it, you got it,
There'll be no doubt about it,
Nobody's gonna keep from you
Ooh
I want you, I need you,
Gonna find a way to get through,
Nobody's gonna keep from you

Heaven, 
It was heaven,
Now I know I've seen the light,
Make it go on shining

I keep on searching for the way to your heart,
Try to believe it's getting better.
Baby, take me all the way to your heart.
I want you -oohooohoooh-

I keep on searching for the way to your heart,
Try to believe it's getting better.
Baby, take me all the way to your heart.
I want you
I
Want you

Ooh, keep on searching
For the way
To your heart
Try to believe it's getting better

Baby, baby, baby, baby,
I want you",The Way to Your Heart,1988
Soul Snatchers,"We're Iguanas in the midst just, just about the Father's business
From the ashes into the trenches
We move from plateau to the next
From the P-H-O-E-N-I-X

Yo! Seven X-Sinner Iguanas in the midst flesh issues
And set this spiritual death wish. Forget this
One of us goin' die
Resist the devil he flees, God draws nigh
I'm ready for war official nasty shut em down
Flesh no more, Christ. Sunrise, sundown
What now? I move with a swiftness
Leavin Satan giftless like Muslim on Christmas, forget this

In the distance you can barely see the glare from the iguanas
Phlipsyde-the word tech the wrong move you're a gonna
You can check my persona, reptiles from Arizona
Peep the word on my tongue hoe it snatches-creeps up on ya
We in your midst, you one of this, spiritual bliss (?)
Bangin' with this, it's Jesus Christ till I R.I.P
It's only right, I gotta fight
You meet me by the seventh trench, seven p.m. at night

Evil's been around since at first days begun
I can't change the style of life but I can change the life of some
You can receive my words maybe or maybe not
It's getting dark and hell is hot
You took the words right out of my thoughts
Where I'm at hot breezes blow freely Phoenix is where I chill
Rock this beat wet and send Hot back to Nashville
To my boy Knowdaverbs whose style will make you holler
Together with Holy intellect that's why we known as scholars

We're Iguanas in the midst just, just about the Father's business
From the ashes into the trenches
We move from plateau to the next
From the P-H-O-E-N-I-X

Iguanas in the midst with Jesus Christ we represent
Advocates and Knowdaverbs the Factors of the Seven
Keep it tight, bring light, and shine on anointed tracks
Take it to the world, come again and bring it back
To a time of life when I was dwellin' in the midst
I had to seek the kingdom and execute the Devil's tricks
I'm never lookin' back but all the while feelin' lonely like
A king to his throne
Lord father take me home

In a darker realm I slept for days I wept
For my Lord to open my gates and my soul he kept
'Cause I was null and void in the pathway of righteous
Screamin' sinners prayers hopin' one steady might just
Live true my inner spirit nearly dead
Spirit food consistency nearly water and bread
Then a turnaround be	 thunderbolts did deliver
Grains of sand in my life turned into a roaring river

We're Iguanas in the midst just, just about the Father's business
From the ashes into the trenches
We move from plateau to the next
From the P-H-O-E-N-I-X

Temporarily Nashvillian, Permanently Phoenician
Staying prepared to move inside and out of season
Hailing from the dust off of 43rd and Thomas
Shipped in shape like a rhombus. Choke the curse and pulled the promise
But Yo! There came a time where I finally recognized
That what God wanted to do that an enemy despised
And as long as he could keep me from a true experience and never ready
He could either steal, kill, or behead me
Tried to hit me with his best shot but not
Somehow avoided being stopped so begun like a Gloc
To be about my Daddy's beeswax, rode the land on camelbacks
I-I had to double check, minimize me so he could max-
Imize the plan, like a lamp take a stand
As I study God's hand as it combs through the sand
And recognize his voice when he speaks in the wilderness
Trekking through the dunes not to deviate off the Syllabus
With my ears open widely slow to speak swift to listen
Had to rid me of myself and not to messy up the mission
The temperature raisin' in the arid zone
To disintegrate the trash that wasn't in its purest form
When in the midst continue praisin' as his prescence seems nearer

Renegades of this atomic age 
This atomic age for renegades 
Renegades of this atomic age 
This atomic age for renegades 

Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece 
On down through the Middle Ages 
When the earth kept going through changes 
There's a business going on, cars continue to change 
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades 
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne 
Like Martin Luther King, Malcom X 
They were renegades of the atomic age 
So many renegades 

Hand clap, hand clap, the renegades 

From a different solar system many many galaxies away 
We are the force of another creation 
A new musical revelation 
And we're on this musical message to help the others listen 
Improve momentum and seek the electonic chance 
Like astrology 
Like technology 
Like God's Creation 
Like the Zulu station 
Like to the nation 
Like destroy all nations 
Like militants 
Like down in sand 
Like through changes ,nothing stays the same 
Oh renegades 

Now renegades are people with their own philosophy 
They change the course of history 
Everyday people like you and me 
You know they have their secret notions 
And time is endless motion 
All people of the moderate ages here in this twentieth century 
You have to keep up in time with the moderate time 
A state of mind and a sense of pride 
A renegade, yes a renegade 
Of this time and age

Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop

And not of empty popping 
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of 
electronics 
With the bass, and the treble 
The horns and our vocals 
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh 

There was a time when our music 
Was something called the Bay Street beat 
People would gather from all around 
To get down on the Bay sound 
You had to be a renegade those days 
To take a man on the dance floor

Renegades of this atomic age 
This atomic age for renegades 

Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece 
On down through the Middle Ages 
When the earth kept going through changes 
There's a business going on, cars continue to change 
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades 
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne 
Like Martin Luther King, Malcom X 
They were renegades of the atomic age 
So many renegades 

Hand clap, hand clap, the renegades 

From a different solar system many many galaxies away 
We are the force of another creation 
A new musical revelation 
And we're on this musical message to help the others listen 
Improve momentum and seek the electonic chance 
Like astrology 
Like technology 
Like God's Creation 
Like the Zulu station 
Like to the nation 
Like destroy all nations 
Like militants 
Like down in sand 
Like through changes ,nothing stays the same 
Oh renegades 

Now renegades are people with their own philosophy 
They change the course of history 
Everyday people like you and me 
You know they have their secret notions 
And time is endless motion

And not of empty popping 
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of

With the bass, and the treble

You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh 

There was a time when our music 
Was something called the Bay Street beat 
People would gather from all around 
To get down on the Bay sound 
You had to be a renegade those days 
To take a man on the dance floor

Then in their eyes the same dirt covers me 
Take off the blindfold, it's time to enlighten

For self satisfaction we're prepared to destroy 
One man, one earth and one destiny

No black magician telling me to cut my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in your peace
I've opened the door now; my mind has been released

Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life; I don't want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruinte
I can see through their frustration

People hiding their real face
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe

So believe what I tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind

As ransom in return for my soul's silhouette.
How deep does shit get? 
Is it worth the Bentley's 
And jets in this jungle of sheer cons 
And devils with breasts. 
I mean does everything happen for a reason, 
The change of seasons, 
Even the slugs screamin' to stop you from breathin'. 
It seems we're all a target in this mosh pit. 
The world be spinnin' lopsided, that's
Why I have my logic.

Sound clash, bomb blast 
We are what we are, musical contrast
Sound clash, bomb blast 
So don't tell me how to act, how to be, how to live 
We are what we are, forever live or die 
Don't tell me how to act, how to be, how to live 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

My conspiracy theory threatens national security, speaking clearly, 
You assholes don't hear me. 
Walked the psychopath of Timothy Leary 
When cell therapy wasn't curing me, 
God put fear in me, scaring me. 
R-I-P Kamau Jahi, quiet warrior with dignity, 
Still with me spiritually, forever in memory. 
Cut throat, who ill as me?
Soulfly. Flight attendants ain't got shit on me. 
You reap what you sow, 
So I try my hardest to harvest good crops regardless 
If most artists are garbage
With godless content. 
To be honest, the chronic plus my fondness of alcoholic products 
Held my spirit in bondage like convicts. 

Gettin' blunted wasn't pungent,
Overabundance of dumb shit had me living low-budget. Conflict. 
Indo had my mental growth stunted, cut friends out my circumference I used to run with. 
Rose above it. Fuck thuggin' and clubbin', 
I got one in the oven, 
Plus my girl's talkin' husband, she buggin'. 
My method of flowin' expression through poem, 
Salt of the Earth like the ocean, God's chosen spokesman. 
Creation to cremation, to be blatant, fuck Satan, 
Paper chasin' motherfuckers facing damnation. 
Girls actin' fly with no interest in aviation, fuck station, radio
Waves is just radiation. 

We are what we are, musical contrast, sound clash, bomb blast 
We are what we are, musical contrast, sound clash, bomb blast 
You don't feel when I bleed, when I scream, when I feel 
We are what we are, forever live or die 
You don't know how I feel, what is real, what's the deal 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Cutthroat Logic, 
The newest extension of the Soulfly Tribe 
From now until the day that I die. 
Can't you tell by the pain in my eyes 
That with this music I will bring my dream to life. 
Stressed the F out, losin' my mind, 
I wanna blow up right now 
But I know it takes time. 
Like slanging saxs to takin' elbows across the state lines,
From 22's to tec 9's swag to kind. 
Underground to worldwide, I will never die, 
Forever my words in my rhymes they gonna keep me alive. 
So onward I strive each 
And every day of my life as I fight to keep K-RAB's dream alive. 
Forever my better half from fightin' to makin' cash. 
Some things in life are fucked up,
Wish I could take 'em back. 
But I live life with no regrets 
So I just look back on life and laugh.

We are what we are, I know you understand 
In memory of D-LOW I carved your name 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Got Catholics in confession 
And 5-percenters studying lessons 
While the youth smoke Buddha for blessing.
I hear you fuckers on vinyl praising false idols, 
Claiming Gods and dogs and other fraud titles, to rival. 
My recital's laced with the Bible, life is just a time trial, 
I'm trying to make the finals. 
March madness in the land of savages, 
I'm stranded, a magnet for static so I combat it diplomatic, nomadic, 
What I'm tatted, my cross my only baggage, 
Roots go back to Africa, I'm not Asiatic. 
Brothas mastered mathematics and still they can't add it. 
My quest isn't cabbage although it's nice to have it, 
Rock the planet, like volcanic magma fragments, 
As my lava cools a lot of fools take me for granite. 
I just wanna meet the trinity and live for infinity, 
Laugh at the enemy, when I get there who cares who remember me, on Earth. 

Since birth my dome had afro turf, ask the nurse, 
I heard a verse that said, ""who's last is first"", 
So I keep my flesh humble 'cause I'm still-skinned like Rumple, 
Average a triple double and keep my game subtle, 
Jam harder, than Vince on all ballers from bench to starter 
Since I slaughter holler, murda, on Shawn Carter,
No honor with robbers, 
So I pray to my godfather 
And my conscience isn't bothered by how I get my dollars.

Turn my head up, looking at the stars
So many years, I still wonder where you are?

It's been so hard and I ask myself why?
Turn my head up, looking at the sun
Waited so long, it's time to move on, move on

Is it worth the Bentley's 
And jets in this jungle of sheer cons 
And devils with breasts. 
I mean does everything happen for a reason, 
The change of seasons, 
Even the slugs screamin' to stop you from breathin'. 
It seems we're all a target in this mosh pit. 
The world be spinnin' lopsided, that's
Why I have my logic.

Don't tell me how to act, how to be, how to live 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

My conspiracy theory threatens national security, speaking clearly, 
You assholes don't hear me. 
Walked the psychopath of Timothy Leary 
When cell therapy wasn't curing me, 
God put fear in me, scaring me.

Still with me spiritually, forever in memory. 
Cut throat, who ill as me?
Soulfly. Flight attendants ain't got shit on me. 
You reap what you sow, 
So I try my hardest to harvest good crops regardless 
If most artists are garbage
With godless content. 
To be honest, the chronic plus my fondness of alcoholic products 
Held my spirit in bondage like convicts. 

Gettin' blunted wasn't pungent,
Overabundance of dumb shit had me living low-budget. Conflict. 
Indo had my mental growth stunted, cut friends out my circumference I used to run with. 
Rose above it. Fuck thuggin' and clubbin', 
I got one in the oven, 
Plus my girl's talkin' husband, she buggin'. 
My method of flowin' expression through poem, 
Salt of the Earth like the ocean, God's chosen spokesman. 
Creation to cremation, to be blatant, fuck Satan, 
Paper chasin' motherfuckers facing damnation.

Waves is just radiation.

Cutthroat Logic, 
The newest extension of the Soulfly Tribe 
From now until the day that I die. 
Can't you tell by the pain in my eyes 
That with this music I will bring my dream to life. 
Stressed the F out, losin' my mind, 
I wanna blow up right now 
But I know it takes time. 
Like slanging saxs to takin' elbows across the state lines,
From 22's to tec 9's swag to kind. 
Underground to worldwide, I will never die, 
Forever my words in my rhymes they gonna keep me alive. 
So onward I strive each 
And every day of my life as I fight to keep K-RAB's dream alive. 
Forever my better half from fightin' to makin' cash. 
Some things in life are fucked up,
Wish I could take 'em back. 
But I live life with no regrets 
So I just look back on life and laugh.

In memory of D-LOW I carved your name 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Got Catholics in confession 
And 5-percenters studying lessons 
While the youth smoke Buddha for blessing.
I hear you fuckers on vinyl praising false idols, 
Claiming Gods and dogs and other fraud titles, to rival. 
My recital's laced with the Bible, life is just a time trial, 
I'm trying to make the finals. 
March madness in the land of savages, 
I'm stranded, a magnet for static so I combat it diplomatic, nomadic, 
What I'm tatted, my cross my only baggage, 
Roots go back to Africa, I'm not Asiatic. 
Brothas mastered mathematics and still they can't add it. 
My quest isn't cabbage although it's nice to have it, 
Rock the planet, like volcanic magma fragments, 
As my lava cools a lot of fools take me for granite. 
I just wanna meet the trinity and live for infinity, 
Laugh at the enemy, when I get there who cares who remember me, on Earth. 

Since birth my dome had afro turf, ask the nurse, 
I heard a verse that said, ""who's last is first"", 
So I keep my flesh humble 'cause I'm still-skinned like Rumple, 
Average a triple double and keep my game subtle, 
Jam harder, than Vince on all ballers from bench to starter 
Since I slaughter holler, murda, on Shawn Carter,
No honor with robbers, 
So I pray to my godfather 
And my conscience isn't bothered by how I get my dollars.

That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth, good will to men
From heaven's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world

Above it's sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing

All ye beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow

Look now for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing
And hear the angels sing

Soulful Strings,"Sunshine blue skies please go away
The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.
I'm a man and I got my pride
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain,1969
Soulful Strings,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand

The woman who lives there can tell
The truth from the stuff that they say
She looks me in the eye

No, well o.k. then

I wonder if everything I do
I do instead 
Of something I want to do more

This is just the way it goes
When everything else seems unclear
I guess at least I know

Follow me like de wizard of Oz

Ask about me in da streets I spit so heat
Ain't nobody in da game messing with my click
Style swift hot like itz July 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn't
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
We gettin money over here hands in the air
Y'all making it too easy!, it's not fair

Kidnap the world till they pay my ransom

I'm a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas.
Hammer in my drawers but I nail yo bitch.
Blunts like fingers, I'm bout to make a fist.
Everybody die, gon' bury me alive.
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside.
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky.
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire.
Life ain't shit but bitches and money.
I pass that weed, like I studied.
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix.
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic.
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts.
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks.
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei.
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape.
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks.
Life is a bitch, I'll make her yo ex.
Better turn to God, 'fore I turn to Godzilla.
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Muthafucka it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong.
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone.
I'll have a broke muthafucka run in ya home.

You ain't gon' hurt nobody like Kid 'n Play.
Ain't nun sweet but the codeine nigga.
Eyes hella red like chlorine in 'em.
I was gettin' that pussy, I was gettin' that money.
Long hair, don't care, Hacksaw Jim Duggan.
Too high to take a breath, too high to take a step.
Two rights don't make a wrong, three rights, make a left.
The cops on my dick, the feds on my nerves.
I walk it like I talk it, got legs on my words.
If she don't suck dick, I don't give her that dick.
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch.
Money is the issue, full court pressure.
I like my blunt, Nutty Professor.
I'mma straight rider with a getaway driver.
Hit you dead on the money now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends.
But never too rich for new money.
These niggas buying hatorade by the twelve pack.
Like two stomachs.
I'm laced up like two shoes, miss goody.
Keep that ratchet nigga.
Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch you nigga.
Blow yo fuckin' brains out in traffic nigga.
Got green, New Orleans, St. Patrick nigga.
One bitch in the whip, one on the phone.
The one on the phone, is in front of ya home.
She 'bout to run in ya home, and put one in ya dome.

One in ya dome. One in ya dome
One in ya dome. One in ya dome

Rest in peace to the game, tell them kill they self.
Make yo death wish, 'cause I'm too fresh.
'Cause I'm fresh to death, 'cause I'm fresh to death
You go broke tryna get fresh like this.
Rest in peace to the game 'cause I killed it.
I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death
What you talkin' I came out a coffin.

I just can't see myself,
Living in a house of mirrors.
I bought me a double R,
'Cause I went from rags to riches.
And these niggas nag like bitches.
Actin' like little fags like Richard.
And all of my bitches be bad as vision
You gotta problem I can fix it like a mathematician.
I ammunition, call me ammo for short.

Soulja Boy,"Fuck buyin' jewelry, buyin' ammo
Teflon, bulletproof the Lambo
Hate rats, got my niggas in the fed
Got money in the bank and money on my head
Really? Niggas sound silly
Wanna talk money, yeah, just counted ten milli
Free my nigga Meek Milly, bad bitch out of Philly
Sold that white girl so I guess I sold Iggy
Who you think I give a fuck about, an enemy?
Think I give a fuck about the industry?
Pussy ass nigga better Google me
Boy, I really made a million out the fuckin' streets
Boy, I had a white car back in '04
Back in runnin' wood days and ride low
When bein' a street nigga really meant something
Now niggas sell his soul for a follow
If you wanna talk streets, what it mean to you, nigga?
Take pictures with guns so that make you a killer
Nah, LA Reid gave me that check today
Took that shit to the jacks, empower the hittas
I'm Crenshaw at Fatburger, fuckin' with Nipsey
And I bet you I'm rockin' my chains
Or I'm in the Watts with Jay Rock or slidin' through Compton with Game
Cause real niggas livin' the same

My auntie did 20 years, my pop did like 16
My partner did a decade so what the fuck you really mean?
Really, ho, Billie Jean jackets in my video
Causin' all this racket, on a tennis court
Really made a million in a kitchen fork
Skirt, skirt, skirt, skirt, dinner fork
Often offended, I told that bitch to get out when she finished
Need me a bitch that gon' suck me and fuck me
And freak me and pass me to all of her friends, that's what it is
Verbal telekinesis
Korrupt mixed with Jesus
Big Meech mixed with Yeezus
Keep playin' them games and get shot from them bleachers
I still got my stripes when I'm not wearing Adidas
Got a fresh hairline from Peter
Got me a hockey mask, choppers, started talking fast
Give it to 'em direct just like Jeter
Niggas ain't killing shit, niggas they playing
They saying they killing shit
Got me an A and a K and a 220 trey
And the shit hit, might burn a little bit
I'm like, ""Really, little bitches, say really""

Fuck these niggas
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me

Brand new Benz with the top down
In my old neighborhood, all the cop 'round
I don't give a fuck, motherfucker, act up
Let him and the police hear how the Glock sound
Comin' with the bullshit, get shot down
Sucker free, no fly zone in my town
And there ain't no discussion
It's simple, you try me we gon' get to bustin'
I promise, my nigga, you want it, my nigga?
My young niggas ready, they goin' on God
They act like they know ain't no God
We so official, for sure, no facade
Trap a nigga shine like I glow in the dark
Still got my .44 in the door
I'n not finna play with you, homie get laid with you
Cement your feet, then it's off in the lake with you
Underestimate you, that mistake I couldn't make with you
I hit you with the K, myself and show you what the paper do
And can't nobody handle you the way I do
Give your boy a K or two, kill you in a day or two
And no disrespect, boy, you violate me, we gon' handle that
Blow your ass off the map
And you still reachin' your hand out for no dap
My demonstration in exchange for your hatin'
I put this flame all in your face, boy you fakin'
We come through in Mercedes and shoot you
You'd think Call of Duty would make it
Bacon, I get my moolah off top
He don't give me my moolah, off top
Give a damn what the naysayers say
And we waitin' a day in the A with the K and I'm gone

Fuck these niggas
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me

Niggas ain't gon' kill shit
I'm ridin' 'round, 7 pounds, nigga, Will Smith
It's a whole heck of y'all and a whole deck of cards
This shit right here you can't deal with
Two ice cubes and some cognac
Spent some time in twin towers, I ain't goin' back
Spent my commissary on some M&M's thinkin' I was Eminem
Runnin' Aftermath in all black
I'll slaughter your house with 5 9's
Leave all of you niggas with crooked eyes
Got the Louisville Slugger, Big Papi Ortiz
Knockin' every button off your buttoned up sleeves
Please that's Jeezy the Snowman
Comin' straight to your window like Bruh Man
Said I ain't killin' your dog but stealin' my hog and fuck my conscience
Puttin' bullets in your doberman, don't fuck with Compton
Don't you fuck with Kendrick, don't fuck with Problem
Don't fuck with YG, I'm Mr. Miyagi, Daniel San, I handle them
My handle's dumb, I had no gun
Fuck around, stomp you out in these Durant's or somethin'
I bear arms like Durantula
This rocket launcher'll blow your whole fuckin' mansion up
And everybody gotta die, put them candles up
How you get caught up in the web with tarantulas?
And for you fuckin' dumb niggas, let me slow it down
I can screw you like Pimp and Big Boi around
And when a nigga say ""Timber"", you don't need Ricky Rubio
To let a nigga know it's goin' down
Fuck you clowns, yeah I put the word on you niggas
Don't A$AP Ferg on you niggas
Been all through New York with Diddy
My verse'll Schmurda you niggas
And that's not a shot at T.I.P. or a shot at Gotti
Take shots of Ciroc in a black Bugatti
Got a shotty in a backpack, napsack
Shawty got a black MAC 11, I will catch that body
Like Nasir and Hov when I'm 40 years old
I will still be the pilot that light up the stove
And be cookin' that crack 'til the Doctor come back
And tell niggas that Detox come out this October
Like Ol' Dirty Bastard, I'm finally sober
And verses like this'll get me a new Rover
Get you a new home and a casket
Your funeral boring, I'm glad that it's over

Chronic bud to save your struggles
So somebody suffer, scriptures
Time to rip ya, hit ya really good
I'll split ya, ditch ya
Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane
Bone, II Tru, Hustla'z, and Shifters (We are the soldiers!)
Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets
Where they playin' for keeps, so fake soldiers...

[Mo! Hart]
Late hours of the eve
Now brothas out schemin'
Tryin' to break your heart
Gotta alleviate the problem before it even start
Sit relax and never losin' my composure
Brotha done told ya, better beware
'Cause this Mo Thug click got plenty of soldiers
Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die
Never esitate don't flip
I can pin you all in them disguises
So if you want to come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

[Jhaz]
why'all want no lovin' to a sister flowin'
Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

[Souljah Boy:]
It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)
With a MAC-10, reactin' like you really want to know what's happenin'
Down with buckin' why'all with me strap and best a be duckin'
'Cause I'm blastin' real fast when I see fake-ass O.G.'s

I'm ridin' real; Mo Thug is where I be
I'm down with Ken
So put 'em up as I cock the pistols
Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many want to roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go
So let's make our dough, for sure

But ain't no soldiers, this lunatic get the chrome

And handlin' them demons makin' me crazy
Knowin' that Gates can't be fucked with

You heard it before, but this time you can buy
Some bustas fell off, we leave 'em behind
I'm mean we tried, but they could not fall in line

Yeah, I'm feelin' myself
And with the number one single, I'm feelin' my wealth
Yeah, Now what you know about me
Call me Mr. '08, 'cause this year about me
I'm rookie of the year, but a major in the league
So, how you doin' haters stay away from me
You don't wanna see the chopper
When the boys get silly 
And they rainin' on ya block, and ya brains like Chile
Get Silly!

[Soulja Boy]
My chain too silly, my watch too dumb
Only rapper on Myspace with more friends then Tom
1 for the money, 2 for the count
Ridin' in the vehicle I can't even pronounce
S.O.D. Money game, money keep stackin'
I leaked every song, and I still went platinum
Fruit Loop silly, candy painted flav. cars
You are a prisoner behind these 8 bars

If you don't like it eat a D
I'm here at ring tone misc. and ring tone net
Tryin' to label southern dance music, ring tone rap
They cappin' on the coop, but ain't a damn thing funny
They ain't hatin' on the music, they hatin' on the money

[E-40]
My house so silly, my money so silly
I make more in a week , than your parernts do yearly
My ring so silly, my ice so silly
The roc's on my watch makes the hatas wanna kill me
The hundred round drum on my gun so dumb
That it'll fly yo head all the way to London
I'm sick with it, rich like Lil' Weezy
I'm a milli, got a short fuse and I'm throwed like a frisbee

Get peeled like a dutch, and split like a philly
Oh really, them boys on the block, them boys in a row
Them boys at the trap they know the dilly
Make it rain for days, for the nights
And now when I'm at the strip club
When you them choppas out the back window

The Barack of College Park, I mean what more can I say
I switch my chains with my cars, switch my cars by the date

Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that
But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips swing, and, look, just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back

Hell yeah, that's the spot, now bring it back to the top
Stop! woah, now back it up, now back it up
Let it rise then watch it dump, shaking your junk in the trunk
And, I, like, the way you move it smoothly
Now why, don't, you move that booty, to, me
I'm tryna come up with some thoughts of attack,
Until I heard somebody yellin' out ""savage where the chorus at?!""

They said em twice. Another third times a charm.
But why would you holla back, if a nigga in front of you ain?t no harm.
He tried to lean, he tried to rock, but he can?t do it quite like me.
Cause he keep doing the same ole move, constantly.
Now watch us kill this dance. Soon as we hit the flow.
Bout to get real crazy, don't turn yo head. We bout to start the show.

Roll yo arms and show yo swag. Now break his legs, arms, neck (yea).

Soulja Slim,"Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
Check this out

Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm  tyring to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up till they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed 
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed

I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for ??? this
Soda couldn't rock this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
My ??? can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before

Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being 
Shot

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs

If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed 
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs

If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed

Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but I spent a 100 on my ride
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name
Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine
I told him weed charge it 2 the game
Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit
Some slum shit
Some out the projects dumb shit
Some weed and blunt shit
Some I don't give a fuck shit, where it from shit
Some penitentiary solitary confinement 
Never see no motherfuckin' sun shit
Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga hit the floor 
I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick door
Now whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting
Y'all call me down??? do get scared 
I ain't flipped till my guns smoking
It be a hustle just to eat  
And it be hard on these streets
Gotta get my hustle on
Got 20 dollars y'all now that shit don't last long  picture this",20 Dollars to My Name,1998
Soulja Slim,"Imagine making it big in this rap game
And you think it's all good
I'm here to tell you it ain't baby
You got every eye in the world on you
You gotta understand these people fear what they don't know

Imagine life with no jails and no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they want to trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga break bread

I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skins too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rangs
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got me FED's on the scene and they sware I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had a pissed, ask your son, I know he gotta see-Murder disc
Number one in every record store
Mom and pops tap my phones, but you know I ain't slangin' rocks
Take me to jail but I tell em take me off the scene
My first call go to P, he put my mind at ease
You told me not to trip cause it's a bigger picture
And if your tank don't put it on TRU, I'm a come and get ya

Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I went through stressin' (why), cause I'm already strapped,
bulletproof vesting
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, dad, why they come for me
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And from time to time it crossed my mind
What if there wasn't a crime 
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's true for me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, so toss the glocks with the hollow
I would kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don,
nigga woah

Now we get only get one minute to pray and a second to die
Could you picture the dark side before I let these bullets fly
From out my 4-5 see, I know what you mean
Is it life or that imagine living life with no breath
My imagination's a motherfucker with a bullet stretch
Too much killing, I won't supply the world with a vest
But that's impossible, killing its unstoppable
As long as they got bullets and guns they got niggas that's droppin' em
Real niggas from that ????? the world that's all about
Real niggas we won't have a reason to kill niggas, heal niggas
My plane it runs so deep I'm a share it with why'all
While my own niggas is trying to cut throat while I'm tryin' to ball

Mines in the back of my head

Been runnin' with me since I was small
a lot of y'all probably know him, then again ya probably don't
Cause its sung to strugglin' that be ridin'
With head biters in the trunk
Elliotts name was double crosser
He'll double cross ya, when he woulda taught ya
Told me not to get my hand dirty
He'll be my nigga tosser
Tellin' me to do my rap thing
No Limit bring me out there
Just chill, and make my mills

Born killaz

The real niggaz, stay real
And the fakes stay fake
And you's a busta type nigga
Then stay the fuck outta my face
Because I'm tryin' to stay busta free
But y'all not hearin' me
Its nuts or cuffs
Get it how you live, on these city streets
And every nigga roam,
Gotta be Bout It Bout It
Niggaz pourin' syrup in the game
They not bein' solid
And that's the busta type
Niggaz I can't fuck with so I stay my distance
And run with real soldiers that love me
Only a handfull, duck and holler back
Real niggaz for sure got my back
All about the combat
All of the rest of 'em dead
Bread, ridin' red
A big dope dealer I used to fuck with doin' time in the vet
No need to say his name, my nigga used to slang them thangs
O-Z's and kilos
Heard the smack mayne
He used to give me grams
Never wanted to give me weight
He knew my habit, had me out there, he was goin' to get blazed
I respect that by me bein' an addict
I was, here I had to snort about half a gram to get me a buzz

Chorus-2

I got sent to the old jail, where a lot of niggaz don't survive
I rolled on the till bout a quarter of five
Got up early in the mornin'
Four feet up old mill
Guess who till rep
My dogg Cheer Will
He gave me five scoops, cause I just rolled in
But I gave that shit away
Cause my head bone bent
A murder charge in three attempts
What the fuck you expectin'?
I'm facin' life in prison, with a leathal injection
But these dick suckin' DA's
They refuse the charge
I rolled off B1, makin' boo-koo noise
Screamin' those bitches can't hold a Soulja like me down
Then my pajamas, socks and T-shirts, with a tank from ? town
I ain't stay out, cause thirty days
I come right back in this bitch
Probation violation, gotta do a year in six
I bet you dick suckers won't see me
No mothafuckin' more
I got big plans, ya understand?
By slangin' lyrics like dope
To all my people locked down, y'all be home in a second
Just keep it real, and stay treal and make them bitches respect ya

You think I'd be sayin' to myself
How many more days you leave jail?

Countin' some mill
Hypnotized by fast thangs, fast cars and fast bitches
I'm tryin' to have fast things, can you dig it?

Hopin' outta 4 doors

Never fuck with, no I don't know hoes
For sho' hoes
Come from the South and no doubt I wear jibo's and polo's
Everything I ride is chrome and mo-mo's
can't' trust a few, cause that's a no no
You gotta watch your back, cause niggaz will jack
That's why I stay strapped with 4-4's
See, I'm tryin' to have enough money to turn every project into a condo
Every nigga I don't like, to wino's
and every girl that alright, to fine hoes

You know who get ready bro 
It seems like they don't want a young nigga to get rich 
Make money like we ain't supposed to leave the ghetto
But uh

You know we was dealt some bad cards but
You know

Life's hard so lets show em show em show em what's up

The reaper is callin' so I'm constantly smokin'
See-Murder ain't gonna die in vein 
My ghetto ties got me livin' my life in pain
See the world knows we gonna be thugs forever 
You can take me out the ghetto
But you can't make it better
See the status of your money done changed 
But the status of your danger remains the same
I need to clear my head of these evil thoughts 
And teach magnolian' gateway the shit I was taught
Take a ride wit me nigga to eternity 
And watch you live tuh see anotha century
Life's a bitch who do you trust I put my faith in my glock 
Cause I know its gone bust

But my ghetto ties keep my checkin' in my rearveiw

Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch 
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich
I was thrust some bad cards 
Became a thug with no love cause life's hard

Who do you trust?

He might take me for a faker
He might try to do a jack and that might cost me my life 
If you ever jack its real nigga 
You best kill me or pay the price
Ain't nuttin' I ain't fallen behind
No street machine tell me what you seen
Then tell a nigga about some stoned ass 
Left the murder scene disguised in army green with a infra beam
Own self tryin tuh gum nigga run as soon as he heard the blast fool one
He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight
Witness that murda the first degree my ghetto ties fuckin' round wit me
Don't do that

How many times have you seen a family nut up and the mom was cut up
I see now but later on I'm gonna be seein' now

Gonna get the dilly for a milly
Went to the next room john jones was in the zone

Soulja Slim,"Chorus:Master P
Daddy wasn't home so mama raised me
I'ma thug but still mama bathed me (4X)

Verse 1:Master P
I live my life as a thug, roll wit' some killas
Slang crack to some dope fiends, ride wit' some drug dealers
Find me in 3rd ward pullin' all nightas
Keep a tech 9 cocked for any nigga that don't like me
Throw up your soldier rags if you rowdy
I represent a million muthafuckas that's 'bout it
Mama couldn't control my destiny as a street thug
Find me in the Range Rover buyin, sellin street drugs
Even though, this ghetto got me crazy
Everytime I go to jail mama get me out cause I'm her baby

CHORUS (2X)

Verse 2: Snoop Dogg
I'ma gangsta, located in the alleys and Cali
Shoot dice wit' killas and smoke wit' the dealers
You can't tell me shit 'bout these streets homey
I don' seen it and done it and lived the real from the phony
Out for this money, homies maintain they composure
Since kids on the streets sellin' dope by the police
Now I'ma a soldier muthafucka for the chips
When I dips the trips, GP straight for DP
But the scripts how mama raised me 
Pops wasn't home, left us all alone
Wasn't no thang, cause my mama had game
She showed me everythang except how to be a man
I understand, for all the streets and the jail time I caught
The pain I brought, that wasn't what you taught
It's probably pops fault how I ended up
Gangbangin', crack slangin', not given' a fuck
Two strikes in my life, a nigga fed up
Mama said don't let up, and baby boy keep your head up

CHORUS (2X)

Verse 3:Soulja Slim
Now picture me a ghetto child, runnin' wild
Maybe if you emphasize, niggas supposed to pick us
The world wouldn't be like it is now
I made moms proud, when you mention me she smile
If feels good buyin' moms a car and a house
And my pops been locked up for ten years
Life was a struggle moms shed so many tears
That's why baby ain't got nothin' that I love so much
The only one can hurt my feelings, when she fuss
Momma I love you cause you brought me hear
But niggas startin' to hate and it's gettin' dark in here
But I remember what you told me, and what ya' showed me
Take it slowly

I be the same motherfucker ready to blow a nigga head off
Bury him, before he bury me
Become a memory, motherfuckers talkin' bout remember see
Nigga, is you crazy, I don't know what death is
The reaper don't fuck with a nigga like me, I'm a handle my biz
Like 4 more, I'm sick with it, you know what I'm sayin'
Don't play no games boy, you know see-Murder ain't playin'
I go to clubs, mean mug, ain't shit gon' happen
I'm a motherfuckin gangsta, niggaz know I ain't just rappin'
Can't stop a crazy motherfucker from doin' what he want to
I'm still facin' ten years on an open charge in California
So believe if you see me on the corner it really don't matter
And respect a real nigga, or watch your fuckin' brains scatter

Verse 2: [Soulja Slim]

Now see-Murder told you bitches don't play no games
And since I got a little paper bitch you think I changed?
? at all times respect my mind
I'd rather be caught with it than without it, I ain't lyin'
'cause soldier haters come in all shapes and sizes
They act like they your people wearin' them different disguises
You get a little baby and you get some fame
They be all in ya face just because of ya name
I'm worldwide, southside is what I claim
Uptown, magnolia, that's whose bringin' the pain
I'm gettin sick and tired, sick and tired of this shit
Life's a bitch, even when you bitch niggaz and hoes snitch
So tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do 
I run with real niggaz and trill niggaz that's bout it and TRU

Verse 3: [Magic]

It's Mr. Magic, I'm take my time, I'm a handle my business
Either thuggin or rappin, I refuse to leave a witness
Nigga, money don't make me, I make the money
And you niggaz don't scare me, that's why I ain't runnin
I was in the lower nine, its best you back up bitch
Kidnappers and killas y'all niggaz makin' me homesick
My mind is full of battle scars because I ball
And servin' time in the graveyard, times is hard
But my world still remains the same
Infested with anger, that's why I ride with probably one in the chamber
I'm with million dollar minded niggaz
Between the screen we worth more figures than the world got gravediggaz
We made niggaz, picture us for some years
Throwin a' finger to our foes, and givin' love to our friends

Somethin about the way I make moves, some think it the shoes And just,
Uh, mu'fuckas like to blame it on TRU
When I do, what I do, and talk that slang
Makin the hardest street niggaz askin me can they hang
Ain't no thang, but you must wear khakis or ?G-bose?
Neck touchin some gold, and fully don't love hoes
Blowin smoke out ya nose, keep a box of optimos
Hustlin so you can come up on the pearl, proper rose
Up in clubs, rock in clothes, big ballas have never seen
Keep their mind wanderin and steady servin fiends
In my jeans a 9 gat, jack, because of my rep
My other pocket full of money, givin me this funny step

Chorus 4x

[Soulja Slim]
I walk, high talk, Gs up and soldiers down
I used to bob and weave when I was on that doodoo brown
Face down on the ground, when Slim come around
Or I be forced to bring more noise than the Beats By The Pound
I just got out the pen, so I bounce when I walk
And say ya heard me, every time that I talk
4-4 boys I used to balk, but now I got a glock 40
I feel sorry for any nigga that wanna get naughty
I love fuckin up parties, watchin bitches like Charlie
Ask Magnolia Shorty, that's my people, she could call it
My mama told me I still walk the same way
Talk the same way, every since I was yay

Chorus 4x

[Fiend]
I ain't got to show it for nobody, you can see that I ball
3 months, fuck the walker, I was struttin 'fore I crawl
Before the old school even had the, ""Yes, yes, ya'll!""
I was spendin my uneven money on my family in the mall
Young Fiend, was the guard, I breaks rules with it
My ? got grooves with it, cause I packs tools with it
I simply acts a fool with it, roll, represent-a
Wear minks in the winter, Tank iced in the center
My step is the agenda, not only this voice
But they its bout my hips, naw they ain't havin my choice
Now the moral to the story is that I'm cold with it
Made a song about my stroll with it
If you was with it, can ya dig it?

Soldiers got some daily clout
Slangin in the dirty south
What we really worried about x2

[soulja slim]
(peep this shit) I know you heard about this nigga from the 3rd
Raw, then a uncut bird with bad tempers and bad nerves
Serve, dope to a dope fiend gotta get more cream
Than the rest of the dealers
Every nigga that I fuck with gotta be from killas
Fill up in this shit, that was ever smokin, you can catch me smokin
On some shit that will have me broken, (cough cough),
I'm so high, I can ride, barely need to slug some dealing
No optimos, no keep moving, fuck it, pass the feeling
Real niggas feel me, cause I'm bout as real as it get
Son or stranger, no love for that studio shit
All my little partners gone, I'll be damned if I g-o
But if I do I'll grab my gun shoot like and pull let em know

Chorus x2

You know I'm from the ghetto, hit the glock
And pop my shots clean up your block
Red beam, maintain my aim, bullet holes in your brain
When I stop that motherfucking clock, kane
Usual suspect, down south niggas bout respect
Choppin off slugs like a mailman in a corvette
Like the weed when I lower my tek
Niggas is seeking, pump down like bricks, in the trunk of the 626
Is something you hate cause your boy
Just got flipped, ak with a strong clip
In the hood I bust you with the tank,
In the pen I trust you with the shank
My mind go blank, I'm a soldier smokin dank
All the way to the motherfucking bank

Now what y'all mean, niggas on my team
They all about the cream
And my enemies, we take it to the street
To get the green, knowa mean
Came here with slim, mac and fiend
I still scream woah!
In the drop where my nigga walk
Runnin from the cop who was trying to meet his quota
I'm young and I'm black, I'm a soldier
So he thinking I'm slanging that baking soda
You ain't heard about, nigga from that dirty south
Where the po-po's scout
Everybody, everybody that knows what your bout
Won't leave your house
Cause at night, nigga freaks come out
Grab your gat with that extra clip cause if you catch us slippin
You might connect the grip
Shots there cut up strip bout a couple of ship
Like the peoples in summertime agent trip
Lets take a trip to the land where the niggas
Do the murderman dance on their enemies
And fake niggas pretend to be a, they be them friends of me
Woah, slow your roll and daddy I'm camoflauged
I'm psycho warden I stay on my guard and bitch I never die

Chorus x2

[fiend]
What the world don't know is I'm a hurt
A soldier without a pause
I'm prayin about cause, break jaws and all laws
My bullet scars didn't heal, my tatoos reveal
Bout to ride explain a million of hostile
The burn feels like almost a step from death
Fuck spending lives, I barely leave a minute of breath
I'm set, families with teks, release my stress in their chest
Wouldn't know where I'd be without my God and my vest
Killers, we the best fuck all the rest, here hit the cess
Snort, c'mon the test
With the charge the best, cause I open your chest
God bless, I made my way back so I can say that
Me too whatever, should have known that fiend believe in payback
Do it for haystacks, me, slim, twins, and mac
Gotta attack, with the jest to ask, deftly in the act
I doubt that, I'm strange cause I'm with the right change
After soldier consediration, I'm the live range

ain't no mothafucka like em
where he at, show em to me
and I'm gonna strike em and bite em
and swallow em, for trying to be a follower
my deadly venom instantly kills em like a cobra
leave it up to Magnolia
to shut em down and sober
popped off and tokin' em
break down and stick em and hold em up
and smoke it up with enemies
claim to be friends with me
the whole while they into me
when shit don't make sense to me
whodi got a bently, and whodi got a jag
whodi got a lot of shit that Soulja Slim never had

Look you knew what you was dealing with from day one

Its only been a few days and so you say
You love me in a married way, yeah okay
I've been several types of relationships
And I feel your true love don't make no sense
Its all on me if I want this thang to work out
I know your goal is to try trap me that what you heard bout
I ain't been home in a few days cause you be traveling
I let you get your mind right cause I ain't with the kicking and scratching
I'm on parole, I can't be riding for domestic violence so I stay my distance
When there two ways to beat the pussy up and I'm bout my business
If I gotta beatcha then I don't need ya, let the next man do it
You done ran me away from you now, how you gone prove it

Deep in your heart you know I'm a true player boy
But its cool I take that nigga I take my player charges
I don't know why you making me promise to come home to you
Yeah I come to fuck but that's bout the only thang I can do
You noticed how I put the truth in front of the player
The world revolves round cane and that's why I take it there
God forgive me but I swear I think I'll never change
And I'm still stuck on that old saying no pain no gain
What said me not to be explain decision ya understand
I'm a man, so I gots to keep the upper hand
You know what I'm saying

Putting that brod down player please don't feel played
She was uptown looking and got herself a true lover head
Your girl and all my hoes got my psyched up
Calling on caddy daddy just to get the right fuck
You best tighten up your game cause it hurting charlie
I pop a rodly feel my game tight than everybody
On the low you don't even know I got her pop it two
And that's just one of the thangs I know you couldn't make her do
It ain't nothing for me to take over a strong mind
Even Eve couldn't tell a bitch that love blind

And the police raided the spot then he flushed one and a half
And he ask you for one mo'
What should you do if you was in that position?

Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide

Nigga fuck that! I'm bout to send these niggaz life back

It's time for me to say my prayers, and hit the streets
Bullets about to hum, bitch niggaz gon' get numb
Here come ? ? down the block nigga don't try to run
I ain't lettin it slide I caught him slippin and him twice
Next thing you that nigga was on the ground, shakin like dice

These niggaz fail the test so neverthless I split yo' chest
Fuck the rest!
I come through to spit, to show you niggaz what I manifest
A y.g., so I breathe toke three, ? ?
Bullets at you busters please, don't try to test these
Pistol packin niggaz in our town

You can't feel what I feel cause this shit's to deep

Invest all your thoughts and all the times he hid

A lesson was learned when they put you in the grave
It don't matter what you got when a nigger gone get cha
Cause when a nigger gone hit ya a nigger gone hit ya
Bulletproof with ak's with hundred round drums
Can't stop one bullet penetrating your dome
That's why I value nothin but family and friends

You wanted No Limit so I brought the brigade 
I'm true to the game so I'm draped in tats 
The most valuable player because of my stats 
all the Platinum sales because I'm so gifted 
ya I used to slang I even shop lifted 
When I went to jail and went upstate 
I beat a charge cause my paper was straight 
I wanted a truck so I bought me a Nav 
an I wanted some pussy so I paid for the ass 
I got it made so they call me a made nigga 
If rap was dope I guess I'd be a drug dealer 
I got the feds all over my dealy

Don't think the money will change me I'm still down to click-click and 
blast something 
See I gots to get cash but I guess it be in time 
now see you gotta get yours I gotta get mine 
And when I get something for niggaz its the most popular kind 
And when I buy something that's for me nigga its top of the line 
Now nigga on the real I gots to fulfill my own dreams

Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin'

That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z

They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal

Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another.

'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath.

So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil

'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death?
