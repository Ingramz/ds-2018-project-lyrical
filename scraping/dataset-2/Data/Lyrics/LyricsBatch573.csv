Lamb,"There's so many things that we miss in our everyday lives
We're so busy hustling, bustling, chasing far-away dreams
We forget the little things
Like blue skies, green eyes, and our babies growing
Like rainbows, fresh snow, and the smell of summer
We forget to live

Give us eyes like children so we live each day as others
We're so sure we know so much that we forget to listen
Then we wonder fickle things
Like cheap thrills, fast fuel, and constant consumption
Like TV, CDs, and cars that speak our names
We forget to live

There's so many things that we miss in our everyday lives
We're so busy hustling, bustling, chasing far-away dreams
We forget the little things
Like blue skies, green eyes, and our babies growing
Like rainbows, fresh snow, and the smell of summer
We forget to live",Little Things,1999
Lamb,"Always and forever
We'll be free
Always and forever
Be with me

We'll have joys out numbered
We'll share perfect moments
You and me

Always and forever
You will see
Always and forever
Just be with me

We'll have love aplenty
We'll have joys out numbered
We'll share perfect moments

I'm so happy with you

Lamb,"One day I met a precious soul
Who's words would touch my heart
His poetry resounded so
It tore my soul apart

But when I tried my thoughts to speak
Emotion made my mind go weak
And time stood still for years and years
And bathed him in my tears

[Chorus]
I cry, I cry
Tears of joy, tears of pain
I cry, I cry
Tears of love again and again

Some people turn to pills and things
To help them through the day
To take them up or down or just
To ease the blues away

But me I really want to feel
The ups and downs of life so real
And feel sad emotions reign
My tears flow just the same

[Chorus: x2]

Gonna burn so completely I leave no trace
For so many out there would laugh in my face
For wearing emotion so close to the skin
Condemn me they might if love's such a sin

[Chorus: x2]",I Cry,2001
Lamb,"What kind of fool am i

That

What is, just is?
What is, just is?

You see I've been somewhere
Not far away, but such a different space

The bells started to ring
My soul to sing

Union so deep there is no unwinding

Even apart we are dreaming together

To see all the lights shining--they're so pretty
And think of the millions of lights going on
At this present moment
And those come and gone

[Chorus]
And it makes me float free
To feel how small my life must be
And it makes me float free
To feel how small my life must be

Whenever I can, I go down to the sea
And wonder at how many miles there must be
And all of the people on all of the shores
At this present moment
And those gone before

Sometimes I'm out in a bustling street
Dazzled by all of the faces I see

Caught in the trap of meeting
The laws of supply and reprimand

The pressure valve has been refitted
A lost plot in constant revision
A rising storm that's never abated

Too far gone now to reverse my course and be subjugated

Lambchop,"the clerk smiled as she saw the same nut pick up a personal size grocery basket and head down aisle two. she smiled because periodically this guy would return with a basket full of glade lock and hold room freshener and deodorizer. it's a deodorizer that works on the same principle as a bug bomb. simply push down on the button and it fills the room with a scented fog. the man would buy only about five or six cans at a time. he'd been coming in for about five weeks now. sometimes he would come in twice a week. he seemed like a normal guy. he was kind of balding in his mid thirties wearing a black leather jacket. and he was always so damn dusty something soft about his features. it looked like it was makeup but it was just dust. he paid with a twenty and said thank you and left. 

when the man returned home he took the glade from the worthless little plastic sack. he placed one on the rug, one on the end table, one on the window sill, one under the TV, and one on the air conditioner. this might seem unusual except for the fact that his entire apartment was just filled with them. every room on every surface. he figured he had about sixty of them in all--each one's nozzle poised at the ready. he sighed and opened a beer. he started to push down the lock and hold buttons on the canisters, slowly filling the room, working his way from the dining room into the den. each room filling with a multiscented fog: desert bloom, evergreen, misty rose, fresh lemon, regular and unscented, pot porrouri, wild oak, petulia, ocean mist, musk, hazel wood, irish nights, sandal wood, rain forest, country kitchen, natural prevention?, orange blossom, indian summer, and holiday candle. calmly he sat on the couch, spilt his beer, and closed his eyes.

Cause he wanted to smell 
What was left of the girl 
That stayed at his hotel 
Still the water was warm 
With the soap in his hand 
As he halted the process 
Just to stare at this man 
In the dark of his room 
Right after his nap 
He buried his face in her pillow 
Then he stared down at his lap 
A small circle of miracles 
Surrounded his head 
That ranged dark blue 
All the way to dark red 

And in honor of this new affair 
He bought some socks and some underwear 
He was feelin' so sporty and lookin' brand new 
To cover up his invisible tattoo 

The box on the carpet 
Matched the lines on his head 
As he was ready to sleep 
And he turns down the bed 
Removes all his clothes now 
Lays them on the floor 
Slips under the covers 
He hears her key in the door 
His eyes blink for a minute 
His lids open and close 
A cool warmth fills the room 
He feels her chest on his nose 
His brow brushes her navel 
His hand follows her hips 
His neck jerks on the pillow 
Feels the touch of her lips 

And in honor of this new affair 
He bought some socks and some underwear 
He was feelin' so sporty and lookin' brand new 
To cover up his invisible tattoo 

But not as good as this invisible tattoo

Hear the faucet dripping

He carefully begins to read 
The label on the toilet seat 
It's like warning of some kind

And his eyes roll back into his head

Lambretta,"Such a long time ago, I found you
In the street with your friends
Your friends were so strung out
And I was taken in by your false blue eyes
Your kiss feels like a drug, your touch feels like the sky

What am I supposed to do with someone as screwed up as you
What am I supposed to do, when my heart is stuck on you

Give me love
Give me all that you got
Take me, forget the drugs

Give me love
Give me love
Take me, forget the drugs

I wanna come around today, but something is in my way
I'm scared to be there, I don't know what I might see
Demons make a fool of you, I know what you're going through
But the night won't be long, tomorrow they'll be gone

So what am I supposed to do with someone as lost as you
So what am I supposed to do when my heart is stuck on you

Give me love...

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,

To tell my story

If there's somebody you want bad enough
You won't mind pushing aside your pride
Cause whatever's needed to get over
You shoot your best shot
Give it all you got

It all depends on how much
You want it and how bad
Cause it definitely can be had
That's why I don't mind begging
Oh, yeah, for my lady

Now I want you all to sing along with me
Maybe my baby will feel sorry for me
And come on back home, right here

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

Havin' fallen from a few good graces
So many sandy years, dusted and wasted
How, from there did I get here?

I wanna be east of anywhere
Take me out of the everywhere into the here

Sweet space to satisfy me

Alone on the front line of life with no foundation
Return to my train of thought but I miss the station
Wake up every morning heading for yesterday
How do I make all my troubles go far away?

I wanna go east of anywhere
Take me out of the everywhere into the here
Sublime to ride, reside up high in wide-open big sky country

The more that it changes, the more it stays the same

You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar
But baby, nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down

I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?

Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Feels like, feels like, you know, it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know, it feels like
Falling in love

And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love

With thoughts of murder and carnage

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love

For all the things they paid you for, my love

With out flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
Don't know why
Now where do we go

Hot wind moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins while we put his wing together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky

Lana Lane,"I'm woven in a fantasy, I can't believe the things I see
The path that I have chosen now has led me to a wall
And with each passing day I feel a little more like something dear was lost
It rises now before me, a dark and silent barrier between
All I am and all that I would ever want to be
It's just a travesty, towering, marking off the boundaries 
My spirit would erase

To pass beyond is what I seek, I fear that I may be too weak
And those are few who've seen it through to glimplse the other side
The promised land is waiting like a maiden that is soon to be a bride
The moment is a masterpiece, the weight of indecision's in the air
It's standing there, the symbol and the sum of all that's me
It's just a travesty, towering, blocking out the light and blinding me
I want to see

Gold and diamonds cast a spell, it's not for me to know it well
The treasures that I seek are waiting on the other side
There's more that I can measure in the treasure of the love that I can find
And though it's always been with me
I must tear down the wall let it be
All I am, and all that I was ever meant to be, in harmony
Shining true and smiling back at all who wait to cross
There is no loss",The Wall,2003

Your eyes could tell no lies
So your life became a compromise
And it was you
Who had seen men dyin'
You heard their children cryin'
While their women weep in silence

And you who thought
You were so wise
Succeeded only in disguise
Now and then
You'd find a bridge to cross

Reach the other side
And you'd still be lost
Evaded by the sweet smell of life

To show the way

Am Ende des Tunnels und wenn es dann da ist
Verzieh' ich keine Mine, auch wenn's hart wird
Für die Familie und Freunde, seid nicht enttäuscht
Eigentlich leb' ich seit Jahren nur für euch
Doch man kommt an 'nen Punkt an, an dem man sagt
„Ich bin eigentlich gesund, man, doch an sich am Arsch.”
Durch Schicksal und Karma
Sprech' ich seit Jahren mit dem Blick zum Grab
Geknickt mit mei'm Vater und frag ihn
„Was hat der Scheiß uns gebracht, man?""
Zwei Söhne, die es bis heut' zu nichts gebracht haben
Ich puffe und der Joint wird zu Asche
Hab bis heut' nichts bereut, was ich machte
Hab Freunde betrogen und 'n paar auch verloren
Frauen verarscht und bin verarscht worden
Ey, ich hab Groupies gefickt, Doubies gekifft
Und will seit fünf Jahren von mei'm Bruder nix wissen
Letztendlich hätt' ich allerhand voll zu reden
Doch füll' mein Album nicht mit privaten Problemen

Mein Leben ist Girls, Kush, Cash für die Medien
Weil ich mit den' über nichts and'res reden will
Sollte es auch nicht ankommen, gebe ich kein' Fick
Sterb' noch vor 30, das weiß ich
Ich ziehe die Fäden, spiel' mit den Medien
Red' nicht mit ihnen über Probleme

Was ich gut find', findet er gut, wenn
Wir uns auf meiner Show dann begegnen
Erste Reihe, derbe am Feiern, denn seit der Selfish EP
Hat er endlich 'n Selbstwertgefühl
Sagt, keine Bitch hat ihn überhaupt nur verdient
Denn wenn er was liebt, dann höchstens das Weed
Weed, Weed, und er zieht bis zum geht nicht
Mehr, zieht immer mehr, sein Kopf dreht sich
Wer mich nicht kennt lernt mich jetzt durch ihn kenn'

Tickets für's Lance Konzert endlich bekommen
Ey, beste!

Stell dir vor der raucht danach noch einen mit uns
Boah, bäm

Sie trägt Comme des Fuckdown aber nicht wegen A$AP
Kauft jeden Scheiß den sie bei mir gesehen hat
Nach, übersteht den Tag ganz nur noch mit Gras
Sie macht es nicht durch mich, sagt sie
Doch wir wissen es besser
Verpeste ein ganzes Land mit Desinteresse
Und das nur durch die Texte, rotz' ihn's hin und sie fressen's
Frag nach ihrem Lieblingsact, sie sagt „Lance Butters, beste.”
Egal, was man fragt, sie antwortet in Sätzen
Aus meinen Tracks die sie niemals vergisst
Ey, des ist, ey, des ist, wie sie spricht
Sie ist an sich keine Bitch, aber für so 'n Fick
Nach diesem Gig, da spricht nichts, und so sitzt sie
Wieder da mit dem Blick aus dem Fenster
Wenn die Snare klatscht, geht es „Lance Butters, hands up”

Beweg' mich hin zu mei'm Bro, vielleicht geht was
Von mir aus auch nur 'n bisschen für später

Und du denkst, es ist nur Image, all diese Ignoranz, ich bitte dich
Lehnte Festivals ab, für die du nicht mal Tickets kriegst
Sag, wie's ist, da das Splash so wenig Scheine gibt
Bringen mich keine zehn Pferde mehr nach Gräfenhainichen

Yeah, sie rufen Mörder auf den Streets, wir
Begraben ein paar Körper unter Beats, yeah
Bist am Haten, doch ich schwöre, dass du's liebst
Was für Beef? Das ist höchstens Ironie

Lance und ich für die Szene 'ne Gefahr
Schon seit Jahren, schon seit Jahren, yeah

Und meine Groupies wollen mich immer noch
Auch wenn ich nur alle Jahre irgendwie was hinbekomm'
Deine ziehen weiter, noch bevor 'ne neue Single droppt
Für sie warst du nur ein Lückenfüller in 'nem Winterloch
Yeah, fick dich doch, hab' das hier so hingerotzt
Kille jeden von euch dennoch easy, Mann, ihr wisst es doch
Hab' damals dumm in einen Schrank reingerappt
Und schon mehr entfacht als du trotz all der Anstrengungen, yeah
Gebt mir mal alle keine Cosigns (niemals)
Bitte, denn ich glaub' nicht, dass ihr dope seid
Glaub' nicht, dass es passen würde, wenn wir 'nen Track machen würden
Wenn hätt' ich den Part, den alle lieben, und du den, den alle hassen würden

Yeah, sie rufen Mörder auf den Streets, wir

Schon seit Jahren, schon seit Jahren, yeah

Ihr seid so talentiert wie Bülent Ceylan lustig ist
Dass er Hallen füllt, ist auch das Einzige, was lustig ist
Dass ihr Hallen füllt, ist also gar nicht mal verwunderlich
Scheinbar kann man jeden Mist hier unterbringen
Denn ist einer scheiße, ist auch noch Platz für 'n zweiten
Bild dir nichts ein, läuft so die ganze Zeit
Was für Style? Wovon reden wir hier bitte?
Du hast Style in einer Szene, die sich gegenseitig nichts schenkt
Erzählen nur Geschichten, Hauptsache, es verkauft sich
Die Sachen, die du aussprichst, du glaubst dir die Kacke doch auch nicht
Doch, ne, ich muss euch nicht bekehren
Ahzumjot und Lance, alle schwimmen hinterher, hinterher

Play this record
Bruder, ist dein Ernst oder was?
Bruder, zeig mir deinen Lieblingstrack
Ich schwör', der ist wack, Alter

Ja, die Scheiße kommt gut an, ja
Doch wie viel Kopf ist da für euern Anklang?
Hab' keinen Bock mehr zu rappen
Ich schwör, ich hab' keinen Kopf mehr für Rap
Auch wenn ich damit einst ein Ziel gehabt hab'
Quittier' ich dis, lass da „Free Lance Butters”
Leg' keinen Fokus mehr auf stylische
Betonungen, wenn ich einrappe
Ist doch egal, wie geil eine Line in 'nem Track ist
Solange es immer noch Deutschrap ist
Privat stapeln sich Probleme zur Decke
Denn viel blieb durch diesen Mist auf der Strecke
Hab' wenig zu essen, hab' nur noch paar Reste
Muss die Monatsmiete noch bezahlen vom letzten
Nicht mehr versichert seit keinen Plan, Mann, vergessen
Wo bitte bleibt da noch Kopf für das Rap-Ding?
Denn der Scheiß bringt kein Zaster
Wenn man es macht, wie ich's mach'
Mann, sag, wie können die sich noch im Spiegel betrachten?
Die kopieren die Stile, eins zu eins von andern
Und ich bin nicht kreditwürdig bei meiner Bank, Mann
Ich schlafe nachts ein und hab' Angst, dass mein Tag dann
Morgens beginnt mit 'nem Schreiben vom Anwalt
Weil mich der Staat schon wieder mal anklagt
Sag, wie viel Kopf ist da für euern Anklang, heh?",Gefahr/Jm,

I don't even have to tell you that these are hard times
The world is changing
People don't have jobs and those that do
Are scared they're gonna lose 'em
The air is polluted, our food is full of poison
And all we do is stare at our phones waiting for a message
Anything to distract us, literally anything
These are hard times, hell
Even that's an understatement, it's insanity
It's like nobody knows what's true anymore
And it's like nobody cares
We live in our bubbles and feed on each other's lies

Tägliches Karma für Scheiße, die ich so getan hab'

Als ich noch mit Bongrauchen klar kam
Wohl etwas asi am Start, heh
Jaja, ich weiß, dass jeder seines Glückes Schmied ist

Sofort scheitert, ich weiß das, gab auch 'ne Zeit
Da waren Freundschaften krass rar, bin heut noch auf Abstand

Bin ich heute sowas von am Arsch, Mann
Ja, denn ich spar' zwar, doch was bleibt, ist nada
Ja, war klar, scheinbar muss ich diese Dinge heut noch ausbaden
Hab' damals Leute verarscht und bezahl's grad
Doppelt und dreifach als würd' das nicht reichen
Hab' alte Schulkameraden, die heiraten
Die haben Leihwagen und ich hab' rein gar nichts
Muss vielleicht auch nur auf meine Zeit warten
Solang zieh' ich den Mist an, als wär's 'ne scheiß Gabe
Echt Wahnsinn, mir bleibt bald schon nichts mehr
Es nimmt keine, nimmt keine Rücksicht

Hier drin werd' ich verenden
Ein bisschen zu sein wie ich
Hat noch kei'm geschadet, doch seid gewarnt

Ich gab ihnen all die Jahre nur das Stumpfste von mir
Doch Stufe für Stufe wird's jetzt dunkler um sie
Message lief auf Repeat, ja, auf jedem Release
Ich bin besser als die, haben jetzt alle kapiert
Doch was kommt jetzt dran? Ich mein', was kommt als nächstes?
Habt ihr euch nie gefragt, wofür mein gottverdammtes Herz schlägt?
Wieso ich so bin, wie ich bin mittlerweile
Und innerlich inzwischen nur hier unten verweile
Denn Blaow war die Wohnung, für euch alles so wie gewohnt
Und jetzt sehen sie meinen Keller, er ist kahl und vermodert
Hab' keine Idole, blick' zu keinem nach oben
Soll mich der Teufel doch holen
Ist doch so oder so keine Rettung hier in Sicht
Die Menschheit ist gefickt, lehn dich besser schnell zurück
Und wart ab, hab's gesagt, wenn dein Plan nicht wirklich aufgeht
Kannst du dich entspannt mit mir hier unten einfach ausleben, auf jeden

Na, gefällt euch mein Keller?
Merkt ihr, wie er euch verändert?
Nur ein klein wenig sein wie ich wird nicht reichen
Leg dein bisschen selbst noch zur Seite

Dann mach's dir bequem, hier ist es kalt und leer
Doch da oben gab uns auch keiner Wärme
Wirst da nichts verpassen, also lern es zu hassen
Seit ich mit den' abgeschlossen hab', läuft's fantastisch
Und wolltest du nicht sein wie ich, heh?
Bist dir anscheinend nicht mehr sicher oder warum zweifelst du mich an?
Will kein bisschen lästern, doch die sind das Letzte
Ich schwör', die sind nicht glücklich, die wissen's nur nicht besser
Ich schwör', die exisiteren nur durch einfache Werte
Kein Einziger, der von Wert ist
Posten dummes Zeug da in sozialen Medien
Und glauben allen Ernstes, dass sie irgendwas bewegen
Als würde irgendjemand einen Scheiß auf uns geben

Aber gut, behandelt mich wie eine Ikone

Gebt mir den Preis und ich steh' dann da oben

Sicher ja, wenn man Bock hat, auf 'ner Bühne zu stehen
Kann mich nicht dazu zählen, ich meide Konzerte
Rauf, durchziehen, dann wieder rein in die Wärme
Brauch' keine Nähe oder Liebe oder sonst was
Brauch' etwas Ferne und mein Weed, ja, Mann, sonst passt's
Frag meine Bruhs, denn die sagen's dir
Bin der Letzte, den es juckt, wenn es gar nichts wird
Bin der Letzte, den es juckt, denn was zählt
Ist das Geld auf dem Konto und das fehlt trotz des Fames

Abhaken, bevor ich für immer verschwinde

Für buckeln und buckeln und buckeln
Und abends nachhaus kommen, auf gar nichts mehr Lust haben
Auf nur noch Routine, Arbeit wurd' Musik
Ja, ich zog dieses Los und bekam eine Niete
Hab' mies verdient, dann kam Jahre, die nicht liefen
Und jetzt steh' ich schlechter da als vor meinen ersten EPs
Verlor Energie von Release zu Release

Wie soll ich mich zurücklehnen, wenn ich Stress hab'?
Jaja, in paar Jahren wird's besser

Und jetzt schau mich an, ich bin komplett am Arsch
Hab' ich nicht auch gesagt, dass ich klüger als die alle bin?

Ich verfluche meinen, ich sag's jeden Tag, doch
Ich hass', dass er nicht klar kommt
Dass er sich nicht meldet und wenn, will er Geld haben
Warst sieben Jahre fort, dann eins da, jetzt wieder weg, heh?
Wegen dir kann oft nicht pennen, hast du dran gedacht, Mann
Dass sich ständig fragt, was bei dir nur falsch gemacht hat?
Ist dir wohl alles scheißegal
Doch nicht nur dir ist die ganze Kacke damals widerfahren
Auch ich verlor' unsern
Erinner' mich an diesen Tag, als man mich abholte von der Arbeit
Ich denk' an die Fahrt, wie ich's da schon geahnt hab'
Doch muss dein dich jetzt wirklich verarzten?

Und hab' daran noch nicht mal Interesse
Als wär' das eine Challenge, die zerstören sich doch von selbst
Oder glauben sie, ihr Scheiß bleibt ewig in den Trends? (huh)
Mann, es reißt mich nicht hin dazu
Leute zu erwähnen, schon deren Interviews
Ich weiß nicht, ob's der Hype ist, doch
Sie erzählen nichts Eigenes, komplette Scheiße
Ich lass' mir einfach auch Texte schreiben
Aber nicht dafür, dass ich reich bin
Nicht, dass ich 'ne gute Zeit auf Gigs hab' mit den Wichsern
Sondern, dass ich noch mehr Zeit für nix hab' (aber no way)
Bin nur nicht so scharf auf die Massen
Alles schon gesagt, lass mal paffen
Lass mal lieber pennen oder zocken

Bin abgefuckt auf alles, diese Gegend, dieser scheiß Staat
Zwölf Wochen lang kein Friseur, ich führ' das Leben eines Asozialen
Wohnung ist zwar sauber, aber fast nix Bares
Alles so wie damals noch nach Jahren
Und gehe auch sicher abgefuckt ins Grab
Habe lang' schon keinen Spaß
Ja, meine Zukunft bereitet mir Kummer
Doch bin in GTA 'ne große Nummer
Komm, besuch mich in mei'm Bunker
Ich tauch' ab und an mal unter
Geh' nicht gerne raus, da ist es laut und alle lungern
Hab' Probleme zuhauf, die meisten regel' ich auch
Doch lieber zöger' ich sie raus und reg' mich ewig drüber auf

Hab' von Montag bis Sonntag keinen Bock, Mann
Hak' die Woche ab und erleb' sie dann gleich nochmal
Handy Nicht-Stören-Modus ist vierundzwanzig Stunden drin
Damit ich ab und an am Tag auch einfach nur mal für mich bin
Denn ich hass' den Sommer, jeder will rausgehen und was machen
Winter hass' ich auch, da will immer jeder bei mir abhängen
Ich schwör', kippt noch jemand sein Getränk auf meine Sachen
Rast' ich aus, so wie Joe Budden da bei Everyday Struggle
(„Does it look like I'm left off 'Bad and Boujee'?“)
Ja, mein ganzes Leben ist ein Hustle
Kann man nicht verstehen, wenn man es so wie ihr betrachtet
Denn für euch ist stets das eine falsch, das andre richtig
Für mich ist es in erster Linie beides gleich beschissen

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1992
Lance Hayward,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1992
Lance Larson,"About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen

So l asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and i soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

Well I get into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man

When a man is on the bottom he may not cry for help.
But he needs to know he's not alone in hell all by himself.

There will come a day

I won?t fall apart at the mention of your name

My tears will all be washed away

I hope and pray

There will come a day


There will come a time

I?ll smile when you cross my mind

Regrets will all be left behind

I?ll be fine

There will come a time


With memories as strong as this

How can my fragile heart resist

Drifting through the way we were back then

But as long as I keep holding on

To someone who?s already gone

How can the healing begin?


As long as there?s a breath in me

Apart of you will always be

The way the losing you still hurts

Somewhere near the center of my soul

I hope my humble prayer will work

Make half a man Once again feel whole


There will come a love

I hope its half as sweet as ours was

With a little help from up above

I could love again

But until then

I hope and pray

There will come a day

And on days like this
I could take apart my window
So let down, I been so let down

How deep is the hole I feel I'm in?
Seen a lot of lights and done a lot with it

In the least of the lighted
Eyes was on a roll
And the deep and the sweet hearth
Couldn't keep the word in you
You can draw it in and draw it back
Pull the best behind you
You wanna leave I got it back
You can draw it in a draw it back

How deep is this hole I feel I'm in?
Seen a lot of lights and done a lot with them
How deep is this soul I feel I'm in?
Seen a lot of lights and done a lot with them

Lately little love could call
And get in my way
Maybe we could draw this out
Of our dark display

How deep is this soul I feel I'm in?
Seen a lot of lights and done a lot within
How deep is this hole I feel I'm in?

It could happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh while your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or it's on its way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart, heart

Het land waar ik blijf, vind het er heerlijk
Eerlijk

Ik kom uit het land waar je door heen rijdt in drie uurtjes
Met een ander dialect elke tien minuutjes
Kom uit het land waar op papier een plek voor iedereen is
En XTC, export nummer 1 is
Kom uit het land waar Andre Hazes over honderd jaar in elk café nog steeds de baas is 
Kom uit het land waar Peter Gert-Jan Raymond en Junte 
Frans Bart en Ali de game runnen
Kom uit het land waar hiphop een kind van dertig is
En je mag zelf in gaan vullen hoe vet dat is
Het land waar als je rijk wordt je zoveel inlevert
En dat je bij jezelf denkt, hoeveel zin heeft het?
Het land waar prostitutie en blowen mag
Het land van sinterklaas en koninginnedag
Dit is het land waar ik verloren heb, bedrogen ben
Kom uit het land waar ik geboren en getogen ben

Kom uit het land met de meeste culturen per vierkante meter
Maar men is bang om bij de buren te gaan eten
En integratie is een schitterend woord
Maar shit is fucking bitter wanneer niemand het hoort
Ik deel mijn land met Turken en Marokanen, Antilianen, Molukkers en Surinamers
Het land waar we samen veels te veel opkroppen
En wereldwijd gerepresent zijn door Harry Potter
Het land waar apartheid, internationaal 
Het meest bekende woord is uit de Nederlandse taal
Kom uit het land dat tikt als een tijdbom
Het land dat eet om zes uur en ook nog eens op tijd komt

Lannie Garrett,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds just wandering by,
Where do they go? oh I don't know, don't know;
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes,
Stories of love belong to you and to me.

Oh, dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, oh my dindi.
Oh dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing dindi, happy dindi, when you're with me.

I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do;
I'd let you go away, if you take me with you.

Don't you know, dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river that
Can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.
Can't find the sea that would be me without you dindi.

Like a river that can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines 
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line 
Oh-oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run 

Yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend 
I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
And strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
Oh-oh, will you walk with me out on the wire 
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe, I want to know if love is real 

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight 
In an everlasting kiss 

One two three four!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
Everybody's out on the run tonight 
But there's no place left to hide 
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness 
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
Oh-oh, someday girl I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place 
Where we really wanna go 
And we'll walk in the sun 
But till then tramps like us 
Baby we were born to run

Knowledge
the highest level of understanding
wisdom must come forth
Yo Laquan, speak

[ VERSE 1: Laquan ]
Keepin in tact cause I express myself on wax
Read between the lines as I state the facts
The fact is known, you gotta be strong to live long
And know the difference from right and wrong
What's done in the dark will soon shine in the light
You're provin em right by suckin the pipe, stereotype
Media hype is killing me
Why must my brothers steal from me?
Woman is queen, she feeds what you need at birth
Research of self, develops your mental health
Man is king, lead the route
But some sell out and find a quick way out
By selling poison to another
Poison for pay rotts the brain away
Caught in the devil's trap
Some call it dope, some call it crack
Call it what you want, it doesn't matter what the name is
The effect is still the same
Your life goes down the drain in constant pain
For a $20 plane ride
Comin from inside of me - truth
You can hide from me, you can't hide from facts, black
Sorry if I've blown your cover
I must tell it like it is, brother to brother

(Alright)
Brother to brother

[ VERSE 2: Laquan ]
Open your third eye, vision a clear sight
As we take a flight into the life of parasites
Some will feed and never give, that's pure greed
Climbin, climbin but I'm constantly pulled back
Is it the wrong steps or is it because I'm black?
We're alkin in circles pacin the same track
Never will win a war with someone else
We're havin this devilish war within ourselves
Brothers and sisters, you are the listeners
The react is the track will attack like a maniac
If in your blackness, teach your brother practice
Black awareness, don't be scared of this
I'm on a mission to fix up the mixed up
Constantly strivin is the way I'm survivin
The sermon is written to better the way you're livin
Speakin of livin - I'm livin positive
I'm on a quest to redeem your self-esteeem
Rehabilitate those who lost faith
This here lesson is leavin a reflection
On the young to grow to be strong ones
A weak mind is brainwashed easily

On the minor set-backs, follow the right tracks
Caged in a false educational system
The government's on my back because I dissed em
With a middle finger and a balled fist
Hidin the truth and feedin us bullshit

Scopin my gold rope but don't attempt to grab
Watch your step, keep a civilized head
The truth is said to awaken the brain-dead
Why intercept me from a positive destiny
Music, music, my important necessity
God bless me and those who test me
Help those that I'm down with and let the rest be
Stuck in a black hole and yes, I withhold
A key so you can see me in poetry motion
Steadily coastin to a lyrical plot that puts a knot in my pocket
Now let's bear witness to the sight of the no-good
Minds are molded, and flooded with falsehood
Too much TV, you're brainwashed by Hollywood
I speak truth, so let it be understood
You want peace, boy, you have to show some
Some cry for peace and still carry a gun
I understand, get or get got, shoot or get shot
That's not to way to go
Well, I'ma chill back and stay out of crack and stay low

The set is not done yet, some have learned but I bet
Some will twist the truth and rebuke the positive groups
Who prophecize and open eyes of the blind
Use words like tide to clean dirt from your mind
Often I practice cause practice makes perfect
You disagree with that? Yo, I feel it's worth it
I can't hold back, yo, I must expose the fact
Truth is hidden, self-knowledge you lack
Let words slam, back-track, check the diagram
When Spanky flex he creates the side-effects
Set my course, proceed to speak with force
Grab the sourc and take lyrical intercourse

Watch your back, you never know who's a backstabber
You're now a slave, feel the force of my soundwave
As the vibes flow

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
As I hit my conclusion you find it amusin
How I drift to the rhymthm of the samples I'm usin
Status is proven by the fact that you're movin
Words flow rapidly, melody soothin
One never prospers from a negative thought
You might win in the begin, but lose in the end
Suckers being drugged into my lyrical pit
Brains are lit, they throw a fit but still they sit
Alone in my death dome scared of my voice tone
Step in my path, you're just entered war zone
Now how can you quiz me if you don't know the answer
The effect from my dialect is somewhat cancer
Slow death, you lose breath as I rip what's left
of your flesh and let God save the rest
So if you didn't know, now you know
To chill back when I go and let the vibes flow

It's like pumpin in my ear drums
Yeah, the vibe's pumpin in my ear drums

How could a nation grow without its roots
For the land is the tree and we're the fruit
Awareness of black pride is kept aside
It's time the mentally dead revise alive
Pyramids prove we were first in existence
Change our conditions and rise with persistence
Position is fightening, words are enlightening
For those who can't see the light of G-o-d

Drift to the music but don't miss the message
I'm droppin, your job's to catch it
Stop harrassin, we're not assassins
I'm just a vocalist far from Charles Manson
Brothers livin foul, they're actin like juveniles
They're goin a mile, man, they need to calm down
Speakin my theory as the crowd get near me
Yo, turn up the mic so they can hear me clearly
Then I be set
Yo Eric, how you feel about that? (Cool) Bet
Paintin a picture, learn from the scripture
TKO once the bass hits ya
Wounded by the lyrics, kicked by the bass
Peace to Style One, Deja, Mark and Tase
Cool, calm, almighty Laquan
I'm a menace to society and heavily armed
I'm a soloist, one DJ and a gun
Two heads are better than one
Peep out this misfit, it's dope, isn't it?
Get close to your speaker and witness the drift

Witness the drift

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
Calm, swift is how the vocal tone is thrown
As I let it be know that the blind will roam
In the dark as I spark and set a mark in this art
For a cause, save the applaus for last 
As I blast and strive at a task
At a slow pace cause haste make waste
Most of you want to do what I do
State facts on wax and make a million too
As I thrust this style style of speak
You're hypnotized as sound waves seep
Deep within and I'm gonna send you
Words that alternate at a constant rate
Picture yourself trapped in a cage
Your mind is in rage, you wake up, it's a stage
You think it's a dream, but you're still a prisoner
Cause I cook shrimps as if I was Sizzler
Here is the movement, work for improvement
Join hand in hand, back to the Motherland
It doesn't matter what your shade is
We need to set it straight, he think the land is his
I'm not taxin, stop ridin my tip
A smooth coaster, I don't flip, trip
Step tot his, as your spirit uplifts
Become a part of this, witness the drift

Witness the drift",Witness the Drift,1990
