Michelle Branch,"Well you sold my heart 
And I'll get it back 
But look me in the eye, baby 
Tell me why you love me like that 
Why you love me like that 

Well I've walked this world 
Thought time's no more 
And after all this walking 
They've still got me crawling on the floor 
Crawling on the floor 

And out of this world 
Keeps on turning 
Keeps me yearning 

How can you turn and walk away? 
Pretending everything's okay 
How can you turn your back? 
Tell me why you love me like that 
Why you love me like that 

Well I find you sad 
But I shatter like broken glass 
But I thought we would be different, baby 
Yeah, I thought we would last 
Yeah, I thought we would last 

And out of this world 
Keeps on standing 
Every minute that you're in me 

How can you turn and walk away 
Pretending everything's okay 
How can you turn your back 
Tell me why you love me like that 
Why you love me like that 

I might not believe me baby 
Don't lead me on 
With loving like yours 
Believe me I'm better off, 
I'm better off alone 

Well I was your gypsy 
Throwing diamonds at your feet 
Drifted around you like a satellite 
I gave you everything you need 
Everything you need 

I know this world keeps on turning 
Keeps me yearning and yearning 

How can you turn and walk away 
Pretending everything's okay 
How can you turn your back 
Tell me why you love me like that 
Why you 
How can you just break away 
Why can't you find the words to say 
Love is something you can't forget 
Tell me why you love me like that 
Why you love me like that 

How can you throw us away 
Look at what you lost today 
Now everything's a shade of gray 
Now you're pushing me away 
Say all the things you need to say 
Thought we were going all the way 
Play all the games you want to play 
Sooner we'll stay away",Love Me Like That,2003
Michelle Branch,"I didn't notice
But I didn't care
I tried being honest
But that lead me nowhere
I watched the station
Saw the bus pulling through
And I don't mind saying 
A part of me left with you

[Chorus]
One of these days
I won't be afraid of staying with you
I hope and I pray
Waiting to find a way back to you
'cause that's where I'm home

Did I make you nervous?
Did I ask for too much
Was I not deserving one second of your touch?

[Chorus]

What would you do if I could have you?
Oh if I could
I'd let you feel everything I'm thinking
Wouldn't that be nice?
One of these days
I won't be afraid of staying with you",One of These Days,2003
Michelle Branch,"I remember stormy weather
The way the sky looks when it's cold
And you were with me
Content with walking
So unaware of the worlds

Please don't drive me home tonight
'cause I don't want to feel alone
Please don't drive me home tonight
'cause I don't want to go
Tuesday morning
In the dark
I was finding out
Who you are

I took your picture
While you were sleeping
And then I paced around the room
If I had known then
That these things happen
Would they have happened with you?

Please don't drive me home tonight
'cause I don't want to feel alone
Please don't drive me home tonight
'cause I don't want to go
Tuesday morning
In the dark
I was finding out
Who you are

And if you turned around to see me and I was gone
You should have looked outside your window
'cause the sun was coming up

Please don't drive me home tonight
'cause I don't want to feel alone

Tuesday morning
In the dark
We were finding out
Who we are
Tuesday morning
In the dark
We were finding out
Who we are",Tuesday Morning,2003
Michelle Branch,"Maybe I'll be better on my own 
Nobody ever seems to understand me 
It's easier for me to be alone 
Until a piece of me that feels so empty 
I've been all over the world 
I've seen a million different places 
But through the crowds and all the faces 
I'm still out there looking for you 

Where are you now? 
I'm trying to get back 
With never ever knowing at all 
What is the chance 
Of finding you out there 
Until I have to wait forever 

I write about the things I'll never known 
And I find a moment to slow down 
Makes me think I'll never have the chance 
To figure out, to figure out 
What it's all about, what it's all about 
So tell me, tell me 
What it's all about 

Cause 
Where are you now? 
I'm trying to get by 
With never ever knowing at all 
What is the chance 
Of finding you out there 
Until I have to wait forever 

Where are you now? 
I'm trying to get by 
With never ever knowing at all 
And I still don't know 

Where are you now? 
I'm trying to get by 
With never ever knowing at all 
What is the chance? 
Of finding you out there 
Until I have to wait 
Until I have to wait forever",Where Are You Now?,2003
Michelle Branch,"I wanted to be like you
I wanted everything
So I tried to be like you
And I got swept away

I didn't know that it was so cold
And you needed someone
To show you the way
So I took your hand and we figured out
That when the time comes
I'd take you away

If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted
Was somebody who cares

I'm sinking slowly
So hurry hold me
Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on
Please can you tell me
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone

If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted
Was somebody who cares

All you wanted was somebody who cares
If you need me you know I'll be there
Oh, yeah

If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted
Was somebody who cares

If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted
Was somebody who cares

Please can you tell me
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone",All You Wanted [Instrumental],2003
Michelle Branch,"Tell me
Just what you want me to be
One kiss
And boom you're the only one for me
So please tell me
Why don't you come around no more?
Cause right now
I'm crying outside the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm telling you my babe
It's all in the game of?

Love is
Whatever you make it to be
Sunshine
Instead of this cold lonely sea
So please baby
Try and use me for what I'm good for
It ain't saying goodbye
It's knocking down the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm telling you my babe
It's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love

You roll me
Control me
Console me
Please hold me
You guide me
Divide me
Into me
 
So please tell me
Why don't you come around no more?
Cause right now 
I'm dying outside the door of your loving store

I'm out here on my own
On my own",Game of Love [Instrumental],2003
Michelle Branch,"Strange, how you stopped loving me
How you stopped needing me
When she came along
Oh, how strange

Strange, you changed like night and day
Just up and walked away
When she came along
Oh, how strange

Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring

Strange, you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange

Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring

Strange, you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange

How strange, how strange
How strange, how strange
How strange, how strange
How strange, how strange

",Strange,2003
Michelle Branch,"Sometimes I imagine a world without you
But most times I'm just so happy that I ever found you
It's a complicated web
That you weave inside my head
So much pleasure with such pain
I hope we always always stay the same

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my, life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

You go and then I can finally breathe in
'Cause, baby, I know in the end you'll never leave it
Well, we're rarely ever sane
I drive you crazy and you do the same
But your fire fills my soul
And it warms me up like no one knows

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my, life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my, life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

I'm feeling the way that you cross my mind
And the way that you save me in the knick of time
Oh, I'm feeling the way when you walk on back
I feel light, I feel love, I feel butterflies",I'm Feeling You,2005
Michelle Branch,"It doesn't matter how far apart we are now
You can add up all the miles in between
If you take a good look all around now
All you see is you and me

When I look at myself in the mirror
I see you standing there smiling at me
And I'm right back at the beginning
Lost inside this memory
I won't ever let go, all that I want to hold onto

And we belong together
Like the moon and stars in the midnight
And we'll be strong forever
'Cause we belong together
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Doesn't matter how long that it takes you
Cause I'll always be right by your side
And even when darkness awaits you
I'll be there to be your light
It's a hard lonely road
When you're standing outside in the cold hoping

And we belong together
Like the moon and stars in the midnight
And we'll be strong forever
Cause we belong together
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Sometimes it's hard to learn to let go, whoa
Life always knows the right moment
To show you what you made of

And we belong together
Like the moon and stars in the midnight
And we belong together
Like the moon and stars in the midnight
And we'll be strong forever
Cause we belong together

And we belong together
Like the moon and stars in the midnight
And we'll be strong forever
Cause we belong together
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, oh",Together,2008
Michelle Branch,"Goodnight big moon
Sweet dreams, baby
If I could have one wish tonight
It would be that you'll always keep
Keep the starlight in your eyes
One day you'll grow up
One day you'll walk out
In this big world on your own

And there will be days when
Your heart'll break in
Swear that all your strength is gone
But then you'll find a way to carry on

Heaven knows that it's a crazy ride
It's never perfect all the time
It'll pull you down and send you flying
So baby hold on tight
On this crazy ride

So don't be scared when you're in the darkness
The sun is swallowed by the ground
You think it's gone but it's hanging on
It's just on the other side of town
Even when it's lost, it can be found

Heaven knows that it's crazy ride
It's never perfect all the time
It'll pull you down and send you flying
So baby hold on tight
On this crazy ride

Heaven knows that it's crazy ride
It's never perfect all the time
You know it's just a crazy ride
It's never perfect all the time
It'll pull you down and send you flying
So baby hold on tight
On this crazy ride

Goodnight big moon
Sweet dreams, baby",Crazy Ride,2010
Michelle Branch,"Time is going by so fast
And I can't do anything about it
IÃ¢??ve been holding on so long 
It's time that I can do without it

Everything comes and goes
I'm always the last to know
I can see the sun come up another day

You were looking for some fun
And I was asking for a heartache
I should turn my head and run
Or I could learn it all the hard way

Everything comes and goes
I'm always the last to know
I can see the sun come up another day

You should make up your mind
After all of this time, all this time

Everything comes and goes
I'm always the last to know
I can see the sun come up another day
I can see the sun come up another day",Everything Comes and Goes,2010
Michelle Branch,"How to see nothing at all
Become so loud
When does silence settle in
Nothing's wrong but nothing's right
We hold our breath and close our eyes

How did we get so low
It don't even hurt
Yeah why are we so comfortable
To be still
Here we are pretending
We're doing fine
Scratching the surface
To get in back
Don't you think its time
We feel something real

I want tears, I want rain
If that's what leads me back to you
Even if there's stealing the pain
That's what we gotta do
Let the fire burn
Let it break my heart
Yeah we can do that instead
Cause I don't wanna smile
If that means losing you
I want you",I Want Tears,2010
Michelle Branch,"Well, you walked in and knocked me right out of my seat
How could a pretty little boy make such a fool out of me
Oh, you better run for cover, you better get on your knees
You better think about it then turn around and leave

Oh, I'm ready to let you go 
I'm reaching for something that I can't hold
I'm tired of feeling low
I'm getting ready to let you go 

Well you won't find me cryin' in my drink
I got a little black dress and my toes are painted pink
Oh, my brother said to tell you you're tires look kind of low
My daddy says he knows of a lake where no one goes

I'm ready to let you go 
I'm reaching for something that I can't hold
I'm tired of feeling low 
I'm getting ready, to let you go 

Maybe someday the truth will set you free
Til that day keep you're lying hands off me

Something different 'bout me, different 'bout me

But you never do see, you never do see me

Hey, can't wait around forever for you

Sooner or later you're gonna come around
And you'll be sorry when you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later you're gonna wish you had me
Yeah, you're gonna wish you had me

Well she don't do nothing for you
But mess you up, yeah she messes you up

Michelle Branch,"It's the time of year with things growing wild
Love's found underneath the stars
Kids are playing in the backyard now
Catching fireflies in a jar
I am sitting on my back porch
And I'm wondering where you are
And if you look at the moon like I do
Does it break your heart
Does it break your heart
When you think about me
Do you remember to forget
Summertime 

I go back there in my mind 
Kissing underneath the moonlight
Discovering things we thought we'd never find
When I was yours and baby you were mine
Summertime

I thought I saw you a couple months ago
At the airport boarding a plane
I couldn't move I didn't know what to do
And you took my breath away
I heard she's wearing a shiny diamond ring
I guess you're finally moving on
I hope you're happy when she's looking up at you
And I know it might be wrong
Yeah it might be wrong
When I think about you I just can't forget
Summertime

I go back there in my mind 
Kissing underneath the moonlight
Discovering things we thought we'd never find
When I was yours and baby you were mine
Oh summertime

Michelle Branch,"I don't know what it is about this city
Every road I walk down I discover
Little pieces I thought I never had in me
I never had in me
I guess you knew it all along

That somewhere down the darkest alley is a heartbeat
Is a heartbeat
You remind me
And I swear that I am walking through a daydream
Hear your heartbeat
That's where you're gonna find me

Every shape and transatlantic color wrap around me, I've discovered 
That I just want to get as far as I can run to from the sun in California
I don't know how the west is ever gonna win me
Once I'm breathing in the water
I'm gonna drown out every sentimental memory
Find the courage to start over

Oh I know there's got to be a reason
'Cause I'm always running from my life
They say, ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions""
But I don't know what it is about this city

Miles away someone I know is sleeping
In a bedroom by the window
I guess I've always been afraid that I would miss out
And get blown out like a candle
And I don't know what it is about this city
Every road I walk down, I discover
Little pieces I thought I never had in me
I never had in me

Michelle Campagne,"Bow tie, tux and tails
Striped pants and pointy shoes
He taps his baton
Strikes a pose and no one moves

Not a word, not a sound
Not one floutist’s peep
Until his hand guides them all
The shepherd leads his trusting sheep

Into the music, which leaps and swirls
As does his baton
The conductor is amazing
This guy’s got it going on

His hair shakes as he moves
As the music reached its peak
It was so beautiful
That a tear ran down my cheek
He orchestrated everything
And didn’t even speak",The Amazing Conductor,2006

Michelle Chamuel,"Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me-e-e-e-e

I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e

And I realize, the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now

When he proposed he informed my mother
He was probably her very last chance.
And though she was twenty-two, 
Though she was twenty-two, 
Though she was twenty-two
She married him. 

Life with my dad wasn't ever a picnic

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

But it was home. 

Mother always said I'd be very attractive 
When I grew up, when I grew up. 
""Diff'rent,"" she said, ""With a special something 
And a very, very personal flair.""
And though I was eight or nine,
Though I was eight or nine, 
Though I was eight or nine, 
I hated her. 

Now, 
""Diff'rent"" is nice, but it sure isn't pretty.
""Pretty"" is what it's about. 
I never met anyone who was ""diff'rent""
Who couldn't figure that out. 
So beautiful I'd never lived to see. 
But it was clear, 
If not to her,
Well then to me 

That everyone is beautiful at the ballet.

I mean, I was born to save their marriage 
But when my father came to pick my mother up at the hospital he said, 
""Well, I thought this was going to help. 
But I guess it's not."" 
Anyway, I did have a fantastic fantasy life. 
I used to dance around the living room with my arms up like this. 
My fantasy was that it was an Indian Chief 
And he'd say to me, 
""Maggie, do you wanna dance?"" 
And I'd say, ""Daddy, I would love to dance.""

Michelle Lewis,"I've been discovered
My trip is over
I'm not really one of you
Nothing is mine but the cracks in the skyline
I guess it's time to tell the truth

Outside I'm normal, but inside I'm green translucent gel
I may seem nice enough but really I am ornery as hell
Can't you tell?

[Chorus:]
Stop looking at me sideways
I'm just trying to keep my friends
Because I still don't have answers
I'm just an everyday alien
Stop kicking at my head to see what's underneath my skin
Because I still breathe; I still need you
I'm just an everyday alien
Dying to be human again

He's not my brother
And she's not my mother
She's some nice lady trying to help out
It might cause you to wonder
How many others
You'll find wandering about

So many reasons to want to stay but, still, I am alone
You called me out, so I'll have to drag my alien butt home
Guess I'll go

[Chorus]

I've been so lost, so far gone
It's almost funny I held out this long
You'll tell everyone the truth about me
And they'll see I'm wrong
I don't belong

The spinning colors down below
I'm passing quickly so
Look up, I'm a comet, here in my orbit
And bless my eyes, from this high
It's beautiful
But down on earth they've sent the code
My time is up, I've got to go
If there's one thing I know
You can't be too happy
They'll shoot you down
Look away from your T.V.

Goodbye (I'm falling)
Big sky (I'm fading)
Hello ground zero (so fast I don't know what to do)
Goodbye (hold steady)
Big sky (and waiting)
I'll be landing soon
And on the crash site flowers pile
The lights that line the runway mile
I'll lose my shit in style
In one minute longer I'm blessing you
(I need some time to clear my mind and to memorize the view)
Then finally I'll hear the scream
Metal on metal like my dreams
The asphalt steaming with
The smell of burnt rubber, pity me
Leave me up here forever, peacefully...

Hello ground zero (so fast I don't know what to do)

And all our momma says is

'Cause you can never come back home

Michelle Lewis,"On the coldest night of the year
You start to rethink hell
Cause all you hear is a cruel wind moan
Fire engine bells
See, this family had no heat
So they built a bonfire in their living room
They Thought they could keep it a secret
But those flames caught on and soon the whole building went up
I see one fireman turn to another and say
""That's quite a blaze we got here.""
""Yup, well, they're warm for now""

And the fires burn on the east side
While the west is hunkering down
And I'm in search of comfort
But he is elusive and working in mid-town

Oh, Oh I think the whole world may freeze

January's child

It's the coldest night of the year
And I've decided that hell is on 29th street
Yeah, the car's jammed down 10th avenue
Cause the girls all go on sale just to get inside
""Hey, honey, you want a ride?""
Well They'll give handjobs for a dollar
They'll go down on you for ten
If your car has heat
Hell is 29th street

And these few degrees are lonely
They cling to me for life
Holding on to a dead mans blanket, a lost dogs fur
And a hookers exposed thighs

[Chorus]

And when he finds me
On his steps outside
I'm half frozen in ice
So he digs me out
And he drags me in
And he cuts like a surgeon
Through my skin into warm blood
Melts me down and gives me love
When I tell him I want to die
That January boy laughs and says
""Okay snow queen, here's a match
Why don't you try""

Oh we'll be all right in awhile

It's gonna be all right

I thought you were gentle but you're not
And you're poisonous to eat

With yellow on my chin and a stem in my mouth

She's been traveling the sidewalks for hours 
Stopping as every moment of the truth wanders past 
Window shopping for religion or something harder 
Than the coins in her pocket 

She is way too pretty for prime time New York 
She gets the business every time she takes a walk 
Amid the shark-smile porno scenes 
But they can't ever touch her - their disappearing queen

She's as shady as cheap sunglasses 
But as perfect as this October Monday passes

Always in such a hurry, but never too fast

Searchin' alleys for proper company 
She's jumping in and out of cracks 
And she's got everything that you lack 
Well she entered unnoticed

We belong to a street lamp flickering out

And so my chest was empty but it felt okay 
I just fished out the pieces and walked away into

Since skipping parole
And he dials the phone quietly
But she put him on hold
There are good sons and bad seeds

And he watches their lives

Oh, but his breathing is much slower than before

Tomorrow comes another hundred thousand times
Practicing perfect dying
But he can't be saved, he likes the pain too much to be denied
And I don't hear a soul denying

And now the little boy who cried just got his way
But nobody wants to play

It's a shame that no one cried when William died, I think it's funny
He won't give a damn about not loving you or anybody
The sad frozen eyes-are watching William die
And he's dying all the time

He wanders through the crowd alone and out of place
Muttering something about being numb
And he wears his skin so tight, a smile would crack his face
As his heart beats purple blood

And here we stand above the open ground
As they lower his body down

Playing a guitar and begging for change
Oh, I guess I shouldn't have believed my eyes
But when he wiggled his wings, I melted like ice cream
He began to sing (no very well)
He said ""Oh sweet girl, the storyteller never lies""
That should have been enough
I couldn't make this up
Stranger than fiction is my love, my love

Now there's an angel in my bed, I can't kick him out
And his junkyard head is starting to smell
Oh, I guess it must have been a hell of a night
Cause as he stumbled to the door, he just didn't care
That his wings were on the floor-right where they fell
Oh, and I'm still looking for a heavenly light

He couldn't say goodbye
The angel made me cry
Stranger than fiction like my life
My life

Oh, he said, ""The storyteller never lies""
Hey Mack, when you fly back to heaven
Can I come for the ride?
He said, ""No kid, I don't live in heaven
I live here on the lower east side.""

So now I'm back with my old guy, but I think of the angel

Just like the children who carry the blame
Who brought the mission 
Burning down in flames
Throwing stones, stepping on a crack
Oh no, your mama can never take you back
Into the womb the break was clean
In my redemption dream
How many days how many nights
How many souls, How many lives
We take the chain and break the chain
Let's make a change
In my redemption dream
When does the nightmare stop 
When does the dream begin
Go ask the street vendor
""Hey, when does the fruit stop rotting?""

Washed away downstream

To see his face and tell him exactly what he could do

The only person left here in this town

People talk and judge behind your back as if you’re made of stone 
It’s not like you’re not hurting
It’s temporary, everything, your pain and dreams and plans
There’s no tourniquet to stop the changes

There are cobwebs on the ceiling fan

And the lonely forty watt flickers when the train goes by
Take out boxes near the garbage can
And the leaning tower of dishes is getting three feet high

I can't stand wondering if you’re out with that whore
I can't stand I drank an ocean of liquor in your undertow

Uh ha ha ha ha
The faucet keeps dripping like a cannonball
And I threw my guitar in the fire when I ran out of duraflames
The phone kept ringing right off the wall
But it never was you, so I ripped it out the socket
And then I cursed your name

The sun’s been gone for seven days and you been gone for nine
Tennessee river’s just a block away and I could jump in at anytime

I can't stand waiting to hear your boots at my door
I can't stand wondering if you’re out with that whore
I can't stand I drank an ocean of liquor in your undertow

I shuffle around like a mental patient
In my robe and my bedroom shoes
Flipping channels from my sleeping bag
And dining on a box of Fruit Loops

I can't stand waiting to hear your boots at my door
I can't stand wondering if you’re out with that whore

Remember when we would howl at the moon
Radio crackling Sweet Melissa
On a sticky summer night in June

You always wore that corduroy jacket
And the bell bottom patched up jeans
Well, put them back on
And meet me down at the reservoir past the state line
And we’ll cause a scene

You bring the weed I’ll bring the wine
Crawl in the backseat, honey, and have a real good time

Standing at the edge of my ordinary life
Now I'm looking far ahead I only see clear blue skies

All this time we've come a long long way
I've waited a lifetime for the day
I'm praying this moment's here to stay
All this time when every one else said I was wrong
You gave me a reason to be strong
You gave me the will to carry on
All this time.

You kissed my blues away
Now yesterday's far behind
And all these clouds of doubt have cleared around my mind
Now I'm looking far ahead and looking with brand new eyes
Well I can't see the future but I know it's looking bright

Never thought we could survive what we've come through
There were times we felt like giving up but we held true

I lost my way endlessly
Looking for something to restore my faith
And give me the strength to fight again

To many words hit me hard
Coz' they never meant what they said they would
I have been taken, and broken, abandoned alone
I guess I was resigned to give in

I believed in you
I was lost and you gave me direction again, yeh

Just when I needed someone to give me love
You came and rescued me, yeh
You showed me right there
Just what I've been waiting for
Lifted me up
Guided me out from the dark
Just when I needed it most you show me The Meaning of Love

As tears go by, I can say
There's nothing I miss by the crying game
My heart beats like its still reeling
I know I can feel it
I've got the strength to fight again

I was lost and you gave me direction again, yeh

Guided me out from the dark

Get a zoom on my face
Standing here, crooked smile you put it there
There's no doubt in my mind
Now you've found me I'm whole again

Irgendwann bin ich bereit
Irgendwann merk ich dass du, all die Lieder für mich schreibst
Irgendwann bin ich allein und dann fällt´s mir wieder ein
All die Jahre war ich dein
Irgendwann sehen wir uns wieder
Und wir beide schau'n zurück
Gott wird helfen, doch wir zwei
Wir verschenkten unser Glück
Irgendwann bin ich allein und dann fällt´s mir wieder ein
All die Jahre war ich dein

Mir fällt es schwer, doch ich kann es nicht mehr
Du bist heut anders, ich hab es schon lange gemerkt
Du bist nicht mehr diese Frau die mich geliebt hat, nein, Schatz
In deiner Welt gibt es für einen wie mich kein' Platz
Sag wie lang hab ich um dich gekämpft
Nichts mehr gegessen und nicht gepennt
Wie lange hab ich auf mein Handy gestarrt
Obwohl ich wusste, du bist längst nicht mehr da
Hab mir eingeredet, dass die Hoffnung zuletzt stirbt
Und gesehen, dass in den Medien gehetzt wird
Heute weiß ich, sie wollten uns trenn', denn
Leider ist nicht alles Gold, was hier glänzt
Wir waren zu jung, für den Schritt nicht bereit
Vielleicht war es auch nicht die richtige Zeit
Eifersucht und Streit durch den Druck
Sekunde, ich gönne mir noch kurz 'nen Schluck
Denk jeden Tag an dich, wenn ich aufsteh, raus geh
Wie viele Songs muss ich noch aufnehm'n?
Kein', denn das war mein Letzter
Was mach's gut? Ok, mach's besser
Doch denk dran, ich wünsch dir das Beste
Zeig deinen Kindern meine 10000 Texte und lächle
Denn wir hatten eine gute Zeit

Wir verschenkten unser Glück
Irgendwann bin ich allein und dann fällt´s mir wieder ein
All die Jahre war ich dein

Schlaflose Nächte, eiskaltes Herz
Und jede Scheiß-Party war's einfach nicht wert
So oft war ich von den Weibern genervt
Blick in mein Inneres, ich zeig dir den Herbst
Ich leide nicht mehr, wenn ich uns're Bilder seh
Wie oft hast du mir gesagt, du willst nicht geh'n?
Wie oft hast du mir gesagt, bleib für immer?
Ein Foto von dir? Ich hab gar keins im Zimmer
Baby, ich hab abgeschlossen
Wie viele Jahre war ich nachts besoffen?
Wie viele Male hab ich mich geschlagen?
Ich schwör, ich konnt diesen Kopfschmerz nicht ertragen
Meine Wut raus gelassen, hab mich nicht im Griff
Doch scheiß drauf, egal, es ist, wie es ist
Bleib wie du bist, du gehst dein' Weg
Das sind Geschichten, die das Leben erzählt
Ich wünsch dir das Beste, ein Haus mit 'nem Garten
Ein' Mann, der dich liebt, mit 'nem fetten Sportwagen
Zwei Mädchen und zwei Jungs, wie du's wolltest
Auf dass sie gut in der Schule sind und du stolz bist
Viel Geld, doch am meisten Gesundheit
Dass du noch die nächsten 50 Jahre jung bleibst
Und dass Gott dich beschützt
Vergiss mich nicht

I'd watch the sailors tying knots

Was grey-haired old Patch Eye

Watched the ships go by

He'd talk about his missing eye
He would talk about his wooden leg
But he'd never talk about the old tatoo
On his right arm that said 'Meg'

Sailing seas both blue and green
And he said that all pirates gots to have a patch
So's they can look real mean
He'd make the bad guys walk the plank
The pretty ladies, he would save
Then he'd take the treasures from the ship
Then sink it to a watery grave

He'd talk about his missing eye
He'd talk about his wooden leg
But he'd never talk about the old tattoo
Or brown-haired blue-eyed 'Meg'

He told many a story about his wooden leg
As he sat there spinning yarns
Once he'd lost it to a mamba snake
Down in the Amazon
Another time it was way out west
In a gunfight, or so he said, but
That's alright, a man's got two legs
Why'know, he could've lost his head...

Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush

I thought, I thought love was a key
I picked the lock, I forgot to knock
I walked it off and baby, I was free

They play it every opportunity
They play love's song for you
Yes, and any other fool but you know that
Love's song was never in my key

A short time ago, well, wouldn't you know
Came the strain of some old melody
Singing soft and low, sentimental and slow
Now somehow I know love's song is singing me

Love's song lingers on the lips of other singers
You don't have to pay 'em, they'll play 'em all for free
They'll play love's song for you, any love song will do
But you know that love's song was never in my key

Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Love's song lingers on the lips of other singers
But love's song was never in my key
Just goes to show how wrong I could be

I seem to bring out the very worst in you
Perhaps you thought my love could be bought
Perhaps you think we're happy but we're not

I tried to talk it out but you'd just take it out on me
Shout at me to shut up, turn the volume up on the TV

And when the neighbors all began to complain
You yell at me and tell me it's my treachery's to blame
I gave you my trust but I'm taking back the same
For the things you are doing in our name

All I ever needed you to show me was your soul
I see that all you ever really wanted was control
And now I know this wasn't part of your plan

Unless I take those 12 steps, aimed at gettin sober
That's the shit I told myself I'll handle when I'm older
And now I'm older and still got this devil on my shoulder
Bottle up my problems, like prescriptions I'm poppin
All the liquor that I find myself drinkin so often
Now these cards are dealt, told myself I don't need help
Numb myself to everything, and keep on runnin from myself

Let's drink away the pain
Let's make another toast
Let's smoke another blunt
Until it's just a roach
And pop another pill

Left here to battle this addictive personality
That's got me living in this alternate reality
Losing touch before this [?] so gradually
Cause at this point I need these chemicals to balance me
It's like I'm following a blueprint that the devil made
Since I first took my Ritalin in the 7th grade
The doctor gave me 16 milligrams, just a kid
Barely weighed a buck, it's like they used me as their guinea pig
Crazy teen, medicated ADD
Doctor said take only 1, but you know I was taking 3
Blazin tree and skippin class, getting drunk and missin math
Bangin chicks without a rubber, crushin pills up on the desk
Chemically imbalanced in this motherfucker, startin shit
Still I was a smart kid, got myself a scholarship
Private schools with it, button-downs with the dockers
And the JanSport full of weed stuffed into my locker

See I'm just wreckin out weekly, livin on repeat
Still in highschool but the teachers could never reach me
Always was the fuck up with a chip on my shoulder
And a pocket full of anything to keep me from sober
See I was livin like there's no tomorrow
Chewin on a xany bar, rollin up the window smokin blunts up in family car
Bottles to the head, got detention on the reg
Never listenin to what my parents said
I was always rollin with an ounce or two
Everytime I'm bouncin through
Flippin everybody off like Shady taught me how to do
Always thinkin that the more we burnin, the merrier
Just a kid from middle-class suburban America
And so many others like me, listen to me nightly
Happy that somebody else is feelin' what they might be
So Christian pop a pill, oh yeah I bet you will

And nothing else could ever smolder

Well, it's been a few years now
And, still, sometimes when I'm in a crowd
I hear some folk whisperin' loud as they pass me by
""Remember that girl Michelle?
You know, that girl from the well?""
As I picked up my pail, I can't help by smile
'Cause they don't know the half of it (hey)
They don't know how deep it is (hey)
They don't know what you did
How you took my broken heart and put it back together again

Lonely for the incident at the well

[Bridge:]
Wanna say I love you (love you)
Wanna say I needed you (needed you)
I really wanna be with you (be with you)
And if they only knew I give all breaks to you
For the things you brought me through
And just before my simple song is through (through)
Please, let me say...

I wanna tell ya; I'll tell ya, but I can't explain it (can't explain it 'cause...)

I could see if i'd done something noble,
incredible or simply wonderful
Then i'd understand just why you care for me
Saved a child from the building on fire,then fed
all the hungry supplied their needs 
Then  maybe it would make more sense why you 
dare to love me,but

I can't figure out this love thang
Though we've talked about it all before
But the truth about this love thang,no one else
can love me more

I was looking for love in all the wrong places
And never found a cure
I was hoping that it could be sent from heaven

Dwindled by the way
In all of my fears it left me lonely with tears
Here to stay

I learned to pray for love
If you see it in a lifetime
Learn to stay in love

My heart about to drown
Fulfilling my need to have a companion but no
One was around
In all of my guilt I feel redemption it wasn't
All my fault
The home that I built was real inside me but
Love was never caught

Wind all on my face
But that's no remedy
When your heart it seem to be breaking
Tell you and you just don't listen
Don't know how much more I can take it
Nothing to say but

[Chorus]
Stop this car
I don't wanna ride no more
Cause it's just too fast
And you wont pump the brakes
Slow down hear what I gotta say
Stop this car
Was our destination too far?
I wanna get out
I don't wanna ride no more
Baby just stop this car

I miss the days when we would
Tour the countryside
And drive for hours on open road
Til the tank was dry
The minutes pasted, we cry and laugh
Get inside you're mind
Now it seems you built a wall
That I just can't knock down

I can here the music playing
Turn it to my favorite station
Wind all on my face
But that's no remedy
When my heart it seem to be breaking
Tell you and you just don't listen
Don't know how much more I can take it
Nothing to say but

[Chorus]

There's nothing worse than being ignored (being ignored)
If you don't want me put the brakes to the floor (to the floor)
When you shut me out I feel so alone
Pull over right here, open up the door
Watch me, I can be gone, oh yeah
Oh yeah, Stop this car, Stop this car

To see me waiting up for you
There's something I gotta say
Never in my life
Could I have ever imagined that

Never knew something good be so true
And I'm so much better

You really think I was so blind
I wouldn't notice the signs
And it was you, uh
Who gave me all the time to find
All the love that you ain't giving me no more

And I never ever felt so special
Never knew it could feel so good inside
I'm so much better
Pray for forever
So before I say goodbye to you

Made everything so clear

I wanna find a real man
If it wasn't for you
I wanna thank you

I wanna thank you
For not coming up with better lies
Cause he loves me better
Than you could ever
And I owe it all to you

Bey
Go on Michelle

I really hate to see that look
Huh, on your face
You lookin' like someone came and rained on your parade,
And I know it kills to feel those tears,
In your eyes
But I guess your conscience finally caught up with your lies

But when my tears dropped,
Where the hell were you?
But it's okay, boy I've changed,
And I ain't been there waiting
So I won't pre-tend, to feel bad for you
'Cause since you left, I ain't cried since
And boy I like it that way

I can say I'm done in a million ways
But let's not wait around the bush, let's cut to the the chase
When you change, I change, but it's too late
Now I'm so through, too cool, on ya
And if our love was a game, you just lost
When you change, I change, but it's too late

I know you hate to see this look
On my face
I'm sure that you can see real clear a little lion
Goes a long way
And if you think I'll waste more tears,
Boy you crazy
And baby you should get yo'self admit it
Don't delay

But you let the ball drop,
Too bad for you
But it's okay, boy I'm straight,
My whole life's amazing
So I won't pre-tend, to feel bad for you
'Cause since you left, I ain't cried since
And boy I like it that way

I can say I'm done in a million ways,
But let's not wait around the bush, let's cut to the the chase
When you change, I change, but it's too late
Now I'm so through, too cool, on ya
And if our love was a game, you just lost
When you change, I change, but it's too late

Now you wanna claim you got a clue (Oh no)
Boy what you expect for me to do?
You claim you wanna have a life, or two
But you can save your sorries, and your ""I love you"" too

I can say I'm done in a million ways,
But let's not wait around the bush, let's cut to the the chase
When you change, I change, but it's too late
Now I'm so through, too cool, on ya
And if our love was a game, you just lost
When you change, I change, but it's too late

Change just in time
Just in time for me to change my mind
And it's too late,
Boy I changed,
It's too bad for ya
Oh oh boy I changed my mind, I don't want ya
No no boy

But it's too late

When the moon meets the night we’re all safer in your arms
Happy to see you because you make life beautiful
Beautiful from dusk til dawn
Jesus you are so beautiful

Picture me trying to figure me out by myself
Like the times I came to you and said I don’t need your help
But you wouldn’t leave me til you won my heart
But I wish I’d learned quickly without you I won’t get too far
Now I wish I never had to see that to know that you’re real
When it’s plain as day so crystal clear

Little sister
You can't wait till you're all grown up
Mama's always sayin' you're not old enough

When a man gets fooled by a tender touch.

Of Harry's Bar and Grill
Someone hugs a bottle
To take away the chill.

Carries his sleeping soul
As far as lonely goes.

Behind a golden door
Someone's drinking pink champagne
To keep from being board.
Between the highs and lows
The icy wind still blows

To wash away your troubles.
If you could buy a suitcase for your soul.
You would make a pretty package
Of all your extra baggage.

From the has-bents to the haves
From the mansions to the alleys
From the riches to the rags
Underneath our clothes.

There's a distant craving that I'm still trying to forget
Am I drifting endlessly, am I moving to
A resolution of you and me

I hear you, can you hear me
Is it too late to say
I'm so sorry

My thoughts are stained with the faded words of a valentine
Will my heart ever be free like the free I knew
Living the love that was you and me

To know where I went wrong

When your heart has crossed that finish line
Oh how we fought æ??il the hour was late
Never stoppinto think
We were just fighting fate

You're gone
That's as it should be
We were all that we could be
But it wasn't enough
It's not your fault
It's not my fear
We just never really belonged here
And our time was up
Still I want to thank you for your love
I just want to thank you for your love

We were giving, we were gentle
In a world that can be unkind
It was sweet and sentimental
It was love, and love's so hard to find
But in the end there's that still little voice
That comes in the night
And leaves you no choice

CHORUS

It's not your fault
It's not my fear
We just never really belonged here
And our time was up
Still I want to thank you for your love
I just want to thank you for your love

You know how people have these little habits
That get you down like Ernie
Ernie like to chew gum, no, not chew, Pop

Like, I come home this one day and there's Ernie
Layin' on the couch chewin', no, not chewin', poppin'
So, I said to him, I said
""Ernie, you pop that gum one more time"" and he did

So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots into his head

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake city about two years ago
And he told me he was single and we hit it off right away
So, we started living together

He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
Then I found out, single, my ass
Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up the chicken for dinner
And in storms my husband Wilbrin in a jealous rage
""You been screwin' the milkman""

He says and he kept sayin'
""You been screwin the milkman""

And my husband, Charlie traveled around with us

Flip flops, back flips, one right after the other
Well, this one night we were in Cicero

The three of us, we were in this hotel room
Boozin' and havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice
So I went out to get some

I come back, open the door
There's Veronica and Charlie
Doing number seventeen, the spread eagle

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out
I can't remember a thing, it wasn't until later
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming, they had it coming
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it, in spite if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

I loved Alvin Lipschitz, he was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter
But he was always trying to find himself
He go out every night looking for himself
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead

We were eating eggs in Sammy's when the black man there drew his knife

Aw, you drowned that Jew in Rampton as he washed his sleeveless shirt
You know, that Spanish-speaking gentlemen the one we all called Kurt

Come now, gentleman, I know there's some mistake
How forgetful I'm becoming now you fixed your business straight

I remember you in Hemlock Road in nineteen fifty-six
You're a faggy little leather boy with a smaller piece of stick

You're a lashing, smashing hunk of man your sweat shines sweet and strong
Your organs working perfectly but there's a part that's not screwed on

Weren't you at the Coke convention back on nineteen sixty-five?
You're the misbred, gray executive I've seen heavily advertised

You're the great, gray man whose daughter licks policemen's buttons clean
You're the man who squats behind the man who works the soft machine

Come now, gentleman your love is all I crave
You'll still be in the circus when I'm laughing, laughing in my grave

When the old men do the fighting and the young men all look on
And the young girls eat their mothers meat from tubes of plasticon

Be wary of these my gentle friends of all the skins you breed
They have a tasty habit they eat the hands that bleed

So remember who you say you are and keep your noses clean
Boys will be boys and play with toys so be strong with your beast

I really love my sweet thing, I can't give her up
I really love my sweet thing, I can't give her up
I really love my sweet thing, I can't give her up 

In the beginning, when we were winning
I was your ever-present love-sick fool
You turned the heat off and left me standing
Freezing by your swimming pool 

I can't give it up
I can't give it up
I can't give it up
I can't give it up 

Now I don't want to spoil the party
I know it goes against the grain
As the plane touched down, and the midnight moon
Can't just walk away

Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light 
Just a few at the scene, and they all did agree 
That the man who ran looked a lot like me 

The judge said ""Son, what's your alibi? 
If you were somewheres else, then you won't have to die"" 
But I spoke not a word, tho' it meant my life 
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife 

Chorus: 
She walks these hills in a long black veil 
Visits my grave when the night winds wail 
Nobody knows, nobody sees 
Nobody knows, but me 

The scaffold is high, eternity near 
She stands in the crowd, she sheds not a tear 
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan 
In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones

I was groping in the darkness
Seeing dangers in the port
Tortured into silence
My back against the wall

Dancing in the starlight
Swirling in the walls
Just like Venus on the ocean
The figures on the wall

If you don't take risks
If you don't take a chance
You're bound to fall
Oh yeah sugar
You will surely fall

Crying for salvation
There was nothing there at all
I could not dial the number
And I could not make the call

Dancing in the starlight
The figures on the wall
You will surely fall
Dancing in the starlight
You will surely fall
You will surely fall",Dancing in the Starlight,2001
Mick Jagger,"I was trying to forget you
But you won't tell me how
Lately I'm finding it tricky
With your picture plastered all over town
Friends pick you up in conversation
Just to see how I'll react
I get this internal lacerations
That jack me up and lay me out flat

But I can't throw my life away
I can't give the game away
You just wandered off the stage
And left me dealing with the pain

So don't call me up
Oh when you want to cry
'cause I might let you down
Don't call me up
On some rainy night
'cause I might let you down
Let you down

People ask have you seen her
I say not for a while
I'm gonna see my girlfriend
Way down in Argentina
We're gonna have a blast for a while
But I see you in my inner eye
Touch me with a gentle smile
Wonder if you catch my mood
Can you feel my solitude

So don't call me up
Oh when you want to cry
'cause I might let you down
Don't call me up
When some other guy
Hangs your heartstrings out to dry

As the waves crash around
And the stars hit the ground
I'll be out of my mind once again
As the rain lashes down
And the stars can't be found
I will hold my head high
Don't call me up [cont]

And just gaze at the sky
I was under your spell
And you took me to hell

Don't call me up
If you want to cry
I might let you down
Don't call me up
If you want some lie
I might let you down
Might let you down
Might let you down
Might let you down

""God Gave My Everything""

You can see it in a clear blue sky
You can see it in a woman's eyes
You can hear it in your baby's cries
You can hear it in your lover's sighs
You can touch it in a grain of sand
Yeah hold it right there
In the palm of your hand
Feel it 'round you everyday
And hear what I've got to say

God gave me everything I want
Come on
I'll give it all to you
God gave me everything I want
Come on
I'll give it all to you

I saw it in the midnight sun
And I feel it in the race I won
And I hear it in the windy storm
And I feel it in the icy dawn
And I smell it the wine I taste
And I see it in my father's face
And I hear it in a symphony
And I feel it in the love
You show for me

Yeah
God gave me everything I want
Oh come on
I'll give it all to you

Dogs are on the roof
I am in the basement
Looking for the truth

Tired of being patient
For the voice to come
If you want the answer
There is only one - only one

Her flesh is smooth and supple
And velvet as the night
Her eyes are shot with diamonds
A mouth full of delight

There's a goddess in the doorway
Asking how much can I take
And it looks like she's heading my way
There's a goddess in the doorway

Demons in the bedroom
Dogs are on the loose
Driving in the backstreets
Looking for the truth

I'm searching for your temple
Hunting for your shrine
I'm looking for a vision
By a neon sign

There's a goddess in the doorway
Asking how much can I take
And it looks like she's heading my way

You broke my will you broke my back

You tried to push me to the edge
You wouldn't listen when I begged
Why don't you push me off the ledge

And I threw it in the earth

From scrabbling in the dirt

Living in the past
No use getting misty eyed
It all screamed by so fast
When life was so much calmer
Severely buttoned up
The future rich in promises
Milk flowing from the cup

I would spend those lazy days
Lying on a ridge
Watching girls in cotton dresses
Diving off the bridge

Is just building crumbled down

That's a million dollar flat

Cause it's never coming back

Lost in starry dreams
And now watch my children
Just downloading them to screens

And don't hold me tight
'Cause I could get used to your vision of paradise

And don't ask me where all of the pain goes
'Cause you make me feel that I don't know myself
You say that you want me forever and I
I say that love is no crime
So tell me the names of the children we'll have
At the end of the line

Don't put your arms around me
And don't hold me tight
'Cause I could get used to your vision of paradise
And don't let me near the garden

Of earthly delights

While I fall apart in my bed
I find myself aching for you
I feel myself breaking in two

Talkin' to some rich folk that you know

And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

When you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
And another girl to take my pain away

Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail

In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids.

Like a real good woman nobody knows

I get so ashamed for making you blue
I come back to this porch to make it all up to you
The rain's got me thirsty, falling wasteful and slow
I'm restless enough, I'm so scared to go

So her love has turned as hard as a bramble rose
Just a real good woman nobody knows

Do you think she'll be happy out on the wind?
Do you think she'll get halfway 'fore it's raining again?
Will she find that she's true when it's hardest to be
Or will the notions she follows have all turned on me?

Once her love has blown as far as a bramble rose

Now you can put your glass to the sky
If you got love for a nigga with the real
Handy with the hand, see he ride till he die
Quick to let a motherfucker now how he feel

Mama was working two jobs on dialysis
Can't stop, won't stop
All I've been thinking lately is can't flop, won't flop, don't flip
But this shit is straight drop, it's gon' flip
Coke in your nore, smell what I'm cooking
Man there's fiends at the door cause there's dope in the flows
I've been on that Santigold, show your ho where it don't shine
No .9 can save you
You don't wan't the bovine, a co-sign can't make you
Free-throw line, I'm going back for extras, need that
And when I'm 6'5"", big boy, no 3 Stacks
Tryna flip it 3 ways, 1 pack, 3 days
I give you low key ways to get that off
The henny got me talking crazy like I pissed that soft
I never do it underhanded so it couldn't be that
They'll call him underrated but it couldn't be stats
That they was looking at, time I was putting in
Told em bout The Water[s] with my wrist I was cooking crack
Everything was crooked then, couldn't get straight life
Rough around the edges, slicing bed with a steak knife
Niggas was stressed, had to learn to finesse
It was still a couple wrinkles that I needed to press
It was still a cup of water that I needed to drink
And it's still a couple burners that I need off my chest
Never the less

Now you can put your glass to the sky
If you got love for a nigga with the real
Handy with the hand, see he ride till he die
Quick to let a motherfucker now how he feel, nigga how he feel
Yo I ain't never really had to try
Nigga I'm me, that's all I'm tryna be
Never gave a fuck 'bout a nigga talking shit
If he ain't about the action then that's all that's gonna be
All it's gonna be

Now you can put your hands to the sky
If you got love for a nigga with the real
Handy with the hand, see he ride till he die
Quick to let a motherfucker now how he feel, nigga how he feel
Yo I ain't never really had to try
Nigga I'm me, that's all I'm tryna be
Never gave a fuck 'bout a nigga talking shit
If he ain't about the action then that's all that's gonna be

Better know I mean what I say
Gotta wash 'em off the medical, I dream when I'm wake
Thoughts get lofty, all you niggas lines get costly
Can't nobody off me, I'm awfully
Sick with this shit, got the sickle cell trait
You hook fam, I'm gifted
No need for me to check the ballistics
Y'all niggas is missing
How come everybody off with the aim?
I guess over saturation's just a part of the game, I'm out",How U Feel,2015

Mick Jones,"Standing in the rain, with his head hung low
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream
He heard one guitar, just blew him away
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day

Bought a beat up six string, in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure
That one guitar, felt good in his hands, didn't take long, to understand
Just one guitar, slung way down low
Was a one way ticket, only one way to go
So he started rockin', ain't never gonna stop
Gotta keep on rockin', someday gonna make it to the top

And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes, he's a juke box hero
He took one guitar, juke box hero, stars in his eyes
Juke box hero, (stars in his eyes) he'll come alive tonight

In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain
And that one guitar, made his whole life change
Now he needs to keep on rockin', he just can't stop
Gotta keep on rockin', that boy has got to stay on top

And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He's a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
Yeah, juke box hero, stars in his eyes
With that one guitar, (stars in his eyes)
He'll come alive, come alive tonight, woah

Yeah, he's gotta keep on rockin', just can't stop
Gotta keep on rockin', that boy has got to stay on top

Sometimes I don't know what I will find, I only know it's a matter of time
When you love someone, when you love someone

It feels so right, so warm and true, I need to know if you feel it too
Maybe I'm wrong, won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong

I've been waiting for a girl like you, your loving will survive

Only in dreams could it be this way

Chorus",Good Morning Britain,
Mick Jones,"Everyone is busy with the regular routine
The sniper just takes his aim
Everyone is window shopping, no one is amazed
Even if he hit you, you'd still think it's just a graze
You go to a movie, you go to a show
You think that you're loving, you don't really know

Big tears mean nothing
You can count them as they fall
Big tears mean nothing
When you're lying in your coffin
Tell me who's been taken in

Oh you talk about the new boss automatic clause
But of course they make it all up for you
Always fascinated by the weird edge of town
Come home disappointed every time they put you down
Laughing with the old boys, saying that it's all noise

I suppose, big tears mean nothing
You can count them as they fall
Big tears mean nothing
When you're lying in your coffin
Tell me who's been taken in

All the buttons of my overcoat
They have fallen off one by one
You wouldn't even like me if you'd never had a drink
You wouldn't even like me if you never stopped to think
Standing in the shadow, turning wives to widows

I search for treasures in your soul
And when I'm gone, you'll know I will come back to you

We'll sail on a river, way down to the salty sea
Love will keep us together
And the tide will draw you close to me
(Never words so true, never words so wise)
Love will keep us together
'Cause there's more to this than meets the eye

I'm like a mountain made of stone
I'm like a new day dawning
I'll be here every morning, close to you",Buoy,2000
Mick Karn,"When the room is quiet 
The daylight almost gone 
It seems there's something I should know 
Well I ought to leave but the rain it never stops 
And I've no particular place to go 

Just when I think I'm winning 
When I've broken every door 
The ghosts of my life blow wilder than before 
Just when I thought I could not be stopped 
When my chance came to be king 
The ghosts of my life blew wilder than the wind 

Well I'm feeling nervous 
Now I find myself alone 
The simple life's no longer there 
Once I was so sure 
Now the doubt inside my mind 
Comes and goes but leads nowhere 

Just when I think I'm winning 
When I've broken every door 
The ghosts of my life blow wilder than before 
Just when I thought I could not be stopped 
When my chance came to be king 
The ghosts of my life blew wilder than the wind",Ghosts,2005

Mick Lloyd,"We were all down at Margie's bar
Telling stories if we had one
Someone fired the old jukebox up
The song sure was a sad one
A teardrop rolled down Bubba's nose
From the pain the song was inflicting
And all at once he jumped to his feet
Just like somebody kicked him

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty five
Bubba shot the juke box last night

Bubba ain't never been accused of being mentality stable
So we did not draw an easy breathe
Until he laid that colt on the table
He hung his head till the cops showed up
They dragged him right out of Margie's
Told him ""Don't play dumb with us, son""
""Know damn well what the charge is.""

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty five
Bubba shot the juke box last night

Well, the sheriff arrived with his bathrobe on
The confrontation was a tense one
Shook his head said, ""Bubba Boy,""
""You was always a dense one.""
Reckless discharge of a gun
That's what the officers are claiming
Bubba hollered, ""Reckless! Hell!""
""I shot just where I was aiming.""

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty five
Bubba shot the juke box  stopped it with one shot
Bubba shot the jukebox last night
Well he could not tell right from wrong
Through the teardrops in his eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
It was justifiable homicide
Bubba shot the juke box stopped it with one shot
Bubba shot the jukebox last night",Bubba Shot the Jukebox,1997
Mick Lloyd,"Every Friday night there's a steady cloud of dust
That leads back to a field filled with pickup trucks
It's got old Hank crankin' way up loud
Got coolers in the back, tailgates down
There's a big fire burning but don't be alarmed
It's just country boys and girls getting down on the farm

Well you can come as you are, there ain't no dress code
Just some rural route rules that you need to know
Don't mess with the bull he can get real mean
Don't forget to shut the gate stay out of the green
If it starts to raining will just head to the barn
Where country boys and girls are getting down on the farm

You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can do outside those city limits
Ain't no closing time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls getting down on the farm

Ed's been on his tractor ain't seen Becky all week
Somebody said they seen em heading down to the creek
Farmer Johnson's daughters just pulled up in a jeep
Man he knows how to grow em if ya know what I mean
Old Dave's gettin' loud but he don't mean no harm
It's just country boys and girls getting down on the farm

Ah let's get down y'all
Stay out of that hay",Down on the Farm,1997
Mick Lloyd,"She makes his coffee, she makes his bed
She does the laundry, she keeps him fed
When she was twenty one she wore her mother's lace
She said, ""Forever,"" with a smile upon her face
 
She does the carpool, she P.T.A.'s
Doctors and dentists, she drives all day
When she was twenty nine she delivered number three
And ev'ry Christmas card showed a perfect family
 
Ev'rything runs right on time
Years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines
He thinks he'll keep her
Ev'rything is so benign
The safest place you'll ever find
God forbid you change your mind
He thinks he'll keep her
 
She packs his suitcase, she sits and waits
With no expression upon her face
When she was thirty-six she met him at the door
She said, ""I'm sorry, I don't love you any more""
 
Ev'rything runs right on time
Years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines
He thinks he'll keep her
Ev'rything is so benign
The safest place you'll ever find
God for bid you change your mind 
He thinks he'll keep her
 
For fifteen years she had a job and not one raise in pay
Now she's in the typing pool at minimum wage
 
Ev'rything runs right on time
Years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines 
He thinks he'll keep her
Ev'rything is so benign
The safest place you'll ever find
At least until you change your mind
(He thinks he'll keep her)
