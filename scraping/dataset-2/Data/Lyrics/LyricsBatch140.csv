I'm the type who takes love literally

Diana Ross,"You, heard somebody sayin'
That I loved another
They don't know, it's not easy fakin'
Lies about your lover
Nothing they could tell you
Would change the way it feels
But when they, try to come between us
We still have each other

I've heard it all, and I have my faults
But I could never hurt you, I love you through it all

Take the bitter with the sweet
Two hearts are stronger together
Love can be forever
Take the bitter with the sweet
We can't let rumors affect us
We just, have to trust

I, want you more than ever
No matter what they told you
If they pry, doesn't really matter
Long as I can hold you 

People can say what they want to say
But you know that I love you, it's better every day

Take the bitter with the sweet
Two hearts are stronger together
Love can be forever
Take the bitter with the sweet
We can't let rumors affect us
We just, have to trust",Take the Bitter with the Sweet,1989
Diana Ross,"Stand up, stand tall and be counted
Divided we fall, together we stand, together
Our love has all never doubt it
Alone we fall, together we stand, together

When we're playin' the game of life
What we pay is a heavy price
If you choose the wrong path, you will lose that's so right
Be prepared, you might have to make some sacrifice

I can feel we can make it
I believe, when there's no longer separation, we'll succeed
Here's a chance, better take it
Time won't wait for us, everyone come on

Stand up, stand tall and be counted
Divided we fall, together we stand, together
Our love has all never doubt it
Alone we fall, together we stand, together

I'm afraid we will never learn
That's why I'm sayin' I'm so concerned
Turn around and look, this court is adjourned
Before we get beyond the point of no return

Leave us not be forsaken, let me speak my peace
The pen is mightier than the sword or so it seems
Here's a chance, better take it
Time won't wait for us, everyone come on

Stand up, stand tall and be counted and be counted
Divided we fall, together we stand, together
Our love has all never doubt it
Alone we fall, together we stand, together

On the stage of a theater, a production of
All the feelings that we're feeling, all surrounding us
In the words of a playwright, one is not enough
To experience the act called love, called trust
Called love, called trust, come on all

Stand up, stand tall and be counted and be counted
Divided we fall, stand together
Our love has all never doubt it, never doubt it
Alone we fall, together we stand

Stand together, together, stand together, come on all
Stand together, together, stand together
Stand together, together, stand together, come on all
Stand together, together, together, together

Keep on dancing
So you don't have to fee the pain
Keep on, keep on, keep on dancing
So you don't have to feel the pain

Fate has dealt you a losing hand
Ever since the day that your life began
Wish you had some stronger ties
There's no one around to hear you cry
Move on up now, don't you see
Stop pretending you need a quick release
In the nighttime, in the rain
Like a moth drawn to the flame

Keep on dancing
So you don't have to fee the pain
Keep on, keep on, keep on dancing
So you don't have to feel the pain

Some people think they have everything
But they're living in emotional poverty
They use their fronts making deals oh, mighty sharp
There's no love and they're bankrupt in the heart

From yourself you can't run

I live on a battlefield
Surrounding by the ruins of a love we built
And them destroyed between us
The smoke has cleared
As I stumble through the rubble
I'm dazed, seeing double
And I'm truly mystified

My new home is a shell-hole filled
With tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around, there is desolation
Scenes of devestation
Of a love been torn apart

I live on a battlefield
Though one where not one
Single drop of blood has spilled
Is no less horryfying
Sweet memories
Of a bygone situation
Lie shattered, torn and battered
And scattered all around

My new home is a shell-hole filled
With tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around, there is desolation
Scenes of devestation
Of a love been torn apart

Everything that can, has gone wrong
It's gonna take spine to carry on
Like a drownin' woman coming up for air
I'm looking for another survivor
I can't see one anywhere

My new home is a shell-hole filled
With tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around, there is desolation
Scenes of devestation
Of a love been torn apart

I live on a battlefield, hey
Can't go on, baby

Diana Ross,"Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems, dear,
Love has gone away.
Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it.
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.

But I'll blame it on the sun;
The sun that didn't shine.
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees.
I'll blame it on the time,
That never was enough.
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea,
But my heart blames it on me.

Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?
Wish I could tell you what I am feeling,
But words won't come for me to speak.

Oh, I'll blame it on the sun
That didn't fill the sky.
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees.
I'll blame it on the day
That ended much too soon.
I'll blame it on the nights
That could not be,
But my heart blames it on me.",Blame It on the Sun,1991
Diana Ross,"You're trying to tell me something
Every time I come near
I got a feeling the message
Is the one I don't want to hear
You can deny all you want to
But I know you enough to know
Why not come right out and say it
You've been trying to let me down slow
So let's talk before the tears drop

You've had a change of heart
Well I guess that's up to you
I couldn't change my heart
Even if I wanted to
You've had a change of heart

Your kiss sends a message
And I detect the signs
I got enough understanding
Of a lover to realize
That you can't make him love you
Though I give you my best
You're keeping your heart at a distance
And it breaks me up to confess

Change of heart
Well I guess that's up to you

You've had a change of heart

Or is this change gonna last?

But trying's not enough
Acting like strangers

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;

Right by my side

Should we try and stay

Might be a fantasy

Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby

Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes
I care not for myself but for those
Who've never felt the joy we've felt
Whenever you are near
I hear a symphony each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air now
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
Oh so close to me, baby, baby

Baby, baby, I hear a symphony, a tender melody
Ah it goes on and on",I Hear a Symphony,1993

Diana Ross,"Mom was cooking bread
She wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low
Rolled to her feet, she just didn't know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh no matter how she tried, she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her

In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train
I married a guy, was livin' high
I didn't want him to know her
She had a grandson, two years old
I never even showed her

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you are not to blame, Momma, I miss you

Came the telegram
Mom passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best, ah! cookin', cleanin'
Always in the same old dress
Workin' hard down on her knees
Always try'n to please
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you've done your best
Momma, I miss you
Won't you forgive me Momma
For all the wrong I've done
I know you have done your best
I know you have done your very best you could
But I never understood
Workin' hard on your knees
Momma, you were always, always tryin' to please",I'm Livin' in Shame,1993
Diana Ross,"Keep falling in and out of love
In search for what I'm dreaming of
I long to find a love I'm sure about
That certain kind of love that moves all doubts

Keep falling in and out of love
Still searching for that special one
To whom I can give my love completely
And feel a lasting love so sweetly

Just when I feel sure love's here to stay
It seems to suddenly just fade away
Can't seem to find that everlasting love
That this heart of mine needs so much of
Keep falling in and out of love
Can't seem to find the lasting kind
It seems I can't find the joy I need
Love always somehow all goes wrong for me

Keep falling in and out of love
Keep falling in and out of love
I keep reaching out for tenderness
Touching a hand that holds emptiness
Well I'm looking for a love that lingers on
Long after that first kiss is gone
That kind of love that keeps burning bright
Long after we've said goodnight

What I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born  in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, by society
Love child, always second best
Love child, diff'rent from the rest
Hold on, whoa

I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me
Don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't want to please you
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'

And, oh my darling, now you're gone

Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there
You closed the door of your heart and turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked just one way
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Hung up to dry in the teeth of the wind

I thought that we were supposed to make it
Where did we go wrong?
How could life give us love then take it away?

Alone again today
Remembering when we were a brand new morning
We weren't afraid to feel
All that we asked was somewhere to hide

We were like happy children
Reaching out to touch everything that's real
We believed in love
'Cause our lives were touching inside

And baby, remember the things we needed
The summers and the winters and springs we needed
The feeling we would fly
And on wings we needed to share

Remember the people, how few we needed
We always had the me and the you we needed
If every little thing that we knew
We needed to care was there

Then where did we go wrong?
And isn't time supposed to heal me?
Where did we go wrong?
And can a part of you still feel me?

As much as yesterday a touch a world away
We were the time of crystal
Shining for love to see
Both of us gave the things we receive

We were like hungry people
As I gave to you so you gave to me
Believing in our love
'Cause we love the things we believe

Baby, remember the dreams we needed
The nights we couldn't sleep
And these dreams we needed so we could find the time
For what it seems we needed to say

Remember the touches
To show we needed to keep our love
And keep our love the glow we needed
And being here without you
I know we needed to stay that way

I thought that we were supposed to make it

Thought I had my degree
In life and how to love
What if you run?

I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Folly and fun

I was so right, so right
Thought I could turn emotion, on and off
I was so sure, so sure
But love taught me
Who was, who was, who was the boss

I'd defy
Anyone who claimed that I
Didn't control
Whatever moved in my soul

I could tempt, touch, delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight

Somehow it just slipped out
I swear that I would take it back
If I could right now

I'd forgotten where I was
With you there so close to me
I thought that we were still in love

Oh I knew just what I'd done when you stood up so fast
And say the friends that we'd become, can't hold on to the past

Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
Then I spent so many nights Just thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here, with that  look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now

Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

You can not ignore

You alone know how I feel down deep inside
I promised you I'll never stray from by your side
But now I'm looking back on all those yesterdays
The many times I let you down
I'm begging I can hear you say

Tell me again that you love me
And you'll love me till the stars fall from the sky
Tell me again that you love me
And the love you have for me will never die

I can tell when first we start to drift apart
The emptiness just takes hold of my wounded heart
You know I need to feel you by my side
'cause when the night is cold and I've been so bold
There's no need to hide

Just tell me again that you love me
That you'll love me till the stars fall from the sky
Tell me again that you love me
And the love you have for me will never die

And if you light the way
I will follow you into that land of gladness
No more sadness

Tell me again that you love me
That you'll love me till the stars fall from the sky
Tell me again that you love me
And the love you have for me
The love you have for me will never die

Diana Ross,"Some things you never get used to

It's the same routine of getting up every morning
And putting on a smile
But underneath there's another person
Who can't find a reason to make living worthwhile

Ah, another day to get through
Without the love that once was mine
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you and not having you
I'll never get used to

I've gotten used to not listing
For familiar sounds you used to make
Now I'm trying to get out of the habit
Of calling your name first thing when I awake
Look here

It's like a child's first step
I have to learn to walk all, all over again
'Cause you were always there if I should fall
And now there's nobody else that I can call
It's like wanting you and not having you
I'll never get used to

Lost in a cloud
I think I caught a glimpse of you
Blindly I rush to touch your hand, huh
To discover it's my mind
Playing tricks on me again
Tricks on me again

Some things you never get used to
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again

You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do
And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little, then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying, trying, anything for you

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I want to get you where I can let you make all that love to me
I'm on a journey for the inspiration
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love

You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little then you swallow slower
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you, oh
You gotta plan, your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is

Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I want to get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
Instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you
With no more left to say
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
You let me hold you for the first explosion
My arms will cover you

What are you hoping for, do you know?

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

(p. zizzo)

I know it's on your heart
That a love like ours
Shall never fall apart
You're so afraid of the rain
So I'll take your hand
And I'll love you in the best way that I can
And I only expect the same

Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know
You'll never make me cry
Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try

Though I'm sure of what I feel
I never thought a love
So true felt so unreal
And I'm a little afraif myself
If you love me day by day
With an honest heart and just a little faith
Baby time will tell the tale

Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try

Diana Ross,"Time after time

Now 'till my life is ended

So many tears
That you have turned to smiles

Dreams are for dreamers
Who somehow lost their way
Once you find the secret
There's no need to be afraid
And tell the bad dreams to just go away

In your dreams you found the lock
In your prayers you'll find the key

My love will guide you
High above the stars
In dreams you can do many wonderful things
Even find out who you are

When you dream I'll be there
Just picture me in your mind
When you're scared

Hold on to me

To make you dreams come true

Diana Ross,"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me

You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone, alone, why

Just the other night
I thought i heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms

I can hear your prayers
Your burdens i will bear
But first i need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

You are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone

Who looked just like you

Just like I never met you
Why is it only I can cry
And you can say goodbye in a minute
Don't you remember I was your friend
And you can just erase all those days
And those tender reflections we bear
We promised not to fall in love
But it was there and soon I was in it
Already I was more than your friend
It's harder for me

No words or expressions
Can make you hungry for me
I've never seen you on your knees
Like I'm beggin' you

Don't give up, give up on each other
Back where we started
No love to hold us down
I'll never give another anymore than I gave to you
Will never come around

Always and always
You told me love was ever and ever
Together the dream will come true
If we turn back
If you turn back to me

You won't be sorry if you stay
I'll stake my life upon it
Little flame inside us can be fed
Take our precious love to the limit
It's the one that you need and it's your friend
It's harder for me

No words or expressions
Anything that makes you worry
I've never seen you on your knees
And I'm in a hurry
How is it you can break my heart
But you can't be sorry
Push away whoever you please
But I'm begging you

Don't give up, give up on each other
Back where we started
No love to hold us down
I'll never give another
Anymore than I gave to you
Will never come around, oh

I know you're here
I feel you close to me
So much to say but
Making all the words
I save them all inside
Then I see you and they disappear
Like leaves beneath the snow
And life don't wait for everyone
And yesterday, I let you go

I'm watching you tonight
And I waited for so long
I've been living on your memory
In a world where we were one
And you told me you could make it on your own

I'm watching you tonight
And it's making me cry
When I lost you, I lost everything
But our love should never die
Not mine, my love is born to be your love
Oh baby
To make history near you
But the moment when I see me in your eyes
You're gone, you're gone

You can say goodbye if you want to
I love you but I'll try to understand
But in my soul I know it's meant to be
Together you and me

But I know you came to fade away
Like voices in the wind
And I wonder if you feel my love
It's stronger than it's ever been

I'm watching you tonight
And there's no other one
All the love we gave eternally
Now it's dying in the sun

Gave up everything to keep love satisfied
Baby the air that I breathe you will take when you leave
All because of this something small
Like the day I missed your call
I tried to get in touch with you
When I finally did you said we''re through

Why must we fall in love to find out how to cry?
Build up trust, then tear it down, oh tell me why
When it takes so long to make it
And no time at all to break it off

Then you walked away I just stood there numb
I had nothing to say
Into the night you walked away with my life
And feeling almost half my size
I looked up and the heaven''s eyes
Smile was gone we used to see
She knew that you were standing there with me

Why must we fall in love to find out how to cry?
Build up trust, then tear it down, oh tell me why
When it takes so long to make it
And no time at all to break it off

One day up then the next day down
Love will keep you going like a merry go round
To keep you hurting, hurting
You both tried night and day from the start
To keep your love from falling apart
Then all at once you left one out
And love walks out the door
You''re searching baby, for something else
You''ll never find that thing you have before

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

But that was many, many years ago
Abandoned in a pile of useless junk
I found her never to be lost again
While I'm around her
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
Just give me a bad hat and some old funky clothes
We don't care if folks are laughing
When we're on the road
Can't you feel that surge of power
Going 18 miles an hour
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
She ain't even paid for but she's mine I suppose
Once they tried to repossess her
But she wouldn't start
God bless her
Spunky hunk a junk my funky rolls
For 30 years she got by on her looks
That was chic, that was very chic
Her face appeared in all the motor books

Once a week each and every week
When they checked her gasket out
The old girl blew it
Funky was a lemon
She never knew it
But I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls
She's got Plymouth headlights and
A tank full of holes
Once I thought I really lost her on Cid Boulevard
Funky found the love she needed
Metaphor, overheated
I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls

But you're always in my heart until we meet again

Did time have to take our live in different directions
And it hurts cause there's no way for me to reach you

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out.
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me.
Don't think I don't need you,
Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.
 
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.

They always find Him there

He alone decides
Who writes a symphony

And He lights ev'ry star
That makes our darkness bright
He keeps watch all through
The dark and lonely night

He still finds the time
To hear a child's small prayer
Saint or sinners call
They always find Him there

Though it makes him sad
To see the way we live
He'll always say
""I forgive""

He says, ""I forgive""

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

Oh what a feeling to be loved

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day
To be love, to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved

Some wish to be a king or a queen
Some wish for fortune and fame
But to be, truly, truly, truly loved is
More than all of these things

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away to hear from each day
To be loved, to be love, to be love
Oh what a feeling to be loved
To be loved, to be loved, oh what a feeling

Lifted up to the clouds by a kiss
Never felt nothin' like this

Is that me, I don't recognize?
Love's the one thing I know all about

But what about trust? What about tenderness?
What about tears when I'm happy?
What about wings when I fall?
I want you to be, a story
For me that I can believe in forever
And what about, love?

Will you be my light in the storm?
Will I see a new world in your eyes?
With you my whole spirit rise

And what about hope? What about joy?
What about tears when I'm happy?

How still we see thee lie.
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And, gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth.
And praises sing to God the King.
And peace to men on earth.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,

As we go marching down the trail
Right along, right along

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the Zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charmes us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers in the wilds
And starve together, dear in Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny on a roll
In Central Park, we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy




",Manhattan,
Diana Ross & the Supremes,"I've got a boy sweet as honey
Penny pincher but they tease him
Penny pincher 'cause he doesn't spend his money

A penny pincher that's what they say
So from him, other girls shy away
But I love him for what he is
All his love, he truly gives

He may not drive a car
But I love those walks through the park

A penny pincher, he may be
But oh, he means
He means the world to me

I don't care if he won't spend a dime
Just as long as I know he's mine

Let them tease him, call him cheap
But in my book he can't be beat
I love him for what is within
A tender loving trusting friend

I don't care if he won't spend a dime
Just as long as I know he's mine

But his love means the world to me

When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
So I must go
Where destiny leads me

With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
And after the day
The darkness will hide me

But maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter

'Cause with you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away

With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to

Diana Ross & the Supremes,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and we walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered at the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said she got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

Papa said to mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it just don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, papa caught it and he died last Spring

I can't break away from his kiss, 'cause his kiss I surely miss
All my life I needed someone to need me, so I do my very best to please him
But the more and more I care, the more of him other girls share
When I need a hand to hold, that's the time he leaves me all alone

Just keeps me, keeps me cryin' myself to sleep
Nothing but heartaches oo, nothing but heartaches
But I can't break away, oh, no, keep a loving him more each day
Oo, I can't break away from his arms
I can't break away from his charms
I can't break away from his kiss, 'cause his kiss I'll surely miss

To him I'm loyal, to him I'm true
Why can't he be the same way too?
But the more my love has grown, the less love he has shown
He makes promises he doesn't keep
Sometimes I don't see him all week

Just keeps me, keeps me cryin' myself to sleep
Nothing but heartaches oo, nothing but heartaches
But I can't break away, oh, no, keep a loving him more each day

It's the same routine of getting up every morning
And putting on a smile
But underneath there's another person
Who can't find a reason to make living worthwhile

Ah, another day to get through
Without the love that once was mine
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you and not having you
I'll never get used to

I've gotten used to not listing
For familiar sounds you used to make
Now I'm trying to get out of the habit
Of calling your name first thing when I awake
Look here

It's like a child's first step
I have to learn to walk all, all over again
'Cause you were always there if I should fall
And now there's nobody else that I can call
It's like wanting you and not having you
I'll never get used to

Lost in a cloud
I think I caught a glimpse of you
Blindly I rush to touch your hand, huh
To discover it's my mind
Playing tricks on me again
Tricks on me again

she wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head.
Always had her stockings low, 
rolled to her feet, she just didn't know.
She wore a sloppy dress,
No matter how she tried, she always looked a mess.
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate.
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her,
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her.
 
In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found.
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet.
I must have been insane,
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain.
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train.
I married a guy, was livin' high,
I didn't want him to know her,
She had a grandson, two years old, 
I never even showed her.

She wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low
Rolled to her feet, she just didn't know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh no matter how she tried, she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her

In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train
I married a guy, was livin' high
I didn't want him to know her
She had a grandson, two years old
I never even showed her

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you are not to blame, Momma, I miss you

Came the telegram
Mom passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best, ah! cookin', cleanin'
Always in the same old dress
Workin' hard down on her knees
Always try'n to please
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you've done your best

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I need you baby

Sleep walk
Instead of dreaming
I sleep walk
'Cause I lost you
And now what am I to do
What to do
Can't believe that we're through
I don't care how much you tell me

Sleep talk
'Cause I miss you
I sleep talk
While the memory of you
Lingers like a song
Darling, I was so wrong
But I'll be right someday

The night
Fills my lonely place
I see your face
Spinning through my brain
I know
I miss you so
I still love you
And it drives me insane

Sleep walk
Every night
I just sleep walk
And when you
Walk inside the door
I will sleep walk no more

Every night
I just sleep walk
And when you
Walk inside the door
I will sleep walk no more

You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected
A hurt, scorned, rejected

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

I started my life in an old, cold run down tenement slum
My father left, he never even married mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplating
Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
The child we maybe creating

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, (scorned by) society
Love child, always second best
Love child, different from the rest

Mm, baby (hold on, hold on, just a little bit)
Mm, baby (hold on, hold on, just a little bit)
I started school, in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out
I knew the way it felt, to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

Don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't wanna please you
No child of mine 'll be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

I need to find, find someone to call mine
But mama said you can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You gotta trust, give it time

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait how much more can I take
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone

Diana Ross & the Supremes,"You think that I don't feel love
What I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born  in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, by society
Love child, always second best
Love child, diff'rent from the rest
Hold on, whoa

I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me
Don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't want to please you
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'

Love child, never quite as good
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood
But I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

she wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head.
Always had her stockings low, 
rolled to her feet, she just didn't know.
She wore a sloppy dress,
No matter how she tried, she always looked a mess.
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate.
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her,
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her.
 
In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found.
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet.
I must have been insane,
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain.
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train.
I married a guy, was livin' high,
I didn't want him to know her,
She had a grandson, two years old, 
I never even showed her.
 
I'm Livin' In Shame, Momma, I miss you.
I'm Livin' In Shame, Momma, I miss you.
 
Came the telegram, 
mom passed away while making homemade jam.
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side.
She always did her best, Ah! cookin', cleanin', 
always in the same old dress.
Workin' hard down on her knees,
always try'n to please.

Doch ich weiß nicht was mir fehlt

Sei bereit

Manchmal in der Nacht
Hab ich fantastische Träume
Aber wenn ich aufwach quält mich die Angst

Sei bereit

Manchmal in der Nacht
Lieg ich in Dunklen und warte
Doch worauf ich warte ist mir nicht klar

Sei bereit

Manchmal in der Nacht
Spür ich die unwiderstehliche Versuchung
Einer dunklen Gefahr

Sei bereit Sternkind

Ich hör eine Stimme die mich ruft
Sei bereit Sternkind

Ich kann eine Stimme hören

Sei bereit

Manchmal in der Nacht fühl ich die Macht eines Zaubers der mich
Unsichtbar berührt

Sei bereit

Manchmal in der Nacht bin ich so hilflos und wünsch mir es käm einer
Der mich führt und beschützt

Sei bereit

Manchmal in der Nacht
Kann ich es nicht mehr erwarten
Ich will endlich eine Frau sein und frei

Sei bereit

Manchmal in der Nacht
Möcht ich Verbot'nes erleben
Und die Folgen sind mir ganz einerlei

Sei bereit Sternkind

Ich hör eine Stimme die mich ruft

Sei bereit Sternkind

Ich spür eine Sehnsucht die mich sucht

Sich verliern heißt sich befrein
Du wirst dich in mir erkennen
Was du erträumst wird Wahrheit sein
Nichts und niemand kann uns trennen
Tauch mit mir in die Dunkelheit ein
Zwischen Abgrund und Schein
Verbrennen wir die Zweifel und vergessen die Zeit
Ich hüll dich ein in meinen Schatten
Und trag dich weit
Du bist das Wunder
Das mit der Wirklichkeit versöhnt

Mein Herz ist Dynamit
Das einen Funken ersehnt

Ich bin zum Leben erwacht
Die Ewigkeit beginnt heut Nacht
Die Ewigkeit beginnt heut Nacht

Ich hab mich gesehnt danach mein Herz zu verlieren
Jetzt verlier' ich fast den Verstand
Totale Finsternis
Ein Meer von Gefühl und kein Land
Einmal dachte ich bricht Liebe den Bann
Jetzt zerbricht sie gleich meine Welt
Totale Finsternis
Ich falle und nichts was mich hält

Sei bereit

Machmal in der Nacht
Denk ich ich sollte lieber fliehn vor dir
Solang ich es noch kann

Sei bereit

Doch rufst du dann nach mir
Bin ich bereit dir blind zu folgen
Selbst zur Hölle würd ich fahren mit dir

Sei bereit

Manchmal in der Nacht
Gäb ich mein Leben her für einen Augenblick
In dem ich ganz dir gehör

Sei bereit

Manchmal in der Nacht
Möcht ich so sein wie du mich haben willst
Und wenn ich mich selber zerstör

Sei bereit Sternkind

Ich hör eine Stimme die mich ruft

Sei bereit Sternkind

Ich spür eine Sehnsucht die mich sucht

Won´t you stop telling me lies

Turning and swirling and whirling ´round me again 
Twirling and curling ´round me 
Turning and burning and yearning for me again 
All my life with you

It is a chance, a romance
It´s a dance we do

Turning in circles we go
Turn like the seasons
Turn back to me once again
Never let me go

Tell me you love me
Tell me that you´re mine again
Tell me you won´t turn away
Turn like the seasons
Turn back to me once again
Circling all the way

Turning and swirling and whirling ´round you again
Twirling and curling ´round you
Turning and burning and yearning for you again
All my life with you

Turning and swirling and whirling ´round me again 
Twirling and curling ´round me 
Turning and burning and yearning for me again

Diane Armesto,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,2008
Diane Armesto,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Diane Ball,"It's a brush fire spreading, feeding as it moves
It's a disappeared glacier; it's the airborne flu
It's your disbelieving eyes logging concrete miles
It's your yawning conscience and your lawyer's smile
It's an occupied country foaming at the mouth
No smoking gun, no mushroom cloud
It's a military mother with a boy in hell
And it's a flag-draped casket down an oil well
It's an Argentine school-girl gagged and bound
It's a torture camp; it's a long way down
It's the constant bracing shock of now
And it's the whole damn world turned inside out, alright
It's a march to extinction with your god in step
It's his name in your mouth; it's his cross on your neck
It's a farm boy sprinting over desert dirt
And he's panting the 'Our Father' in staccato spurts
Now that's his automatic rifle and it tells no lies
It's his truth in your stomach, it's no alibi
But the trouble lies on the other side
With an equal truth prepping for his holy night
He sees the crescent and the star blink in the virgin sky
And hears the call of milk and honey from the afterlife
And as he eases to the checkpoint, he is calm and sure
It's collateral damage; it's the cost of war
It's another bag of bones for the Gods to sort
It's just another bag of bones for the Gods to sort

Well it's a species disappearing, all the birds fly south
In a January heatwave, in a pulsing crowd
It's an African Militia, kids with sub-machines
It's a conflict diamond on your bride-to-be
It's the dispossessed lining up at every gate
It's the facts worth facing, faced way too late
It's the mission of modernity, go get what's yours
Til there's nothing leftover to go get no more
And it's not what we're owed, but it's what we've earned
And it's closer than we realize, and it's time now to burn
And oh it's time now to burn
And oh it's time now to burn
And oh it's time now to burn, to burn",In His Time,1999

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Diane Birch,"A strange kind of love
A strange kind of feeling
Swims through your eyes
And like the doors
To a wide vast dominion
They open to your prize

This is no terror ground
Or place for the rage
No broken hearts
White wash lies
Just a taste for the truth
Perfect taste, choice and meaning
A look into your eyes

Blind to the gemstone alone
A smile from a frown circles round
Should he stay or should he go?
Let him shout a rage so strong
A rage that knows no right or wrong
And take a little piece of you

There is no middle ground
Or that's how it seems
For us to walk or to take
Instead we tumble down
Either side left or right

Diane Birch,"When the sky breaks it rains
So just let the H2O splash upon the graves
Of all the souls I used to know but now have passed away
Men say that time can heal a situation
But this pain is not a passing phase
Now I'm curious how many years a heart can ache
Feel like a Minotaur meandering this darkened place
Trying to find a way to maybe find the light of day
If I could rewind then I'd re-live my life again
And sit and hold my nan's hands while she felt the pain
And say hello to old mates behind the pearly gates
Given the chance to glance back at my childish face
I'd try and smile the way I smiled just like a child again
Before I had to say goodbye to anybody
And the loved ones I've lost all had life within their bodies
My side was less lonely then
You wanna cry well come and hold me then
I think I need the blessing of some holy men

'Cause everything is different now
I'd really like to tell you how
How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like I laughed but I cried
But I wish I could push rewind

If I had minutes on my hand just like a time piece
I'd turn the clocks back and maybe try to find peace
As well as my ID, so rewind me
Just like a video cassette cause I'm upset that I ain't seen
Some faces in a while just apparitions in my dream
That ends abruptly when they try to hug me through the screen
Of smoke that's engulfing me
Like the coastline with its high tide
And you can see the sands and the oceans meet
No one told me when this ride began to hold my seat
Time flies like Emmet Brown was in the driver's seat
You talk of irony
Well now I'm lonely
But I'm searching for my privacy
This life won't comply with me
I think I need some dead relatives either side of me
To keep me company and guide me through the library
Of neverending stories full of lies and deceit
Hi Ho Silver, Lone Ranger riding to the beat

'Cause everything is different now
I'd really like to tell you how
How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like I laughed but I cried
But I wish I could push rewind

If I could rewind time to its slowest
I'd look at life at its heights and its lowest
So I could maybe try to recollect
What made me who I am besides a poet
Besides a poet

How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like I laughed but I cried
But I wish I could push rewind",Rewind,2013
Diane Birch,"I sit and wonder where you’re gone
Have you found a head to ground that stays under when you push it down?
I sit and ponder what went wrong
Was I too emotional?
Too many puzzles for your simple soul
Does she let you sleep
When she’s awake

Does she close her eyes and pay the asking price
Does she suffer with the smile
Take a penny for a song and it’s all
Part of loneliness drinks the honey of your promises
Does she know that’s all the love you got
That’s all the love you got
Does she know that’s all the love you got

And tell me does it feel the same
Is she close enough to hurt
When she takes it does it make it worse
Can you still kill a perfect day
With a twinkle in your eye
Do you still awake when she’s asleep

Does she close her eyes and pay the asking price
Does she suffer with the smile
Take a penny for a song and it’s all
Part of loneliness drinks the honey of your promises
Does she know that’s all the love you got
That’s all the love you got

You belong to no one
You are easy to be around because

Picking up diamonds so heavy
I had to leave them all behind
Coming up from the mine shafts sparkling bright
See me laughing, having nothing in an infinite night
Clear and dangling in the light

Switchboards are corroding in the micro-ranging waves
Did you receive my love across the telepathic desert
A million signals singe for every syllable that's saved

Today I sent you love
I wonder if you will receive it
They shoot it down so often
I have watched it and believe
That if it never reached your mind
And it fell short your heart
It's fallen to the desert floor where
Scorpions and sun torched and stung it all apart

Do not misunderstand me

From the bleaching of the bones

At the end of the road where I sit in the morning
The weeks have been hazy but something is changing
I watched the sun convince the weakest cloud to let it through
It said ""I would have gone crooked but for you""

There's a sticky orange vine here
And it grows over everything
I don't know what they call it
I call it 'Darling Creeper'
I give names to the flora and to the fauna
Most descriptive of their character to me

And there's snakes I have been warned about
There's rattlers in this roundabout
They come in from the chaparral
They crawl beyond the gravel now
That I like it when I'm sitting with things around me moving
It may look like I'm brooding
Like I'm getting not much done

But oh! there is a cure here
The light is very pure here
I'm gathering my strength like a consumptive in the sun

His red rock garden in the turnaround road where I sit in the morning
It gets kicked around the cul-de-sac
By those who go and double back
As if there is no-throw affair in absence of a beaten track

And red ants are moving with their sick and withered comrades
They carry the bodies of the withered in their mouths
Because it is no big deal
Hey, what else is there to do
But set your sight on something and pull your tangles through

That i’m sorry for causin' her pain
Causin' me pain?

We are the only ones that you can trust
You’ll become fear
They’ll become dust

You are the smoldering vessel of punishment 
Born to do nothing but justify us
Give us your empathy we’ll give you lust

Give up your childish obsession with questioning
Anything we don't tell you is irrelevant
Everything you've ever been is replaced by the 
Metal and fire of the weapon you clutch

Diane Dufresne,"The morning sun touched lightly on
The eyes of Lucy Jordan
In a white suburban bedroom
In a white suburban town

And she lay there 'neath the covers
Dreaming of a thousand lovers
'Til the world turned to orange
And the room went spinning round

At the age of thirty seven
She realized she'd never ride
Through Paris in a sports car
With the warm wind in her hair

So she let the phone keep ringing
And she sat there softly singing
Little nursery rhymes she'd memorized
In her Daddy's easy chair

Her husband, he's off to work
And the kids are off to school
And there were oh so many ways
For her to spend her days

She could clean the house for hours
Or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked through the shady street
Screaming all the way

At the age of thirty seven
She realized she'd never ride
Through Paris in a sports car
With the warm wind in her hair

So she let the phone keep ringing
As she sat there softly singing
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized
In her Daddy's easy chair

The evening sun touched gently on
The eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the rooftop where she climbed
When all the laughter grew too loud

And she bowed and curtsied to the man
Who reached and offered her his hand
And he led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd

At the age of thirty seven
She knew she'd found forever
As she rode along through Paris
With the warm wind in her hair",The Ballad of Lucy Jordan,2010
Diane Dufresne,"Oh the wind whistles down
The cold dark street tonight
And the people they were dancing
To the music vibe

And the boys chase the girls, with curls in their hair
While the shocked too many sit way over there
And the songs get louder each one better than before

And you singing the song thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you singing the song thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight

So you're heading down the road in your taxi for 4
And you're waiting outside jimmy's front door
But nobody's in and nobody's home till 4
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
Talking about Robert Ragger and his 1 leg crew
And where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?

And you singing the song thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

Diane England,"I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there

And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all",The Winner Takes It All,2012
Diane Hildebrand,"A distant nightbird mocks the sun
I wake as I have always done
To freshly scented sycamore
And cold bare feet on hardwood floor

My steaming coffee warms my face
I'm disappointed in the taste
But there's a peace the early brings
The morning world of growing things

I feel the moment hurry on
It was today, it's died away
And now it is forever gone

And I will drink my coffee slow
And I will watch my shadow grow
And disappear in firelight
And sleep alone again tonight

Diane Horner,"Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack.
I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.
Dwight Yoakim's in the corner, try'n' to catch my eye.
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey, the stars might lie, but the numbers never do.
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight.

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream 
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

No matter what they are
Since nobody knows how they'll come in

So wish me a luck
Because I'm going to bet on
A sentimental hunch
My heart has suddenly settled

Somehow I'm sure I found a sure thing in you
Something within tells me we'll win
Somewhere my heart has picked you out of the blue
And since I'm only a beginner, a winner I'll be

But win or lose whatever comes up
Your thumbs up with me

One thing I'm sure, I'm sure of
All my life through
If love can figure out a sure thing
That sure thing is you

Listening for those footsteps
Through the echo of your own
Suddenly it hits you
All those dreams weren't worth a dime
'Cause no one ever tells you in time

Long before
The icy winds of winter
Autumn tells the swallows
Time to fly
So why do we pretend
Till the bitter end
Till it breaks our hearts
To say good-bye
Well

No one ever tells you
That it's just another fling
No one ever warns you
When your heart begins to sing
Someone tells you later
All is fair in love and war
But no one ever tells you before

Long before
Our love boat's torn asunder
We can hear the thunder
Of the falls
So why do we go on
Sailing madly on
Till all we had is gone
Beyond recall
Beyond recall

No one ever tells you
That it's just another fling
No one ever warns you
When your heart begins to sing
Someone tells you later
All is fair in love and war
But no one ever tells you before

It never comes easy
'Cause no one
No one, no one
Ever tells you
Tells you
No one ever tells you before
No one ever tells you before
