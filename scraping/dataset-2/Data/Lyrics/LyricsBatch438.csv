And we in the street life until they call the law (Ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (What happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet (Got em)
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 a.m.: we was at the club (What happened?)
2 a.m.: 10 bottles of bub (Money ain't a thing)
And about 3-something I was thinking about grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (Twisted)

Talk a buck 80 If the bentley is the topic (That Grey Poupon)
But of course gotta fly ...? (Where?)
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (Get Your Money Up)
Drive 80 up Lenox cause I got an urge (Speeding)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous living in the fast lane (Ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'mma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (Let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

Jim Jones,"[Bizzy Bone]
Motherfuckers ain't gon' get at me like that nigga [laughs]

And ready for warfare
They ain't ridden me of nothin but weapons of war playa
Pick up the double for reverends and devils
More weapons will give 'em the bite there
But the war yeah, he got us a sword right out of a drawer
Now give me a reason this isn't assault, my fault
Caught up in the crosshairs, here's more playa
They thought it was over and it was a wrap
I tap-dance, for the paper, escape in a world that they never did care playa
And when it was written, the devil didn't deliver it in your mail
And what do you know, it's just like livin in hideous times here
Addicted to kick it, compete with the price
Pour me some ice, yeah, now give me some liquor to get with the vibe
For quicker than fast to get with the mass
The underclass is what they call it
Call me a drunk or an alcoholic I'm ballin, motherfucker!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'ma-I'ma keep it thug 'til the day that I die
I'ma keep it thug 'til the day that I die
See ya - see ya boys hatin cause you see a nigga ballin
Sippin-sippin on the Hennessy until a nigga fallin

[Jim Jones]
Jones... now I'ma push it to the limit, I was dyin to be the boss
And we was up early cause grindin was a sport
Rewindin in my thoughts, late 90's it was cold
Lost a friend every month, couldn't survive another loss
My niggaz in the pen, until we meet again
Picture me in the Benz, blowin weed in the wind
I caught a few cases, and now the Coupe races
Right through the Westside, floor seat at the Lakers, the milli-makers
Uhh, and do you know what that money mean?
The wintertime turn to sunny scenes
50 thou' on my dungarees, I made it rain like it's thundering
But the money got me nervous
My niggaz pack guns cause I ain't tryin to get murdered
And the feds tryin to serve us
Cause we ballin, but I'ma thug 'til I die
Until I hug the sky - Jones!

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
As soon as we judge you give me the grudge you get it away from me
Always seem to be druggin the bud, they get with the scrubs
I'm sittin here waitin for somebody daily
Hopin for love cause shit it is hard enough, myself, get 'em away from me
Probably does continue to move it and groove it
And why you never get rid of me
Can never get rid of beef, nobody know me and nobody owe me, I get it myself
I'm earnin respect and wealth up under the belt, the baby can feel the welts
Been livin in poverty, livin and prosperous
Livin in the matrix, I'm gettin it how
Huh, I'm movin this shit, I stay on the edge and ready to smash
And we better then that, Lord I hope we kick it to get it together real fast
Together at last, under the bridge, you know what it is, move my ass
Drunk or an alcoholic I'm ballin, even if I'm crawlin
Quicker than fast, now get with the mass
The underclass is what they call it, motherfucker

Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money

Just clean my fancy car

This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

Reminiscing on my first slant,
By the time I was sipping on my first Schlitz
Hit the game, I started as a look out,
See the fly cars that the big wheelies pushed out,
Dirt bikes popping wheelies by the cookout, that was that summer,
I was thirst to be plumper. It pays better but the risk was worst,
Save the fly leather copping kicks with the work.
It didnt work; I was fucken up the re-up.
Bottles at the tunnel, that was 98, I called papa for the bundles,
An easy ten grand, it felt like a hundred,
These Gucci belts by the stomach, with guns in them.
Its only wealth that we want, if we run wit em
Till the death, until the feds come and get em
Byrd gang money, it started off that Byrd Kane Money
New cars, in that third lane money!

Just clean my fancy car,
Picked up my fancy clothes,
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only real niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

Getting money is the hardest,
Your first hundred grand is a job
Your first cool million, you're an artist.
Especially if the niggas up the block, sell garbage
Told it, crumbles all apart when you hold it
Wasn't naturally born a crook, I was molded
Drugs kept my uncles in the green, so I sold it
Even learned to smell a good grade through the packing
Headed Midwest and got financial backing
Started networking with the wheelies on credit
Any concepts of being robbed I was debited
Anybody get it, don't come a day later with the eigth money
Got to play it out, cause I said it
Courts an acquittal, coming in the club with an entourage
Me I'm the boss in the middle.
The brain and the bran roc-a-house rope around the neck
A lot of letters for the chain, and the charm. Come on man

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

At a young age, no bricks just grams
Nigga stuck, then your mans a flip
The situation real, then your mans a hit
You slow on the get-a-way, the can you get
You circle the block, you play track and field
A lot of real niggas on that track got killed
But you know me forever manning up,
Never sit down when I pee, forever standing up
I'm a boss, so I'm calling the shots,
Big homie, pioneer of the block
You wanna pump, nigga Ill tell you when and where at
Don't face-fight; I'm not the one to stare at.
Matter of fact dog, you and your man sits,
In the back off cop car, dog, pointing your index
I guess you could, cause you a Sammy the Bull
But somebody gonna die if a hammer get pulled.

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

Now what would Diddy say if he caught you in my coupe
On the way uptown if the ball get loose
Tearin' through the blocks, tearin' of the tops
Sun all in your face and it's glarin' of my rocks
I had to ask her how she felt, said let's ride she ain't strap on a seatbelt
I stay fly, fitted cap with a mean belt thats the thug shit that's makin' her knees melt

Boy I trust you and all
But I've been here before you
You remind me of pain
But I can't ignore you

After I met you boy
I try my best not to
Think of you
Such a silly game to play
To eventually just lose to you

Can I get another chance to hold you tonight
Dance on my left and things feel so right
Hold you boy with all of my might
Just don't let you slip away
I pour my heart out to you from now to daylight
So you could know hurting you was never my right
I'm trying to see what's in the cards for tonight
Boy accept this as my plea

[Chorus]
I love you
I love you
I love you (Hey, hey)
So don't break my heart

I felt a weight lift from my chest
Now that you know just how I feel
I held it in for far to long
I couldn't tell if this was real

I never thought I'd understand
How it feels to be hurt and to love again (Oh, no, no)
You made it possible for me
That's why I'll give you anything

Can I get another chance to hold you tonight
Dance on my left and things feel so right
Hold you boy with all of my might
Just don't let you slip away
I pour my heart out to you from now to daylight
So you could know hurting you was never my right
I'm trying to see what's in the cards for tonight

Just like the stars in the sky
You brought light to my life
That's why I love you
Just don't break my heart

Without you by my side
I was wasting my time
But now I love you
Just don't break my heart

Look, I think she love me (love me) I think she love me not(not)
Anywhere I touch her turn to a hot spot
Look into my eyes tell me what you see A grade A hustla, a certified G
Only one question, what attracted you to me the way I do me make you weak to your knees
Now Cheri you know a nigga can't wait to put my hands on that little cherry coke bottle shape
Like uh you said a nigga make ya heart jump like uh
You said a nigga give you goose bumps like uh
Send chills up and down ya spine uh
Yung Joc like to watch you from behind

Just like the stars in the sky
You brought light to my life

Why you worried about balling, cause I am balling
I'm just ready to blow the bank on you girl
You know we just splashing them this year
It's all about that splash life
I still live the fast life, I blow the bank though

I got at place in mind, for my move to LA
Or my mansion in NJ, we can party in the sky

Where you wanna go?

From Manhattan to my hood, where my money's never good
We can spend it playa, tell me what you want

Trying to scoop something nice (fly girl)
Trying to put you on the flight
I'm a jumper, we can do Aruba tonight
Or we can jump in the coupe and just shoot for the night
She was dancing in the club with her pumps in her hand
Trying to tell her that The Trump was the plan
Trying to get her out of the club
And have her jump in the Lamb (Murcielago)
Konichiwa, we can jump to Japan (you like sushi?)
Or we can just do the tropics
We need more problems cause the money ain't the object
Probably get mad cause the smokes in the cockpit (so what?)
Chest cold as a froze up locket

I wanna blow the bank with you
Spending all that money, spending all that cash
I wanna blow the bank with you
Spending all that money, spending all that cash, let's go

In Atlanta, popped up like a toaster (I'm burnt out)
Did Miami in the soft-top roadster (drop top)
Rose champs, spilling drinks on the sofa (champagne don't stain)
Thank god for the chauffeur
Where to little lady?
She's my designated driver
Bad little be, like the destiny survivor (she's a dime)
We can see the sun rise up
Speeding to the room in the V getting highed up (hit that, hit that)
Or we can jump through the block
Brand new whip, so you can jump through the top
Hop out like who got bank
Then we blow it all cause you know we gonna ball

Some niggas call it tough love
It's crazy cause
You might know a nigga all your life
And he got a twisted alterier motive
And he just wanna see you do bad
See a smile on your face all day
So he just acting like your friend
When he is really your enemy
Or your best friend can become your enemy
Through the the jealousy
So we call those frienemies

Knew him since a child
Played cops and robbers
My best partner grew up to be monsters
Stayed in my crib
Ate out my fridge
We was on a grind
Even wore the same clothes
My brother
Fucked the same hoes
His beef was mine
Even had the same foe
We was inseparable
Joined at the hip
I let you get the checks
I kept the joints on the hit
And what happened
The sneaky hating
Niggas in your ear
And a plan deviating
Snakes in the grass
Just waiting for the moment
Niggas on your team
And they're really your opponent
Play the game
And you know goes booments
Mama said friends come by the dozen
Know I'm feeling for their guns
When I hug em'
I hate them from a close
From a distance I could love em'

The ones you love most

You know who you kiss
You know who you lift

The ones you kept secret
You had plans to make it
Frienemies
I smell danger
Over the money
Best friends become strangers

Bailed you out of jail
Wait let me backtrack
First you came home
Then I got your ass a deal
Fresh out the can
Signed a quater mill
Running through the paper
Buying copes and popping pills
Money got low
You started acting ill
You grew desperation
Once again you got nailed
Someone got killed
Conspiracy, and even still
I bailed you out of jail
Without me you would be facing
In a pale, barude nuders
You would be Judice
But in the process
Flew you in the world
Put diamonds on your neck
Like you were my little girl
Put money in your pocket
Like you was my son Su
Food in your stomach
Like you was my son Pooh
The streets talk
Heard you partnered Tru
Now you talking shit
Like you really wanna do it
A will-wack
The type that deceive you
Your mama should have told you
Never bite the hand that feed you
Caught me off guard
I met you through my man
I let my guards down
And accepted you as fam
Told you get a chair
Let you eat at the table
Never thought that he would be ungrateful
But guess what
I own the pub and the label
So if a nigga feeling itchy
I got killers on the paper

[Chorus]

Hope y'all paying attention
Keep y'all eyes open
Hope I ain't wasting my breathe
About this shit that I'm talking about
Cause it's so real
You gotta watch these niggas around you
Cause you never know whose who now a days
And all of our love we be showing
They might not be showing the same type of love back
Matter of fact
They might not be in there for your best interest
See an alterier motive is hard to see when
You've known a person for so long, or
You've became a custom to their ways
But you gotta stay on 50
You gotta stay on 50
Cause, you got some people that
Think like, if niggas is moving fast like that
Then karma will get em'
But sometimes karma don't come around fast enough
To handle the situation
But sometimes for us to learn a lesson
We go way to far
Then the consequences become way too heavy
That's what I'm trying to let learn from experience
And please don't be naive to the fact that
The nigga next to you could be the nigga that set you up for failure
Or even kill you
You know how the game go
And you gotta watch these bitches
These trifling bitches man they set you up for failure too
You know they're in there for the money man
Gold digging bitches
It's a fucked up world
But you probably won't even get a chance
You know, might put you up in a gang

It makes me laugh ha, life is so ironic, 
How I would get tha cash I become so iconable 
Cop the fast cars that come with the trip tonic panel 
I live the life that's filled with the jealousy 
Doomed from the start its like we born wit a felony 
Where's the longevity 
We in the place where best friends become enemies 
And foul nigguhs got the tendency 
You gotta watch what you wish for 
I hope to god its on a switchboard 
When I'm tryin to say a prayer and I'm callin' hope you listen lord

Gotta me smokin on this blunt while I'm lookin' at the sky 
Make it rain so I know the doves cry.

Its like my, my, my

We was goin' hard to many bottles up in free-vay 
You was goin' crazy wit my Haitian man t-sway 
Pass that on the twins I had teesh fer like three days 
And I can't forget you're be-day

And its a damn shame because nigguhs still upset

I'm tryin' to keep a positive mind movin' through the stress 
I'm tryin' to stay afloat, they say I'm doin' the most 
I'm doin' way to much I'm playin' death to close 
I'm think bout the thought of goin' back to court 
For the petty little games I really should avoid 
But its the calculator risk on how we make the chip 
Realizin' if I slip its a bottomless pit 
If you'd a filled my shoes, would you walk a mile 
Let the media tear you down and turn around and smile 
I thank god that I'm alive to see a black president 
We screamin' yes we can but that won't change the deficit

And drawin' down
This ain't no Western movie
Roll a Swisher, pass it to Ric

Onion ass on the strip
You fine but baby girl where your whip
It's jumpin' off

While I'm outtie on the West
I got the best weed
And the best hoes
I'm on the block at all times dressed in the best clothes
My focus is money 'cause pussy come natural
I only fuck wit those that can show me some collateral
I deal 'em all off top
I ain't a child molester or a killer
I don't need y'all props
Shit, if she wit me, she know what it is
We hotellin' and you don't deserve to go to the crib
If yo potna wanna roll she can roll
I ain't gotta touch
I like to smoke and watch you freaky hoes
And I could have my choice
Enie, meenie, miney, mo
Bust a nut, get the fuck
Play it how it go
My main ho called and told me she made some money
I said ""Bitch you ain't never come gave it to me!""
How many woman now done wanna get gangsta for me
Gotta be willin' to get down on your hands and stomach

Treat you like milk I'll let your ass get spoiled, (And?)
Said you wanna ride, I bought you brand new toys,(Take that take that)

We to close can't stop praying now 
Though there seems there's no one to this pain 
Every time I close my eyes I pray for rain 
I pray for rain to wash away the strain 

You couldn't understand how much the pain weight 
So in the hood we love the rainy days 
Cause subconsciously we know the suns coming 
We love the winter cause we know the summers coming 
Remember I got locked the same night my son was coming 
All I could do is pray that they don't take me away 
And lord knows I have the angel's on my side 
They search the car I had the hammer in my ride 
A miracle on Flatbush Avenue I still made it back 
To say push when she was having you 
A newer version a younger me I want him to go to school 
And raise him motherfucka free I swear some places I don't want him to be 
I swear some things I don't want him to see but new booty daddy
Loves you truly and the nights you don't see me you know daddy's on his duty

What's a poor mans pickle survive threw the poor pull a truck upfront 
And drive threw the store had to be a felon hated being proper 
Read the book of life and Satan was the author still I was the cooperative 
Rather be in Rykers the bugger had my baby momma running threw them 
Diapers all fo that shiting and all them pampers 
Grandma laid up with all of that cancer lid paint flaking constantly chipping 
Mama with that dark rum constantly sipping I vow to my name a bad transmission for getting in the game that's a bad transition 
One flick one night I'm ally ally out sin free for getting you a place with a g 
A couple heavy shots ima newer man ready go and get paper the hustler 
With the confetti

With just one chance it can change his circumstance 
And get the money baby lets get the money baby

This is the life
When the champagne spills and the Rollie on a nigga wrist glows

When the spotlight shines and the camera gets me with a sick pose

When the night time falls and the cash shuts everything down

Took the champagne glasses, please fill 'em up

The latest coop V's got the ladies loopy
Indulged in the world so we spend the paper loosely

Gazin' at the stars Ferrari engine rarrin'
At the red light and Harlem was the settin'

I'm married to a gang but didn't come for the weddin'
It started with the dealin' and dreams of four wheelin'
Comin' up I ran a amuck in the streets
Chasin' the fast bucks, stomach touch gotta eat

Now we orderin' breakfast, I'm sittin' at the table
Stackin' up my pancakes the syrups on maple
I gotta watch my brothers 'cause Cain can turn Abel
Gotta watch the money 'cause the thing can turn tables

Blowin' smoke through the pipes, gettin' ghost through the night
This is fast life livin', pick a coast if you like

In my life, a lot of haters talking shit
And I might, expose you hoes you out this bitch
And I ride, with the nine I won't fall or slip
If I die, they still will not get off my dick
But I try, to survive like Destiny's Child
And I smile, cause they been trying to test me a while
But I cry, cause not all my partnas alive
But I smile, cause I know all my partnas with God
In my life, a lot of haters baller blocking my shine
I stay calm, even though I ought to drop em a nine
In my life, I make cash using hoes
And my Sprite, is purple so I'm moving slow
On my side, my dogs moving rocks and hay
And I slide, by how I'm chopping blades
When I drive, I got a big cup of syrup
When I glide, I ride with a couple birds

I take the good with the bad, however the ball bounce
And lately, I've been walking on dangerous ground
It feels like my own partnas, don't want me around
Cause everybody in my crew, be trying to argue me down
They telling me I changed, and I'm not the same
But for the past three years, I've been saying the same thang
I've done a lot of dirt, but I don't brag about it
And since I don't rap about it, you don't know jack about it
People see me being friendly, and they think they know me
But just cause I shake your hand, don't mean you my homie
I got a personality complex, man I'm so complex
But if you come with plex, this ain't fun plex
I'm walking straight, but my mind's in a maze
The only thing that I'm afraid of, is being afraid
I done stared death in the face, I ain't budge one inch
He here beating up myself, and I still don't flinch
Somebody pinch me, I hope I'm dreaming
I'm searching inside my heart, trying to find the meaning of my life

It ain't all about the hoes, gold and ice
I go from down to up, up to down

Kings get crowned, the rich get rich
Where everybody live, screaming life is a bitch
I ball in the mix, and keep to myself
I don't just wanna be, another book on the shelf
A lot of y'all fakers, faking the game
I'm one of the real niggaz, that's bringing the pain
I've seen hard times, so I spit hard rhymes
I've been around, different people of all kinds
And to this day, I got a few riddle friends
Too many of y'all, that's so fake and pretend

I’m like Tony Danza, I’ll show you who’s the boss
Teach my worker who’s the fiends and who’s the narcs
It’s a lot of niggas out trying to prove they hard
‘Til you hit they cousin up, and make them move they aunt
Yo, I would wild out and let the Rug’ just spark
But you know how the hood be when someone screwed your start
All the basketball tournaments was cool to watch
Bet your money: lose a little, or lose a lot
They beat us by one point; yeah, them dudes was sharp
But I’m a sore loser, so I had to shoot up the park
I wouldn’t of robbed your man if the fool was smart

‘Bout to hit the crib, take a shower, watch a bootleg
Glad nothing popped off, got to get the bag out of the crib
Goose dropped off, so it can get knocked off
Then I got a sharp pain in my chest
About knowing I ain’t supposed to have it in the place I rest
Yes – but it’s a half a joint in there
Two .40 cals with the hollow points in there
Few bricks of diesel, couple pounds of purple
Gallon of the water, plus a thousand circles
A man hit me, saying that he’d be here in a minute
All I’ve got to do is wrap it, and bring it down to the rented
By now, it’s a little past five
And I’m still trying to roll, could barely open my eyes
Next thing I know, she giving me a massage
Instead of waking up rich, I woke up to a surprise

At five in the morning, I was up in this broad
At four in the morning, we was out the club door
A few hours before that, I was getting fresh in the store
Now a week before that, I was at the car lot
Thinking convertible so I can make the broad drop
A half a mill in cash off a three-month run
Them rubber bands stacks in ten-G lump sums
Police is on our back ‘cause we dump guns
So when Bird Gang’s outside, motherfucker, just run
We just dumb, like the hyphy life
I told you life was a bitch, not the wifey type
Help you get the right bricks, if the price is right
Catch you standing on the strip in the icy whites
Season of heirs, we in the V switching gears
Dropping the top, blowing weed in the air
She’s showing her ass, and
Next think I know, I’ve got a detective all in my face
Asking me all kinds of questions
I don’t know shit but get my lawyer

Well I forded the river

I paid all my bills

Gave a gift to the giver

Now I'm headed for the hills


I paid back my borrows

Likewise all my dues

I'll be gone tomorrow

Nothing here I can use


Headed for the hills

Headed for the hills

I can't hear 'em calling

Headed for the hills


Once I had a a woman

Deaf and mute and blind

Only one could hear me

When I tried to speak my mind


Once I had a fiddle

Once I had a bow

There's nothing on the griddle

But I paid back all I owed


Headed for the hills

Headed for the hills

I can't hear 'em calling

Headed for the hills


Can't roll off to glory

Much less Arkansas

Or freedom teritory

Till you satisfy the law


No love, lock and chain

Provides me the key

No blood-soaked law of Cain

Can set my spirit free


Headed for the hills

Headed for the hills

I can't hear 'em calling

Headed for the hills


Last thing I got to do

One thing before I go

To say my love for you

Was all the love I know


If you don't forget me

I'll do the same for you

Forever in your memory

To pay back all that's due

I went out walking up high timberline

Snow fell like kisses, the air sweet as wine

Calling me back to the days you were mine

So close to heaven, up high timberline

So close to heaven up high timberline

Way up on high timberline


Remember my love, do this for me

For I think of you all the time

Whenever the wind howls lonesome and free

From the peaks of the high timberline


Like a vision of angels the higher I climb

A mare and a stallion with traces so fine

Stepping like dancers in three-quarter time

The ghost of white horses of high timberline

The ghost of white horses of high timberline

Way up on high timberline


Remember my love, do this for me

For I think of you all the time

Whenever the wind howls lonesome and free

From the peaks of the high timberline


I love you and I always will

Although we for evermore part

Sierra Nevada remembers us still

Holds our love deep in her heart


For shame that the sun showed its face on the day

You and the rose on your cheeks slipped away

But the promises love made between us still shine

When we rode white horses up high timberline

Dancing white horses up high timberline

Way up on high timberline

Looking elsewhere, looking around

I sat me down, I sat me down

Looking for answers where they can't be found

I come around, I come around


Elsewhere, that's where I was looking

When I should have been looking right over there

Over and over, never too far

That's where I'll be looking, wherever you are


Looking for good love, for love sweet and true

Looking for you, I was looking for you

I knew when I saw you, that my looking was through

Brought you my heart, and I hope it will do


Elsewhere, that's where I was looking

When I should have been looking right over there

Over and over, never too far

That's where I'll be looking, wherever you are


Looking elsewhere from the sky to the ground

From the sea to the sunset, from the hill to the town

From the creek to the bar room, from the dawn till the sun

Sinks over the mountain and another day is done


Elsewhere, that's where I was looking

When I should have been looking right over there

Over and over, right over there

Sweet apple blossoms twined in your hair

It just rises higher on into the night

Back in old Arcadio
A hundred and eighty three years ago
Someone died by an act of god
Conducted through a lightning rod

No one bore witness but the chicken
Our Ken ran off like Dickens
Who's to blame is not in question
It's a haunted history lesson

Each generation is marked for slaughter
We will not let you go

Left Nova Scotia, once Arcadia
Settled in South Louisiana
Cold revenge followed us here
With lingering doubt and living fear

There's a proud family that won't forget
As far as we know, they remember yet
Only question I've got for you
Are you one of them, and if you knew

That I might someday rue
I saw the danger
Yet I walked
Along the enchanted way
And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf
At the dawning of the day

We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of the deep ravine
Where can be seen
The worth of passion's pledge
The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
And I not making hay
Oh I loved too much
And by such and such
Is hapiness thrown away
 
I gave her gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to the artists
Who have known the true gods of sound and stone
And word and tint, I did not stint, 
I gave her poems to say.
With her own name there and her own dark hair
Like clouds over fields of May.

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow
That I had wooed not as I should

My Kathleen shall again return.
And when thy old friends welcome thee
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
Where laughs the little silver stream
Beside your mother's humble cot
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.

Jim McCann,"Once in the dear dead days beyond recall .
When on the world the mists began to fall
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng
Low to our hearts love sung an old sweet song .
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam
Softly it wove itself into our dream

Just a song at twilight, when the lights are low
And theflick'ring shadows softly come and go
Though the heart be weary sad the day and long ,
Still to us at twilight comes love's old song
Comes love's own sweet song 
Even today we hear love's song of yore .
Deep in our hearts it dwells for evermore
Footsteps may falter, weary grow the way
Still we can hear it at the close of day
So till the end, when life's dim shadows fall
Love will be found the sweetest song of all

Just a song at twilight, when the lights are low
And theflick'ring shadows softly come and go
Though the heart be weary sad the day and long ,
Still to us at twilight comes love's old song
Comes love's own sweet song 
",Love's Old Sweet Song,1996
Jim McCann,"I wish I was in Carrickfergus
Only for nights in Ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
Only for nights in Ballygrand
But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
And neither have I the wings to fly
I wish I had a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over my love and I

(This verse is only sung on the 40 years cd)
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times there spent so long ago
My boyhood friends and my own relations
Have all past on now with the melting snow
So I'll spend my days in this endless roving
Soft is the grass and shore, my bed is free
Oh to be home now in carrickfergus
On the long rode down to the salty sea

Now in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her
But I'll sing no more now til I get a drink
Cause I'm drunk today and I'm seldom sober
A handsome rover from town to town
Ah but I'm sick now my days are number
Come all me young men and lay me down
Come all me young men and lay me down.",Carrickfergus,1998

Through the frosted window pane the sun grows bolder
Your hair flows down your pillow, you're still sleeping.

Tell you again the things I told you
Behold I give you the morning hm,

Far behind your flickering eyelids you're still dreaming
You're dreaming of the good times and you're smiling

Tell you again the things I told you
Behold I give you the morning hm,

Like an eager Christmas child the day is coming
Listen to the morning song it's singing.

Jim McCann,"I danced in the morning
When the world was begun,
And I danced in the moon
And the stars and the sun,
And I came down from heaven
And I danced on the earth,
At Bethlehem
I had my birth. 

Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

I danced for the scribe
And the pharisee,
But they would not dance 
And they wouldn't follow me.
I danced for the fishermen,
For James and John 
They came with me
And the Dance went on.


Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

I danced on the Sabbath
And I cured the lame;
The holy people
Said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped
And they hung me on high,
And they left me there
On a Cross to die.

Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

I danced on a Friday
When the sky turned black 
It's hard to dance
With the devil on your back.
They buried my body
And they thought I'd gone,
But I am the Dance,
And I still go on.

Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

They cut me down
And I leapt up high;
I am the life
That'll never, never die;
I'll live in you
If you'll live in me -
I am the Lord
Of the Dance, said he.",Lord Of The Dance,2006

Jim McCann,"As I came down through Dublin City
At the hour of twelve at night
Who should I spy but a Spanish lady
Washing her feet by the candlelight

First she washed them, then she dried them
Over a fire of amber coals
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so sweet about the soul

Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye

As I came back through Dublin City
At the hour of half past eight
Who should I spy but the Spanish lady
Brushing her hair in the broad daylight

First she brushed it, then she tossed it
On her lap was a silver comb
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so fair since I did roam

Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye

As I returned to Dublin City
As the sun began to set
Who should I spy but a Spanish lady
Catching a moth, in a golden net

First she saw me, then she fled me
Lifted her petticoats o'er her knee
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so fair as the Spanish lady

Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye

I've wandered north and I have wonder south
Through Stoney Barter and Patrick's close
Up and around, by the Gloucester Diamond
And back by Napper Tandys' house

Auld age has laid her hands on me
Cold as a fire of ashy coals
But there is the love of me Spanish lady
A maid so sweet about the soul

Through the streets broad and narrow
Crying ""cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh""

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying ""cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh""

And sure, t'was no wonder
For so were her mother and father before
And they wheeled their barrow
Through the streets broad and narrow

And it's too late for changin' 
When this race has been run 
Take me back where I came from 
And let me return what I took from the ground 
When this body won't carry me no further 
Take me back 
And lay me down 
This east Texas red dirt 
Won't grow much of nothin' they say 
'Cept tomatoes and peaches 
They mostly drill for oil nowadays 
And a hired hand named Regan 
First made me understand 
And he told me the red was the blood of my kin in the land

And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay

And settle down quiet some where 
I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile

Jim McNabb,"Love is but a song we sing,
Hear a way we die.
You can make the mountains ring,
Hear the angels cry.
Tho' the dove is on the wing
You need not know why.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Some will come and some will go,
We shall surely pass.

Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

Jim McReynolds,"Now let me tell a story, I can tell it all
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey, the son, he drove the load
And when his engine roared, they called the highway thunder road

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis Town
The revenuers, they chased him, but they couldn't run him down
Each time they thought they had him, his engine would explode
He'd go by like they were standing still on thunder road

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

On the first of April, 1954
The federal man sent word, he better make his run no more
He said 200 agents were covering the state
Whichever road he'd try to take, they'd get him sure as fate

“Son”, his daddy told him, “Now make this run your last
Your tank is filled with 100 proof, you're all tuned up and gassed
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through
I'd rather have you back again than all that mountain dew”

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

Roaring out of Harlan, revving up his mill
He shot the gap at Cumberland and screamed through Maynardville
With G-men on his tail light, roadblocks up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels feared to tread

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden, there they made the fatal strike
He left the road at ninety, that's all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

",Ballad of Thunder Road,1994
Jim McReynolds,"I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
A little place called Hamburger Dance
I heard that old jukebox playing
A song about a truck driving man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I put a nickel in the jukebox
And play that truck driving man

The waitress just brought me some coffee
I thanked her but called her again
I said that old song sure does hit me
'Cause I'm a truck driving man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I put a nickel in the jukebox
And play that truck driving man

I climbed back aboard my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got that old truck wheels rollin'

Under branches lit up by the moon.

As our days disappeared all too soon.
But I've wandered much further today than I should
And I can't seeem to find my way back to the wood.
So, help me if you can I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one.
You;d be surprised there's so much to be done,
Count all the bees in the hive,
Chase all the clouds from the sky.
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh.
Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do,

Got a honey jar stuck on his nose.
He came to me asking help and advice
And from here no one knows where he goes.
So I sent him to ask of te Owl if he's there,
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

For they both have the very same sensation

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.

Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you

They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps

Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel 
Since God is marching on. 

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! 
His truth is marching on. 

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat 
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat 
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! 
Our God is marching on.

Jim Nabors,"The streets are always wet with rain
After a summer shower when I saw you standin'
In the garden in the garden wet with rain
You wiped the teardrops from your eye in sorrow
As we watched the petals fall down to the ground
And as I sat beside you I felt the
Great sadness that day in the garden

And then one day you came back home
You were a creature all in rapture
You had the key to your soul
And you did open that day you came back to the garden

The olden summer breeze was blowin' on your face
The light of God was shinin' on your countenance divine
And you were a violet colour as you
Sat beside your father and your mother in the garden

The summer breeze was blowin' on your face
Within your violet you treasure your summery words
And as the shiver from my neck down to my spine
Ignited me in daylight and nature in the garden

And you went into a trance
Your childlike vision became so fine
And we heard the bells inside the church
We loved so much
And felt the presence of the youth of
Eternal summers in the garden

And as it touched your cheeks so lightly
Born again you were and blushed and we touched each other lightly
And we felt the presence of the Christ

And I turned to you and I said
No Guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the father in the garden

No Guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father and the
Son and the Holy Ghost

If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying: ""My god, that's tough
She's stood him up""
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to well wouldn't do
The role i was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much, as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me in doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
Or if He really does exist
Why did He desert me in my hour of need
I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul,
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally

She wasn't what you'd call a blushing flower

Well, that's what comes from too much pills and liquor.
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen,
She was the happiest, corpse, I'd ever seen.

To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Born is the kind of Israel.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain,
That Jesus Christ is born. 
While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.

The shepherds feared and trembled,
When lo! above the earth,
Rang out the angels chorus
That hailed the Savior's birth.

And lo! When they had heard it,
They all bowed down to pray,
Then traveled on together,
To where the Baby lay.

Down in a lowly manger

Or was it in your eyes

And I call myself an island
And luckily I find
That you're the sea around me
And are with me for all time

Falling in love with you
Was learning how to cry

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me,

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1996

And your skin's getting colder

And you try to move towards her
But you can't move your shoulder
And you're sight's getting dimmer
Maybe if you kick her
But your leg's getting weaker
And she's such a deep sleeper
And you would get a snorer
To share your last hour
You sure picked a winner
And time's seeming slower
And now you can't see her

I may act like a bombardier

Take a walk, through it's molding streets

Like a plant
That needs reminding

That it's nothing
Without soil

Like the seeds in an apple

I guess now I know you feel more at home
With a case of Handi-Wrap

You'd hold your own if you thought that it was clean
At least give me some gloves to wear
Or a picture of St. Augustine

If I were to die with these things on, can't say I didn't try

I'd think that you would try to find something to do
With my old school tie
That doesn't turn my skin blue

Is it hot in here, or do I feel a little draft
From these pants that you brought for me to wear
The ones that have no back

If I were to die with these things on, you might want to try
Another size

I'd take your name, if I thought it'd do me good
If it's all the same to you
I'll just take a look under your hood

If you were to die with this thing on
You coulda chose a better style

And now that you've gone off
And all of this has passed

But you left behind your mask

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream 
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will

More lost without you and so it goes

As we stood at the station in the rain
A whisper was saying from a pine tree close by
When we heard the whistle of your train

I heard the moans of sobbing of the wind in the pine
I felt the cold icy fingers of fear from the spine
For I knew in my heart, you'd never be mine
And I heard a heartbreak last night

For I knew in my heart, you'd never be mine
And I heard a heartbreak last night",I Heard a Heart Break Last Night,

And the silence tells me, she is gone

These walls will hide me, when I cry
And pray that heaven lets me die
What good is life, when hope is gone?

Will fade into the distant past
And if I must live and love alone

Then windin' down that old familiar pathway
I'd hear my mother call at set of sun

Were woven around supper time
When my mother used to call

But you know for me time has woven the realization of
The truth that's even more thrilling and that's when
The call come up from the portals of glory
To come home, for it's supper time

When all of God's children
Shall gather around the table

That man will live for evermore because of Christmas Day

While Shepherds watched their flock by night they see a bright new star
Then hear a choir of angels sing music seems to come from a far
Now Joseph and his wife Mary come to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to lay the child not a single room was in sight
Hark now hear the angels sing...

By and by they found a little nook in a stable so forlorned
In a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born
Hark now hear the angels sing...

And it brings back sweet memories dear to me
'Though it's faded and worn, it's as precious as the morn
When I found it 'neath our first Christmas tree

I thrill with every word, every line
Guess I'm always sentimental 'round this time
Pardon me if a tear falls among my Christmas cheer
It's the memory of an old Christmas card

You know, I don't know why I get to feeling sentimental
About this time, every year
But every time I see a Christmas card
I somehow can't help reminiscing

About the very first Christmas that you and I spent together
What a beautiful Christmas card you gave me that year
Why I know you must have looked through thousands of cards
To find that wonderful poem that still brings a tear to my eyes

Jim Reeves,"Ja ek verlang na jou my liefling en ek droom van jou oe so blou
Ja ek dink net aan jou my liefling en my hart is'n mantel van rou
I gaze at the stars with a prayer in my heart
I ask for bitter strength just to hate and depart
Ja kom nou terug na my my liefling ek verlang na my liefling vanaand

Jim Reeves,"On a mountain stands a mansion so fine and it looks down on this cabin of mine
I had a love and I loved her true but along came a rich man and loved her to
Now on a mountain in a mansion stands my love

Well he promised he'd buy her diamond rings yes he promised fancy dresses and things
He promised everything indeed but it can't buy the love that her poor heart needs
On a mountain in a mansion so fine

Now I know that she's not happy there and I know that she's got thing to bare
My only dream is that someday she'll come right back here and stay

Jim Reeves,"When a record starts to spinnin' and love words make a song
I think of a million sweethearts but only one I could own
Today your life is music and famous they say you'll be
Darling sometimes write a lonesome waltz for me
Put in some pretty love words as fresh as the summer rain
I'll punish plenty teardrops and pretend you're mine again
And if some day you'll find you're just a used to be
Please come back and dance this lonesome waltz for me

When a story's told and music for millions to hear its cry
There's always someone lonesome who'll hang their head and cry
A waltz's so soft and touching a love's so cold and lost
Darling please for old time sake let's dance the lonesome waltz",Lonesome Waltz,1968

Jim Reeves,"(When you are gone)
When you are gone there's no fun with the crowd
I find myself crying even crying out loud (crying out loud)
I could find fun but I'd still be alone
'Cause my world simply stands still when you are gone
When you are gone my heart knows it well (knows it well)
And it just won't believe these stories I tell
Just can't get used (can't get used) to this being alone
And there's nothing to live for when you are gone

But I just couldn't stay couldn't stay away for you see I still care
I couldn't stand not knowing what this man you'll marry's like
What a sad trip to your wedding but sadder coming back
When you take his hand and make your plans the plans we made are through
And though it hurts and hurts how it hurts my best to both of you

I received your invitation and I held it in my hand

Jim Reeves,"Last night was the worst night of my life, no doubt
'Cause while I stayed at home, someone else took you out
I cried 'cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me, how I missed me at your house last night

I missed holding hands, walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight?
I missed me, how I missed me at your house last night

Did the neighbors say they noticed anything strange?
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change?
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light?
Did they miss me like I missed me at your house last night?

I missed holding hands, walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight?

Jim Reeves,"South of the border, hey I know a lad
He's got more fun than anybody's had
Don't got no worry, don't got no dough
Everybody's wondering about Mexican Joe

In old Mexico they call him the Rhumba King
Leads all the women around on a string
When they go out they get a million thrills
But the lovely senoritas wind up with the bills

Dancin', romancin', always on the go
Sun shining down on Mexican Joe

He makes the night spots all along the bay
People want to see him when he comes their way
He spreads so much joy everywhere
He goes everyone shouts Viva la Mexican Joe

He likes to gamble at poker, he's an ace
He's always lucky with the cards at ever face
At winnin' the money, he is sure a whiz
But when they win they don't collect
'Cause they don't know where he is

Dancin', romancin', always on the go
Sun shining down on Mexican Joe

He don't got no income tax 'cause he don't got no dough
Still he gets along just fine how we'll never know
He's got everything he wants, a girl, a song
If we use his formula we surely can't go wrong

His favorite playground is anywhere there's girls
He's got that something that sets their hearts a whirl
It couldn't be his money 'cause he ain't got a peso
But when he wants a kiss all he's got to do is say so

Dancin', romancin', always on the go
Sun shining down on Mexican Joe",Mexican Joe,1968

Again let me see
The one who is holding
The best part of me

Look at my side of town
Remember if you change your mind

Each night I look up at your mansion
I can see the window where the light shines through

I'm walking the floor over you,
I can't sleep a wink that is true.

I love you more than I can ever tell,
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine,
But you went and left me here with troubled mind.

With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtles so bright with emerald dew
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue.
Oh, I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm ev'ry heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming, idols were clay
All portions of love then had all flown away.

Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart now is wond'ring misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell.

Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flow'r
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I'm longing to see him through life's dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower.",Wildwood Flower,1968

Burned them gently one by one
Before I'd light the flame I'd read it
To try and find the wrong I've done

The first you wrote me was the sweetest
The last one broke my heart in two
Our love is there among the embers
Of the ashes of your letters tied in blue

Today I burned your old love letters
I watched our love go up in smoke 
I lived again those precious mem'ries 
I heard each tender word you spoke

Of the ashes of your letters tied in blue.

The records that you bought the hi-fi we loved to play
The decorating man will come and rearrange them

That I'm gonna seek much more than them all

It gives me a chance to speak to my heart and to brace myself for the storm

The storm is coming I can feel it and soon we'll be driven apart

I might do something I'd be sorry for later
