Reik,"No buscaba nada
Caminaba sin pensar
Pero cuando vi tu cara
No me pude alejar

No me lo esperaba
Y no supe reaccionar
No encontraba las palabras
Ni un momento para hablar

Y tu mirada
Me corta la respiración
Me quema el alma
Y me acelera el corazón
Pierdo el control

Tengo todo para arriesgar
Siento que no puedo esperar
Llévame en tus sueños
Y no me dejes hasta el final
Tu mirada caí en mi piel
Y me va quemando otra vez
Cuando te desatas
Ya no se que viene después

Siempre dices tanto
Cuando vuelves a mirar
Pero eres como el aire
Imposible de atrapar

Es una estrategia
Una intriga nada mas
Voy haciendo que el misterio
Te descubra mas y mas

Y tu mirada
Me corta la respiración
Me quema el alma
Y me acelera el corazón
Pierdo el control

Tengo todo para arriesgar
Siento que no puedo esperar
Llévame en tus sueños
Y no me dejes ata el final
Tu mirada caí en mi piel
Y me va quemando otra vez
Cuando te desatas
Ya no se que viene después

Y tu mirada
Me corta la respiración
Me quema el alma
Y me acelera el corazón
Pierdo el control

Y tu mirada
Me corta la respiración
Me quema el alma
Y me acelera el corazón",Tu Mirada,2011
Reik,"Si fuera por ti, me harías sufrir
Casi sin pensarlo podrías mentir
Si yo nunca fui, tu historia de amor
No juegues conmigo, es mejor tu adiós

Tal vez esto es lo mejor
Que sufrir de amor
No lo hago por ti, no quiero seguir

Ya no quiero de ti nada
No puedo creerte nada
Vete y busca quien te quiera
Quien te aguante a tu manera
Por mi parte está perdido
Te he dejado en el olvido
Tan cansado estoy de ti 
Es mejor así, es mejor así

No puedes luchar contra la verdad
Por mucho que llores
No voy a cambiar

Tal vez esto es lo mejor
Que sufrir de amor
No lo hago por ti
No quiero seguir

Y aunque esta noche estoy despierto
Puedo decirte que me siento (siento)
Mejor así, mejor así
Mejor, mejor así
Mejor, mejor así
Mejor así
Mejor así

Ya no quiero de ti nada, 
Vete mucho a la chingada
Vete y busca quien te quiera
Quien te aguante a tu manera
Por mi parte está perdido
Te he dejado en el olvido
Tan cansado estoy de ti
Es mejor así, es mejor así
Es mejor así, es mejor así
Es mejor así",Es Mejor Así,2013
Reik,"Se que duele tanto recordar
Que sientes ganas de llorar
Pero no quiero hablar mirándote la espalda
Ya nos queda solo un poco más
La historia está por terminar
Y no quiero pensar que nos valió de nada

No hubo nadie que me amara tanto
Ahora entiendo claramente cuanto
Terminemos con la cara en alto este amor
Por esos días llenos de sueños
Por las sonrisas, que no volverán
Por ese beso que estuvo a punto de matar
Seamos cuerdos un momento
Por los recuerdos

Yo se que al fin la vida seguirá
Que alguien más encontrara
Y que lo nuestro sera un rastro del pasado
Ven, hay tanto que no estuvo bien
Y solo por última vez
Fijamos vida que esto aún no ha terminado

No hubo nadie que me amara tanto
Ahora entiendo claramente cuanto
Terminemos con la cara en alto este amor
Por esos días llenos de sueños
Por la sonrisa, que no volverá

Por ese beso que estuvo a punto de matar
Seamos cuerdos un momento, por los recuerdos
Por esos días llenos de sueños
Por la sonrisa, que no volverá
Por ese beso que estuvo a punto de matar
Seamos cuerdos, un momento
Por los recuerdos, por los recuerdos",Con la Cara en Alto,2013
Reik,"Te fuiste de aquí, sin pensarlo
Dijiste que no me amabas más
Yo te supliqué, quédate aquí
Yo no sé que haría sin ti, no creo soportarlo

Te fuiste de aquí, todo ha acabado
Y llora mi alma en soledad
La vida me puso junto a ti 
Nunca pude predecir
Me convertiría en tu pasado

Te fuiste de aquí, encontraste otra vida
Te fuiste de aquí, enterraste la mía
Aunque no estés, yo sigo respirando aquel amor

Te fuiste de aquí, descubriste otros brazos 
Borraste mis besos, me hiciste pedazos
Y duele ver que le entregaste a otro el corazón

Te fuiste de aquí, todo en silencio
Quedaron las huellas de nuestro amor, noo
Sueño que te abrazo una vez más 
Me despierto y ya no estás
Me estoy ahogando en el vacío, no

Te fuiste de aquí, encontraste otra vida
Te fuiste de aquí, enterraste la mía
Aunque no estés, yo sigo respirando aquel amor

Te fuiste de aquí, descubriste otros brazos
Borraste mis besos, me hiciste pedazos
Y duele ver que le entregaste a otro el corazón

Y aún siento en el aire, me acaricia tu voz
Me robaste la luna, el cielo y las estrellas

Te fuiste de aquí, encontraste otra vida 
Te fuiste de aquí, enterraste la mía
Aunque no estés, yo sigo respirando aquel amor

Te fuiste de aquí, descubriste otros brazos 
Borraste mis besos, me hiciste pedazos
Y duele ver que le entregaste a otro el corazón

Ohh ohh Le entregaste, a otro el corazón",Te Fuiste de Aquí,2013
Reik,"Odio amarte 
Y odio que me hablen de ti 
He decidido olvidarte 
Y está bien claro que sin mi eres feliz 

Pero ni pienses que me quedare con los brazos cruzados 
Llorando y suplicando por ti 
Yo me levantare y esta vez jurare 
Que no voy a volver a buscarte 

Para curar este dolor 
Para que sane mi vida 
No hay nada como un par de tequilas 
Que me ayude a olvidarte 
A olvidarte 

Para curar este dolor 
Para que sane mi vida 
No hay nada como un par de tequilas 
Que me ayude a olvidarte 
A olvidarte 

Un par de shots de tequila 
Un par de shots de tequila 
Voy a dedicarme, a olvidarte 
A borrar tu voz 
Hacerme el fuerte 
Recordar que, sin ti estoy mejor 
Y voy a salir sin rumbo 
Ya no serás mi mundo, corazón 
Voy a sacarme tu veneno 
Con tequila, sal y limón 

Voy curar este dolor 
Para que sane mi vida 
No hay nada como un par de tequilas 
Que me ayude a olvidarte 
A olvidarte 

Para curar este dolor 
Para que sane mi vida 
No hay nada como un par de tequilas 
Que me ayude a olvidarte 
A olvidarte 

Ya enterré los recuerdos 
Todo lo que vivimos 
Los planes que hicimos 
Lo juro no te guardo rencor 
Y hablando claro, no existe un ahora 

Odio amarte 
Y odio que me hablen de ti 
He decidido olvidarte 
Y está bien claro que sin mi eres feliz 

Pero ni pienses que me quedare con los brazos cruzados

A olvidarte",Tequila,2013
Reik,"Entiende que aunque quiera perdonarte
No puedo, ya no sirvo para amarte
Me golpeaste, me arrojaste
Y en el suelo me dejaste
Y ahora pides que regrese como antes

No me quedan fuerzas para odiarte
Mi alma ya no puede repararse
Ya no siento, ya no veo
Y aunque intente no te creo
No me ruegues que quererte ya no puedo

Eras mi vida, eras todo
No entiendo porqué tú me traicionaste

Voy a olvidarte, voy a borrarte
Así que vete y no regreses
Que esto ya no me interesa
Es muy tarde para oír que te arrepientes

Voy a olvidarte, voy a borrarte
Ya no pierdo más mi tiempo
Ya no pienso estar sufriendo
Desviviéndome por ti en ser perfecto
Voy a olvidarte

Te dicen que es difícil encontrarse
A un amor honesto y entregarse
Yo te di mi corazón y lo rompiste en mil pedazos
Y es por ti que yo no vuelvo a enamorarme

Eras mi vida, eras todo
No entiendo porqué tú me traicionaste

Voy a olvidarte, voy a borrarte
Así que vete y no regreses
Que esto ya no me interesa
Es muy tarde para oír que te arrepientes

Voy a olvidarte, voy a borrarte
Ya no pierdo más mi tiempo
Ya no pienso estar sufriendo
Desviviéndome por ti en ser perfecto
Voy a olvidarte",Voy A Olvidarte,2015
Reik,"Años sin poder romper
Está soledad en mí
La supiste deshacer
Y ayudarme a revivir

Tus besos me cambian de estación

Al fin llegaste tú
Al fin llego tu luz
Salvándome de mi
Te doy mi corazón
Te entrego mi amor
Al fin estás aquí

Ohh

Los fantasmas en mi ser
Ya no están puedo avanzar
Las estrellas en tu piel
Son mi guía si estoy mal

Contigo no importa la estación

Reik,"Te siento conmigo
En cada latido
En mi corazón
Si me siento perdido
Encuentro el norte
Con sólo escuchar tu voz

Podrán pasar huracanes
Pero nada podrá contra mí

Porque tú serás
La luz que ilumine mi andar
Y el mundo se detendrá a mirar
Un amor de verdad

Un amor de verdad

Si estás a mi lado
No importa el pasado
Ya no hay mas dolor, oh no

El cielo nublado
Y el viento helado
Se fueron con tu calor

Podrán volver huracanes, no
Pero nada podrá contra mí

Porque tu serás
La luz que ilumine mi andar
Y el mundo se detendrá a mirar

Hoy el cielo entero bajé para ti
Mi vida
Hay algo importante que intento decir

Deja que me ponga
De rodillas para ti

Estamos condenados a vivir
Lejos y admitir

Bésame en sus besos
Como yo en secreto
Suéñame y déjame olvidar
Que somos dos náufragos sin más

Terco prometí
Hacerlo todo a un lado y no cumplir
Nos fallé, me rendí
Amor no me haces falta
Tu amor no me hace falta pero

Bésame en sus besos
Como yo en secreto
Suéñame y déjame olvidar
Que somos dos náufragos sin más

No está en mi olvidarte
Te siento aquí abrazándome
Respirándome, temblando sobre mí, es así
Aunque te fuiste no me suelto de ti

Yo quiero que sigas en mi vida
Yo quiero que vivas en mi piel
Si amarte es tan fuerte todavía
Qué gano olvidándote

No quiero cerrar estas heridas
No quiero curarme del ayer
Prefiero llorarte un día de vida
Soñando que piensas en volver

Mírame, no cambié
Soy el mismo ciego
Estoy en paz, te di mi amor y más
Aunque digan que yo me quedé atrás
Ahí después
Porque un día serás mía otra vez

Y el silencio me habla de ti, es que solo hay tanto espacio 
Desde que no estás, daría todo lo que hoy me queda

Distraído de tu foto no me despego

Necesito tu olor, necesito tu calor 
Necesito verte encima de mi en ropa interior

Reiko Kudo,"From the deep silence of my mind
Is something I'm trying to find
When it speaks you know you will hear my name
Not so complex in design
But harder to mind 
As I step, in vain 
Won't you come down to my arms
There's something I'm ready to say
Would you call, my name

Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each others love again 
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

A memory tells us that we're blessed
But opening up this chest
I discovered that a heart is lame 
Falling behind what we guess 
But trying to do our best 
Do we stop, do we stop in frame
Won't you come back to my heart 
There's something I'm trying to say
Would you call, my name

Look at where we are

Reil,"This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God

Since you finishin' 'em early, what posessed you to start him?
We made a vow later we'll regret 'til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, 'cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin' when you made us; so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, 'cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded wonderin' why
Cryin', pourin' out my heart, pourin' out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin' we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin' the truth
He had talent too, I had plans on watchin' him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein' him leave, or watchin him go

Listen
Listen
Listen
Listen

If you wonder why (why I live my life)
The way that I do ('cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (don't worry, don't worry worry)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper

You'se a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play 'em like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face
To straight breakin down and showin' all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit' you

We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends,
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here,

To brighten up the night, I have you love,
And we can face the music together,

I was unrecognizable to myself
I saw my reflection in a window, I didn't know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
On the Streets of Philadelphia

I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the Streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I my friend
My clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin

I can feel myself fading away

Reilly,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2002
Reilly,"The holly green, the ivy green
The prettiest picture you've ever seen
Is Christmas in Killarney
With all of the folks at home

It's nice, you know, to kiss your beau
While cuddling under the mistletoe
And Santa Claus you know, of course
Is one of the boys from home

The door is always open
The neighbors pay a call
And Father John before he's gone
Will bless the house and all

How grand it feels to click your heels
And join in the fun of the jigs and reels

Just friends, but not like before

Rein de Graaff,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1987

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far

Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2000

Reisho Yonemura,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995
Reiss,"I'm gonna double your lovin', double your fun
You get two for the price of one

It took me a long time to find a good woman
One that would be true
That's why I'm gonna double
What it takes baby to hold on to you

I'm gonna make my lovin' twice
As good as it was before
I'm gonna love you so good
You'll be begging and crying for more

Double, double lovin', is what I'm gonna give to you
And you're gonna receive double pleasure every time I do

Double, double lovin' makes
You feel so good inside
And when I double up on my lovin'
You're gonna be satisfied

I'm gonna double up on my huggin'
And my kissin' too
And I got a double stroke of lovin'
I've been dying to use on you

Don't be afraid to give me your love
'Cause I won't hurt you
You make the first step baby
And the rest I can easily do

I'm gonna double your lovin', double your fun
You get two for the price of one

Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?
Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?

To maintain, that's the price of fame
Walked in, lights dim, never knowing my name
Now it's sold-out shows, they try expose what I made
You a fake-ass rapper, you a hoe in a lane
And I made this life from picking holes in my brain
I was born with a vision, Alexander the Great
And that fake love creeping like the cancer I born
June 27th, 1993, I came on
With them black fists high and them blisters in it
Black boy, white friends, he don't know different
Days spent scrubbing on his face in the mirror
My blood bleed red so why them homeboys whisper?
Cold nights and dead friends, man, I still get shivers
I still wet the bed, I remember being with you
I see vividness in places I go
I see dead bodies flying of the ones that cut short
And these dreams that I'm living only present to crawl
And I love you, my nigga, but I'm doing the most

Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?
Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?

Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?
Won't you stay with me
Till the morning sun comes up?
Come away with me
There's nothing here for you, what's there to lose?",Pink Flower,2017

Remember when you used to call me
Got your North Face black pink suede up on me
Chicken head you used to call me
Now I'm dancing six-feet beneath the moon, I'm lonely
I wish she was the home, I wish
And these teardrops, flipflops, raindrops, false tales
Break shit I don't even say shit
Wish I never made this
Wish I had a penny for my look (outrageous)
Dancing like I'm basic, you was always basic
Fucking in my spaceship
Fucking 'til the cab screamed Mary had a face-lift
I be inspiration to the kids on the block
So never tell me nothing, tell me something I forgot

Confidence is terminated hatred in my fucking bones
Hatred fucking skinny naked fame I hope you fucking choke
Into my homicidal court cases and algebra

Me and my microphone in my room was twenty seven like the club
Dead kids, too short, life gone, mad drugs
Suicide genocide responsibility for us
Responsibility for us
Look inside the mirror looking venom but they paying us

Twenty seven like the club twenty seven different drugs

Rejuvination,"She cries, ""It's freedom that we need""
But I have yet to see a cause to believe
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)
It comes in waves of need
Ten ways to make you bleed before you get to die

Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?
This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims

Why spend our lives on bended knee
Choosing not to be free
He sighs, ""I'm quickly burning out""
All that's left of me are jaded memories
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)

Of what I could have been
If I had only been less of what they wanted
Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?

This is not a requiem we're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives on bended knee
Choosing not to be free and we're still here
All together and alone consumed with fear
That one day we'll discover how empty we've become

Sickened and ashamed
We crave what they provide us
So we'll never feel alone
Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful

Just to make it through?
This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives

Rekkenze Brass,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon [1934],1997
Rekkenze Brass,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Reks,"I'mma write this here rhyme like Guru's in the passenger
Standin on the East coast, starin out to Africa
Accolades, Escalades fade
My vernacular remain in tact for the generation that's comin after
The average rapper you praise days numbered like a calendar
Challengers caliber mediocre enter the catheter
IV's, wrap 'em up, mad as fuck, need a ladder up
Escalator, elevator, skyscraper, hella haters
On Primo beats, meditate a bit to elevate my spit
Scribble daily scripts, hell in wit
Angels I strangle the instrument mangle chop can't go pop
I gotta remain boom bap, true dat, who dat be?
Mr. 'Say Goodnight,' I'mma blaze the mic willingly
Kill or be killed industry, and the realest of the real emcees
Solo flow enemy, future of the rap
Golden Era dead {""No time for looking back, it's done""}

We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?

Before I fade to black, face the mirror, face the fact
Fate appear to backtrack where the plaques at?
Where the love for the cat?
Fortified flow, fire from fire like fame
Foresayer in Josiah desire to perspire
The 25th hour upon me, calmly walk the wire
Annihilate enemy ire any higher than I are in the sky
Or heaven I require less than mediocre
I reawoken the deeper thoughts of sleepin prophets
Regardless of others offers I authentic dialect, I'm a vet
Y'all are just wakin up, 'Say Goodnight'
Slap a rapper, take his mic, greater height
Spit a rhyme saber like
Inner mind paid the price, A-B-C-alike
Hey Preem, we a tight, chemistry
Any beats sent to me I'mma instantly write
'til the fingertips crippled
It'll be sort of arthritis to finish a line
If you more than rhyme this

We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?

You ever chant with the rebels, dance with the devils?
Answered the higher levels, ride with the iron elbow to elbow
In hellish circles where the heat is echoed
You ever let go, stresses from pressures boilin beyond the kettle?
You ever petrified, exorcised demons
Believing you leave 'em breathin they'll get even
Odds are beyond y'all, achievin peaceful means of seekin deacons
Ain't no way out, they 'bout beat, by any means
Ain't necessary but they bury them very young, hell or heaven
Them adolescents, is pedalin, packin metal and settlin
Street wars, revolves life behind tight walls
When I falls, psychos strike the right chords
They at pause, bumpin Ricky Ross
Kids is on crack, they lost
Wipe a lot, no time for looking back, it's done
Golden era over and dead, I'm over your HEADS~!

Relic,"J'ai vu un homme pleurer sa misère,
Tendre la main et faire l'aumône
Avec un air à mon grand-père
Garder la foi était lprincipe du père de ma mère
Petit clin d'oeil pour ne pas perdre le Nord
J'écris pour ne pas oublier, tous les pleurs de lAfrique du Nord,
Sud, Est, Ouest
Mais relevez tous la tête
N'oublions pas le Rwanda, ce génocide à coups de machettes
Trop lourde est la peine
Vous comprendre c'est difficile mais plus facile quand on vous aime
Mais que dire de plus, que la vie n'est qu'une épreuve
Que ce n'est pas une fin en soi
De finir veuf ou même veuve
Que la vie continue, que j'ai vu l'jour étant nu
Que ma mise en terre, d'un simple linceul je s'rai vêtu
Mais essuyez vos larmes, la vie vaut d'être vécue
Cet ignorant, lui, s'est pendu parce que sa femme le fait cocu
Message d'espoir, parait-il qu'on n'a plus le droit
Ni d'avoir faim, ni d'avoir froid
Mais ceci est une autre histoire.

Gardez la pêche le temps d'un titre quelques rimes pour ceux qui souffrent
On garde l'espoir pour ceux qui doutent, un brin de soleil pour ceux qui luttent
On sait que c'est dur mais on y croit, cette vie nous flingue mais on luttera
Faut rester forts tant qu'on a l'âge, il faut se battre tant qu'on est braves.

Vivre d'amour et d'eau fraîche, la citation qui me fait rire
L'incitation nous fait périr, la joie des autres me fait sourire
Le monde entier est rempli de mômes, de pauvreté et d'hématomes
Gardez l'espoir qu'un jour ça change, en terres d'Afrique ou en Thaïlande
Toi, petit homme qui n'y croit plus, qui a déjà baissé les bras
Impuissant tu te sens seul, mais sache que Dieu est avec toi
C'est un message d'encouragement car l'existence est loin d'être simple
Juste pour vous dire qu'on pense à vous, que tous ensemble on pourra vaincre
Enfants des favelas, partis trop tôt d'une balle perdue, d'un enlèvement ou orphelin, traînants
trop tard dans toutes ces rues
Toutes mes prières je vous dédie en espérant vous voir heureux
La cruauté de tous ces hommes sera punie, soyez-en sûrs
Malgré tout ça, y a de belles choses, cherchez les bien car elles se cachent
Le coeur d'un être a des richesses même si des fois cette vie est trash
En tout cas, je reste optimiste parce que sinon je perds le moral
S'il vous plaît, gardez la foi même si c'est dur sous des pluies de balles


Gardez la pêche le temps d'un titre quelques rimes pour ceux qui souffrent
On garde l'espoir pour ceux qui doutent, un brin de soleil pour ceux qui luttent
On sait que c'est dur mais on y croit, cette vie nous flingue mais on luttera
Faut rester forts tant qu'on a l'âge, il faut se battre tant qu'on est braves.

Garde la pêche sous ce ciel nuageux
Garde l'espoir de revoir le ciel étoilé un jour briller sous tes yeux
Sois honnête et fais honneur à tes vieux
Reste humble et fort, et des valeurs sois le plus respectueux
Dis-toi que le monde abrite ta chance aux plus profonds d'une mine d'or
Creuse un jour où l'autre et t'en apercevras le trésor
Lève-toi et va de l'avant et n'attend pas que le vent t'emporte
Face aux succès et à la chance et n'attend pas qu'il te rapporte
Les clefs de la réussite
Là où se perd le mérite
Là où les gens héritent de la haine deviennent individualiste
Alors si t'as le sentiment que ton corps agonise
Dis-toi que chaque être humain et promis à une terre quelque soient les
Erreurs commises
J't'avoue que c'est dur d'être courageux quand le ciel bleu devient orageux
Et que les gens qui soi-disant t'aiment deviennent dangereux pour des enjeux
Et malgré tout ce qui t'entoure, faut rester sage
Après l'orage vient le beau temps, après la peur vient le courage

Gardez la pêche le temps d'un titre quelques rimes pour ceux qui souffrent
On garde l'espoir pour ceux qui doutent, un brin de soleil pour ceux qui luttent
On sait que c'est dur mais on y croit, cette vie nous flingue mais on luttera

Relic,"On reste loin des apparences
C'est bienvenu en France
C'est du lourd
Faites pas trop gaffe à la sap, ni au graff,
Ni même au tag, ni aux infos sur Canal Sat
La menace porte un teddy
Bois du Benco
T'inquiète pas, jeunesse se passe,
La banlieue même dans un landau
J't'assure pas de couteau entre les dents,
Juste un baggy moyennement large
Faisant la crainte de l'Occident,
Les faits sont d'actualités
J'entends parler d'Islam de France,
De l'apéro à la mosquée,
Kifs l'Afrique dans une assiette pour du couscous et du mafé,
Vos idées sont étroites,
Les apparences sont trompeuses,
À 4x4 entre les pattes et notre bourse n'est pas si pieuse
Ils rêvent de nous le soir
RMIstes ou licenciés, ils aiment les arabes et les noirs
Dans un putain de pénitencier
Moi j'ai la classe moi
Une paire de Dolce Gabana avec un cigare de Cuba,
J'fais un tabac bande de tarbas
À votre merci, on ne l'est pas
J'écris pour éviter de brûler vos arrêtés
2006, j'ai pris ma carte d'électeur
Préparez-vous à vous casser

Ils nous veulent à leur merci
Nous appellent la délinquance
Mais, t'inquiète que nous on vit loin des apparences
Changer les mentalités, on y travaille et on y pense
Près des clichés, moi je te souhaite la bienvenue en France
On vit loin des apparences que l'on nous donne
On vient de loin là où on s'méfie des uniformes
Au-delà, de vos idées, et de tous vos préjugés
Allez tous vous faire pointer,
Il n'y a que Dieu pour nous juger
T'as l'étiquette collée dans le dos
Comme un sale numéro d'écrous
Et toute ta vie, tu vas le porter
Parce qu'ici-bas personne t'écoute
T'es Bac + 6 option juriste
Une chance sur 2 de finir pompiste
Parce que t'habites dans le 95 et que ton blaze est sur la liste
Toi t'es blonde tu t'appelles Claire
Le problème c'est que tu es ronde
Pour être hôtesse d'accueil dans ce système
Aujourd'hui faut être une bombe
Toi, c'est Yassine, t'as 22 ans
Tout frais, beau gosse, sorti des cours
En chaise roulante depuis tout jeune voilà le frein à ton parcours
Tous les CV tu les envoies, les recruteurs finissent sans voix
T'es trop calé pour cet emploi pour eux le profil tu ne l'as pas
Alors tu te bats, tu t'appliques, tu restes loin des trafics,
T'as le courage et l'éthique mais le sourire lymphatique
Tu n'en peux plus de ces regards qui te fatiguent depuis tout petit
Les préjugés sur ton aspect, et les on-dit qui t'ont meurtri
Frères et soeurs je vous comprends on est tous victimes de nos atouts
Mais soyons fiers de nos différences et restons loin des apparences

C'est pas parce que t'es riche que forcément tu vis mieux
La plus belle des richesses c'est d'avoir appris à se contenter de peu
C'est pas parce que tu braques que t'es un mac'
Que t'as le courage d'affronter seul l'homme à la matraque
C'est pas parce que t'es mignonne séduisante que tu me plais
Je préfère une femme simple qui résonne et qui cache sa beauté
C'est pas parce que tu l'aimes que forcément t'es amoureux
Mentir c'est se trahir soi-même, je t'assure que ça rend pas plus heureux
C'est pas parce qu'on vient de la rue qu' on n'a pas le droit aux études
Qu'on a pas de but, qu'on est condamné à vivre les pieds dans le bitume
C'est pas parce qu'ils sont séparés que tes parents ne t'aiment plus
Un jour tu comprendras qu'on choisit pas et que la vie l'a voulu
C'est pas parce que t'es grand balaise et fort
Que t'as la santé et la forme que t'es invulnérable face à la mort
Alors si t'es anéanti et que tu te sens offensé
Dis-toi que le jugement appartient à celui Haut Placé",Loin des Apparences,2006

Un flow fat et hardcore pour tous les gars qui nous épaulent.
Tout niquer sans coup de veine ! Faire péter la SACEM
Ouvre grand tes oreilles: « LEGENDE URBAINE » !
On reste hardcore encore sur du bon vieux dancefloor,
Représente les halls et on l'crie fort.
Tout niquer sans coup de veine ! Faire péter la SACEM
Ouvre grand tes oreilles : « LEGENDE URBAINE »

On n'est surtout pas nouveau,
Offishall faut qu' ça paye on a les crocs
Pour la rue et ses accros ! Tu peux y aller c'est du costaud
Trop lourd ! Débordes, marquer l'histoire, non pas la mode,
Même en mode club, les connards on les démode.
95, Val d'Oise! Dédicace à mon enseigne!
Représente les bords de Seine !
Donne le ton aux affamés en scène.
Vas-y! Aussi zen que Zazie, impertinent comme Baffie
Tout dans le débit, décidé le bête de show à commencer
Et puis tant mieux si le flow y est. Morveux ! Tout ce bordel est
calculé.
Y a pas de quoi s'en faire. Antar ! Un kick, une caisse claire
Flair « Légende urbaine » en clair!

J'attire les passionnés les fous, les folles.
Je fous le feu sur la foule, sans l'affoler car d'elle j'en raffole.
Epauler par les halls, je lâche rafales de phrases contradictoires,
A l'égard de ceux qu'écrasent la vie que pour la victoire.

On débute nan! C'est le retour grand. 2004 nan!
Avec ou sans promo, je lâche une vraie bombe pour les accros.
C'est une revanche nan! Juste une réponse grand,
A toutes les gueules qui parlaient trop, une première touche, premier fléau
On est pas venu pour baltringuer, sortez les gosses et les minettes,
Canon scié sur toutes les tempes ça va vous péter à la tête.
C'est aujourd'hui que la roue tourne préparez-vous à l'ascension
La suite logique est annoncée protégez-vous de la sanction
Criminel dangereux, coup de scalpel douloureux,
Incision microphonique derrière l'oreille pour les graineux

Ca sonne street, ça cavale on est pressé, il faut que ça course
Hé ! Mon frère ReliC c'est chaud, ça sort des bas-fonds d'Argenteuil
Si mon son crame ta platine c'est que t'as gravé et que je suis en deuil.
C'est la guerre, je sais que ça gaze, mais notre blaze prend de l'ampleur
« Légende urbaine » avant l'heure, putain, c'est ça qui leur fait peur.

Même si on se fiche pas mai de ce que je vis d'où je viens et où je
vais.
Je donnerais mon avis dans c'te monde où se confondent bons et
mauvais.
Je rappe pour les gens vrais ceux qui triment et ceux qu'en valent
la peine.
Ceux qu'on voit à peine dans la zic'qu'expriment l'amour, et la
haine.
A mon tour de crier au monde entier que je veux briller dans ce
domaine
Mon rap, c'est le coup parfait du siècle comme une droite dans
l'abdomen
Où est le drame ? Où est le crime ? Où est le mal ? Où est le blème?
Compte pas sur nous pour tourner le dos à la vie comme Kurt KOBEN.
L'emblème je l'embellis autant pour les anciens que pour les mômes
Autant pour ceux qui bossent durs dans la vie que pour tous ceux qui
chôment.
Je veux me faire entendre sans jouer les tendres car c'est avant
tout mon rêve
C'est à mon goût ce que j'ai de mieux à faire avant que ma vie
s'achève.

Ouais c'est bon signe on a passé les détections

Did You realize that You would be my Savior?

i've got no cash to spend
sell all my books for front row tickets

i know this year will test her

oh no! not for me not for me
call it torture call it university
no! arts and crafts is all i need
i'll take calligraphy and
then ill make a fake degree

80 grand later i found out
that all that i had learned
is that you should show up to
take your finals and your midterms
the party scene is kinda mean
i think it's sick and twisted
the navy showed up at my dorm
and clamed that i enlisted

don't get excited she'll say 'no'

and i've decided college girls
just won't go out with me
they make me nervous and they
allways catch me off my guard

i drop out cause college is to hard

it's time to call my father
cause it's his alma mater
good grades arn't what they seem

Just slips through my grip

And if there's one in this world,
You let me know you're not that girl

Don't touch the positive with the negative end
Don't touch the positive with the negative end
Cause after all of the sparks you're left alone in the dark
Cause after all of the sparks you're left alone in the dark

Experience with you as a mistake
And while I'm at it, I'll say I've had it
Experience with you is a mistake

On a one track mind
And you're so out of touch
Cause I'm so far behind
I'm trying to make sense

Just slips through my grip

The point I could convey
If only I could find the words to say to let You know how much You've touched my life
Because here is where You're finding me, in the exact same place as New Year's eve
And from a lack of my persistency
We're less than half as close as I want to be

And the first time
That You opened Your eyes did You realize that You would be my Savior
And the first breath that left Your lips
Did You know that it would change this world forever

And so this Christmas I'll compare the things I felt in prior years
To what this midnight made so clear
That You have come to meet me here

To look back and think that
This baby would one day save me
In the hope that what You did
That you were born so I might live
To look back and think that
This baby would one day save me

That You were born to die
So I could one day pray for You to save my life",I Celebrate the Day,2003

Glory streams from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts they sing hallelujah

The stars in the sky they looked down where He lay

I'm blending in so you won't even know me
Apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet you mention is my one last shot at redemption
Because I know to live you must give your life away
And I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity and
I've been locked inside that house all the while You hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though, there's no way in knowing
Where to go, promise I'm going because
I gotta get outta here
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging you, I'm begging you, I'm begging you to be my escape.

I'm giving up on doing this alone now
'Cause I've failed and I'm ready to be shown how
He's told me the way and I'm trying to get there
And this life sentence that I'm serving
I admit that I'm every bit deserving

'Cause I'm afraid that this complacency is something I can't shake
I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging you, I'm begging you, I'm begging You to be my escape.

I am a hostage to my own humanity
Self detained and forced to live in this mess I've made
And all I'm asking is for you to do what You can with me
But I can't ask You to give what You already gave

I've been locked inside that house all the while you hold the key

So I've given up and now I'm just indifferent

And later on we can go outside
And create the impression of an angel that fell from the sky

And by the fire my heart it heaves a sigh
For the green grass waiting on the other side

Our hearts stay warm cause they are filled with hope

And see the leaves on the trees begin to show
The birds would congregate and things
A song of birth a song of newer things
The wind would calm and the sun would shine
I'd go outside and I'd squint my eyes
But for now I will simply just withdraw
Sit here and wish for this world to thaw

It seems this curse just can't be lifted

Shifting everything was melting

When I got tired of running from you
I stopped right there to catch my breath
There your words they caught my ears
You said, “I miss you son. Come home.”
And my sins, they watched me leave
And in my heart I so believed
The love you felt for me was mine
The love I'd wished for all this time
And when the doors were closed
I heard no I told so's
I said the words I knew you knew
Oh God, Oh God I needed you

You should have said, ""Nice to meet you, I'm your other half""

Relient K,"I can smell the death on the sheets, covering me
I can't believe this is the end

But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

The year is 1941
I was 8 years old and far, far too young
To know that the stories of battles and glory
Was a tale, a kind mother made up for a son

You see, dad was a traveling preacher
Teaching the words of the teacher
Mother had sworn he went off to the war
And died there with honor, somewhere on a beach there

But he left once, to never return
Which taught me that I should unlearn
Whatever I thought a father should be
I abandoned that thought like he abandoned me

By '47, I was fourteen
I'd acquired a taste for liquor and nicotine
I smoked until I threw up, yet I still lit 'em up
For thirty more years, like a machine

So right there you have it, that one filthy habit
Is what got me where I am today

I can smell the death on the sheets, covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear the sad memories still haunting me
So many things I'd do again

But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

Got married on my 21st
Eight months before my wife would give birth
It's easier to be sure you love someone
When a father inquires with the barrel of a gun

The union was far from harmonious
No two people could've been more alone than us
The years would go by and she'd love someone else
And I realized I hadn't been loved yet myself

From there, it's your typical spiel
Yeah, if life was a highway, I was drunk at the wheel
I was helpin' the loose ends all fall apart
Yeah, I swear I was destined to fail and fail from the start

I bowled about 6 times a week
A bottle of Beam kept the memories from me
Our marriage had taken a 7-10 split
And along with my pride, the ex-wife took the kids

I can smell the death on the sheets, covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear those sad memories still haunting me
So many things I'd do again

But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

I was so scared of Jesus but he sought me out
Like the cancer in my lungs, it's killing me now
And I've given up hope on the days I have left
But I cling to the hope of my life in the next

Well, then Jesus showed up, said, ""Before we go up
I thought that we might reminisce
See one night in your life, when you've turned out the lights
You asked for and prayed for my forgiveness""

You cried, wolf, the tears, they soaked your fur
The blood dripped from your fangs, you said, ""What have I done?""
You loved that lamb with every sinful bone
And there you wept alone, your heart was so contrite

You said, ""Jesus, please forgive me of my crimes
Sanctify this withered heart of mine
Stay with me until my life is through
And on that day, please take me home with you""

I can smell the death on the sheets, covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear you whisper to me, ""It's time to leave
You'll never be lonely again""

But this was my deathbed, I died there alone
When I closed my eyes tonight, you carried me home

I am the way, follow me and take my hand
And I am the truth, embrace me and you'll understand
And I am the light and for me, you'll live again

And you can hear Mrs. Claus screaming
I warned you never trust those elves

Unless something drastic happens fast
Say hello to the ghost of Christmas past

Old Saint Nick ain't all that jolly

And the sleigh's in the shop
'Cause it's broken down
But Christmas won't stop

Santa Claus is thumbing to town, uh-oh

Santa spent all night hitch-hiking
With a sign that reads, ho ho slow down
Santa Claus is thumbing to town

Every car just drove right past him
And sped right out of sight
Santa never got to ask them
To drive around the world in just one night

So Kris Kringle started walkin'
Through the snow without his sleigh
Shed a tear for every stocking
That would be empty Christmas day

Relient K,"For a time I thought there was a thief among us
I thought I'd track him down but prior to my pursuit
The smoke it cleared into my disbelief
There was no thief
Cause it was me that lost you

There was no thief
Cause it was me that lost you

I guess it's safe to say you're never coming back
And I understand why you wouldn't want to
I guess it's up to me to find a way to get to you

And there's just one last thing that I have to say
As we reflect on the mess of all of this I've made
It was cowardice that made me push you away
I was so afraid cause you were so much better than me

I can't see you
Getting used to
Living in the midst of your perfection
And I'm so lost
How can you trust
Somewhere the sun is always shinin'

Oh

And there's just one last thing that I have to say
As we reflect on the mess of all of this I've made
It was cowardice that made me push you away
I was so afraid cause you were so much better than me

Relient K,"So to the best, to the best, of our knowledge
We are doing our best to fight technology
Cause back when our parents were in college
We weren't even born, and neither were CDs
Cause when our folks would listen to their rock 'n roll
They'd gather round, and play it on their turntables
But these days, their records are worthless
Cause DJs scratch the records on purpose

[Chorus]
So, let's put this in a perspective
In the present day in which we live
It's all the same with all the kids
No one knows what vinyl is
Cause they just burn the MP3s (Whoa-o)
Onto their stacks of blank CDs
And during all that arsony (Whoa)
The records stay right in their sleeves
It's all the same with all the kids
Cause no one knows what vinyl is
Yeah!

Cause these days, kids, they act so ignorant
They have no clue what to do with a 7-inch
They say, ""It won't play, it's my CD player's fault
I'll take it to the park, and play some Frisbee golf""
So give me side A, give me side B
It really doesn't make any difference to me
I tried to burn it, like all the CDs that I get
But what the heck is all this melted plastic mess?

Rell,"This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God

Since you finishin' 'em early, what posessed you to start him?
We made a vow later we'll regret 'til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, 'cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin' when you made us; so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, 'cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded wonderin' why
Cryin', pourin' out my heart, pourin' out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin' we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin' the truth
He had talent too, I had plans on watchin' him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein' him leave, or watchin him go

If you wonder why (why I live my life)
The way that I do ('cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (don't worry, don't worry worry)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper

You'se a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play 'em like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face
To straight breakin down and showin' all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit' you

When will you see
That there's no one like me (no one no one)
No matter how hard they try to be
Cause they just don't flow (they don't flow)
The way that I flow (The way I flow)
So baby don't fight it

It seems the more that I try
The harder you make it for me to get by
If you only knew how I felt inside
I'm sure you would be so blind 
Cause another like me you won't find

You better think it over before you try 
To say that no one can give you what you like
Cause I know just what you want
And there's no way you can front on me
I hope you see
That you belong to me

So don't fight the way it feels when I do my thing
Trick don't leave for ten months

Jay, my friend blunts
I'm tight though, mad that you're platinum plus
Let me find out that some broad got you acting up
Spread your wings so I figure you'll be back in touch
Wondering if whats-his-name will he tap my stuff
Yo, all I wanna do if get this doe together
Even if you want this on the low whatever
Fuck around, it's gonna be a hoe forever
Cause when it's beef, I know that we're gonna throw together
But we got issues nigga, cause what you did for me lately
To be a little skanky with them bitches that hate me
You know the kind, door knockers hollering at that
Them bootlegging bitches, I don't even blink at that
Stop playing, Especially when I'm ? or black

Make me Schwarzennegger something
You niggas talkin bout a dolla ain't a thing
I got da blocks boilin move oils like Babylon

I move work in and out da Tri-State 
All doubles don't supply weight
All bubbles five eights
Yeah, I'm in and out of state

I touched a lot of states
And yeah my plate touched a lot steaks
And you crumbs can't supply a cake
And cake don't make crumbs it's true

I'm try to school you to some game youngin
But you nuckle head lame youngin
Swear you know the game youngin

Swear we move on the same train youngin

Y'all niggas fuckin wit that bake and that come back
And always got a story like wait, I'ma come back
Sometimes you gotta go away to make a come back
And those that know when they go don't even come back

My nails dirty I ain't sit on my hands
Nails dirty from that shit I'm preparin
Scale dirty got that shit on my hands
Man, hustlin all inside of me

I cop a spot, pop them numbers like the lottery
Keep my luck sevens, big fours right beside of me
Not pick six keep hollows right beside of me
In case them numbers on them balls jump around

I gotta make them boys come to town and dumb around
You mufackas betta buckle down
Before I buckle down
Naw nigga we can't knuckle now

I know you hear me, for the record y'all

Dynasty album, track 16, listeners fret
I can't take back that sixteen
Shit the truth spoke, I gotta give the world true quotes
Can you feel it? I know the truth hurts
They say, ""How can he disrespect his pop with harsh curses?""
Simple - harsh life, harsh verses
""I can't believe the mouth of this prick
He said put his mouth on his dick,""
I know we gotta talk bout that, I know you salt bout that
You on the tip like I don't like you
I got four kids, three baby mothers, I'm just like you
Sometimes I wanted to just fight you, shit
Swing on you - think I'm playin man, I'm just like you
I was a kid with a puzzle
With missing pieces tryin to put it together dawg, you put it together
You made me have to foot through the weather
In the storm with no raincoat
I don't only speak on me, I speak upon the kids in the same boat
Ridin the same water, same situation
Same fatherless daughter - I hate you, that's in your mind
Don't get caught up in the rhyme
You think I dissed you now, that I don't miss you now
Don't be a hater now, be glad I made it now
I know I probably rubbed you the wrong way
But fuck what the song say, for the record, check it

[Chorus]
Still got love for you, though you left me in the cold
To face this world alone, and make it on my own
I still got love for you, but I just can't fight the pain
It's so hard not to hate, but you grow up in a way

Listen - that was my hurt in my heart talkin, along with the truth
I would thirst often as a youth cause of you the person
Moms nursing self-esteem issues
Round the house it's hard to find a clean tissue, minus her tears
To rewind this time I promise I minused my years
To the day to take the pain away
Seemed sunny outside, always rained on Jay
Pop you my umbrella, come help your son with the weather
Soon we come together like man and man and build
Play space, cards face up, I've come to deal
In order to get right we gotta deal with this wrong
And the pain I felt all my life you feel in the song
Your lack of warmth left a chill in the morn'
Your lack of love, left me loveless, and I'm of your breath
I'm your mind body and soul, your heart, your flesh
Your alcohol, your smoke, in results I'm a mess
And dad, still I love you no less dad
Hope you didn't think success would make me less mad
But not mad, just disappointed - we wasted years
I swear to God, may you take me away from here
If you taught me anything
The one thing you taught me is to face my fears, coward
How could you let me grow without you?
Grind in this rap game, take dough without you?
Wear my Pro Keds close to the sole without you?
Family pictures pose without you - WHY?!
Why shouldn't I be mad?
Monster's parents separated, Monster had his dad
These parents had they problems, he still came to the pad
He bought 'em new bikes, imagine what that felt like
Used to have to butt my head to go to sleep at night
Nigga you did me wrong but the love is strong, let's move on

Yo, yo, same hustle man, same struggle man
Yeah, I do it again, if I have to
Still the same way, still the game paid
Still the young nigga, still slang, yeah

I wouldn't change a thing and my mama did it all by herself
She sayin' the same pray, listen
You hear when she whisper
I get the chance I fix her, days that I slipped her

And my man the past, I tell him I love him
And I hug him before he pass
Raised his daughter as if she was mine
Still meet the same girl, still have mine, uh

I thank God the Melik meet Shawn
I throw the diamond up higher in every song
And only drama could do it again
Da hood don't love me, still I walk through it again hear me

I wouldn't change one fact if I have to come back
And I couldn't live black, got me
But mama love me, I'm from da ghetto
And only God could judge me

Same gun, same case, same niggaz I bang with

Just roll me up an L and live life and just do what I do
It's all lovely when it's right
But when it's wrong, I just play along
Get hit bounce back like it's really nothin' wrong

And I still struggle, still bubble
No matter if I'm broke or rich I still hustle
Still get niggaz to test you is my life
And I do it all again,I do it twice

And I won't change a thang, maybe two
I bring Big and Pop back put them in the same room
Then I apolotic and make peace in da same room
Once a game dead then you know we all dead too, true

And then we back on the block
With the crack in da sack
I take it how it come from the bottom to the top
I signed wit Bleek and I'm ridin' wit The Roc and I

Would do it all again, do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh baby, yeah
I do it all again, for the love as it gain
If I have to live my life all over
(And I do it again, yeah, holla)
Oh, I would

Yo, I talk to my fam I lost and let them know
How I feel from my heart without them here no mo'
And is no lies, I do it all again from the start of my life
Till the night my mama die

I would it told her, I love and it all kept looses and close
Let her know I always be here for you
Apologize to grandma that for da stress I put her through
And to my dad I ain't mad at you

Even thought you wasn't there without you
I won't be here so I gotta be fair
Still don't love lost over here I swear
To my restin' road dawgz, yeah

Why changin' my resurrection
I be back and the style same strip
Back with the same click
Hustle in the game chips, explain this
If I have to live all over I do it
Let Barbara have his kidz all over watch me

Get it quick, servin' the pump liquor
Spend a little mo' time with my big brother Leek
Still be fam with Cease, Proof, Cali and Bleek

When they bounce, Let me know that they all a part of it

On state row where it's so cold

Which way do I go?

Man whipped a few shoulders
Shovel nick boulders gettin' it slow

My niggas like her
She been with me through the grind
Girl you put in that top like been lifers
You got tight used to hooky and chill
So I tight plus she cook up a meal
Had the hook up for real
More headaches and stress cause a child involved
It's all good cause our sex be my Tylenol
Best baby dollar fall
Shit the rest of you childish broads
Give me the sex then I'm tired of y'all
So find a next to provide for y'all
I got my baby girl, plus she about to drop, 
My baby girl
Forget about all the rumors you hear girl
I know a life soon to be here girl
And can't nothin' fuck up that
Got to fuck with that
Can't find a better love than that, 
My baby girl

[Chorus]
Don't stop givin' me your lovin'
Cause my heart's been racin' for your lovin'
And I won't give it up for nothin'
'Cause there's no better love
Girl you got me goin' crazy
You got me thinkin' 'bout you baby
Could you be my one and only lady
'Cause there's no better love

Comin' up I thought Cupid was stupid
Only two loves my family and music
Fallin' through somethin' just couldn't do it
It was the beginning of time, 
And you was like nine
But God damn you was fine
Used to stay on my mind, 
When I was out on my grind
Opened up the bags when I'm choppin' my dimes
They ? spittle stood by me for the rentals
Popped up last year with me and got me rentals
Sick with the plastic, what can I say
Bitches hate around the way, I had a lay day
Gossip and watchin' him, runnin' back
Moved up North, kinda fell off track
Still my peoples though, 
Love when I see you though
Once a while might call just to chill might ball
Forever my dog, even when I downfall
First in line whenever chick is involved, what

[Chorus]

We the youngest in charge, so lead 'em of his ?
We give you better love the same time is tough
Baby I feel the same as Neef do
Spit the game as he do
If you could take two, 
Ain't no need to bring your people
Lingerie see-through
She got it goin' on
Oh that's can't stop, won't stop
We got 'em goin' home
We got 'em all alone
Just us nobody's wrong
I'ma hit her, you can hit her
We waffle house in the morn'

Ever since the day I saw your face
My mind told me you were the one that was down for me
And baby when I get laced, 
I'm gonna do what you want I'll be there (truly)
So don't you let a thing, 
Turn you away from the love that you need (my dear)
I don't want to play around wit ya

But some many years I remained same
Use to be a love maker, heart breaker, major part player.
Never thought that my heart ever change.

What it really means to fall in love.
But I don't know how I know I just know
Baby you're the one 4 me

Tried of the same old thing and playing all same old games
And if I could trade one thing in the exchange for you
Boy I give anything (anything)

As a lil' I was taught I was trained
Never trust in a man
'Cause they all remain the same
But you came alone
And you brought out a lil woman in me
And it's all in the things you do yea
Never thought I be there with thoughts of loving you
But I claim it and name it
Baby your the reason I want a love brand new

But its a long time comin'

Hundred million miles runnin'
On life's treadmill
Runnin' in place

Food stamps shorts of wonder bread
My mom dukes
Young, wild, loose learned a less
I got my truths from the older heads
U went 2 church n took a different route
U got ya truths from out the bishop mouth

And yet there's more to life than misery
We have to have unity in our community
We have to work together brothers and sisters

(Lord knows, I was on the run confused)
DipSet forever
(Shit)
We're talking about a concrete jungle
(Yeah, it sure is a jungle)
Life or death, you have to choose life
(I done seen it all, at least I think I seen it all)

I'm with my concrete jungle, no Tarzans and Janes
Diesel by the bundles and the hard grams of Caine
D's when they come through, it's hard to get some change
Smoking weed getting drunk, in the car for a flame

Yeah, I see the traffic but we dipping on the shoulder
Winter start to set in, it's only getting colder
And I miss you all my political soldiers
Most are doing life for moving bricks or doing hold-ups

Damn, I know we caught up in the fast life
Some like a fiend when they caught up on the glass pipe
Me, I'm still caught up from last night
Same clothes from the club on the block getting cash right

Damn, you know this world full of misery
Some get tore up 'til they hurl off the liquor be
Somebody told me that the girls need the chivalry
That's why I cop ice 'til they ass get the shivers be

Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams
(Live out my dreams)
Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

For the coke I would sleep hard
But the game drove me nuts, in the streets, I'm a full-fledged retard
Was the city block overseer
Man your life is Chuck E. Cheese, mine is a pizzeria

How many pies I done flipped? I lost count
How many guys I done gave shit? I lost count
Holding but I can't ignore cheating
Any day your life could be the hot topic at that board meeting

They discussing who'll stretch you for your trees
For your thievery, you living, you breathing for no fucking reason
That's how it is when you make a man
That's why your man's gotta learn to make himself then you shake his hand

Man, I'm into catching heavy clams
And when Dezzy can us when it comes to dumping I got heavy hands
Ain't gonna be right for your picking jet
This is ours, the square is where we eat, this our kitchenette

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto

Been there, done that, so I can live out all my dreams

Now put your lighters to your head, nigga ride

I let my temper hit the floor
I be staring through the mirror as I serenade my halls
I'm fond of the juices that marinate they drawers
My shorty, she bank a carrot with the four 'cause

If you take us out, the streets will evolve
Some niggaz they live to eat, some niggaz eat to survive
And my conscience keep disturbing me, fucking with my energy
Niggaz that I thought was friends, really the enemy

Dear Lord, please grant me the serenity
To accept the things that I cannot change
Locked up for eight years and ain't join no gangs
Been converted to true nigga, I'm as real as they come

And any moment I have you staring the barrel of my gun
Put my dick up in the streets but I'm married to the slums
Put the chips up in the ante and tally up the sum
I'm having fun, hitting the fiends in the allies with some jums

Ain't nothing sweet living in this ghetto
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)
Been there, done that, running in the streets

Alright, yeah but in choosing life, you got choices
(Oh yeah)
The jungle is full of everything
It's the mother and the father of creation
(Ain't nothing sweet about it)
But listen up, you have to choose something for yourself
Do something for yourself, make something of yourself

That's what time it is

Go strong, be strong, stand for something in life

Yeah, concrete jungle, I can feel it, I can smell it

Rell,"Now don't push me away 'cause when the first time I met you
Girl, you shook me in ways
You know the life of a nigga's cookin' up yay
And because you knew the pitfalls and the tumbles of the game

You've seen the spotlight watch niggas fallin' to the fame
And all the time you tried to tell me to stay hungry and maintain
When I was like let's go half on a baby
And if not then lets go half on a 'cedes

Drop top coup while we pumpin' sweet sadie
Flyin' up Lennox, doin' us, pushin' 80
The road trips, the late nights got you pissed
The road trips, the late nights got us rich

The clothes that we wear, the place that we piss
Run and get shot, we ain't what we sit
So if I don't get a chance to tell you
Now too often lately girl how your hand so helpful

In this cold world girl every man needs help too
So baby, I'ma ride and no plans to fail you

Please, baby, don't push me away
I want you
Please, baby don't push me away
I need you

I had enough of the shucking and jiving, duckin' and hidin'
I'm tryin' to get to conversation and ridin'
'Cause I'm feelin' your essence your presence
Is just enough to let me know that it's destined

And since the day that I found you, there's something about you
That makes me want to lose it and pounce ya
But it's not just your body, it's your mind
Your spirit, everything combined

And while I got a chance, take my hand
And let me show you something real, that love you can feel

Please, baby, don't push me away
I want you
Please, baby don't push me away
I need you

Uh, now two years done passed, few cheers, few laughs
Coppin' Vs, shoppin' sprees gears in the bags
And who cares who's near 'cause most of the bitches
Would just say you was there for the cash

And I ain't scared of your past, I prepare for the future
The one thing I ask is just don't tear a nigga coup up
You brang the bail when I was caged up
And back and forth the court to the lawyer now we case shut

You found the numbers in my phone, you was my face but
You know what they say the break ups to make ups
And I admit I'm getting better with the flirtin'
You know you dead sexy when you yellin' and you cursin'

You such a hell of a person
So when I get home I'm gonnna tell you in person
Face to face, I'ma run base to base
And then I'ma slide home safe till I make yo body shake

You tell me every night that life comes with a twist
That I'm in the spotlight and I'm runnin' the risk
Hey, you always say love don't come with a kiss
It's hard soakin' up game when it's comin' from a bitch

But where's my manners, never take you for granted?
Never take you advantage, most people don't understand it
Is you happy? Look inside humor
When you and I together what the fuck they gonna do wit us?

Say ya prayer 'cause we destined for glory
And when the credits roll it's Harlem's West Side Story

My vision of the lovin' is close
That's how I want us to be when we doin' our thing
Kissin' ya, lickin' ya, touchin' ya, rubbin' ya
Tell me how you want me to bring it?

Because I know he got limits
But baby I don't, and my feelin's they won't
Let you get away from me, come stay with me
Baby, baby, please, baby, don't push me away

When the sunshine turn to rain
Baby, I can take away your pain
Just call me up when you need some time
I'll take you out, break you off like daddy come on

You don't have to settle for less
And baby, I can give you what you want
Just call me up when you need some time
And you can get it from me just like daddy come on

Yak when we drive, like we rollin' fuckin' felony

He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word

A miracle on Flatbush Avenue I still made it back 
To say push when she was having you 
A newer version a younger me I want him to go to school 
And raise him motherfucka free I swear some places I don't want him to be 
I swear some things I don't want him to see but new booty daddy
Loves you truly and the nights you don't see me you know daddy's on his duty

What's a poor mans pickle survive threw the poor pull a truck upfront 
And drive threw the store had to be a felon hated being proper 
Read the book of life and Satan was the author still I was the cooperative 
Rather be in Rykers the bugger had my baby momma running threw them 
Diapers all fo that shiting and all them pampers 
Grandma laid up with all of that cancer lid paint flaking constantly chipping 
Mama with that dark rum constantly sipping I vow to my name a bad transmission for getting in the game that's a bad transition 
One flick one night I'm ally ally out sin free for getting you a place with a g 
A couple heavy shots ima newer man ready go and get paper the hustler 
With the confetti

I can truly understand how life can drain all the passion from a man 
With just one chance it can change his circumstance 
And get the money baby lets get the money baby

Rell,"Oh! Most of us came from a broken home,
Drowning all my sorrows,
Drinking liquor trying to smoke alone
Arguing with my wife so I broke the phone,
But the plane is on!
Is acting funny with the work,
Like my money didn't work,
He gonna end up getting murdered.
The acting funny with the
Like the shit that I spit on the record wasn't real!
Hood man, but they know
But they end up in jealousy to end a nigga high!
The other day I say fuck
When I play the bodega it was dance for the Dutch.
Keep it real, we're living in real time,
And I'm feeling the niggas' pain,
But they never can feel mine!
So I'm a go with the green light,
I don't even sleep, how the fuck could I dream right?

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah!
And you keep telling me things are getting better,
Yeah, yeah!
But I'm a do me, you can say whatever I'm a G!

Guess it's a sad think my is magic!
I remember I never I never said December was cold,
But February was drastic,
My niggas and what they
When the murder scene is tragic!
niggas can talk shit, we don't even glimpse,
niggas can get hit, we don't even wince!
Entourage and I don't mean Vince,
Purple label and purple Porsche
I look into the sky life, my life
And I zip my lips the minute they read my rights.
Blowin' on a lone Dutch in here
How I lie, rather die to be in jail,
It's so good 'till it's all bad,
And the ugly niggas gonna crash your broad's

[Chorus]

I keep on moving on my new on the blocks,
The young boys move
I salute cause it's the west like
What they do for
In the nights your brain is out when the cocaine
Again I know my men got life out the game,
Don't stop so pull the weed out tonight's
Yeah, it's like that
My down South niggas they got
My East Coast niggas they got the
You found what your friends did.
I throw this money over bitches,
But niggas so let's kick it!

Rell,"Yo, I've seen Raj
He been a friend for years
Now your boy in blue, how he switched up gears
He said how I been?
I got a ear full of bad news
Your ? is corrupt and it's time to choose
We got some niggas running drugs that can't be touched
Unless you wanna handle the dirt, it'll mean so much
I said I got this, measure deceive
Ima clean up the block like you wouldn't believe
Call me Mr. Clean, aka Starkiano
Nine years later slid across the Verrazano
Clean sweep, apply pressure to the scum
This is my town, Stapleton is where I'm from
Third shot slapped in the head with a juice box
Grenade with no pin in his mouth, this is my block
And Bamboo fucking with this is absurd
Ima handle my beeswax, that's my word

Came up out the darkness, searching for light
I know home is where my heart is
And now nothing seems right
I tried to make peace and cut my loses
And carry on somehow
But I've come much to far friend
Too late to turn back now, here I go again
Here I go again

Yeah, yeah, welcome home Starks
Remember us? At the jams in the parks
All gold guzzlers, wallabee clarks
Young cold hustlers, obviously sharp
Voom with the purpose to bloom, so in tuned
Dialogue like the Disciples in the circle of goons
My ace boom, then you got sent to the tombs
And shit went left, had to pinch my flesh
And figure some other scheme to get cream, reign supreme
You know everything ain't what it seems
So I switched up size, had switch up lives
And now fuck up life and ? ? dies
A badge and a gun that's legal, it's more lethal
Than any local dealer that's evil leave you people's
The sequel
Me and you both could split a loaf
Just need you a little closer
You could squeeze that toast
And knock off targets, starting with the hardest
By next year my nigga, we be the largest
Felonies done with no charges

Came up out the darkness, searching for light
I know home is where my heart is
And now nothing seems right
I tried to make peace and cut my loses
And carry on somehow
But I've come much to far friend
Too late to turn back now, here I go again
Here I go again",Here I Go Again,2014

Remco De Haan,"You want to go out Friday
And you want to go forever.
You know that it sounds childish
That you've dreamt of alligators.
You hope that we are with you
And you hope you're recognized
You want to go forever
You see it in my eyes.
I'm lost in the confusion
And it doesn't seem to matter
You really can't believe it
And you hope it's getting better

You want to trust the doctors
Their procedure is the best
But the last try was a failure
And the intern was a mess.
And they did the same to Matthew
And he bled 'til Sunday night
They're saying don't be frightened
But you're weakened by the sight of it
You lock into a pattern
And you know that it's the last ditch
You're trying to see through it
And it doesn't make sense
But they're saying don't be frightened
And they're killing alligators
And they're hog-tied
And accepting of the struggle

You want to trust religion
And you know it's allegory
But the people who are followers
Have written their own story.
So you look up to the heavens
And you hope that it's a spaceship
And it's something from your childhood
You're thinking don't be frightened

You want to climb the ladder
You want to see forever
You want to go out Friday
And you want to go forever.
And you want to cross your DNA
To cross your DNA with something reptile.
And you're questioning the sciences
And questioning religion
You're looking like an idiot
And you no longer care.
And you want bridge the schism,
A built-in mechanism to protect you.
And you're looking for salvation
And you're looking for deliverance
You're looking for deliverance
You're looking like an idiot
And you no longer care.
You want to climb the ladder
You want to see forever.
You want to go out Friday
You want to go forever",Hope,1999

Who died in their struggle to survive, never to be forgotten.

Yo my own blood, dragged through the mud
Perished in my heart still cherished and loved
Stripped of our pride, everything we lived for
Families cried, there's no where to run to, no where to hide
Tossed to the side, access denied
Six million died for what? Yo a man shot dead in his back
Helpless women and children under constant attack 
For no reason, till the next season, and we still bleeding
Yo it's freezing, and men burn in hell, some for squeezing 
No hope for a remedy, nothing to believe
Moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve
Forever marked wit a number, tattooed to your body

Having visions, flashes of death camps and prisons, no provisions
Deceived by the devils decisions, forced into a slave

Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
Forced from our families, taken from our homes
Moved from our god and everything we own

But most left were dead, few escaped to the shores
With just one loaf of bread, banished, hold in for questioning
And vanished, never to be seen again, I can't express the pain
That was felt in the train to Auschwitz, tears poured down like rain
Naked face to face, with the master race, hatred blood and David
My heart belongs to God and stay sacred
Rabbi's and priests, disabled individuals 
The poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals
Mass extermination, total annihilation
Shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation
Tortured and starved, innocent experiments
Stripped down and carved up or gassed to death
The last hour, I smelled the flowers
Flashbacks of family then sent to the showers
Powerless undressed, women with babies clumped tight to their chest 
Crying, who would've guessed, dying, another life lost
Count the cost, another body gas burned and tossed in the holocaust

Release those of you, most of you were caught in the maze
We got six million ways to shine like sun's rays
So do what we do to get through the last days (the last days)

Try to listen to the science of life
Anythin but that mean you don't give a fuck about your's
Until ya door's kicked in by Mac-eleven machine men
Army green men but not the ones that's toys boy
That's for sure, if not in case you've been warned
I roll with a Clan that swear they raise they right hand
And smash ya with they left, appear an injustice, it's right there
Get sent back to the essence, kid you wildin like an adolescense
In see-seventy culture, get hung like a wanted poster
Trust me, and Rem-D, ain't the ones to contest G (This is a warning)
You totally desobeyed the first one, break you and fire at you, I know it

Follow instructions, the black gun pulls like suction
Evil minds plot destruction, corruption

With no knowledge there's no wisdom, we all fall victim
Sign of the times, society's lost, controlled, read between the lines

Yo it's late night, come up in ya bank
Computer flippin, microchippin
Insert the disk in, see who's worth a million
They come for the killin, we know where you livin
Come kick ya shit in

Yo you upstairs snorin, we in the safe, panel floorin
Come and go like we tourin, bottomline is we scorin

[Remedy]
I caught my first half brick in '87
I thought I knew it all, few years past eleven
Middle class kid, who grew up fast, kid
Sharp as glass, skin'll crush like a large mouth bass
In a world movin' fast, can't live in the past
Momma said that the best things in life don't last
Another chapter in the storybook, one more sung
And it's so true, only the good die young
This great country has gone to hell
Nobody listened til the Trade Center fell
Everything that once was good, has just turned back
Happiness has faded to sad
This is just what the industry ordered
Come and get your therapy, Remedy, my own worst enemy
The hits come free, straight from the M.C.
The are-E-M D, now, that's me

[Remedy]
Now I retired from the drug game
Self preservation on my family name
I got into this music game, with thoughts about fortune and fame
To find the music and drug game were two in the same
We got dealers turned artists and artists turned dealers
Squealers, pro stealers and big four wheelers
Iced out chains and platinum frames
And big big guns and big big names and
Hollywood's burnin', it must be the music
You can ask E. Sermon (do-do-do-do-doo)
We got, club promoters who turned label owners
Yo feed the homeless, man, we need blood donors
Here's an M.C. advisory, nothin' about the industry's clean
The only thing that matters is green
It is what it is and exactly what how it seems
Cash Rules Everything Me, C.R.E.A.M.

When you see me on the street and just walk on by (R-E-M-E, D-Y)

Now reach, reach up and touch the sky (R-E-M-E, D-Y)

Now I looked the major labels straight dead in their face
And I told 'em, ""yeah ya'll, thanks but no thanks""
They want to throw a few hundred g's in my face
Like I ain't already have g's in the bank
They want to sell me fame but I don't want to buy it
My name in the game is enough, keep quiet
They got live bait and they wheelin' in fish
So all you fuckin' artists best to make one wish
There is no difference between us and them

Now everybody want to sign the next white rapper
Don't make me have to, be the one to slap ya

Remedy,"Feel this,
To all those races, colors, and creeds, every man bleeds for the 
Countless victims and all their families of
The murdered, tortured and slaved, raped, robbed and persecuted
Never again, to the men, women, and children.
Who died in their struggle to survive, never to be forgotten.
Reuven ben menachum, yo

Yo my own blood, dragged through the mud
Perished in my heart still cherished and loved
Stripped of our pride, everything we lived for
Families cried, there's no where to run to, no where to hide
Tossed to the side, access denied
Six million died for what? Yo a man shot dead in his back
Helpless women and children under constant attack 
For no reason, till the next season, and we still bleeding
Yo it's freezing, and men burn in hell, some for squeezing 
No hope for a remedy, nothing to believe
Moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve
Forever marked wit a number, tattooed to your body
Late night, eyes closed, clutched to my shotty
Having visions, flashes of death camps and prisons, no provisions
Deceived by the devils decisions, forced into a slave
Death before dishonor for those men who were brave 
Shot and sent to their grave, can't awaken, it's too late
Everything's been taken, I'm shaken, family, history, the making 

[Chorus]
Never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
Never again shall we sit and take orders
Stripped of our culture, robbed of our name
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
Forced from our families, taken from our homes
Moved from our god then burned of our bones
Never again, never again, shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
Leave our sons and daughters, stripped of our culture
Robbed of our name
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
Forced from our families, taken from our homes
Moved from our god and everything we own

Some fled through the rumors of wars
But most left were dead, few escaped to the shores
With just one loaf of bread, banished, hold in for questioning
And vanished, never to be seen again, I can't express the pain
That was felt in the train to Auschwitz, tears poured down like rain
Naked face to face, with the master race, hatred blood and David
My heart belongs to God and stay sacred
Rabbi's and priests, disabled individuals 
The poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals
Mass extermination, total annihilation
Shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation
Tortured and starved, innocent experiments
Stripped down and carved up or gassed to death
The last hour, I smelled the flowers
Flashbacks of family then sent to the showers
Powerless undressed, women with babies clumped tight to their chest 
Crying, who would've guessed, dying, another life lost
Count the cost, another body gas burned and tossed in the holocaust

[Chorus]

Never again, never again
The final solution is now retribution

All along I was looking for something more
You're so much more

You've always been the one that I was looking for

All of my castles in the sand - washed away again
And I'm left back where I began tonight

But when You find me in my busy streets of emptiness
Remind me I'm not ever on my own

I don't know how You love me like you do
It's so good to belong with You
And in the places I'm a stranger too
It's so good to belong with You

To try, try time and time again?

Remember Oliver,"You don't need no friends
Get back your faith again
You have the power to believe
Another dissident
Take back your evidence
It has no power to deceive

I'll believe it when I see it, for myself

I don't need no one to tell me about heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe.
I don't need no proof when it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset and I perceive

I sit with them all night
Everything they say is right
But in the morning they were wrong
I'll be right by your side
Come hell or water high
Down any road you choose to roam

I'll believe it when I see it for myself

I don't need no one to tell me about heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe.
I don't need no proof when it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset and I perceive, yeah

Darling, I believe, Oh Lord
Sometimes it's hard to breathe, Lord
At the bottom of the sea, yeah yeah

I'll believe it when I see it for myself

I don't need no one to tell me about heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe.
I don't need no proof when it comes to God and truth

I don't need no one to tell me about heaven

Remembering Never,"Last night I dreamt of you, things were going so damn great.
Now I question ethics when the bad things in life are supposed to educate.
Those words were more than just break up words.
They ran too deep.
To end my life... the idea runs through my head.
But the consequence conflicts with how you care.
Couldn't matter at all if they found my dead.
Either way it ends it won't be fair.
Your words were more than just your careless words.
They ran too deep.
They pierced my heart.
I thought I could have died",Words,2001
Remembering Never,"It feels good
To say what I want
It feels good
To knock things down
It feels good
To see the disgust in their eyes
It feels good
And I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls
I don't want
To see the plan succeed
There won't be room
For people like me
My life is their disease
It feels good
And I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls
It feels good
To say what I want
It feels good
To knock things down

Over the hill for now, forgotten
Departed sea and setting sun
And I have a dapper friend with a sinful love
Sucked in shark fin swim the boulevard
Chilli sauce sting chicken wing and a ghetto blast
Off and away with our seat belts fastened
Looking for a girl from a Chinese garden
I’m starved of thoughts of swords and lords
And women torn apart and all these snapper headed freaks
In all their dynasty red carpet stores (fist tight wishing you're wonderful)

Yes, it’s strange and I’m coming ‘cause I love your way
Broke up the party so you’d drive me something strange
Load me up and choke
'Cause I’m low, low, low, yeah

You’re just acting with a massive smile
Got all of these actors who love action
Like they're Brad Pitt, Fight Club
Gonna come snatch her, to go rack some
Off that casper white stuff
(That’s not the vibe love not how you find love)
Coked up on that bad trip, to mount rat-shit
And its taxing right?
Normally you're active, you got passion
But you're passive, right now
'Cause of the antics, you're wrapped in
With these practiced guys, but
(That’s not the vibe love not how you find love)

Let's go let's dash quick, and then pack piff
Before we catch a flight
To tour the axis of the atlas, in the blackness of night
Wake up on a mattress, with mad spliff and acid
Kilpatrick oysters and snappers
Now dancing up on your catfish
Drink the wine and go intergalactic
Call NASA, in the atmosphere
Get lost in the magic, like Shaq did
In that classic era
Never come back to, this dull chapter
Don't have no fear
That’s a vibe, that’s a vibe, that's vibe

Yes, it’s strange and I’m coming ‘cause I love your way
Broke up the party so you’d drive me something strange
Load me up and choke

Broke up beside you and I turn the other way 
Load me up and choke

Quick to bust the mack, better believe that 
She always got my back, nigga twirl that 
About to blaze a sack, where the weed at 
She don't know how to act, 'cause that's my girl black 
With that monster rap, better believe that 
You know the Bronx is back, she represent that 
'Cause Terror Squad got her back, some say heed that 
My niggas love to scrap 

I inhale the deepest, cock back and bust rhymes at your speakers 
I'm troubled, shoot out the air bubbles in your sneakers 
The type to cop a Range along with all the features 
Then take the back streets to avoid the leeches 
A pregnant bitch talk shit, I'ma destroy her fetus 
Her dead baby popped this pussy, and his boys can't beat us 
Straight strong armin', bombarding, and bogarding
Remi don't write her own rhymes, nigga, I beg your pardon

While fraud broads don't get no publishin', still be bitin'
They kill me lyin', like they the ones doin the scribin'
When you can hear the ghostwriter, all up in they rhymin'

Catch me with Pun eatin skittles in the middle of Little Italy 
Y'all don't know diddly, I spit hot, and drop shit
Every time I kick a rhyme, Pun I burn my lip
Take another pull, bust another shot, y'all can't stop me 
Come through in a jail suit, and the new Beef 'n' Broccolis
Doin it, If I'm havin a good time and you ruin it 
I seen a nice casket that'll look good with you in it

Love to smoke weed, stay blowin' trees, fuck liquor 
When shit get thick, I love to hear my bitches raise his clique up 
You sick, but I'm sicker, plus our guns is bigger 
If you really wanna kill us, do it nigga, pull the trigga 
How you figure, you could really come and take what's mine 
And all I gotta do is send a little letter to Rah 
He'll send the troops out

And I'm his little sis, so he taught me the same shit

Cop a heater, turn around and pop your leader
And for the followers, I'ma leave their heads hollower
Make your wig twisted as if I was Oliver
Layin' in a hospital, hooked up the monitors
That's for the game, y'all lames just came to first

Dans nos veines, dans chacun de nos pas
Que reste t-il d'avant dans nos vies ?

De grandes solitudes
Et des doutes par cent

Trop de questions trop de compromis
Les non dits les tensions: la fin des envies

En un soupir , je décampe
Je fais danser des liqueurs entre mes tempes

Ce n'est pas qu'à ton chevet que je passe des nuits blanches
Je pars souvent perdre pied et l'allure est franche
Plus de buée en vitrine, je referme l'agenda
Où s'enlise entre les lignes le peu qui n'est qu'à moi

En un battement de cil, je m'en vais 
Eu un soupir, je décampe, je prends congé
Qui avec moi pour foutre le camp, s'absenter
Disparaître un instant....",Moleskine,

Non moi j'préfère mes cartoons, mes fraises Tagada

Hey hey, je veux faire une pause
Juste un retour en enfance, un dernier caprice
 
J'en conviens, c'est inadmissible
D'être armé jusqu'aux dents d'un pistolet à eau
Je fais même le bruit des missiles
Après d'accord, on fait la paix soldat GI-Joe
 

Hey hey, je veux faire une pause
Juste un retour en enfance, un dernier caprice
Hey hey, qu'elles me manquent ces choses
Et qu'elle est loin l'insouciance, je compte mes cicatrices

J'assume, je suis irresponsable
Mais je ne veux être encore qu'un gamin
Dix fois moins lourd que son cartable
J'veux bien faire le fonctionnaire mais de CE1

Tu te mets à penser
A ce que ta vie aurait été
Si tu lui avais pas un jour dit oui
Pour l'alliance, l'assurance vie
Au crédit pour l'auto
Si t'étais partie un peu plus tôt
D'abord mec idéal
Et puis de plus en plus banal
Aujourd'hui sans mystère 
Juste un gentil colocataire 

Et si l’amour est mort 
Que reste-t-il alors ?
Que reste-t-il alors ?

La magie du flirt
Quand ça tremble sous le tee shirt
Des papillons dans tout le corps
T'as  envie de sentir ça encore
Fantasmes légitimes
Histoires d'amour comme dans les films
Le ralenti d'une première danse
Les yeux fermés, le parfum intense 
De l'eau de rose et puis du champagne
Comme une ivresse qui te gagne
Tu embrasses l'apollon
De passage ou de ton invention

Tu te demandes alors
Aurais-tu des remords ?
Aurais-tu des remords ?

Le désir te dévore
Mais le silence est d'or
Le silence est d'or

Prétextant une soirée entre copines
Tu vas dans des clubs in
Pour voir si tu plais toujours
Pour un peu de piment d'amour
Un numéro sur une serviette de table
Pulsions insoutenables
Des frissons et des blanches nuits
Des je te veux maintenant ici merci
Et les  plaisirs charnels
Te redonnent enfin des ailes
C'est là que revient le tempo
De l'horloge au dessus du frigo

Le désir te dévore

At the crib, I'm hopin' you come over

We can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump
Black magical, act radical with the fist up
Do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop

I don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful
Je ne sais quoi how you say, ""voulez vous?""
Pardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither
'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her
I'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor
But fix my composition and give a proposition to consider

While I mange, just serving long sentences, no commas

I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

Pues hoy cierro yo las puertas al amor
No quiero que jueguen con mi corazón

Por qué me ilusionaste
Con esas tiernas caricias
Y aquellos bellos detalles
Que pintaban mi sonrisa
Por qué fuiste tan cruel de
Demostrarme algo que tú no sentías
Por qué me ilusionaste
Con esas dulces palabras
Decías que eso no era un juego y
Que en verdad yo te importaba
Por qué me ilusionaste de esa forma
Por qué dejaste que me enamorara
Si en verdad no te importaba",¿Por Qué Me Ilusionaste?,2015

Que si son pajarillos silvestres 
Les dirás que su tierra no es esta 
Que los traes de tierra caliente

All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me 
That's some kind of wonderful

And every thing seems to be some kind of wonderful

Remo 4,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

I'll tell you no lie

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

One little thought to me

Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember

Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

You've fallen for somebody new
It isn't too easy believing
You'd leave after all we've been through

It's breaking my heart to remember
The dreams we depended upon
Your leaving is slow dying ember

But if some day you should care to return
Please hurry back and we'll make a new start
Til then you're breaking my heart

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1977

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

It's like I gotta keep remindin' you and remindin' you
Who's that nigga, you heard the kid
Fly was on the casket of all those who oppose the squad us
It's the motherfuckin' don Cartagena ya heard
What?

They wanna know why ya name is Joey Crack
You a hustler, how they think you got the stacks?
You stuck being in jacks on the blocks with your paps
And the squad to hard niggaz gotta fall back
Damn papi, you're shit is icey now
In the bronx witcha Benz rims pokin' out
You got the niggaz in the pen straight lockin' out
But when the don is on nigga close your mouth

Yeah, yo, you wouldn't understand my story of life I live
Most niggaz that really know me got life as bids
The trife as kids, this ain't no scarface shit
These niggaz really will kill you, your wife and kids
I walked through many blocks niggaz couldn't stand on
Had shit locked before I had a glock to even put my hands on
Before I had the doe to put my fams on
Before I had rocks sealed in pink tops, tryin' to get a gram off
A wild adolescent, raised by the street

Mesmerized by the dealers and the places they eat
And when they blazed the heat, I was the shorty to take the hand off
Run upstairs, tryin' to sneak the gat past grand moms
This is how it should be done, my life
Is identical to none, son tried to duplicate but I knew he was fake
'cause every time I walked by he turned blue in the face
I'm like heavy on the leg when I pop
All my change is like heavy on the weight when I cop
It's just the way it's done
Niggaz tell me they respect the way I blaze them guns
On hold it down for the bronx in the name of pun

They wanna know why ya name is Joey Crack
You a hustler, how they think you got the stacks?
You stuck being in jacks on the blocks with your paps
And the squad to hard niggaz gotta fall back
Damn papi, you're shit is icey now
In the bronx witcha Benz rims pokin' out
You got the niggaz in the pen straight lockin' out
But when the don is on nigga close your mouth

Yeah, my name ring bells like a P O
Put the pressure on a nigga like I'm right at the doe
With the muzzle out, nigga can't shoke with my dough
I'm at his mothers house
Beat up his pops, put the pistol in his brother's mouth
Wave bricks, whips, jerked a few coke and next play the strip
With chrome knowin' that they won't forget
And on the weekends we shut down clubs
You know them crazy Peurto ricans always fuckin' it up
If I can't afford it, I'm a extort it

If I can't cut it, I'm a bake it
Strip you niggaz butt-naked, I'm a thorough bred
Carry guns and pump heroin
Never went O.T. I'm too light for Maryland
I'd rather play the streets of New York
Where the friends are guaranteed
To keep the meat on my fork
I'm just a hustler, feds put the tap
On our phones in hopes of cuffin' us
Then wonder why we livin' life so illustrious

They wanna know why ya name is Joey Crack
You a hustler, how they think you got the stacks?
You stuck being in jacks on the blocks with your paps
And the squad to hard niggaz gotta fall back
Damn papi, you're shit is icey now

Stay frontin, like you wild and'll spray somethin
Come to find out, you ain't never slanged nothin
Think it's the game, gon lose the sport
I seen dude's get bruised through fort
Then choose the court, a new's report
They just pursed the court
If you even think of bustin, they ass'll sooth your thoughts
A damn shame, I'm from the streets where it's fair game
Nigga's will ift you off your feet wit the Can-yan
Three in the chest and one in the part
For disrespect you, get left right in front of ya moms

Till the Don out her to the qualities much greater

Ya'll niggas is rappin ass backwards
I left twenty spots since beginnin this rap shit
All yo papi lo que pasa contigo
Mad cause I'm the only nigga reppin our people
When I came in this game, no one wanted the job
All of a sudden niggas actin like they wanna go hard
Spittin venom 'bout the Squad, try and shittin the God
This ain't no ""Scarface"" shit, blow up your kids in the car
And since you wanna act like you livin a movie
I'll hit you with more shots than Bruce Lee got in a ""Fist of Fury""

Listen, I'm from the Bronx were the gun shoot rabid
Front if you want, but don't think we don't shoot rapids
I'm what some might consider a ghost

They call me Prospect, I'm one in a mil
One of the real, I rap but I still put a gun in your grill
I'm the reason why I catch you when your car breezin by, with your Iceberg team
You look when the light turns green
Your scared to death, don't make me have to air at ya chest
Or tear ya flesh, for actin like I carin what's left
Anyone can get it in a minute give it some time, I'm livin this rhyme
Let my nine get in your spine, sit and recline
Get so mad, forget and rewind
So I can see what I did again and just slide
To the next level, hop on the bike and just pedal
Bustin at your best rebel, who runnin to test medal

Yo, yo, It's the T, E, a are a, a are a, O, are Squad
So you know I gotta be that bitch Remy Mar
With Armageddon and your nigga Joe The God
Tony Sunshine and motherfuckin Prospect
Straight out the projects
A forest, where they kill for mils and they blast the steel
But I'm from murda murda Castle Hill
I got a big ass burner, but I'll slash your grill
Yo don't got no status, don't want no static
They knew you was loco toto, and I don't no Spanish
All I know is how to cock back and aim for the cabbage
And keep on bustin 'til the bitch brain splatter
And the kids won't matter, when the crib's on fire
What you spit don't matter, cause this bitch on fire
And I won't stop rockin 'til I retire
Any bitch disagree is a god damn liar

I know it seems every song, is about like the same old thing
But when you rich, ain't nuthin' to do but fuckin' hang
Eat good, spend money, count chunks of change
Keep mah ladies lookin' good, when they touch the Range.
Never fuck wit a bitch, if she can't be trained
Never leave wit a chick, if she don't give brain.
We could leave on trip, I got a private plane
I don't fly, but we could park it up and blaze.
Joe's the God
And I know you need somethin' to praise
Just have a lil faith, and you could be saved.
Uh, it's not mah fualt if they love the kid
It might be the chain or the whip
I don't know what it is.

[Chorus]

Um, I don't mean no harm
But their ain't a chick sicka then Remy Ma
And all the hot boys wanna fuck wit Rem
And I don't turn em away
I'm like, I'm the bomb now.
Where's your gurl, don't matter to me
I'm way out of her league
She can't keep up to mah speed.
She's weak, she don't need to smoke weed
And wherever she's at
Is where she should be.
Now, where's your wife, I don't care
I'll be at the crib, when she ain't there.
Baby do mah nails, and lace mah hair
Take me out on trips and pay the fare.
Maybe.

[Chorus]

Damn, look at all the rocks he got
Ferrari drop 360,hard to top
The party's hot,all white linen affair
I'm doin the suit thang, white Nike Airs.
I'm in the middle of the crowd, like the Don is here.
Shorty whistlin in mah ear
Told me what she wanna hear,she said
""We thuggin'
Smokin' on sumthin'
Down to leave wit ya'll, As long as ya'll fuckin'.""
Woo, thas how you do that there
See me wit mah boys, bring ya crew bak here
We ridin',she drivin'
On our way to the crib, long fish arrivin'.

Fronting like you buy and buy and buy and buy 'em
Claiming that you making so much paper but I know
That I know that you a liar liar liar liar
Let a grand hang out, let a grand hang out
Dip deep into your pockets, let a grand hang out
Let a grand hang out, let a grand hang out
If you balling then quit the stalling, let a grand hang out

Uhh, uhh, uhh, see'mon!
Hey yo, I pull up so aggressive nigga, hopping out the thing
Ice dripping wet like I just hopped up out the rain
My picture perfect pose like I hopped up out a frame
Ain't a coach on the planet that can take me out the game
My heart beats forever like my name was Eddie King
A Midwest rider like my dirty Jesse James
The CEO of dirty and he go by Cornell Haynes
Mean-mugging all you niggas like I hopped up out your dame
I'm like uh-oh, there he go-oh
A hundred and twenty up Natural Bridge in that Mo-Mo
Slipping and sliding, look how he riding pass the po-po
He blazing that fire behind the {?} they don't know-oh
Whoo! I'm really thinking of changing my name to Krispy Kreme

And I still ""Rob"" niggas just like Horry
Everybody hate on Young Tru boy
Cause they know that the nigga on fire fire fire fire

High definition to any form of telecast
Me and young dirty got plenty hoes and hella cash
All I need is a minute to ""Shatter Your Dreams""

And all I do is rep the hood where the jugs be

See I can stunt and tell a chick ""Yo let your man hang out""
Since he fronting like it's nothing, let a grand hang out
Fuck a handout, I been getting ? since way back
Can't wait to see they faces when I drop the Maybach
You lying, you claim you buying but you renting and leasing
If you pimping and niggas spending, where's the paper you seeing?
Stop stalling, I'm balling, call me Sheryl Swoops
Can't stand the backseat driver, that's why I cop the Coupe

Yea, I spit it out quick to put a nigga out
The bullets larged in doctors can't get 'em out
You gets no love, to me y'all dead bugs
My records don't sell then I'ma sell drugs
From O's to whole P's, grams to whole keys
No joke, I got coke that'll make ya nose bleed

Dope so pote and my fiends done OD'd
For three hundred and fifty a pop I'll sell you a dro seed
You really don't know me and that's the fun part
See my flows retarded but Miss Martin is dumb smart
An' you are literate, you can't even read the tele prompta

Another angel in a thug's body scarred and tired
Going to court got a illuminati judgin' me biased
Shit, I talkin' for everybody, walkin' united
The way I walk, it's a challenge just to balance on wires
My old connect put me on said he robbed the supplier
So I pieced him out with pity 'coz his ass was on fire

What goes around comes around holmes I ain't lyin'
That's why the scars on my face 'coz bad karma and violence
Just before a nigga wake I spend the night in silence
To give my nerves a little break before it's back to the malice
I'd like to dedicate this rhyme to old emotional scars
Some nights I meditate hopin' bring me closer to God
Tryin' to regulate my time between the Earth and the stars
Get my health back to determine when I curlin' them bars

We all gon' be eatin' soon like Italians with pasta
Smokin' weed, eatin' curry chicken like the Robsters
After that go to city, Allen and get the lobsters

Now can I get a witness lemme show y'all my visions
Never had a job but still takin' all my business
No G.E.D only the promo what's my lyrics
I rhyme heavenly and let soldiers off the appearance
And rap so I keep my dough stacks don't me go back
And clap, clap at yo do' Matt like nigga hold that
There's no feelings I'm feelin' 'cause when I'm feelin' I'm killin' the Motherfucker right on his trip they killin' the villan what

I was up in the club right as I'm Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin me....

I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening

So I pieced him out with pity 'coz his ass was on fire

What goes around comes around holmes I ain't lyin'
That's why the scars on my face 'coz bad karma and violence
Just before a nigga wake I spend the night in silence
To give my nerves a little break before it's back to the malice
I'd like to dedicate this rhyme to old emotional scars
Some nights I meditate hopin' bring me closer to God
Tryin' to regulate my time between the Earth and the stars
Get my health back to determine when I curlin' them bars

Smokin' weed, eatin' curry chicken like the Robsters
After that go to city, Allen and get the lobsters

Now can I get a witness lemme show y'all my visions
Never had a job but still takin' all my business
No G.E.D only the promo what's my lyrics
I rhyme heavenly and let soldiers off the appearance
And rap so I keep my dough stacks don't me go back

My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we, walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See Money Ain't a Thing nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga

Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come, then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up!
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship, come on!",Lean Back,2004

Verse 1:
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's whilin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin on Crential and cruisin for food when she pulled up beside me sat off in the lap
And I said ""damn girl you actin like you don't know, never seen me before,

She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no vitar
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX, now I'm rich got the world screamin Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go, every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin me....

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I was up in the club right as I'm Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin me....

[Verse 3: Armageddon]
Yous a big girl, eat it up, now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin up swervin the bumps
I'm trynna fuck but I ain't trynna fuck the 23's up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Trynna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just called the boat the front seat
And I think she's about to go down for a season
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason

No fair, 'cause I don't care I go to war wit a musket 
Just give me some Oreo's, a jar of dro and two dutches 
'Cause Pun be the nicest motherfucker on the market 
Now he got the nicest bitch, what, Remi Martin 

[Chorus]",Ms. Martin,2000
Remy Ma,"What?
T-S nigga
Y'all don't know?

Aye yo its on, I see how niggas didn't learn
You is wrong, thought the fire didn't burn
Its on, me and Pun ain't from the Bronx
You's wrong, nigga we can get it on

Aye yo, guns we toss 'em, and bodies we auction
To his family we tell 'em he owed us a fortune
Gimme forty-thou, you can have yo' child, you don't know
What I had to go through, to clap this clown, check my background
The last nigga to see you bleed, the last nigga to see you breath
The last nigga you wish you shoulda believed
And Drag move quick, blend right into a wall like a brick
The only thing you see before I blow off ya shit is my wrist
'cause my hand the gun is covered in
Not this range, when I pump this pistol, it's very rare I miss it
Damn it on ya lips
Y'all keep talkin' like y'all teflon with no weap-ons
Nigga I'm pumpin my four, I ain't throwin no more
Nowadays niggas run upstairs, open they drawer
My circumstance, you ain't got that chance mines in my draw, you get it?
That's means y'all walks for two dicks, so don't be stupid
And make me use one unless you that bitch

Aye yo it's one, you thought I was wack
You was wrong, album double plat
Yo its on, stop talkin shit
You was wrong, get off my dick

How dare you doubt on the ?, 
Big Pun the undoubtable
The only rapper that'll pull out a gun 
And slap the shit outta you
You can't tell me nothin, 
I'll clonk you and stomp out ya belly button
I'm too violent for this rap shit, 
I should be out somewhere killin somethin'
Too quick to blast, some niggas talk shit and dash
But I really will kick your ass
Juggernaut, I don't care if you a thug or not
I'll get Jamaican on ya ass, boy, with the Bambaclad
On your mark get ready, run, I'm sparkin' everyone
The one get locked stand back and watch where you from
How dare you come and try to shit where I eat
Fuck you nigga, literally 
Dick in your cheeks, you rich in the street
But I'm still gon' hit cha'll niggas
Because up north you be tossin salads with maple syrup
I know you hate to hear it, but everybody know this one
Why you always gotta be right nigga, why can't you ever be wrong

Now it's on, from the Bronx where it's at
You was wrong, me and Pun brought it back
Now it's on, stay on with the gat
You was wrong, it's the Don, Joey Crack

Who the fuck want beef with Joe Crack
Make your body fold back
Lift his soul with the chrome mack
I don't chat on the phone, 'cause the phone tapped
You heard there's money on the block we control that
I got the work in the pot where that stove at
Cook it up 'til its wack, get my dough back
You niggas so wack, tryin'a compete
I blind you with heat, I'm the reason crime on the street
I die for my peeps, keep an open eye when I sleep
Let you slide when I coulda put five in your Jeep
Who's liver than me? I ain't know you really want it
I'm like Christ, niggas beg for they life when they see me comin'
Ain't nodoby gonna stop my shine, you out'cho mind
Don't make me have to cock my nine, pop ya spine
Neva did believe in the Don's 
Since ninety-two I've been proving that y'all niggas was wrong

Aye yo, it's on, though I'd stay on the block
You was wrong, now Remi on the rock
So it's on, thought I wasn't gonna drop
You was wrong, I was right all along

I told these niggas, that I was the sickest bitch
And every time you spit, I'ma spit some sicker shit
Ridicoulous, I reminise when I blaze the track
Tight shit, make a nigga want to play ya back
I'm hatin that, but I'ma make 'em all believers
Fuck hot, I'ma come and straight drop a fever
Cop a heater, turn around and pop your leader
And for the followers, I'ma leave their heads hollower
Make your wig twisted as if I was Oliver
Layin' in a hospital, hooked up the monitors
That's for the game, y'all lames just came to first
'cause I ain't neva heard a bitch straight flame a verse
I blame the church, how God let you lie like that
Who scribed you for, 'cause you ain't neva' rhymed like that
How the fuck you gon' tell me that chick is tight
She ain't 'aight 'cause she don't write, you wrong

The CEO of dirty and he go by Cornell Haynes
Mean-mugging all you niggas like I hopped up out your dame

Slipping and sliding, look how he riding pass the po-po

Everybody hate on Young Tru boy
Cause they know that the nigga on fire fire fire fire

And all I do is rep the hood where the jugs be

Since he fronting like it's nothing, let a grand hang out
Fuck a handout, I been getting ? since way back
Can't wait to see they faces when I drop the Maybach
You lying, you claim you buying but you renting and leasing
If you pimping and niggas spending, where's the paper you seeing?
Stop stalling, I'm balling, call me Sheryl Swoops
Can't stand the backseat driver, that's why I cop the Coupe

Half the niggaz in the squad got a scar on their face 
It's a cold world and this is ice 
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life 
Got the Phantom in front of the buildin, Trinity Ave 
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad 
As a young'n - was too much to cope with 
Why you think ? mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit Shoulda been called Armed Robbery 
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny 
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle 
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble 
Came out the gate on some Flow Joe shit 
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo kid!

With a matchin jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion 
My niggaz in the club, but you know they not dancin 
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies 
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies 
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us 
And we - walk around the metal detectors 
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section 
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it 
Said he - liked my necklace, started relaxin 
Now that's what the fuc* I call a chain reaction 
See ""Money Ain't a Thing"" nigga, we still the same niggaz 
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga

You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit 
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit 
If Five-o boy come, then they'd proudly squeal 
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Pharrell 
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya 
These faggot niggaz even made gang signs commercial 
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin it up 
B2K crip walkin like that's what's up!

My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Look at ya self in the mirror like what the fuck

Damn I look good and can't nobody freak it like I could
Yea OK I got a little fat but
My shorty told me that he like it like that
I'm happy
Another nigga never can't be

And all I want you to do is just bless me, lets see
This kid that I'm waiting on
He said he loves when my jeans look painted on
Wit a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always getting hated on
Now shorty tryna push up on me like a wonder bra
Listen when I speak out I wouldn't want you take it wrong
Now number one I don't need you
Ya names Q I only see you wen I see you
Listen two you never play me
Why is that? why is that?
Cause I'm such a fucking lady
And three is all about me I don't want to talk about it

Here you go I wrote a song about it

And I look to good to be loving you
You know I look way to good to stuck with you
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look too good to be getting with
And I look to good to be having kids
You know I look way to good to be in the crib
I'm conceited I got a reason

I don't know what I'm doing
I can't stop my body from moving
I'm bopping and poppin' to the music
He's watching me and he's bout to lose it
I'm dropping that hotter den drop it like its hot
Face down ass up, on some new shit
I'm out of control wit it
Dip it low pick it up slow poke it out now roll wit it
My thong showing but it's cool my shoes go wit it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it
See I look good and I'm knowing it
But I was never to proud to be showing it

Bitch don't ask me why I gotta nice grill
This is just how my face is

Slightly racist, right now I'm robbing a thief and I'm fuckin a rapist
I married an imagrant to get him his papers
Niggaz don't wanna give me the mic 'cause they afraid I'mma say shit
And that's right I'mma say shit
Right in they faces

Been on my own since I was half of 30

Because I was always pretty
I find a dumb nigga gettin dough and do his pockets dirty
But see that wasn't workin
And I wasn't tryna work in
I got my own work in
I started puttin work in
Some say it ain't worth it
I say I ain't perfect
Matter of fact I'm sayin, doin the fuck I feel
I make people nervous
Who say I ain't bout it
I'm still from the projects
What you talkin bout bitch
I sets it on bounces
I don't think you understand son
You know how many clubs I been from
And I can careless
I'm so careless

How he made me drive fast when I should have been cruisin'

And shorty just popped up in the middle of the street

And they really gonna be hatin' this gun on my waist
And I checked shorty's pulse and I don't think she's gonna make it

Look at my rope chain, now check my belt buckle
Put my gazelles on my eyes, now I'm lookin' for trouble

I need a Solider that's stackin' an' packin'
We can't even talk if you can't fit a magnum
I'm fresh to def when it comes to fashion

See, I switched up to my 8 ball jacket
And my spandex got me stoppin' traffic
Baby, not for nuttin', I'ma walkin' accident
They catch whiplash, every time I'm passin' 'em
It's time for some, time for some, time for some

I'm from the BX, Bronx, where it started at
We had jams in the park, motherfuckers a disco
Everybody smokin' joints, sippin' Cisco

Two turn tables and the microphone full throttle
I'll pull up in that Alf or a Mayo Malano, system bangin'
Drivin' reckless, like I don't give a fuck about my be-be-S's
Yo, check this

I hopped out wit my ass cheeks showin'
Through my salt n peppers
Only got one chance to make a first impression
Spit like Big Pun and KRS one mixxed

My Flows sick but it's more than rappin'
First chick try to front, first chic,k I'm smackin'
On some Redman shit, bitch I ain't laughin'

Like there ain't no stoppin'

All my fellas say, oh, my ladies say, awe
Yeah, MC's gon' move the crowd, I'm fuckin' dope
Fresh to def, cold, chillin' and I'm sippin' on juice and gin

It's Friday night and I just got paid
I ain't dressed up or nuttin'm I'm tryna get laid
I'm tryna get shorty over there wit the fade
By the end of the night to say my name

But these lights is all in my face
And I'm really feelin' like I'm a star on stage
Cameras flashin', everybody pose
'Cause it's about time for some

Remy Ma,"See, I'm like a new breed of female
When God made me, He was just showin? off
See most niggaz call a girl, when they wanna give a dick
My shawtys call me when they wanna get a brick

'Cause even when I'm not spitting
I'm still like bitch in the kitchen with that tight ass vision
And the way I chef up make you hang that connect up
See I guarantee to bring that extra to the buck thirty of white
Make 200 hard in this, butta plus 70 grand for Remy Ma

God, now that's a prophecy, I'm like a profit
And I?ma have all of my followers run through your projects
Smack the shit out of anybody that's not on my bus
They plan the private but what they forgot is

I?ma lunatic, crazy ass bitch with not enough sense
And too much dollars
I pop your top right off of your fuckin' collar
[Incomprehensible] I know where I be nigga holla

Yeah, she's got the li'l' crib in the secret location
Laced it, put a strip pole in the basement
Never keep the guns the same place where the safe is
Never keep the fun?s the same place where the base is

Laced it, put a strip pole in the basement
Never keep the guns the same place where the safe is
Never keep the fun?s the same place where the base is

that's word to grandma, cock the hammer
On the block and blow ya face that's in front of the camera
See if you plug that hole with ya little bandanna
And I still got my jewels like my name is Santana

Look li'l' homie y'all really don't know me
Lookin' for the squad but see I'm by my lonely
Bitches gon? pay ?cause them motherfuckers owe me
Like puff 'n' maize, can't nobody hold me

Down from the boogy Bronx style with my hoodie why?all
Got pounds in the brown right on the boulevard
Gettin' so down in that motherfuckin' tittie bar
Like fuck these bitches I'm tryna get pissy and I'm not gay
So fuck the body, yardy

Look around, this is sausage party when I pull up in the pink Benz
With the powder pink tins on 22 inches
Half black chink friends hop out with the pink Tims
Laced with the mink trim, platinum with the pink chins

What you gon? think then, bet you gon? love them
You gon? wanna fuck but Shabba?s sayin' fuck Rem
So now I have to fuck them

she's got the li'l' crib in the secret location
Laced it, put a strip pole in the basement
Never keep the guns the same place where the safe is
Never keep the fun?s the same place where the base is

Got the li'l' crib in the secret location
Laced it, put a strip pole in the basement
Never keep the guns the same place where the safe is
Never keep the fun?s the same place where the base is

Look I ain't too hard, these broads are just too easy
That's why every time I rhyme I be doin' them greasy
Please believe me I'm hot no matter the season
I spit so sick the track be sneezin'

Hook be coughin' got the whole studio freezin'
If you hit me and I hit you, we still ain't even
'Cause I'm not leavin' 'til you stop breathin'
Ain't nothing worst than gettin' popped for no reason

I wanna see you shot, laid out just leakin'
Your words can't come out 'cause ya mouth keep bleedin'
Your tank top burgundy, white tee burgundy
I know why?all bitches wishin' that them niggaz would've murdered me

Remy Ma, you know me if not you heard of me
The reason you gon? have to invest in plastic surgery
I'm good with a hood ?n? some Tims, fuck burglary
My weed?s from of the islands and my guns is out in Germany

Remy Ma,"See, it's crazy, 'cause people be thinkin that I be changin, but it's really them [that be changin], 
(yo) I remember the day, I first signed my record deal with Loud... everything was so good, everyone was so proud
I was so very happy, stood with my baby daddy...
We livin with my granny, but we was all family.
It's like wen the tour began, that's wen the war began...he would be flippin, rippin soon as I'm walkin in.
And I'm so sleepy, could barely stay awake, you don't understand, I been in the studio for six weeks straight... till 4 in the mornin tryna finish these songs
N all you wanna talk about is how many times you was callin
N I'm always lyin...it's never the truth...it never crossed you're mind that I couldve been in the booth??
...Tryna hurry up n get back home to you, tryna get these checks so we could get out the 'jects
I wasn't thinkin bout no niggas, wasn't thinkin bout sex..tryna do this show so I could get this dough.
All I was thinkin was I gott finish Remy on the rocks n I'm not tryina flop so it gotta be hot...
Everybody on my back sayin hurry up n drop so I'm askin you, wut I'm suppose to do?

[CHORUS]

Listen y'all, I kno it seem like I be dissin y'all,
I'm jus tryina reach my goals and remain focused but
Ain't shit changed, naw, I'm still the same
So wish me well,
Sometimes I might scream and yell...
But even people with a fan base have bad days but
Ain't shit changed, for real, I'm still the same.

[Yo] You was the only child, until I came
See we was buckwild back in the days...
I was scared to have a boyfriend 'cause you would beat him up,
We'd eat cereal together, watch cartoons wen we got up
So I couldnt believe that you flipped on me right in the streets for a bitch so weak that ain't got shit but
A fucked up weave n I'm your blood, your little sister, I started to cry... said it must be the liquor,
See I almost died wen you took sides with her then walked off, and just left me there, like I was nobody n you really ain't care.
Said you would die for me, how you ain't gon ride wit me, how you see me on the block and don't say hi to me??
It's all love now, n its all done now, but you never took the time to apoligize to me...
It may be hard to see, but it bothers me... I know you ain't gon let nobody do no harm to me...
But you can't be actin like you fathered me...so I'm askin you, wut I'm suppose to do??

[CHORUS]

Listen y'all, I kno it seem like I be dissin y'all,
I'm jus tryina reach my goals and remain focused but
Ain't shit changed, naw, I'm still the same
So wish me well,
Sometimes I might scream and yell...
But even people with a fan base have bad days but
Ain't shit changed, for real, I'm still the same.


Mommy... you was the one that named me, but you didn't raise me...
You left me all alone, I had to home my own,
But now I'm all grown n far away from home
I kno you love me, but you did me wrong...
I guess it was all the drugs that you was on or the beatings you got from my foul step pops...
Remember the time his punk ass had the nerve to raise his hands to me bitch nigga blackin my eye...
I was wishin he would die, now I wish him life.
I kno he seein me blowin, and its killin him slowly, but what kills me is that you watched him hit me, 
So I'm askin you, wut I'm suppose to do??

Listen y'all, I kno it seem like I be dissin y'all,

Let me replace the love and the faith

Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's life style
Could it be you're fallin' in love
Right now, right now, right now

Could it be, it can't be Pun I'm callin' ya bluff
I must be high off this weed 'cause I ain't fallin' in love
All that I eva dreamed of was fuckin' a thug
So I could bust a few slugs and sell a little drugs
Be up in the Benz, chillin', rollin' ya blunts
Have the Spanish mommies illi' 'cause I'm sittin' in front

And niggas on the block sick like what cha doin' wit that spic
Y'all don't know? Puerto Ricans and blacks make the cutest kids
Ya hair, my eyes, ya nose, and my lips
If it's a boy, I hope that God bless him with his daddy's dick, shit
To tell the truth with you. I know, I'm safe and another nigga
Frontin' and get blown in his face and I like that

You give me love and I give it right back
But when you flip don't you think I ain't gon' fight back
Pun you got dough and you know, I got a nice stack
So when you mad, go ahead take ya ice back
I just throw on some lipstick and the stylistics break up to make up

And you know, I hook a steak up, take you breakfast in bed
Nigga, soon as you wake up, get my jewels back
And take another trip to see Jacob, lovin' the way I do this for you
And every kiss that I blew, poppy chew was a kiss for you
Stayed true, faithful, you can never say, ""I played you""
'cause you ma boo and I can never say, ""I hate you""

With a thug right now
Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's life style
Could it be you're fallin' in love
Right now, right now, right now

I swept you off ya feet, you was just walkin' crossin' the street
And you was talkin' to me or was it my boys in the jeep
Either or she said she loved the way I play ball
Go after the bigger niggas even though there was nice and tall
Shootin' dice in the hall inside of my doorway checkin' my drawers

Up north style right next to ma boys, just the little things
Would impress her a lot like when I let her sit in the lex tryna
Guess, where it's at, God blessed her with ass
She had the perfect mix, she was Morena with an Indian twist
She had the cinnamon lips the edge was rimmy and crisp

I thought she was Dominican the way she was swinging them hips
I never had a clue that she wanna ride with me but I'm like Darnell
Shorty had eyes for me, it's a quarter passed one
But that's another song, what was wrong? Why you took so long
To put a brotha on? It was't long before we start bumpin'and grindin'

Crushin' her spine and had her soundin' like Busta was rhyming
Bustin' her hymen, the sight of sex she start bustin' out cryin'
Her bus went by and she was ready up in there rydin'
Cussin' and wildin', talkin' dirty in the back of the porch
Whose pussy is this? Come on, daddy, it's yours

Could it be, you're fallin' in love
With a thug right now
Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's life style
Could it be you're fallin' in love

What to do he buggin like that's a little me inside of you
It ain't true and I'm scared and I can tell he is worried a bit

My jeans don't want to fit every morning hurling and shit
I had to tell my family I knew they all was goin to flip
And his was happy thinking he was about to be a daddy
But I knew it wasn't true even though we both wanted it so badly

In my body but it don't gotta to live it's up to me but if I keep what 
The fuck I got to give I mean I'm still young and I don't really have

Under a lot of pressure but all I need is the remedy to make Remy 
Feel better I knew I couldn't win so I chose to forfeit its a shame
I'm over four months and I'm in the doctors office I swear to all that
I love that I wanted to leave and wait five more months and birth the child 
That I conceived but I sat there because I felt I had to and I cry everyday
Because I realize boy or girl that I wanted to have you don't be made at me 
How it is is how it had to be and any pain I put you through is all coming 
Back to me 

Tell me what's goin I know what I'm doing is wrong

Oops, I mean Phantom; my words got tangled, man
But this tiger stripe watch make this bitch a Bengals fan
We all know Jacob; check the shit he did
He spent more time making the band than Diddy did
You feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse
I'm out in DC at the white and gold house
Wanna convince me, love? Secret service me with some of that Lewinsky love

Now, sometimes he get heated
And I know he don't mean it
But as much as he accused me,
I should have cheated
And even if I cheated, he wouldn't believe it
Cause right after I read it, messages gets deleted

So look back on your treasured days
When we were young in a world that was so tired
Though it's not what we wanted before
Even the saints had to crawl from the floor

Summers when the money was gone you'd sing 
All your little songs that meant everything to me

And I'll remember you
And the things that we used to do
And the things that we used to say
I'll remember you 
That way

Remember how they tried to hold you down
And we climbed those towers and looked out upon our town
And everything you hoped would last 
It just always becomes your past
It hurts

But summer's when the money was gone you'd sing 
All your little songs that meant everything to me

And I'll remember you
And the things that we used to do
And the things that we used to say
I'll remember you 
Always

But then how this world slipped through my fingers
And even the sun seemed tired
I still cared
As they lowered you down my heart just jaded
In that moment the earth made no sound
But you were there
You helped me lift my pain into the air

I still miss you 
God I still miss you
I know that you are waiting there
I always thought that you'd come home

And I'll remember you
And the things that we used to do
And the things that we used to say

If it don't hurt me it won't hurt you
If it don't hurt you it won't hurt me that way",Perfect Memory (I'll Remember You),2007

Que hemos tenido tal vez se nos gasto

Tal vez nunca te he dado lo que tú esperabas
Y no estaba cuando me necesitabas

Tal vez no te escuché tal vez me descuidé
Tal vez se me olvido que yo te amaba
Tal vez y puro ponzoña musical primo

Tal vez será que por ahora ya no hay nada que hablar
Tal vez esta vez necesitamos tiempo para pensar
Y yo por mi parte propongo intentarlo de nuevo

Que lo pienso no encuentro

Come along with me
The day can breathe once more
To hear the sound of closing doors
The night has opened up its eyes to see day
A thousand moving just as one
A feeling that's so certain
That when this day is done
The paper lads will -

Come with the dawn, casting light on the play
Acting it out in our own special way
Making our entrance and reading the lines
The story of people who live by the Tyne

Back home once again
The streets that seemed so long
They're waking now
The job is done
See people run to catch the wheels of their lives
The cities reading every line
But while it sleeps you're working
In a world that's just your own
For paper lads alone -

In the dawn going round every day
Seeing your home town in different ways
Carry the news, solving problems you find
Though young who knows what goes on in your mind

There before your eyes
Only to exist
Time has held tomorrow yearning while apart
Now the longing has begun for you

Suns will never set
And shall not forget
Promises we made
Somewhere there's a harbour
Though we pass her by
Where our ship can be and safely lie
In the warmth of her arms
Inside a perfect day

And with each passing moment
We wait to sail away

Cast all their doubts away

Though she's flown, wild and free

There beneath his mind she lays

Smiles just a winter smile
Tries to hang on

What it is that's gone

Thunder roaring at the harbour
Women drawn in fear
Huddle up to wait the time
And pray the sky will clear
Howling winds and the raging waves
Cracked upon the boats
And torn from safety, torn from life
Men with little hope

Stood on a tightrope for so long

For someone that you've never met?

A picture of health a real gold mine
Lovely to look at and lovely to hold
A spirit that's broken and a heart that's ice cold

You know she nearly made it, but she had a child instead

And in his heart he carries the message that they need
We move against the tyrant

From hiding in the hills we enter the burning sun

Danger fills the air and the dawn
Holds a sweet but stale perfume

What good are men that love but our slaves
In a country they once called their own?
As they kissed goodbye they have flown

And in each heart is carried the message that they need

Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde
Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde

Deep down inside he hides
A twist that we maybe missed
Confusion and nasty trick of fate
Might be the break
Don't find yourself too late
Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde
This man acid raving beast
His eyes, his rage unleash
He tears apart all at hand
Back to the wall is his stand

[Chorus:]

Duplicated man, inside, double tied
Prisoner, he's back to back, face to face
Mirrored shadows always changing place
Separated man himself he divides
Opposite needs he can't see where to hide
A single double side - Jekyll and Hyde
This man unsteady and unsure
Where did he go before
Slightly afraid you may see
Forgetting who you may be

[Chorus:]",Jekyll and Hyde,1990
Renaissance,"Met a man with the answer to everything
Books and words from philsophers come
Analysed and he cut down a winter tree
To find the sun

Fell asleep, had a dream by the winter tree
Heard the snow fall and melt into spring
Saw the ice lose its hold
On the pale frost grass
To which it clings

[Chorus:]
Have you ever seen a better day
Though we follow many different ways
Though your mind may hold the winter time
Spring is never very far behind
In the summer under open skies
We'll see the sunshine, shine on
Take it easy live today today
We'll see the sunshine, shine on

When I woke there I was by the winter tree
Nothing changed but a thought in the air
Seasons turn, take their days
And in time, I'll take mine
I'll go back there

Horizons seem to beckon me

It's not for money and it's not for fame
I just can't explain, sometimes it's lonely

Early hours pass away
I sing to you of northern lights
I sing for you of northern nights

Past or future, here or there
Shelter comes in words from you, so talk to me
I hear your voice, it comforts me
In morning dreams I take your hand
You walk with me

The northern lights are in my mind
They guide me back to you
Peace enfolds the still night air
Home again I look for you and find you there

Take the easy way, bring me down
Making the hard way now I see
Hard to be really free, I'm missing you near me

So safe the second city

Far below the narrow streets that sing
With the movement of the crowd

As life goes on
Secure as French men can be
Fill your time with love and wine
And in your heart you'll know as long as you
There will always be a song

Then on a winter's day
With your face against the cold and rain
In the wind there's changes
The rivers rise
The water grips the town - tears fill her eyes

I'm standing here which way to go
The crossroads call, but they don't know
Midnight, caught inside
I'm standing here, could all be lost
The crossroads call
You've stood so long

It weaves the strangest picture
Of silky thread
The shadows cast reflection
Lyons as the water's bed
Trees that stand look straight ahead
And search for a sight of distant land

This was a winter's day
In your heart you felt the cold and rain
Change the wind to silence
There's not a sound
Silver patterns run and dance
Upon the ground

Stark in winter, shadows black
Still in my mind, no turning back

Blend with ours, their voices heard

That she would want to own

For you to hold

Have turned to gold, turned to gold

Filled him with her light
And was consoled she was the moon
And he, the sun was gold

Eyes were blinded with his light
The sun she gave
Reflected back the night
The moon was waning almost out of sight

Softly ocean gypsy calls
Silence holds the stars awhile
They smile sadly
For her where she falls

Just the time before the dawn
The sea is hushed
The ocean calls her
Day has taken her and now she's gone

Noone noticed when she died
Ocean gypsy shackled to the tide
The ebbing waves were turning
Spreading wide

Something gone within her eyes
Her fingers, lifeless, stroke the sand
Her battered soul was lost
She was abandoned

Silken threads like wings still shine
Winds take pleasure still make patterns
In her lovely hair
So dark and fine

Stands on high beneath the seas
Cries no more
Her tears have dried
Oceans weep for her the ocean sighs
