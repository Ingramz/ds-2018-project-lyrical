Pussycat,"Sweet as a honey bee but like a honey bee stings,
you've gone and left my heart in pain.
All you left is our favorite song, the one we danced to all night long.
It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be,
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.
Breaking up never, it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song, 
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Precious memories keep-a lingering on, 
ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.
The happiness we spent, we used to dance to the music
make romance to the music, 
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone. 
Oh I can't bear to hear it, 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone; 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone; 
 

",It's the Same Old Song,1996
Pussycat,"I still see the Sunday morning light
Start again how t used to be
Funny that I never realize
All through my thoughts away
A little dool that was at my side
I start to sing a new song
Than to hear someone say goodby
The day u came along
Down in mexicale lane
There`s a place where I became
So alone I long to hold you one more time
Down in mexicale lane
I`ll be seeing u again

Till tomorrow I`ll be dreaming that you`re mine
It`s the first time that I fell in love
Its the last time that I care
You`ll forever only thinking on
Till I hold you again
You change my life into a rose overgreen
I`ll never thought
I`ve been found I tell my friends
All where I`ve been
I won`t be back no more
Down in Mexicale Lane
There's a place where I became
So alone I long to hold you one more time
Down in Mexicale lane
I'll be seeing you",Mexicali Lane,1996
Pussycat,"Where you can hear a country song from far 
And someone play the honky-tonk guitar 
Where all the lights will go out one by one 
The people join the song 
And the wind takes it away 

Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea 
And lovers found the place they'd like to be 
How many times before the song was ending 
Love and understanding 
Everywhere around 

Mississippi, I'll remember you 
Whenever I should go away 
I'll be longing for the day 
That I will be in Grennville again 
Mississippi, you'll be on my mind 
Everytime I hear this song 
Mississippi roll along 
Until the end of time 

Now the country song for ever lost its soul 
When the guitar player turned to rock & roll 
And everytime when summer nights are falling 
I will always be calling, dreams of yesterday 

Mississippi, I'll remember you 
Whenever I should go away",Mississippi [German],1996
Pussycat,"For each moment of tears
I still had my souvenirs
Cherished in a pocket full of dreams
I could hold I could feel
Kept pretending they were real
Long time after lovers stayed away.
Now a picture of you
I had cherished so true
Even kissed 'till I'd seen you again
But when

I've been crying today
Threw my memories away
Something died as I cried
For my broken souvenirs.
Can I reach for the sun
Find a place I belong
Now you're one of my broken souvenirs.
If you'll need me again
There's no way you really can
Pasted pieces never make a whole
And if you leave your room
On some windy afternoon
Try to see where all the pieces flew.
It was hard to get on
Since my memories were gone
But if you'll ever see me again
I can

I've been crying today
",My Broken Souvenirs,1996
Pussycat,"There were days I couldn't weep
nights I couldn't sleep
And ev'ry thing I did just turned out wrong
Till there was you to dry my tears

Whisper love-words in my ears and this is why
I'm glad you came along.

Now there's a smile to cheer me up when I'm lonely
That I can call whenever I'm feeling down.
Smile
and you know that I'm only
Longing for the minute you'll be around.
Help me 'cause I'm trying to get over

The way I thought of love many times before
If ever you should go away and nobody else would be near.
There's always a smile to remember that you were here.
If I could fly I flew away to a bright blue summer-day

Tryin' to share my love with you for evermore.
Darling you made my life complete

You're ev'ry thing I need
I'll never be
The same I was before.

Now there's a smile to cheer me up when I'm lonely. . .",Smile,1996
Pussycat,"Your Mammy has been looking while Daddy stayed inside
And if you ever show up before the morning light
Everything that's said and done is not your point of view.
You stayed the whole night through with your friend Jeany -
Teenage Queenie.
You may be good looking but you don't know how to be -
Your wardrobe's always empty.
And no'one '11 ever see you've been growing for some time
Had lovers quite a few.
Now all you ever do is being dreamy - Teenage Queenie.
Teenage Queenie
You're lost every night
And your Mammy worried your Daddy's uptight.
Teenage Queenie
You still gotta grow
'cause if you wanny be free it's a long time to go.
You like to hear the music - dance on the beat
Where ever it goes slowly it's not your kind of speed.
Your sister has been seeing you in some big shining car
He owned the bar a fellah called Rossini - Teenage Queenie.
",Teenage Queenie,1996
Pussycat,"Wet days in September
Raindrops fallin' tender
As I stare outside my window
And I see the clouds are passin' by.
I am feelin' lonely -
Uh
I love you
Uh
I want you
Uh
I need you so I think I'll die.
And as I fall asleep
All the tears I weep
Are because
Uh
I love you
Uh
I want you
Uh
I need you so I think I'll die.
But there's the morning sun
And all wakes upthat I can be fun
Then all my dreams are gone.
But how can I dream when you're gone my love
And you're makin' love
With every girl
But not with me ?
Yes
Times have been changed since you went away
That I heard you say:
I love you
I need you
So much I think I'll die.
Yeah
I love you need you.
So much I think I'll die.
Why must I remember
Every wet day in September?
Just because
Uh
I love you
Uh
I want you
Uh
I need you so I think I'll die.
But there's the morning sun
...
But how can I dream when you're gone my love

Pussycat,"You say, that's world will getting harder 
Every time you see someone to be loved
Their some evil mind keeps you right for home, to come through
The world 'll getting smaller
And I don't know what to done that
I'll should be your woman 

You sir,loved to be much deeper
And you try to get up 
Now you 've lost your trust
Anything I say could be true
Trouble 'll getting harder 
Please let me pulled you through

I'll be your woman in sorrow and pain
I'll be your woman sunshine or rain
There's a star here in your heart to get burn
Maybe 'll you throw it away
Maybe without tears every day
Say you shared with me
I'll be your woman

You say you're a looser 
But loosers never die
And if you could let me teach you

Darling here's what I 'll be 
I'll be your woman in sorrow and pain

Pussycat,"Then the music stop,all the lights went out
Someone is crying now a time ago
For a moment we wished reality wasn't mend to be hurting so
A falling star music and candlelight
You know where they are so darling lead me through the night
When the music stopped ,we just walked away
Into every day people go 
Cloudy summer nights, dying city lights ,now I know that I need you so 

Please stay by me cause I can still feel the falling rain
I wanna be loved by you and the music starts again

Pussycat,"When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now, give me more

Sway me, make me
Thrill me, hold me
Bend me, ease me
You have a way with me

Hey, yeah, sway me
Sway, sway, sway

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak, I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Sway me, sway me

Putney Dandridge,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Putney Dandridge,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart",When I Grow Too Old to Dream,1990
Putney Dandridge,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1996
Putney Dandridge,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1996
Putney Dandridge,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,

I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

Why mucha gente, me dice vente

Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,

Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!

Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Pyogenesis,"I hear the drums echoin' tonight
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, twelve-thirty flight
Moonlight wings reflect the stars that guide me toward salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turns to me as if to say
Hurry boy it's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing but a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

As the grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seem to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

Pyrrah,"In nights cold and grim
The graves open up
Lifeless cadavers roam the earth
To take their revenge
Tormented souls without hope
No possible escape
A terrible fate they must lead
But they do not complain

The town sleeps most calmly
Unknowing, full of bliss
The room might reek of death
Yet they sleep in peace

Gasping for a final breath
Awoken savagely
Staring in death?s cold eyes

Torture and let bleed slowly
These are the dead
Arisen from eternal sleep
They are the sleepwalkers

Not a scream, not a sound
Lungs ripped out of sleeping bodies
The art of silent slaughter
They want nothing, but to harm
Get revenge on the human race
For all its evils

Torture and let bleed slowly
These are the dead
Arisen from eternal sleep
They are the sleepwalkers

As warm blood hits the ground
Life leaves drop by drop
Nothing left but an empty carcass
To one day join the sleepwalkers

Sleepwalkers of the night
Eternal and forever there
They will not stop killing
Until we are theirs
We are theirs
We are theirs
We are theirs
We are theirs

Python Lee Jackson,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony
(cloud nine)  you're a million miles from reality.

It's silliness, with no love for the culture

Tryna get rich, yeah, it really makes me nautious
They're the reason, some women, they have abortions

I focused to spit it right, my songs are an offerin'

Knowledge first, over beats, producers are samplin'
Myself and creations, on the line as I offer in
It's kinda sad that the toxins are smotherin'
Youth in the hood, poisoned by instant messages

Materialism, barbarianism, all types of isms
And schisms by tainted vision
I watched you grow from a seed into a forest
I watered you and watered you but your flowers are dyin'

Mad 'cause everybody only wanna use you
I admit I used you, but together
We have family, my album's in your name
I'm loving your music beautifully, I feel you slippin' away

Come here girl, uh-uh, can't have my love gone
It's like En Vogue, I guess I gotta 'Hold On'
I wanna drop it for the cause, I know you righteous
Spit something from the heart, help clean up the virus
Decapitate ferocious, peg leg rap pirates

They only flowing now, 'cause the dough flowing now
Who, what, when, why, where and how
I'm sorry baby, that you've been used and abused
And served like hell, some they say I'm a tattle tale
If that when I see wrong done to you, you know I got to tell
Tell, tell, tell, tell

I'm sorry, look what they've done to me
Left my love behind to suit their fantasies
I'm dying, why won't they just let me be?

Real uh? Real hard and fast
Passing fony clique's like a thing of the past
See, were coming up smooth, with the gangsta groove
Just layin' it down, without a thing to prove
So keep on Blazin' Up, and keep that ass lit
Cuase you can't get enough of that gangsta shit

[Chorus 2x:]
Can't get enough of that gangsta shit
Triple see, steady droppin' hits
Can't get enough of that gangsta shit
Fuck with us, and get a busted lip (bitch)

[Verse 2]
Teerin' it up? naw the same old shit
Another hit comin' from the clicka Central Coast Clique
Walking down the street's blowing motherfuckas up
Your talking much shit, and you can't get enough
Pissed off cause a rhymin' every time
Not once in a while, but on every line
Mixing, rhyming, is every thing to me
1-3 style, won't rap for free
I do it my way, Central Coast way, all the way
To see if another mexicano rapper makes my day
Fuckin' it up on the microphone, stutt-stuttering anything
Better leave that shit home, and take a lesson from mexicano's that know
How to drink down, smoke, and fucking flow
So keep on Blazin' Up, and keep that ass lit
Cause you can't get enough of that gangsta shit

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
From city to city, block to block
Buster dropped, to the sound of my glock
Just letting all you putos know
You gotta slow your roll, and start a gangster kinda stroll
When you live in the Central Coast, the shit is all good
But being Mexican, I miss understood
So I use my verse to get my point across
The Central Coast Clique, you down, or get tossed
It's a motherfucking family
Triple see, and that's the way it's gotta be
Keep dropping hits and taking toast's
Drinking shit, and pumpin' out smoke
Dropping shit up on whatever you do
For whatever you do, keep your fucking game true
So keep on Blazin' Up, and keep that ass lit
Cuase you can't get enough of that gangsta shit

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 4]
It's somethin' about the Central Coast sound, huh?
Feelin' the beat when we get down
Flowin' to a motherfucking be	-a-shit
If you got no rhythm, then you might as well quit
Step off the mic and off stage, and while your at it
Check at the crowd and check the gauge
Fucking it up like we always do
Some down ass homies and your damn ass crew
So keep your ass off the mix, bitch
Or you'll find your self in another fucking fix, bitch
Fony motherfucker, studio gangsta
Little trick ass bitch, motherfucking ranker
I never told a lie when I'm flowing on the mic
Your daddy is a queer and your mama is a dike
So keep on Blazin' Up, and keep that ass lit
Cuase you can't get enough of that gangsta shit

You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do

Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope

Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip,

Oxy in me pulse
He don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit, we sinners when me and Abstract are together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers, dammit we winners
Pillaging this rap shit, homie, they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow
And then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me!

Incredibly we do it, and it resonates the music
I tune it, YouTube it, it could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas
Bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners
Blatant non-believers and over-achievers
Kicking it in paisley[?] Adidas
Drink Aliz in liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us, and her man's attitude defeated
But never a scandal, because me and Busta came to handle, we gentlemen

Not to mention, we're veterans
Second, he need some medicine
Before I black[?] as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas
But then again, you need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless?
It's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons
See how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it and I rep the foreverness
Flying, United Emirates - sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left",Thank You,

Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean (Okay)

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up
(Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love b-u-d-d-y (why)
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny
I seem (very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip
(Gotta gotta flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Oh let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)
Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas should we keep her aware
(Mmm Hmm, yeah!)",Buddy,1989
Q-Tip,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Y'know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, prducer extrodinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the B-I-T-C-Hes
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skinz in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uhn, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, i'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother #1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, y'knowhatI'msayin
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitley chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enuff
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the street
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

Q-Tip,"[Big Daddy Kane]
When I'm in motion, it's just like the flow of the ocean 
The weight of the words swerve and curve 
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas 
Quick as a Lamborghini, smooth as a Lexus 
I guess that makes me the top of the line 
Oh, yes, I'm the most prime of all time 
'Cause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin, and the lyrics just start 
To flowing, ahem-ahem, coughing couldn't stop me from going 
On with the rapture, so that I can capture 
Your mind with state of the art music made to adapt to 
To knowledge, the God on the groove 
Because when my tongue moves, I just love that I'm smooth 
Do it with these and in times I leave reason
To give 'em a little of the flavor that please 
As I school in the who in pursuin', and doin', and reignin' again
And the gutter, and stutter, and killin', and chillin', collectin' the rent, and 
Jammin', and slammin', and, damn, it's 
Too much for one mind to comprehend 
A pure blend, the way that I make words mend 
And the way that I be doin' rappers in 
Michael Bivins couldn't make these Boyz II Men 
I play somethin' verbally, capable to murder the 
Average MC; the tough ones I'll burn third degree 
And if you're thinkin' that I'm takin' a beatin'
You're sure to see the Pink Panther speakin'

[Q-Tip]
I'm a native New Yorker, I pitch a lot of porker 
When I get my ride, I be the grill squawker 
Tip's a smooth talker; I love Alice Walker 
So get off the dills and step back, you little hawker 
Better yet, you hooker; you want to show, I book ya 
The highest way I took ya; is you's a good looker?
Queens is residential; I make the presidentials 
Over instrumentals, I utilize the mentals 
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square 
If you went in by yourself, it was a terror 
See, I could do that 'cause my crew is kinda phat 
Outside we had the toolies; out West you call 'em gats 
It's that, 'oh, thanks' chat; well, let me drop some more shit 
Bring your bats and balls, and please don't forfeit 
'Cause you won't get away, your status will be stank 
You can ride with me, G; I'm goin' to the bank 
To meet up with Kane, up on Dollar Lane 
You get the idea 'cause page times is near 
So, rappers, see, they bug 'cause they really can't handle 
Position from the rappin' 'cause some of them be slackin'
Not in this sport of thought; we block out the devil 
The three different flavors; you know we on the level 

[Busta Rhymes]
Check it out, uh! As I come down and get dumb 
Yes, roughneck swingin' along with the drum 
Swimmin' in the track, retaliatin' thorough is how 
I react; Busta Rhymes will attack 
As you feel the pain, bass kick impacts to the brain 
Gotta make a mega migraine 
What up to the Big Daddy and Tip 
My trip, flip the rhyme, then I dip 
Hey, hip-hop, cool, bust the interlude 
Whack, do ya on the stage gettin' booed 
This structure - it takes, bust the angle of three different flavors 
On a young raider chalk; well, that's my vocal fader 
Keep my volume on extra boom! 
All the braids in my neck symbolizes that I want room 
Word up, huh! Here I am, damn 
Dragon slayer stackin' layer after layer 
This jam will be ran while the record flim-flam 
Wiggle your front pram, to the runnin' man 
Sam, Busta, Rhymes, comin' on time 
L.O.N.S. did rip a new design 
Flavor one; taste the unborn baby 
Flip before you move or catch a bad one, baby 
Chiggy change chump, the over-sized puff 
Busta pump you and the love, and then I rump 
Emotional steer point for the wild 
Busta buck wild, musically direct from Strong Isle 
Unload, catch you like smell later 
Dig on your taste of the third flavor, rarah! 
Rarah! Direct from the lungs of the dragon, uh!",Come on Down,1991
Q-Tip,"What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should of slid to my crib
Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flip it, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome s niece, on her way home from joes beaches club
Plus little rob is selling drugs all the time
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort, now I represent to the fullest
Say whats up to herb, ice and bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
One what? one love

Dear born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in new york the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something
Word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block
Your man gave him your glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm a put it to a cease
When I heard you blew a nigga with the ? for a phone piece
Whylin' on the island but now with ?
Better chill 'cause them niggasz will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
I maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reels, all these crab niggaz know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next v I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks
Plus ? flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' in four Maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind (dies)
I hate it when your mum cries
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs
For one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, etcetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the week and hittin' nails while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets have me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in belle vue
Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's helping shorty
Do I roll them two phillies together and the friends we call them oowops
He said nas, niggaz cold be bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce
He inhailed so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing when I peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these bitches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took an l when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted he starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'cause when the pistol blows a shot that's when a murder be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
If the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only the bolder herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
There's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for jake shorty what

C'mon bounce, c'mon (c'mon we gotta) bounce
(C'mon, hah) Bounce (We do it like this one time, uhh, sup, sup)

Do you wanna hear, the boogie bear
Jump up and do the freak funk, throw your hands in the air
Compare me, with none
The son, of the king, triple crown, just to get the job done
I surpass fast dash through a mass of traps fliers
And blow up the spot, and Organize on that ass, I'm hot
Black, with no sugar straight coffee
You stalk me, because your girl wanna hawk me
Jock me clock me watch me mutilate the mic
Rip it apart, shatter your brain when I strike
Add a syringe of raps to cleanse you fall apart
Style damage you amateur 'cause I'm blowin' your file
Honey-dips see me and they yellin' Organized
And they know, Pharoahe Monche's got skills for the wise

Oh, huh, shit! Look who walked in the door
Ryu-kick, tiger tiger uppercut
Directly to the gut, when I strut on mics, makes my windpipe erupt

In the summer or like Redman, ready to rock
Expanding my cleverness on wax, to Japan and back
Ask for Prince and hon I hope ya got
Just five seconds for black Prince to flex
It's not all about sex
I like ears smooth skin and sensitive necks
Victoria's Secret couldn't keep you from the Prince Poe
So peep it when I funky technique it
For those who slept, wake up, ya better make space
Taste the bread I break off, as I take it to your face! Whew
Can you keep up like skeleton watch Organized Konfusion troop up

'Cause I ain't Shai!
So, O.C., let 'em know how we go
Come again my friend with another funk flow

Look who just came in, O.C.'s gamin
Crew's I set you up, to lynch for a hangin
Bangin, bodies up in a tree like a pinata
Many, claim masculine, but sport garters
Whose the artist, not video, more-so to Luke
It's like square dancing on your toes so bounce

Q-Tip,"Caps get peeled rolling in my force field
Like a nine with hollow points I keep rap flows that's ill
So when you walkin' down the block
You better watch who you approachin'
I'm not your R & B singer, so ain't no need for vocal coachin'
Just a forty and a roach and I'll admit you rock the units
While y'all niggas couldn't move me if you worked for starvin' students
Downin' all beer types, from St. Ide's to Red Stripe
(Yipes)

The menace stuffin' mics down motherfuckers windpipes
Has returned to burn, it's time y'all niggas learn
I naturalize y'all niggas like relaxer in a perm
With flows that go against the grain with a story so compellin'
I should mind the people's court
Snatch the mic from Doug Llewellyn and host my own show
After Bill Cosby comes Rico
Transmitting live to all my black people
Catch my drift, I'm down with my nigga E-Swift

My name is Tash, I'm from the group that you don't wanna fuck with
Never shy, sippin' on some why ask why
Smokin' Thai with this bitch that's more fly than Jasmin Guy
Hooked up with John Q so let me do my thing
While niggas rock the play shit that they bought from Chess King
But still, I train rhymes to flip like a seal
Niggas say my rhyme skill on the steel is unreal
But all I do is chill and swing it when I bring it
Oh shit, that's my nigga, show these niggas how you figure

I bring it to your chest, pour all the way live
And deliver ill verse guaranteed to 'cause highs
When we start rappin', heads roll like Patton
With the flood blood clot the Alkaholiks rhyme a lot
Yo, I'm like Grimace when I'm on this rap scrimmage
And I got this magic, want to make your puny soul diminish
The abstract delivers, I be the Queens nigga on point
Mary Jane ain't nothin' but a joint

They called a nigga up to add a little bit of flavor
Now I'm cuttin' and slashin' like Luke's light saber
Yeah, what? You trapped in the zone
Where MC's get seared and all spots blown
And in this rap shit a nigga need to be thicky
I fuck with the crew who downs the deuce, deuce Mickey's
I'm from the rotten apple, y'all niggas can't grapple
And love to the Liks, hit your ass like a tackle

Pow, bust my liquid-ass style
Peace to Mad Lib and my nigga Wild Child

Yo, put in the disc E while I hit the whiskey
(Bust a rhyme off the head J)
The nigga missed me, I'm in this rap game so I'ma aim to be best
It's fresh, but off the head it's like the dunk contest
I don't walk the street, I roll my Jeep in an instant
I rock the beat to sleep like an infant
The Likwit crew, comin' like this on you
With that four minute Olde English piss on you

You're bustin' dumb raps off the cap, oh shit
But I got the pen and pad locked down like a pit
I let the, ink submerger, into the thin wood sheets
Beats make my head bop, so I'ma rock it for the streets
I fill all my days with big butts and boom
I let my pants hand 'cause my big nuts need room
I'm not old school, or new school, I'm modern school, I'm ditchin'
When my girl starts bitchin' I gets got like a kitchen

I fly down like the Chi-town wind
'cause I got the iller noise to make the hardcore grin
When, the saints come marchin' in
I'ma roll right by 'em in the fly Lincoln
Roughneck niggas wanna box me down
'cause I got the ladies lookin' like Foxy Brown
The Liks bring the beer Tip sticks it in your ear holes
I drop the mic and strike the Heisman pose

Hardcore G, I get hardcore man
From the underland a fuckin' wonderman, bam
Lunatic potential, an isperential differential
Confidentially smashin' instrumentals
On this tune I bring raps of doom to the mic
And put my rear shit in flight, peep
If the drunk funk don't wanna hump in your trunk
Man, you got some motherfuckin' junk",All The Way Live,1995
Q-Tip,"Fabolous, Funk Flex Vol. 4 niggas see'mon
It's gettin' hard to dodge the women
But I'm still pitching hard white balls
Faster than Roger Clemens,
Ya know the kid with the O's
That's as large as linens
When it comes to sellin' trees
I'm as large as Timberland
My lawyer got my charges slimmin'
He said the only way I am goin upstate
If it's in larger swimmin'
Pull out the garage like gremlins
Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'
And me and Flex don't roll unless they Andrew Jackson
It's Brooklyn by me the crook the I-B ya even look
At ID you gettin' hooked to I-V

Q-Tip,"(Everybody reppin' from the Illadelph side)
From the Illadelph side
To the New York side
To the the universal side
(Everybody reppin' from the Illadelph side)
From the Illadelph side
To the New York side
To the the universal side

I wanna be able to reach an MC
And reach a little child in the same degree
And my elders excel
I mean what the hell
We might as well bridge these gaps
In all before we fall in the fire

It's a million MCs upon a plan they call real tryin' to set it
Profess mic techniques illegit
Inaccurate perceptions of reality embedded
In they minds thus they rhymes are discredit (check it out)

I use my music implemented with jewels and sport tools
To inspire all these too cool fools who say screw school
Cause they don't see the conspiracy
That's put here to trap you and me

Y'all know the battle lieutenant be on some whole 'nother other finesse genetic
They say I get it from my mother so its' inheredit-
Tary and very necessary to shine
Legendarily, heavily refined

Contemporaries like the Roots is so rad it's like dag
Which bag did they come out of, and how can I get in it to win it?
Like a raffle ticket pickin'
If you feelin' something, guess who get the sticking

I got this Ital style up close and personal
The first I find to violate, I shall retal-
Iate with realism for they whole local
To relate, we on point like decimal Abstract now

MCin' while I'm breathin' MCin' is believing
That you can host a ceremony and the dose is never phony
In fact, it's quite therapeutic
Like a B12 hypodermic needle so shoot it

Lyrically elicit upsteps the explicit
Most wicked seven digit mic wizard
My tongue lash out and strike with it
Just slightly might miss it
When I blast through your section or district

From the Illadelph side
To the New York side
To the the universal side
(Everybody reppin' from the Illadelph side)
From the Illadelph side
To the New York side

In my formative years by my peers I was influenced
Until the instruments of time killed the congruence
I peeped the blue prints on how to make true sense
Of MC's which are a nuisance I know just what to do since I'm on another lev
Brothers is fakin' jacks and think they ready for the rev
But they got a lot to learn, to make their thoughts long term
Cause on their short-cuts they made a wrong turn
Probably, timelessly I construct the fearsome
To rip your eardrum for many years to come
Professional style thinkin' rational to move wise
So hard it's a wonder y'all alive

And still breathin', niggas is dead and not even
Perpetuatin' real life the shit kicked is real trife ayo they fake bleedin'
It's obvious that they needin' attention feedin'
They cold actin' like heathens
When mics is picked up MC's scenes is kicked up
Like women with the gripper drinking Moet 'till they hiccup
Fellas hustlin' picking bricks up
Fantasizin' about the illest stick up
But rip up the jam and we be truly impressed
On stage you won't need your tef. vest
Only a mic with and a mic test
And at your best you get blessed by the fans who profess
That they can relate
With the trials you tribulate
Or the pains you endure
Cause some cats is pure
Tell horors that are true but see cats like you
Y'all fake joints just tyo get a woo-woo
The tear jerker
You be that miracle worker
Whose miracle just ran out
I think it's time you pan out
Or just plain fade, cause yo you played

Q-Tip,"My rhymes create life like the birds and the bees
Make Funk-Master Flex say yo I'm feeling these
Flows make you shit in your drawers
Change your dungarees
Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munches
Bowed down the block eating food at Luigi's
Constipated, too much extra cheese
Well anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas, Lebanese
Let's begin with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend
She was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, AloeVeralese
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees
Yo I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe, the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys
And rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy braud, I mastered my Degree's and my Ph.D's
Got your face on camera, motherfucker say cheese
You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze
Getting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees

I caught that I'll vibe Tip (word Bust?) yo yo word
That I'll vibe Tip (word Bust?) yo yo word

I got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat
Ain't nothing sweet, on the street, for good these I compete
Come off complete
And you need to get back in your stance
We enhance and we're playing the whole world circumstance
So do good in your hood even though you puff life
Positive to comply
Don't screw up facing that crowd
Progress don't fall back
We can't have that
I'll hold your hand Black
We can't wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward, when I play in life
Cause this world as I live it, chill's like a double edged knife
In the jam we regulate, cause we organize
Logic-a-ly thinking when along's enterprise
A lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab
Peace to the West Coast and the East, we's fam
Need I make mention that the crew we've got
Make things get hot, like the FoFo shot, Blauw!
No we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live calmness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay awake for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the force and build rounds with our friends
Why's that?
So we can live right until time ends
Yo why's that?
I estimate, so we can get these ends
Yo true that?

Q-Tip,"Yeah son
I'm the true son
What you wanna do son
Yo this a story about me and my first love nah mean?
Yeah son hit it off

We hooked up at a party it been then ever since
When I first stepped to her I was nervous and tense 
Didn't know was bout to kick, I went freestyle
Straight off the top, with suckas on the side just clocked
She musta liked my flow, 'cause after that we got close
Spending long weekends freakin' up and down the east coast
We got intimate, deep as the pacific
The chemistry was meant to be so then we ran without the ministry
Up in this industry tryin' to get this platinum
Many rappers tried to tap her, it wasn't happenin'
I watched her from afar, starin' at her like a fan
And now I got her in the palm of my right hand
Forever, as long as we can stick together
I guarantee you we blow up, 'cause with 'em I'm a trend setter
We signed a contract said yo, its me and you
Meet you at the top of the charts, where the skys blue

[Chorus]
Yo yo yo God bless a child that can hold his own
Its just me, myself and my microphone
Yo you gotta stick with it dun you cant leave it alone
Its just me, myself and my microphone
No matter where you plug it on the road or at home yo
Its just me, myself and my microphone
Yo God bless a child that can hold his own

My girl cant understand all this time we spend together
I tried to tell her
Its strictly business, she said she had a witness
Who saw us comin' out the hotel
Nosy people always gotta run and go tell
But it was just a tour date I had to do a show
So next time tell your friend to talk what she know
I wouldn't trade this shit for the world
In fact you better check yourself, 'cause I can always find another girl
The microphone is my first love my true companion
When I rap into it people think that I'm romancin'
I'm havin' visions, I'm foldin' it tight
Just me and you a phat track'll lead the spotlight

Right

We been through the ruckus together
Handle that beef
MCs got damaged in cyphers on they own streets
So ladi dadi, forget a shotty
I put a hole in your body with my lyrics when I rock it uh

[Chorus]

I hit her in the back of a club and no one showed her love
In fact it was a seminar you know how some women are
Takin' up my time, I tried to stay committed
Kedar and the Smith brothers made me stick with it
Now we politicin', on a mission tryin' to make decisions
To keep her on the cut and work just like a circumcision
Static in our relationship, its all distorted
The lines of communication, they got shorted
I cant ignore it, you know I couldn't afford it
To have this world tour planned for us abort it
Now I'm on some shit, rollin' with my clique
The mic is my companion that's all and that's it baby

[Chorus]

Like that one time for your mind
For real son, keep it real son

Coast ii coast I represent cause gettin' bent, I do
But I'm doper than sherm plus the way I put it down
Could burn the perm off big worm, so peace and pipe this greeting
Of the last action hero that be freezin' rappers dead in they tracks
Like sub zero (zero), 'cause Rico ain't no joke
I eat your flows and yo' beat up rappers even feel my presence
When I'm home with my feet up

For what you skied up or treed up
Relax and pull a seat up, make your landlord turn the heat up
Got the opposition shook like tiger woods about to tee up
So niggaz no competition with the clear mos definition

The way the wheels spin cutting through the still wind
Outsiders looking in with the ill grin
Fuel injected brand new inspected
Emissions got tested details perfected
Got the armor all touch empty out the dutch
No tobacco spilling on my rug clutch
Kick off your shoes show off your pedicure
Shake off the blues we all forgetting more
Boy that thing
Stuff that brings ecstasy maybe you blink
A little harder than your average hugagraph
Lady tell me this is better than taking a cab
And when you back tell all your girls
You rode around hot-wheeling drinking no Earl
Vacationing, V up my V8
Just one night we drive and we escape

Oh, me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on

Oh, me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on",Let's Ride,1999
Q-Tip,"Looky here, looky here, looky here! 
You out the frame with it, you off the chain with it
You out the frame with it, woman, woman

You got your girlfriend around ya. 
No wonder she surround you. Look at you.
Your brown eyes pierce just like a knight, 
Make a fella think real hard about the rest of his life.
The whole shit is strange. I'm really thinkin' brains
But on the other hand, I really feel your stress and pain.
Flimsy little men, they can't command you
And they don't have the heart to demand you,
But neither do I. I guess I'll let you walk
On and watch 'cause your walk is strong.
Sippin' passion wit' a stranger in the club, 
It doesn't necessarily equate to love.
It's not really in the air, I want to take it elsewhere
Somethin' wild that you can't compare.
Bangin' on my wood drum now
Hope your hearin' all the sound. Now, nigga, come now.
Sittin' at home, a hat in my hand 
While you crawlin' on the earth with your natural tan.
Your than is jigg-a-lin' and causin' a stir. 
Let's do it real rough until life is a blur.

[Chorus]
I suit you the way that'chu want.
Hey, hey, hey, the way that'chu want.
It caught me the way that'chu want. (""Uh, uh, uh."")
Hey, hey, hey, the way that'chu want. (""Check it out, now."")
I suit you the way that'chu want. (""Check it out. Check it. Uh."")
Hey, hey, hey, the way that'chu want. (""Check it."")
It got me the way that'chu want.
Hey, hey, hey, the way that'chu want.

I can kinda understand, you know. 
I mean bein' at the top, I mean to start a show.
The brushes with fame, continuous game you get,
Hustles with plans, stakin' they clans and shit.
But you shine and you pay it no mind, always
Stayin' on the grind with the things you do.
You got the illest little switch and you 
Ain't takin' no shit cause nobody want to fuck with you
Admiration to the utmost. 
All my dogs raise your cups 'til the girl toast.
I don't want to bring shame to you really,
I want to put flames to you sincerely.
Make your box-spring jump like a low rida.
Best place that I could be is inside ya.
The love that we have could be real 
But you gotta go by what your heart feels.
Heart feels [Repeat: x4]
Come on.

Q-Tip,"[Q-Tip]
For real though who really got sent 
Flown on the edge got the ledge hangin' out of the window
Bird chest niggas with you (wondrous fearaf?)
Fuck around you'll be (hemp's meat) inside of a meal sack
Puny little bucks better hit the Jake
But that doesn't mean nothing to the heart within
You cramped up you and your team I'm amped up
And you asses can't dib me bead 
My shine what the fuck is on your mind?
Little weakling rappers better hit the grind
Other brothers ain't motivated they can't do it
Not only did I penetrate it I ran through it
My music comes on and we march at the dance
Inside of your mind or inside of my pants?
Musical intention that we have is vast
You sick? Drink a NyQuil well I'm dead on your ass
Oh well then here comes the gelatin
Tips on some sugars but you yap on your selling friends 
Now your party is completely blown
Real name is Kamal I'm in completely zone
It's rap time for you that means nap time
Preaching from my joint what the fuck I'ma clap mine
Singing songs of 6 pence it's intense 
Surprise your ass at the end like the sixth sense
Heavy hitters knocking shit out the park
You couldn't even really play tell me why did you start
Spitting sharp blades laced with bleach
You wanna play around kid I'm not a walk at the beach
A stroll in the park or your fucking playground
Put on your headphones tell me how grenades sound
Put on your walkmase and go underneath the town

Let your pussy drip on the dance floor if you wanna

Coming with the brand new quickly we pan to
The young black man with intentions to ban you
Seems that people need an aid today
So many fade away so many fiend to stay
I really rhyme 'cause I feel I should say things
While the fraudulent act raps just so they cop rings
Or maybe because when they was young
They was fronted on and left alone to have they own fun
Now they've all grown up to be assholes
I'm giving you the rope will you tie up the lassos
You swing dangling from peach trees
While I sip my Daiquiris in the south west breeze
Writing so exciting the pen it keeps
Dripping out gems that's converted to hems and then
People be humming it from now to they next to kin
My family is starving You know they want me to win
Me forfeit nigga please get off it
Send a check in my name to my office
Mutombo in the lane yo I toss it

Lets talk about the rules I bring
And the things we take
And the jobs we hold
And the land we stole
And a buck or two
And the love for you
And the things you do [Repeat: x5]

I puff L's with ladies and gentlemen
I break spells with faith in a burst of wind
Others talk but.what they talk about?
Who could walk but live what they walkabout
A calm head in the middle of wartime
People go down just so they could get more shine
Girls wave your flag and surrender your faculty
Niggas got geez but its not really mack to me
Keep it soft like we killers and often gat
You walking on me guaranteed you be crawling back
Abstract see it like this is the king in you
Allies living one more if I'm fucking too
Dogs don't eat it up increase they feeding time
I'll be damned if a mutt starts eating mine
Let's stay clubbed out the moon makes it whistle
Pants gripped your ass now I hope they don't fall apart
Look around you tell me who else is shining girl
Fat rapping cats on my dick they just whining girl
That's just the magnetism that a Queens fella has
Range rover gism and he fronting with his Lexus ass
But watch I'ma drop to a bronco
See me in your Bentley nigga just honk yo!
And just know that your man to can get that
And just though that I don't really wet that
And just know that this nigga here flips tracks
Ooh what, whose ya, pain and slip that
The illest regiment is what I represent
Get us mad you gonna see the way gorillas went
Mactime I need a diamond at least a friend
I fear Allah he has no start and he has no end
We raise the roof up and tear the fuck up off
Bucking hard like the coast guard, who's soft?

Q-Tip,"We on a brand new page (Uh)
Millennium days
Desperation on the streets gotta find a new way
Keep the mics and choke holds
The saga unfolds
Machavellian approaches executed by the coach
I'm in these streets like a ghost
The air-jettin' artist
To the love, I hit 'em right plus I hit the hardest, man
I got a whole new approach for the rhymin'
You cherry cats slide, I'm holdin' out for the Heisman
You play the rappin' roll
I take the rap and sold
And intertwine it wit' mine and turn a half to whole
I'm just a genie in a jack bottle
Them fake ballin' ass cats is just a wack model
This joint knocks wit' the force of a gat throttle
I live by 'you put it out, we get it back' motto
Hey, but who around but just your average reproduction, love
Rap is gettin' lose so all the ice is screamin' thug
What the hell is wrong
I'm askin' in this song
One time I smoked hash out of the hippies' bong
One of us is goin' laid 'cause I ain't gettin' played
I leave you right inside that shitty-ass bed you made
And walk along chuggin' baller's brains, rockin' rings
And things and just waitin' for white rains
I got the drive, dog
I hope the dogs' ready
My mentality on dime chicks is stay sweaty

Wait up, your wait up, wait up
Get your (It's the ummah for all time) wait up
Wait up, your wait up, wait up
Get your (The ummah forever) wait up
Wait up, your wait up, wait up
Get your (Get your wait) wait up
Wait up, your wait up, wait up
Get your (Up, up, up, up, yo) wait up

You wanna shoot dice or wanna shoot rounds
Wanna sell rhymes or wanna sell pounds
The decision is yours. I'd rather see tours
Get chicks wit' ghetto shit fallin' out they drawers
My team stay posted. they stay roasted
Niggas who all in it had a hard knock livin'
Administra, rhyme minista, illa treasura
You didn't know that your man was a legend, huh
Embonishment for the both of you
I hit the road and I take my whole fuckin' crew
Cause I'm a queens cat (True) to the g's cat (True)
Gettin' money for more than one needs cat (Aight, c'mon)
Condition never peers and (Take it home, kid) mind stands out
From Seattle to South Beach my joint, Grand Clout
It's the street commentator, providin' you wit' data
On how to live unique and it's really not neat, we gotta

Wait up, your wait up, wait up
Get your (It's the ummah for all time) wait up
Wait up, your wait up, wait up
Get your (The ummah forever) wait up

A mellow disposition even when it's pain
Your mental ammunition is faulty wit' a drain
I puts it down, lord, fuck a mic cord
Brother's out of his game so we can see tours

Q-Tip,"Say ho, everybody say ho
By the way yo
I said shake your soul like way back in the day-yo
By the way yo, everybody say ho
Everybody say,
Everybody say

And check it out now
Who is the cat eating out on the town
And make the whole dining room turn they head round
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Who be riding up in the high rise elevator
Other tenants who be praying they ain't the new neighbor
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
They try to play him like a chump cause he got what they want

He under thirty years old but already he's a pro
Designer trousers slung low cause his pockets stay swoll'
Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go
V.I.P. at the club, backstage at the show
(Yes y'all) the best crib, the best clothes
Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze (say word)
Checks with O's o-o-o-o-ohs
Straight all across the globe watch got three time-zones
Keep the digital phone up to his dome
Two assistants, two bank accounts, two homes
One problem; even with the O's on his check
The po-po stop him and show no respect
""Is there a problem officer?"" Damn straight, it's called race
That motivate the jake (woo-woo) to give chase
Say they want you successful, but that ain't the case
You living large, your skin is dark they flash a light in your face

Now, who is cat dining out on the town
Maitre'd wanna take a whole year to sit him down
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat at Armani buying wears
With the tourists who be asking him, do you work here?
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga

Yo, the Abstract with the Mighty Mos Def
White folks got it muffled across beneath they breathe
""I didn't say it""
But they'll say it out loud again
When they get with they close associates and friends
You know, sneak it in with they friends at the job
Happy hour at the bar while this song is in they car
And even if they've never said it, lips stay sealed
They actions reveal how their hearts really feel
Like, late night I'm on a first class flight
The only brother in sight the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat, 2C
She approach officially talking about, ""Excuse me""
Her lips curl up into a tight space
Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed put an extra lime on my water glass
An hour later here she comes by walking past
""I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph""
(Wow, Mr. Nigga I love you, I have all your albums!)
They stay on nigga patrol on american roads
And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law
Some folks get on a plane go as they please
But I go over seas and I get over-seized
London Heathrow, me and my people
They think that illegal's a synonym for negro
Far away places, customs agents flagrant
They think the dark face is smuggle weight in they cases
Bags inspected, now we arrested
Attention directed to contents of our intestines
Urinalysis followed by X-rays
Interrogated and detained til damn near the next day
No evidence, no apology and no regard
Even for the big american rap star
For us especially, us most especially
A Mr Nigga VIP jail cell just for me
""If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake
Just got some shoe-polish, painted my face""
They say they want you successful, but then they make it stressful
You start keeping pace, they start changing up the tempo

Now, who is cat riding out on the town
State trooper wanna stop him in his ride, pat him down
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill
They gotta send it to the back to make sure the shit is real
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga, Nigga

You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna
Woody Allen, molested and married his step-daughter
Same press kicking dirt on Michael's name
Show Woody and Soon-Yi at the playoff game, holding hands
Sit back and just bug, think about that
Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black?
O.J. found innocent by a jury of his peers
And they been fucking with that nigga for last five years
Is it fair, is it equal, is it just, is it right?
Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white?
If white boys doing it, well, it's success
When I start doing, well, it's suspect
Don't hate me, my folks is poor, I just got money
America's five centuries deep in cotton money
You see a lot of brothers caked up, yo straight up
It's new, y'all living off of slave traders paper
But I'm a live though, yo I'm a live though
I'm putting up the big swing for my kids yo
Got my mom the fat water-front crib yo
I'm a get her them pretty bay windows
I'm a cop a nice home to provide in
A safe environment for seeds to reside in
A fresh whip for my whole family to ride in
And if I'm still Mr Nigga, I won't find it suprising",Mr. Nigga,1999
Q-Tip,"We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam

We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
And even though we may love, this place on the map
Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at

I came up in the street around some real wild brothers
With more than one name and more than one baby mother
More than one case, been on more than one run
Got more than one enemy and more than one gun
Partner, all that's left to want is more
While these cats that's less privileged is just more raw
Less space 'cause the projects laced with more flaws
Less sleep 'cause the nights ain't peace, it's more war
The can is raw like thirsty, rainy season thunder claps
On the block with your old pop pleading number act
To the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at
To the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped
With the jungle cats, lions and tigers, leopards and cheetahs
For gazelle you get chased like a zebra, they blaze cheeba-cheeba
And dominate the weaker on the street
Hungry bellies only love what they eat and it's hard to compete
When they smile with your heart in they teeth
And the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath
Son I been plenty places in my life and time
And regardless where home is, son home is mine

We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam

We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
And even though we may love, this place on the map
Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at

Some people live out in-New York City
Some people live out in-Atlanta
Some people got to live-Chicago
Some people do live-Miami
All my people at-California
And other people got to live-London
And everybody got to live in the whole big world
Together just you and me

When I think of home, my remembrance of my beginning
Laundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen
Chillin in front my building with my brother and them
Spending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them
Wise town and Beat Street, federal relief
Slowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat
Sticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep
With every flavor Now & Later only a dime apiece
Old timers on the bench playing cards and thangs
Telling tales about they used to be involved in things
Start to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out
On the phone, call the cops, pick'em up, move'em out
And it's all too common to start wildin'
I'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence
And it's hard to find
Block parties in dark lobbies
Funeral homes packed but only dark bodies
I can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley
Marley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall
Son I been to many places in my space and time
And whatever my home is, son home is mine

We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam

We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
And even though we may love, this place on the map
Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at",Habitat,1999

On the Rahzel track. 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow 
To the beat 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow 
To the beat 

I let my mind flow like a river 
But now  Red and Dead sea constantly I MC 
No conspiracy like Pope and Cons-tinople 
Makin' tracks by theyself, you know I bless a little vocal 
Artistry since constipated 
Nowadays we're with Rahzel, we're glad we waited 
Now we got you, right in the spot where we want it 
And every single negative vibe is confronted 
It's kinda ill when you let your music go free flowin 
Buildin' on improvised grounds and still growin 
People work hard, some want to escape 
But yo we gotta face the music with ease and with grace 
Sometimes we look to jams for an inner inspiration 
Cause the lyrics and the rhythm are the music vibrations 
Makin things gel like a compound equation 
Mad sounds culminatin' for one sensation 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow 
To the beat 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow 
To the beat 

Lights, camera, action, get it on 
Watch the beatbox as he lets the sound form 
Ain't nobody iller than my man Rahzel 
So you other beat machines don't stress and get gel 
A very short suggestion is you go and work harder 
Give me a Break, my man is phat like Nell Carter 
With a brother like the on top with the willy 
We the illy, he's phildeplh we the rusaphilly 
It's a thunderous move like a herd of elephants 
And it sounds real raw cause we in our element 
Like natural, never catch these kids on sabbatical 
Always up front tryin to give you what you want 
You see it's very crucial that we stand and deliver 
Always tryin to rise above and be a good figure 
And we hopin that you diggin on the rhymes that we wrote 
Better get yourself together, let's flow, come on 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow 
To the beat 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go 
To the beat it makes your mind flow 
To the beat 

To the beat and let your mind flow 
To the beat I let my mind go

Special girl, real good girl
Biggest thing in my itty bitty world
Called her up and she made me feel right
Wish the bliss could never take flight

Sittin' back with this mic in my hand
Spittin' hot shit tryin' to see grand
Imprinted on my mind every minute
Make my plans and you always in it, yo

You're such a vivrant thing,
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing

And even though we both fly
Give each other space and not the evil eye
Actin' like grownups
Don't even try to hide cause the spot blown up

Girlfriend tellin' you she want to see
I say 'I dunno' but you say 'Gladly'
And when we both do hemp
We go on and on and on and on and on and

Sweeter than Ben & Jerry
Can I rhyme? Well you know I gets mine
Sittin' round in my abstract part

All the willy that I kick make the other niggaz maddest
Movin', to your town and situation
Shorty thought she subtle but she really was blatant when she

Shook her thing and violated
Now these wolf-like thoughts are formulated
I'm sayin, ""Yo is this some heartfelt shit here?
Am I strong-backed nigga? Well shit yeah""

Plus we can hold a convo'
Or go to the movies, my crib, whatever yo
Just want to see you by my side
We on 95, know the stash is in the ride

A rappin' nigga for real
You would find me in a cypher if I didn't cop a deal
Rap slate like big grate
You buy, I sell, we split big cake

Penetration is methodically slow

Q-Tip,"Brand new truck, butter soft seat
Four point somethin with a low ride somethin
Ain't nothin better than to ride out the hood with it
Who lookin better and damn you lookin good in it
Take a chance with a nigga in a choice ride
Listen to the CDs I play inside
Mos Def, Jay, Prince, and Stevie
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, and Biggie
And when the evening is over love
Gonna find a nice spot for the rover love
Do things to make the man in the moon blush
My mind race but I tell my waist don't rush
You's a upper echelon piece
So when you find ? then you don't freak
You want to nibble on a nigga ear
And do all the things that make a nigga want to get near
Oh I'm a Queens representative
Get wild by any means my incentive is
When we done, I start it up again
And ride round with you 'cause you my special friend, uh

Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on

The second cut, her ride is like art
We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it
The backseat is the canvas we paintin on
Abstract the word we creatin on
The TV's in the back and the dash too
Got miss napkins and bamboo
Don't worry, the tip's past the legal one
Outkast's bangin loud in my eardrum
The way the wheels spin cuttin through the still wind
Outsiders lookin in with the ill grin
Fuel injected brand new inspected
Emissions got tested details perfected
Got the armor all touch empty out the dutch
No tobacco spillin on my rug clutch
Kick off your shoes show off your pedicure
Shake off the blues we all forgettin more
Boy that thing
Stuff that brings ecstasy maybe you blink
A little harder than your average ?
Lady tell me this is better than taking a cab
And when you back tell all your girls
You rode around hot-wheelin drinkin' ?
Vacationin, V up my V8
Just one night we drive and we escape

Oh, me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside

And verses help 'em out like a found missin' person

So people can hear how my rap sound perfect
Could hate a nigga but in fact it's not worth it
Never know how long you've got on this earth, kid
Count them blesses and pay them dues
Keep rollin' with the winners 'cause they don't lose
In the two G-era the skies is looking clearer
And nothing can stop them guys that's in the mirror
So thankful that I keep my hands on the bankroll
Can't play the shit wreck, falling of the plankroll
So I stay stable like a natural born hustla
Kickin' that hot shit right for all the customers
Near or far comin' here to star
I'll be pourin' out beer in the park
For my loved ones
Deep and thick is how my love runs for you

I never thought I'd see the day when brothers pledge allegiance
To a red white and blue that's wavin' untrue

You rather give us Mickey D's and a tool, huh?
And in the sun I see the way you pull a harsh dreams
And in the sun I see your own way to new things
Every man has to bow down at God's grace
Every soul has to conceed to God's goals
Politicians get religious to the star people
As the constitution reads, it says I'm not equal
Three fifths of the gifts from a love supreme
This gotta be a bad dream, I'm hearing train screams
Little kids are getting warped for computer dwarfs
Family structure is destroyed, marriage null and void

Nothing is brand new
It's all still accordin' to plan
Meet your man
From decades ago can't nobody understand
The hardships we been through
Sun to sun
On the wake up, knock knock
Everybody gotta run for the ultimate goal
Can't lose they soul in the process

Seeing your face lets me see my own
So I zone, and think about the days we got stoned
In the staircase of appartment buildings
Little childrens
Growing in a world so cold
Just like pilgrims, we migrate daily
Now a days we rarely get to see one another
But when we connect we still brothers
And now we in the corporate world
And the game is different

You Vivrant and you fresh and all
Original to say the least and you've impressed Kamal (come on)
Rappers start then they stall
Findin' it very hard to make it over the wall
Hey, get your weight up, my motto you heard?
And I grown a deaf ear to felonious words, uh
So girls move it around
If you see your main dog give a brother a pound
And just uh

Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got, and just uhh
Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got
Give it what you got, give it what you got
If you on the block then give it what you got

A thug, a thrill, you as mean as the eyes (say word)
I want to feel you, them big ass thighs
Your Prada dress or your Gucci bag
With the Polo jeans over doobi-bag, uh
Yo hold the door a-ight?
We comin' through, Tribe beef, hold it down for the night
Big Moon got the fifth
D-Lyfe he got the deally and girl you got the gif (yeah for real love)
Turn it over the page
Usherin' all of y'all to a brand new age, where (yeah)
Status really don't matter
Everybody get right to the pitter the patter (come on)
Makin' moves, settin' precedence
Enterin' your residence, the whole scene is decadence
And the feelin' is true
I'm seein' me and my crew, you seein' black and blue, uh (yeah)
So let's go for the ride
Strap yourself in tight and if you bonafied then just uh

Millennium, on your mind, are you runnin' out of time?
Hope you skippin' every line because I'm gettin' mine
Move it around a bit again 
Every block every town we startin' a trend (for real for real)
Eye to eye ma and toe to toe (toe to toe)
Who concentratin' on killin' the show?
Penetration is methodically slow
Mountain high valley low gonna find the dough (yo for real for real)
All my peoples, no matter the creed
We gonna satisfy the urge and discover the need (uh uh uh uh)
You feel, you feel the bite in this
If you think I'm type real then invite me miss
And let me say a rhyme in your ear
Dancin' close you the most and you fit in here (yeah)

Q-Tip,"You took me to the restaurant where we first met
You knocked a future shock crowbar upside my head
I got caught with the stop of the tick-tock, tick-tock clock
When you told me what you knew

Lost in the moment
The day that the music stopped
And I do remember you

Drawing patterns with a cork on the tablecloth
Promising volcanic change of plot
Where will this lead us, I'm scared of the storm
The outsiders are gathering, a new day is born

I tried to tell you I am not afraid
You looked up and saw it all across my face
So am I with you or am I against
I don't think it's that easy, we're lost in regret

Now I'm trying to remember
The feeling when the music stopped
When you told me what you knew

Lost in the moment
The day that the music stopped
And I do remember you

Drawing patterns with a cork on the tablecloth
Promising volcanic change of plot
Where does this leave us - I'm scared of the storm
The outsiders are gathering, a new day is born

Drawing patterns with a cork on the tablecloth
Promising volcanic change of plot
Where does this leave us - I'm scared of the storm
The outsiders are gathering, a new day is born

The outsiders are gathering, a new day is born
The outsiders are gathering

A man walks away when every muscle says to stay
How many yesterdays, they each weigh heavy
Who says what changes may come?
Who says what we call home?
I know you see right through me, my luminescence fades
The dusk provides an antidote, I am not afraid
I've been a million times in my mind
This is really just a technicality, frailty, reality

Uh, it's time to breathe, time to believe
Let it go and run towards the sea
They don't teach that, they don't know what you mean
They don't understand, they don't know what you mean
They don't get it, I want to scream
I want to breathe again, I want to dream
I want to float a quote from Martin Luther King

Suckers littering, girls ouncing 
Women inching, girls pinching

Twenty-fo'-sev' chillin', tougher than penicillin
From the block where the crooked cops killin' like a villain
Children, in the hood gettin' rocked by they buildings

And brothers, 'cross the board gettin' knocked by the millions
The stress, got me ignitin' the potent marijuana leaf
Tryin' to play it cooler than a polar bear colony
You feel the music know I'm over there probably
Pimpin' on the same system that forever shorted me
I got the soul of a young Sam Cooke when I spit
It make you wanna make a new dance up
It's all to the good shorty 'gwan do that stuff

They wanna know where the drugs guns and cash be
Probably wanna get me to run, so they can blast me
Just, blast me in your box, play my shit
I know it's crowded at the top, 'cause I'm on the tip
And that's as high up at the top, as a brother could get
And how I do it make a lot of muh'fuckers upset

But it's fine, re-gizzlin' I'm back for mine
In case y'all gettin' tired of the same ol' shine
And I'm calm, calculated and perfectly aligned

Look and see I'm ready to spark it
Soon as I zoom on my target, motherfucker better roll out the carpet
See the way I coming through, and how I kick in the door

It's funny how the game change, right?
Shit feel all different

I think the game need us kamal, let's talk to them niggas
Huh!

So many nights were spent pondering
Wondering how we gon' come again
My golden rule is not to focus on the fame game
In retrospect, the game ain't the same man
They heart and soul is divided
They ramshack the music, no control up inside it
Now, look at this, it's all stretched out and nasty
But, letting money pass me
I doubt that, and niggas from the bottom now
Pumping hard, wind sleet hail rain or snow

No matter what, you got to treat your weight right
On the block if you focused on greed then

Need to change up (change up) sound so trash
When I see 'em feel like breaking they frame up
Dupont registry, talking 'bout somebody else cars
Motherfuckers better step up your bars
Instead of frontin in the game like niggas really are stars
Like we ain't seein through the bullshit, we know who you are
I'm like a blessing to the game when your shit sound dated
I force niggas to improve, you should be happy I made it
Here to rep the game fully, change my style like the weather
Giving you niggas new shit to make the game feel better
I'm saying, I cook in the kitchen and we make the thoughts connect
You forced to humble yourself, give me my big respect

Q-Tip,"Yea, from BK to the world. I've had enough

Now-a-days, the range ain't big enough
Moskino ain't jig enough
I'm kind of iced out
But my chain ain't thick enough
Album ain't hot enough
Label said its not enough, singing in the hook
I need to change my look
My rims ain't big enough, chrome don't shine enough
I shopped Fifth Fab, but I still can't find enough
Iceberg to swerve, don't dress gay enough
No airplay, so I guess I ain't pay enough
Cristale don't floss enough
And I still ain't lost enough
Album barely gold, guess I ain't try enough
Video wasn't fly enough, budget wasn't high enough
And I ain't lie enough, about crack sales and jail
Yall feeling me like braill, well I still got no sales
Must ain't soul enough, 'cause my heart ain't cold enough
Said I was ""Born 2 Roll"", but they said I ain't roll enough
Guess I got to brag more, must don't boast enough
Ain't New York enough, ain't west coast enough
But that's fine 'cause I'm gon' focus on mine
And hoping that two-thousand-nine is enough time
Wrote enough rhymes to be on album number fifty
You'll see how I'm on it, if you hung enough with me
The rap game is a book, and I've read mad chapters
And if you ask me, it ain't enough mad rappers

[Chorus]
Somebody, tell me what the deal is I had enough
Niggaz got to know it's for real

Niggaz only rocking them jewels for you to see
Like Ghostface, nigga dont front for me
Enough is enough, we gon' start calling you bluff
Watching your moves, we gon' be, all in your stuff
Fuck around then come through rocking enough ice
Looking nice in high price, niggaz is nuff shiest
Guess it ain't enough thugs, enough drugs on the streets
And niggaz ain't busting enough slugs
Not enough Caucasians, no one stresses
Project girls rock vesses, not dresses
Enough lessons learned, play with fire burn
Enough dough get made, not of it earned
Enough wildin', fuck that yo, enough smilin'
I rep Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island
Queens plus the BX, not enough teks
Not enough cops, killing us all for paychecks

[Chorus]

Enough if this, enough of that, enough crap
Enough wack radio stations set enough rap
And they got the nerve to try to flaunt it
Will my album get enough buzz if there's enough niggaz on it
When we get in the house, it's like its haunted
We got you shook, mad niggaz from the Brook', look
Enough cats with crack moes and mack hoes
Enough cats with wack flows pack shows
Enough of these, enough of those, it never slows
It just grows, your girl don't wear enough clothes
These no-brainers, are lost entertainers
They found on billboards, greatest sale gainers
Enough beans and Benz, enough fly honies  with dime friends
That want to juice you for you ends
It's getting rough, a whole lot of intricate stuff

Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip
(Gotta gotta flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Oh let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)
Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas should we keep her aware

Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping
Somewhat like the girl X-rating
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacing
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breaking in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smoking weed
Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegetarian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story, she was sticking
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike
Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating
Are about as slim as he is
Though I knew where he lived
In his house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck

(Excerpt from a movie)
Just tell me why. 
Don't lie to me man, just tell me why
It's the money, alright?
Just tell me why
It's the fucking money, alright?

I believe that's love

I believe that's love
That's love
I believe that's love

I believe love, love

Uh of the things we believe
There's a whole lot of work we should roll up our sleeves
And we got a hold firm when fate's full like a sieve
Why doubt your plans cause when its all worth believing
We can make it work do believe that
We've mistrust in the dust and believe fact
We can achieve tact
By tuning out negative feedback
Naysayers can hate we concentrate to bring belief back
Into ourselves into the world into the rap game
Emcees are miserable that means their music's leaving mikes maimed
Man look we holding down for the truth
If we alone in the loop we gone hold for the proof
Man put it in believing
Believe in believing
Seeing ain't believing its the feeling that we needing
Believe in each other put the question to the system
They promising returns then question what you getting
We should believe in the reasons we existing
Time for renaissance to reawaken what is with it
Belief can confirm make it is what it isn't
Sometimes I wish I had belief when I didn't

I believe that's love (let's go c'mon)
I believe that's love
That's love

In the land of make belief time to make unbelief believable
Take a belief to the realm of the real
Believe in this shit that's force fed through the medium
Believe it is real when it's really a raw deal
Never disbelieve when you see human miracle
Like ghetto children shining bright in Babylon
Believe in that don't believe in stats to the contrary
Gotta be weary of them theories carry on
People find belief when they don't find identity
Believe in your friends don't believe in your enemies
Mountains of doubts and disbeliefs right in front of you
Troops on the other side what you gone do

Oh oh I believe
Oh that's love that's love

Yo you puss in boots
Energy's electric who's looking for a love recruit
High definition for the fortunate you to view
Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review
Time to turn the tide around

Brandishing these microphones, we outlaws in the town
Corruption in the fool pit, we witness the jam

Q-Tip,"Sent you a message, sent you an email
Hasty decisions we made still prevail
Both needed breaks, we both needed to bail
Walking through the corridors of my mind
The hideaways and nooks, and things with good times
Memories, certainly, yes, they still bind
Still a common man and yeah, that's for sure
Still a bankroll, and yeah, still couture
But man, this thing we had was much more
Come back home, don't be out in the world
It's a rat race and no place for a girl

This kind of lifestyle could be so comfy
We can start a clan just like the Kennedy's
You and I advance, certainly we can expand
Feelings that should never end, you respect me like a friend
But love me like your man, no other could contend
Or we could be like those exposed to history
Like staying with each other with truth and chivalry
The things we go thru they shape our identity
Yes pretty let's do this all night
Consummate this thing and make it alright
And when we cuddle up, I promise that I'll bite

Your magnetic presences make them all come thru
The same way you got them you got me too

Full of excitement and not one lull

Q-Tip,"Sometimes I phase out when I look at the screen
And I think about my chance for me to intervene
And it's up to me to bring back the hope
Put feeling in the music that you could quote
Not saying that I hate it, cause here I kinda dig it
But what good is a ear if a Q-Tip isn't in it?
So to stick it in, to inform your friend
Your boy from the hood, is on that shit again
He has upped the degrees and dropped the mercuries
To splash on the mass from low to upper class
And when the records spins and sometimes blows a wind
A fickleness of friends, they sometimes hate again
They always bring up Tribe on me, could not survive on me
Cause this is my man's on me, this is my fams
And here's somethin' new, it's front row for you
So don't misconstrue, it's Tribal and true
My dudes who hustle hard, don't stop your repertoire
As long as you could see, it's you who's stayin' we
Cause life is filled with (?) pills and little pearls and shit

But still, there is a void, and people get annoyed
Let's focus is on the feel, before we get a deal

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same

With the vibe we came, to put back on the street
Let's take care of ours, and ensure we eat
And Oprah an 'em, they criticize the boys
Without in between, they lose all their boys
They can't keep us down, we're dominate and brown
And those other shades, they join our parade
But wait there's rain ahead, like Brit and Kevin Fed
And magazine debris, is shit she gotta see it
I'm no different to you, I goes through it too
I thumbs through the page, I don't come of age
I'm not a deity, I'm far from perfect, see
I roll the tumble weed, it's just a humble scene
That I present to you, is just a mister crue
Who burrs a harmony, and soon a melody
That speaks to where we are, the door, I hope's ajar
And soon we're walkin' in, a blip, it's just to say, ""Come on""

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Bought the breastfeeding new

But the cream always rise to the top
That's what men and women do

That we both can lock
Can man be stronger if a woman was there?

Can woman make it without men being there?

And no doubt, we rubbed you wrong and rubbin you out
To try to tackle such a problem is a foolish goal
And when the opposition's Abstract, bless your soul

Sit back and listen to your man as I fill it in the Renaissance

This is the Renaissance
This is the Renaissance

So here we go, now
It is the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to MC where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill, so I would hone my skill
And go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, niggas would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my, legend would grow on the A-train line
Where brothers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me, Big, Pete, Tanya, and Sir Ibu
And the heat of the cipher, I was not libel
From all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in ya head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MCs', the weak ones fled
And the stage is the pulpit, Renaissance won't quit
We gon' baptize y'all for your benefit
We been aligned and assigned to change
Rearrange all your molecules like Dr. Strange
Making cultures move, if you disapprove
You can keep loudmouthin, it won't bust a groove
You see the object of the game is we don't see it as one
We don't quit, bullshit, and we never lost, son
Deeper than the oceans and expand like air
We be vast indeed and if your hearing's impaired
We got the perfect remedy for you tonight
Just put your ear to it, it's like dynamite
And it's the Renaissance, rap

Uh, uh, it's the Renaissance
It is the Renaissance
Uh, cause it's the Renaissance
It's the Renaissance, rap

Brought to you by the person at the T-O-P

Of this lame and he came, but I'm the royal highness

They make it easy, celebrate them, let them just who they are

On the microphone, I'm bold elevating to the stars

Here's a demonstration, with the excellence
Reverse the pandemic that's filled with pestilence
Who has his finger on the pulse of the b-boy?
Serving fiends with the stream of a d-boy

And she thinkin about her life
With no more work just being a wife
But instead her love, she gave it to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she go to work, plus go to school
Plus fight the love, she must feel like a fool
She want the ease that come after pain
She fights for love, thats her campaign
We fight, we love

We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
Maybe if we just stop and chat and
It will find out who we are

And it, and it begins, he's off the ball
He left his friends, he ain't home no more
He's in a place, that's far away
Where he can't understand what they say
They say salaam, they cary bombs
In crouded places, and cause alarm
You're the infidel who's uninvited
But really an American boy who's slighted
It ain't your fault, you want identity
So you join this big fraternity
You get to travel the world, its cheaper than college
And you get guns and you get knowledge
Lookin for your soul, and WMD's
You can't find nothing, cause its empty
You got your gun, and he's your friend
And he's your man, until the end

Q-Tip,"For your epitaph, niggas laugh, chicks steady gas your ass
Siphoning out your cash, seein' the door, the flash
While I stay enclosed, walkin' out in my clothes
She said, ""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

You motherfuckin' right, wantin' this shit every night
Finish up, I hold her tight, wearin' feelings on my sleeve
Even when I had to leave, cooler than the evening breeze
Do you believe?
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

The Division One leader, in the rebound with numerous shorties, off the post
Goin' coast to coast, she on the hardwood, sub, I'm out the game
She sayin', ""Nah, he good"", I mean
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

For no amount of dough, franchise this man
Give him all the things you can
Think long-term plans, he be bringin' in the fans
Front-page magazine, listen to this lady scream:
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

Cause she know what's better for her
Toppin' in the peckin' order
Fluid like the runnin' water, nicest nigga? Kinda, sorta
When he screamin' just the slaughter, no matter the quarter
I get it
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

The club-house king, battin' practice, slug and swing
Game time's anything, when I'm in, you're 'bout a minute
Holdin' the bat, it's good as fact
She's out the park, and comin' back
She sayin'
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

Everywhere you sit you get a good view of the ballplayer and all
And the famous hall inevitably will make a call
Hangin' memorabilia from your walls
This is why you can't trade me
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

You can put your money on a sure thing
Certain profits will they bring
Ceremonies are the ringer, in the White House thing
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring
Do you wanna trade?
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

Cause in the end as a teammate
You're lookin' for a back shoot, and go-to ball
Leaves it all on the floor, always lookin' to score
Pep-talks in the locker-room
This is why you sing this tune
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

And injuries can't make me sit, I ball till you get out
Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out
I train for the pressure and come out fresher
Equipped for the game, you know my name
It makes me better
A cheer, for the whole team, let's go, for the whole thing
The ballad that you're holding, MVP voting
And I, represent the sentiment, you're emoting
As you say
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

The physical ability, with mental capability
Legitimately places me inside of your vicinity
And I ain't really seein' me vacatin' this community
I'm stayin' here
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

I'm glad that you feel this way
Here's where I like to play
I need to hear it everyday, they cheer for me, say, ""Ole""
Wait a minute, ""Andele""?
I dunno, well, anyway

It's you
At the end of it all its you

Looking, for how I see her
When I finally realized couldn't believe it
I couldn't, even swallow
Had a lump in my throat, my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine so why be pissy
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get it in
That's when the snooping and shit, it would begin
Where you at?
Where you going?
That's what I get when I pick up the phone
Not a hello or I miss you
Or the renaissance, how does it do?
Suspicious ones, go few
Can stress out your brain
It weighs on your man
And helps your peep game, I thought it was me
But then I could see

It was you
It's you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end
It was you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end
It's you
It's you
At the end of it all its you
It's you
It's you
At the end of it all

I couldn't take it
But the spell of love
I couldn't shake it
Even though, I would discover
That there was somebody else
It was your lover
You gave me up
And managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words they turn to fables
The things that you would accuse me of
It seem were the things you were doing love
Get it? These things you projected
And I don't want to be affected
But when you get in love
It's never easy love
To make decisions of
You've defected
You were doing so much to try to pin me
Going through all my stuff, but it was empty
Answers, that I'm seeking
Well it seem I'm getting close
That I'm reaching
And I was thinking, I had no reason
Calling you a culprit, it was treason
And the twinkle, in your eye
It was kinda not for love
And tell me why?
We'll make amends if you admit it
We can ascend if you're committed
Your heart, is it in it?
If it goes for many days
Sweet love can decay from you

It's you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end
It was you
At the end of it all it was you
And the end
It's you
It's you
At the end of it all its you
It's you

[Verse One]
Yo, I need a gangsta bitch; she don't sleep and she don't play
Stickin up girls from around the fuckin way
Strapped but lovable, hateful but huggable
Always in trouble and definitely fuckable
See her now, booms and pounds, she's mine friend
Puffin on a blunt, sippin on a Heineken
She's got charm, a firearm to match mine
Goin to the movies packin his and her nine's
Wearin Carhart and leather, motherfuck the weather
On Valentine's Day, doin stick-ups together
No one to blame, no shame in her game
And when we fuck she makes me scream out her name
She's not petty, confidant, ready
Right for late night, we play fight with machetes
This goes out to all the gangsta hoe pros
Give me a ghetto girl, fuck a Soul Train hoe

[Verse Two]
She likes to party with her posse and drink beer
Pour a little bit out for the sisters who ain't here
She's not the one, player you might get done
Her idea of fun's takin her son shoppin for a gun
Likes to dress to impress, quick to attack
When your punk-ass boys run, you know she's got your back
In a Benz with her friends, aiyyo Jeep kid
Drivin down the street pumpin, ""Apache you ain't shit!""
Snappin on niggaz, takin no shorts
Sittin on a porch, pullin on a Newport
Minds her business, knows cause she hears things
Fat herringbone and diamond studded earrings
She's a thoroughbred, walks and talks with class
Try to get fast, she just might slap your ass
Come meet my moms, but the two might not click
Parents just don't understand..

I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Verse Three]
I had a church girl, quiet girl, one girl was rich
The most memorable girl was a gangsta bitch
We went out a lot, sometimes we dressed the same
Lickin shots in the park and had pet names
I called her 'Dollars' cause that's what she liked to spend
She called me 'Diamond' cause my dick was her best friend
If you owed her dough, then you had to pay
Bought her an AK for her 21st birthday
We packed up and shacked up, didn't need a job
Engaged to a criminal and married to the mob
I gave MC's injuries and beat 'em down
While she's, pickin up ki's, from Uptown
Sad to say one day got caught out there
I shed tears when the judge said five years
She's gone now so it's time to make my switch
So who'll be my next gangsta bitch?

I need a gangsta bitch, yo! (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)

Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
Tho moog with the funk for your derriere

Still we marched through all the tears we made

On the wall amongst them all from Warhol to Jean-Michel
A commodity, hot property, hears the morning bell
Guantanamo bayin niggas deferring routs
You soliloquies are trash inferring that you got clout
Homie, whats that about? You should revisit your scheme
Before the scheme it seems real it reverts back to a dream
Into that pea head of yours
You ain't commanding no tours
You seeing fee and per diem
We seeing that and the doors
Plus a little bit more because she choosing the prettiest
Thou while its wittiest
On the low we the grittiest
Taking the task, these barbaric insurgents
Who nursery rhyme niggas and play like they are crime figures

Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review
Time to turn the tide around
Comin with the tribal sound
Brandishing these microphones, we outlaws in the town
Corruption in the fool pit, we witness the jam
Acquisition of materials the evil of man
Trickles down to MC's
We combat the disease
With the good and hardy measurement
A real rap sediment
Degenerate genes and your bodies the host

Q-Tip,"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing you can do [Repeat: x4]

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained
So all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait til intermission, run buy your camera
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium

[Verse 1]
I was told by a wise old to come from the heart
Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark
The dark knight to spark mics, and start fights
The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice
It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared
A beast amongst boys like Paul I'm revered...
Well,
Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele
You frail on the mic like you might break a nail
I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L
I knew a fat girl who broke the scale
Still touched down cause I was off Artell
Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail
Took the underground rail to the NFL
I rebel, NYSL
Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mandela

[Chorus]

[Common]
My words is the sword, my skill is the shield
My life is the style I stay dressed to kill
A legend like Will Smith with the steel
I could save the world when shit get for real
Skinny George Foreman, all in your grill
My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel
Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel
The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will
My drive... Is how I stay the livest
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid
Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids
You easy to take out cause you hot garbage
I'm amped like wattage, the truth nigga honest
Any moment opponents drop out like college
Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust
Stadium hands in the air fists balled up

[Chorus]

[Common]
Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt
Scars over bars, symbols of the work
Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama
Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Some of you model bitches is so overrated
Don't mean to underrate it but damn it I made it
In the water I waded on the corner I painted
Draw blood like we related
MC's get de-decapitated
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with
Mr. Excitement, change your face up like a white chick
Then light shit up like a dread with the herbs
Get sex in the city and head in the burbs
These are the words of a radical
The crowd applaud, I'm bowed, I'm proud
To be the gladiator

The verdict came in and it said I was guilty
I looked at the judge, ""Hey, America built me""
Tried to get rich, but they label me filthy
Only God can judge me, touch me, feel me!

Says, ""Get the car, it's time to rock.""
Never heard him speak this way

It's all a flash, but who would know
How this story would unfold
Don't charge me for the crime

Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime

Filled to the top with loads of cash
(See this paper right here?)
And throws the pistol on the dash
(Yeah, it's time to get money now)

Says, ""I'm sorry for the crime 
That I've involved you in this time,
You're the only friend I've got""

With everything you'd ever need

Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time, you know
Don't charge me

Sirens sound and
My heart was poundin'
I looked at my man as the cops surround 'em
A teen on the scene with no objective
The American dream can be so deceptive

Now I see the flashing lights
There goes my future and my life
Now I've gotta do what's right
(Right, right)

(Oh, man, they've got us, they've got us)

I stop the car and throw the keys 
Out of the window, sets me free
I throw the pistol in the back
(Back, back)

(Ah, ah, ah)

I throw him out of the car, I say,
""You know me well,
I'm not goin' to jail
I'm not paying your bail
Believe me when I say,
They won't charge me for the crime""

Mos Def, Jay, Prince, and Stevie
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, and Biggie
And when the evening is over love
Gonna find a nice spot for the rover love
Do things to make the man in the moon blush

We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it
The backseat is the canvas we paintin' on
Abstract the word we creatin' on

Got miss napkins and bamboo
Don't worry, the tip's past the legal one
Outkast's bangin' loud in my eardrum
The way the wheels spin cuttin' through the still wind
Outsiders lookin' in with the ill grin
Fuel injected brand new inspected
Emissions got tested details perfected
Got the armor all touch empty out the dutch
No tobacco spillin' on my rug clutch

Shake off the blues we all forgettin' more

His pops is not around the boy is blocked down

And now he despises the shit-taker

His only dream is to have bricks and a stash
Poppin the clutch and hittin the gas, so he start dabblin
In the coke game pitchin for halves

Life is like a costume party
Just cover the floors in Cavalli

We're all tryna be somebody else
You can't hide your tears in wealth
When your heart knows you hate yourself
It's all pain we felt
Just the way that the card's been dealt

Cover up all that is passed
Drop an olive in your glass
Putting on a disguise
It's an ocular vice

Fifty feet all on the gas

Try to break her spirit so it shouldn't be surprisin'
We're here with no fear and gave her uprising
Gonna blend in with the bullies and the bureaucrats
Arrows pierce like lightning, choppers sound like thunder clap

Try to restrain us, even though you trained us

Who to run from? Who to hug?

This bitch always flipping pushing buttons like a sidekick
That's when I hop in my Jeep and pull it out the toxic
And while you gone, guess what?
I'll be bouncing on that sidedick, nigga

I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
Shit, they stop making them, they stop making them
Guess she thought they stopped making real bitches when they made you
Shit, there's a few in the room and a couple in the Wraith too

Now she's explaining to you
That she's the baddest bitch to ever grace to pair of shoes
And if you are unable to find better you lose
And all this loud chirping that you consider rude
But when food is on the table
We may be arguing like the Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl I cut the cord from her navel

To be honest, I feel like gettin' right back to these commas

But who gives as fuck?
That's why I came
So pour it up
And get down
Ya'll have no choice
But to listen to Pit now

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 2)
Everybody knows
Pit's got tight raps
When I'm in the club
DJs bring it back
With no questions asked
But the number one question is
""Does he got cash?""
Lil Jon's at the bar
While me and them eastside boys smoke out
Roll another one
No doubt
Get a couple hoes
Roll out
Beef, you don't want none
To go down
dumb diddy dumb dumb
My times now
The city I'm from
Is covered with federals
That'll make your crew run run
Your crew run run
Its next to come

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 3)
I convince mami to creep on the DL
Even though my head spinning
Like some sprewells
Skip the details
Its the vodka bottom line
that's testin my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
Or those chains or that ice or them cars
All that's bullshit
If that's what your lookin for
Keep lookin hoe
Cause you got the wrong one bitch
I'll let you know
Mami's like damn
That Cuban's shot out
Bitch I came to the club
To wild out
If you came to act up
Then you need to get from me bitch
And back up

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)

Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Q. Lazzarus,"You told me, I see you rise
But, it always falls
I see you come, I see you go
You say, ""All things pass into the night""
And I say, ""Oh no sir I must say you're wrong
I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong""
Won't you listen to me
You told me, I've seen it all before
Been there, I've seen my hopes and dreams
A lying on the ground
I've seen the sky just begin to fall
And you say, ""All things pass into the night""
And I say, ""Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong
I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong""
Won't you listen to me

Twist my foot, I nearly fell
I was lucky I was alive
One look back, I could have died

I was the sole survivor
Sole survivor, sole survivor
Solitary fire

When I saw it I was amazed
One time glory right in my gaze
I saw the sorry, I saw the joy
Light in the darkness none could destroy

I am the sole survivor
Sole survivor, sole survivor
Solitary fire

And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me
So if you see me slippin', reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

When tonight's pregnant girls strugling to get a cab

Kids put to bed duck, they heads from gas poppin'

Queens bridge slingin', hoppin' our benches
Don status, throw feeds, got sirenges
Poppin' out they arm scratched, now, remember parked jams
Cause' else perfect ways, shell Adidas

Smellin' reefer, way before purple haze
Private stock, peer nigga, with ill walks like Mark Clare
Has tilted wild, niggaz, lickin' shots in the air
Me and Pop was there through the years, our names have switched

Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nostradamus and Blitz
What project is this? Q.B., burnin' in tint
12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me? Niggas, seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done just remember our name

I'm familiar with the dead grass drama, black gates and crime
Embryo of the ghetto born, face and time
Niggas, shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine
Ghetto fame, got a fellow's name draped and shined
How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?

Where corruptors and new police being recruited
Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded
While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed
Many thought's 'cause I see the past grimly

That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street
Through all the pap grease and street chases
Sudden raids and confrontations, leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases
I blew smoke through hallway window

Watched the buddah clouds lingo
Pluckin' the blunt brokes from my fingers
My eyes flip different shades
Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways

Seein' nothing but another day
In this six story rat trap
Them gats clap, another nigga's blazed
Events in my hood rotate

Like the battle on the thirty-eight
Snob in the world of fake love
Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs
Coming at you kisses and hugs

When death calls, who's really a thug
The street glory got me deeply in love
Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it
Got me needin' this drug

Niggaz die for the street glory
Go to trial, get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me
So if you see me slippin', reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

Niggaz die for the street glory
Go to trial, get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me

Dreams of bein a doctor will deteriorate
Takin over the underworld was a clearer fate
Luxury cars, a hundred girls at my face
Laced the name brand, had my game plan mapped out

Lost respect for those cracked out
Most of my elders were failures
To the poison that killed Len Bias from bein Celtic
The later I would hang, the greater my slang

It took my english, replaced it with game
Only cared about, sneakers and two-two bullets
Influenced by the hood, wasn't scared to pull it
Dared to do what I would

First blunt they passed me tasted nasty
Then overwhelmed in the spell the blunt had me
Eyes red, pants saggin
My first dime cut me off for braggin

But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street
Rap on my record, man, Kimiko, send Ice the beat""
The Dude is def no doubt, what can I say?
The man can roll with Ice-T or Michael J

I'm back, on the block, on the screen
I'm on the wax, I'm on the stage, I'm on the scene
I'm on the case, just like an attorney
The Dude took me on a magic journey
To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

Back up and give the brother room 
To let poetry bloom to whom
It may concern or consume
As I reminisce before this
The bliss that exist
But now we brought about a twist
Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen a blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so
Jesse Jackson, Miss America a black one
No more livin for just a small fraction

To nourish, so to conclude

[ VERSE 4: cool Moe Dee ]
An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

of the crowd

Quad City DJ's,"Yeah, what's up? It's that time in the big city
98 hot degrees out there
Check it out there's a party goin' on all day at the beach
So fellas you might want to wash the Chevy's
Drop the tops, and ladies y'all pull out the bathing suits
'Cause it's gonna be a scorcha

Yeah baby, come on it's time to have some fun
It's summer time so let's unwind and go out in the sun
I like when all the young ladies be off on the beach
Tryin' to creep 4-deep in them convertible Jeep

Lookin' oh so sexy, wearin' them daisy dunes
They lookin' so cute in them 2-piece bathing suits
Baby illin', chillin', stylin', profilin', down by the ocean
(Ocean ocean)
All the fellas be sweatin', goin' out of they minds
'Cause them girls be so fine down south in the summer time

Halter tops and daisy dunes, sexy 2-piece bathing suits
Hair and nails is up to par, lookin' like a superstar
Lot of clouds up in the sky and all them ladies lookin' fine
Big, tall, short, and fine
Oh yeah, it must be summer time

Come on and break out your daisy dunes
Along with your bathing suits
Versace shades to block the sun, it's time to go have some fun
Stomp your feet and clap your hands, and wild out to the Summer Jam

It's summer time, time to move baby, it's time to dip baby
But we can't, traffic's jammed on the strip by them playas
With them vogues on the Cadillacs
Bending curves in suburbs with the boom in the back

Matter fact, all them ladies be crowdin' around
Them playas with the Benz's when they let the top down
Cruisin' slow and low, one time for the 64
Baby pumpin' up the sound and bouncin' up and down
Everybody chillin' not a worry on they mind
Pumpin' the Summer Jam because it's summer time
(Time time)

Heavy Chevys Cadillac with them boom in the back
UCD in the deck, boy be gettin' much respect
Cruisin' up and down the block, go ahead and drop the top
Wild on out and unwind 'cause it's summer time

Come on and break out your daisy dunes
Along with your bathing suits
Versace shades to block the sun, it's time to go have some fun
Stomp your feet and clap your hands, and wild out to the Summer Jam

Corazón, que has sabido sufrir

Que tu amor se descubre 

El castigo de ayer
Que me diste tan cruel

de mis sueños dorados

Quadro Nuevo,"Sunday is gloomy; my hours are slumber-less
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Only makes a quilt

It seems I'd rather lose a friend then a fight
But I'm not young enough to know everything
See, what I do know is
My alter-ego is upcoming

I preach my wisdom as a neat, friendly poach

If you can't do what I do
It's 'cause you reap what you sow

My lyrics to synchronize
And educate the young, dumb, deaf, and blind
And drop a seed in they minds, so they can open their eyes
Realize and recognize we livin in the last times

I pull a spark of shining light out of the glorious fate
Create the lyric arsenals that verbal warriors make
Escape hell temporarily
Merrily vibes carry me to heavenly states
Inevitably rockin steadily

Yea, I represent the underground mc

I hold it def for 6
Blazed my way up out an orphanage
Assertive it, poetic scripts blast murderous
The earth shaker, I crack a nigga out his windbreaker
The verbalier, rhythmatic fly commentator

Yo, now if you stumble on a phonograph
To listen to the flavas that you got to have
With lyrics that be perfectly handcraft
All the way from the bay to l.a.
We're tryin to give you all different points of view
To show you our poetic words that we use
From the mc's that you're bound to choose

So passengers fasten up these average cats'll never catch up

Yeah I hot dog the ball behind the yes yes y'all
Fuck hanging on the shore trying to ball ? ? ? ?

No, I don't jitterbug with lyrically idiotic litterbugs
They shit and bug the shit out of me eat em up for dinner so

We imburse to disperse, wish your last was your first bit
Consume the whole room and you wonder where the earth went

So I reduce the risk
Spit words like a journalist
And burnin it in unofficial mic tournaments

I'll play off night watchin trife 'cause we might utilize
The mic as a rightful for the eyes on the prize (? ? ? )
So try to conduct yourself in a manner that's wise
Ain't that right? right right, true, right right

Kiss my wings you can't me hypnotise me

Every itty bitty square diamond of jiggy
They givin ??, up to woodsy
Manipulatin they minds in the alleyways
These dizzy and shitty rats, the sizes of kitty-kats
They cross paths when traffic subsides; somewhere
Some brothers is overstandin on a hot black rooftop
Freestylin for they GOT damn lives, the spirit, it gets live
And answers the question why God blessed the Earth
But, buildings block out the sky, and the children
Are oversexualized, media-wise, brutalized by parents
At the tender age of five, in front of they siblings wide-eyed
Nah not surprised, just the real scene regularly
Up in between the lies, try to put it together GET
They pieces of the pie, hope they clever and tough
Make it better before they die, plant the next seeds

Retali' and swear he could damage em Dunn
But that will shatter his Mom's faith
In the art that she burns, herbs and candles of perm'
It's hard to call it see cause times change and the world turn
Some end up slangin dope, some end up strung out
On coke and sherm, some party every night for the rest of they life
And some learn, go corporate all professional rhetoric
With sensational glory, let me tell you all one day
That it is it ain't boring, and so hard to ignore it
Cause any day in this fork, that they callin New York
Based on nothin but currents, you can find yourself a failure
Or a success story
On the subway, at three in the mornin, huh
Or on the corner, or up on a rooftop yawnin
Meditatin upon it, lookin over a city that's gritty

You know there comes a time in everybody's life when
we just need a little bit of guidance
You know we get a little lost in the fog
and it sort of impedes our vision
But there's a way that we can figure it all out
and make it happen, make it work

The purpose of producin beautiful soul music is two-fold
One is fun - two goes to mute all the roof hogs
Let's build, useful tools, find some resolution in our lives
Three's to get your groove on, but it ain't like there's no
particular order, this ain't a true/false, answer only part of it
Everything's got an art to it
So we bottle it, market it, it don't hold water
well then we sharpen it, carve a little niche where we can all exist
as ourselves, not our sales
Despite our ails (OOH DO TELL!)
Cause I can't part with the alcohol, no doubt bruh
And on that note, I'm like my Southpaw Grandpah
He used to get his lamp on, he used to giggle at Tampons
And I'm probably not supposed to talk about that part
who cares though that's not important
I really broke all the sample laws with this damn song
so now I'm an outlaw
But it's time, we started talkin havin dialogue and bein honest
What's the other options - walk around, bottled up all hot and bothered
Makin assumptions and nothin gets accomplished
Can we set it off properly please?

The purpose of producin beautiful soul music is two-fold
One is fun - two goes to glue all the loopholes
Music is fuel, to get us where we goin in our lives
Three is still to groove on, but it ain't like there's a
paricular void, that's true though, that's my whole argument
That's where I'm at, there's where I've always been
Cause we've made accomplishments, we just need to proceed
with the utmost confidence - so, whether that encompasses you
signing up with your community nautilus
Buy a couple joggin suits, hop up on that pommel horse
and burn some ounces off your gluts, your upper abdominals
Openin offices, in major metropolises
Get some flossy cards, your logo embossed on em
Not the cost effective models
where you gotta cross the old pager number off the bottom
and draw, all kinds of lines all across it
and write your mom's spot, on top, and along the side of em
like, ""Aww man, my pencil's not sharp -- know what?
Let me, let me just get your card, tight
Also, is it possible, can you run me by a Jack in the Box?""
Like I should, open office, minimize losses
Reinvest profits, we refine the process
by readin all the options, keepin all we promised
So we not caught up, all the fellas with the pants down
ladies caught topless, showin they casabas
Ignore that garbage, that was just some old nonsense
Strictly off the top shit, measurin the progress

In fact you pissed me off and you gets the jaw smashed 
This here's the rawness that ripped em off 
And wack shit gets dissolved as the gift revolves 
Around earth space agent that'll rock ya pah 
Have you runnin for your Gramps for a lil baklava 
Let me, talk to y'all bout some off the wall 
Rapper wannabe in front of me that got the balls 
To not know who the G.A.B. be me 
The nocturnal, elite MC, they flee from 
Ease on down the rhyme train trap design aimed 
At your mind, came back to shine, play it back 
The time and days of the last breaths of life 
Leave your spine ablaze when my ass bless the mic, c'mon

Permanent kind, urgent to climb, pressed up 
Insertin the rhyme, it's workin on time, yessir

Gets things, done when I think and my thoughts distinct 
I'm the link in the lock that's missing 
Find a pea in the pod that's glistening, shining, it's me 
History, in the making awakening this industry 
To this beat I'm christening it's sizzling 
In this thing, intuitive thoughts just like gypsies 
It's risky, when you want a bout with mic's Big Chief 
I rip these, and do it out loud while y'all lip sync 
You pygmy, you'll never get rid of me, renege this 
Against me inevitably y'all gon' dig me 
Essentially, incredible feat, of raw energy 
Immensely, embedded inside y'all intensely

Quannum,"Check it
It began at sea
Three cross currents concurrently
Started turning creatin' the mother of all tempest to be
Excess precipitation and ionization
The cloud cover hovered ground 2000 feet
Listening swiftly to meet the ocean's wave peak
Along the jet stream was a fog
Sparkin', rollin', and pourin' needles of rain
Thunderin' like god's bowlin' lane

Crashin' and collidin', the master of craftsmen 
Passionately expressing his anger with his angst 
Then flashes rains
Insanity in fastening are rationally lashing out
Blossoming from his majestic means
Patterns and waves gravity couldn't tame
Battling seas with seas the skies were stale
The light light rain of lightening veins
Brought in gray clouds with bright silk, then fade

Devistating
The dark, thick, all bliss, cumulus
Looked more like swabs of cotton in a chalk cold ditch
Stretched across all four tips of the horizon
Yet its movement was swift
But then there seemed to be a shift
A small pause with and oddness and a stillness that felt
Ominous

Now if the storm was the servant under the earth's surface
The congregation was stirrin'
Nourishin', swellin', like a serpent turning
Like a burning furnace yearning
It was churning perturbed and quite determined to be heard
So the ocean floor bursts the earthquake emerged
And it formed a network of corridors
Which made the earth porous, the force urge forth, the surf warm
And the storm that served above it assumed the same course
Now as the rain poured waters the basin tore its corners
And they both aimed toward the northern california shore
And as the wind whispered warning, the ground hinted authority
The long shore men leaned forward, also were corneas
Quadruple in proportion he was lord by his formal introduction
To the forth coming force

That afternoon the appetite of the catastrophe beast cooled
Began by snacking on the panoramic view, the population of people
Every single house so feeble in the mouth of the storm
The needle of the richter scale teetered and trembled
So beautifully warned
Picturesque hale shot through the windowsill 
The glass splinters sailed through the innards of little children
Waitin' for dinner, they entered then exited
The earth split like dry flesh and then engulfed two whole blocks
The roofs flew off like screw off tops
The school for the arts, the schoolin' docks
Plus few supermarkets and all its human contents
Of ruddy is screwed on top like you throw blocks
Now if you're alive to announce true accounts all over your mouth
Of rumble mills spouted keep your mouths and dollars damaged
The doom, the trials, the tribulations
You can do without the balance between life and total devastation

Everything around you shakin' and you quakin'
And you feel the rocking of the foundation 
This madness slanted vibrations
And down you go, your mind's been slow around you so
Dishes flying out of their kitchen cabinet door
A few crashin' when they smash in the windows
That's when you recognize 
The warning isn't just the terror in your eyes
Or fear between your ears
It's thunderin', the rumblin', is it all over you're now wonderin'
That's when the telephone pole rips through the roof
And adds a wide stake through your living room 
Nature's heavy burden is now passed on to you
Your world eaves and pulls, you watch the house next door
Swallowed by a sinkhole, it's out of control, wow

Riveting whirlwinds gripping the world
Women and children wait a minute we're all in jeopardy

The wind brought the rain
The rain cleared the lane for the quake
And still made room for more rockin'
The quake shook the state, the state took the bait
Then sank, but still made room for more rockin', rockin'

It's like the bible says, the final days, the tidal waves
The earthquakes, the storm that breaks, simultaneously
Smack the landmass, orderin' california
The pourin' rain , the smoke and flames
The earth engaged in open man, from growin' pains
The broken mains regurgitating all in vain, pain 
Your orphan daughter screams in vain
The block you came rectangular lace, from people grievin'
Neighborhoods that hydroplane, heavy breathin' can repeat
From passenger and everybody trying to escape on half a tank
Hearts palpitate, valves breakin', gas tanks, fault lines, open wine
We fall flyin', nose line
Behind us a car is blindsided by a semi
Fallin', cascadin', golden gate totaled, spiralin', spiralin'
Until the hemorrhages fall",Storm Warning,1999
Quannum,"Well I came at you a young boy, girl
With no experience.
Year in year out
We had our ups and downs
But I always took it serious.

I made a joke
I played the fool
I took time, made all the plans.
I know I told you that we were
Supposed to have something
Made for this weekend
But I changed my mind.

I changed my mind.
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
And I changed my mind
	
Well it started getting cozy, girl
I let you control the reins.
And despite what I knew to be true
I'd hoped that things would change.

I'd even say I can't completely blame
But I even take 'cause was situations in
Retrospect with the things you say
Would shift direction when put into action.

But I just let it whiz on by.
People say ""L-B it's goin' awry!""
And I'd flip up say ""that's not right.""
Now I see my shit's not tight.
Now I changed my mind

[Chorus]
Well lookin' back now
I was a young man, girl.
In hindsight I regret.
I never listen to my better judgment
So my blind side got the best of me.

But we live and learn.
What you did in turn
Made me never have to settle for less.
And would I deserve and once you mature girl
You'll always be second best.

[Chorus]
I'd even say I can't completely blame
But I even take 'cause was situations in
Retrospect with the things you say
Would shift direction when put into action.

But I just let it whiz on by.
People say ""L-be	 it's goin awry!""
And I'd flip up say ""that's not right.""
Now I see my shit's not tight.

It really pains me to say things change
But your limitations would've held me back.
The things you say try to underrate me
They were just a reflection of your self-respect.

But now I let it whiz on by.
You can't tell me LB can't fly!
Kiss my wings, you can't hypnotize me!
Hear the M-singer singin' this bye-bye.
I changed my mind bout this here relationship
That you've become so complacent with.

I've changed my mind.
You've sacrificed everything we had
For a happenin' price.
Changed my mind, plain and simple
Now tame and gentle
Changed my mind, I tried
I kept it quiet now why the hell

Quannum MCs,"Yea yea yea yea, oh yea
It's the late night hype mack be dog in the house
Chillin, like a big ol pimp
Right about now, at 3:01 in the morning
Everything else on is probably pretty faulty and repetitive
So if you're goin through your radio
When you get down to that, you know, far left hand side
Keep it tuned to mack be dog, 'cause you know
I'm keepin it extra extra funky
Know what I'm sayin?

Concentration, concentration is the name
Keep the rhythm
Or you will be out the game

We bust shots like german lugers
On intruders
Violate we activate the ill-style shooters

So lateef [wassup? ]
Let your lyrics heat-seek [all right]
And yo, get on the mic and fuck the microphone technique [here we go now]

Look what we've got
Akil, lateef and mark 7 deliverin the presences
J 5 quannum
Zakir, gab, lyrics born natural as the elements
I jump down and customize
My lyrics to synchronize
And educate the young, dumb, deaf, and blind
And drop a seed in they minds, so they can open their eyes
Realize and recognize we livin in the last times

I pull a spark of shining light out of the glorious fate
Create the lyric arsenals that verbal warriors make
Escape hell temporarily
Merrily vibes carry me to heavenly states
Inevitably rockin steadily

Yea, I represent the underground mc
Even though I move around I'm still down with mc's
Now pound for pound I go the round
I is down, as you see (? ? ? )
I'm from the group, jayou, the j 5 mc's, yea

[chorus]

Oh god, it's so re-al, and then ya, it's ser-I-al
Flowin, like soy milk, over sweetened cer-e-al
Y'all melt, like toys built from cheap material
Reevaluate yourself, it ain't about the here and now

I hold it def for 6
Blazed my way up out an orphanage
Assertive it, poetic scripts blast murderous
The earth shaker, I crack a nigga out his windbreaker
The verbalier, rhythmatic fly commentator

Yo, now if you stumble on a phonograph
To listen to the flavas that you got to have
With lyrics that be perfectly handcraft
All the way from the bay to l.a.
We're tryin to give you all different points of view
To show you our poetic words that we use
From the mc's that you're bound to choose
All the way from the bay to l.a.
[scratching]

[chorus]

Look what we've got
Akil, lyrics born, zakir, gift of gab
Lateef, mark 7, chali, cut chemist, nu-mark
Xl, and dj-shadow

The rhyme ambassador that mastered the ceremony
So passengers fasten up these average cats'll never catch up

Yeah I hot dog the ball behind the yes yes y'all
Fuck hanging on the shore trying to ball ? ? ? ?

No, I don't jitterbug with lyrically idiotic litterbugs
They shit and bug the shit out of me eat em up for dinner so

We imburse to disperse, wish your last was your first bit
Consume the whole room and you wonder where the earth went

So I reduce the risk
Spit words like a journalist
And burnin it in unofficial mic tournaments

I'll play off night watchin trife 'cause we might utilize
The mic as a rightful for the eyes on the prize (? ? ? )
So try to conduct yourself in a manner that's wise
Ain't that right? right right, true, right right
Tell em why

We bust shots like german lugers
On intruders
Violate we activate the ill-style shooters
J 5 quannum kick it live
Orth with the south, civil war with the rhymes
We bust shots like german lugers
On intruders
Violate we activate the ill-style shooters
J 5 quannum kick it live
North with the south other crews flatline

I heard that trouble comes from deep within.

We saw the many different shapes as one.
I saw the white snow turn to dust.
We saw a different ove of love and trust.

I heard that music came from out of space.
We had it cast upon the human race.
I heard the future from afar.
We heard the past, from a distant star.
I saw the patterns in the sky.
We saw our only chance passing by.
I saw the people change to cope.
We saw a distant space of love and hope.

I felt a feeling from way up there.
We felt vibrations, the basic snare.
I felt the tender touch of the sun.
We felt the many planets spinning round.
I saw the shadows blow and shine.
We saw the silent passing of our time.

I saw the world change to greed.

But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know, I flow some ol' funky shit

Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke

And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton!)

It's where it takes place, so when asked, yo' attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker, but I ain't lynchin'

When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if your bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn

Quantice Never Crashed,Picture a parade of mannequins: ivory white. Straight black ties to harden crooked spines: single file. Holes for eyes as useless as 2000 yrs of evolution. We have no ears. We have no eyes (to see what's in front of us.) it's a new plateau of cost-efficient living. There's no funding for free will and we're not budging. And no one cares. No one listens. Plastered between nine and five there is a pulse that ticks in time- it's neutral and it's centralized. We found it safer inside the lines. And no one cares. No one listens.,Pins and Needles,2004

This time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt

I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(think it over) haven't I been good to you?
(think it over) haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love

Race ahead so you'd be dead with the rest.
So Com'on now!

[Chorus] x 2
Let's get the stars.
Forget who we are.
There's nothing to it.

So were you at now'
Last I heard you was abroad.
Used to be the ladies man.
Now your set with several dealers and bras. 
They say, next time they meet you they.
Gonna reach you in numbers.
Like there's somebody you owe.
Is that the reason you're staying under.
Used to have a lot of tight friends but now the bonds are losing. 
You know that shit ain't right man.
I heard rumors confusing'.
They acting like they care about you and your predicaments.
I'm sick of this bullshit every other dude is a hypocrite.
Man we had some good times I hope you understand man.
I had to leave you like I did but damn I made a good friend.
So keep the champagne all nice.
I'll catch you on the flipside when you make things right.
So Com'on now!

[Chorus] x 2
Let's get the stars.
Forget who we are.
There's nothing to it.

You caught me pissing in the wind man but now I got the pool.
I'm doing just splendid, how the fuck are you'
You See, I took the hatchet and cut my self-loose.
I got rid of all attachments and I''m back to peruse.
I've been doing this for to long to just give up and move on.
And I'm rolling the dice now, right now too ruled out.
So just cool now relax and kick in.
And enjoy this life like it is while we still can.
So Com'on now!

[Chorus] x 2
Let's get the stars.
Forget who we are.
There's nothing to it.


Let's get the stars.

Much love to the ladies with jobs

And to my people who always keep it real 
They work all week just to pay bills 
Now and then gotta have a little fun 

Go buy something to wear 'cause the weekend's 'bout to come

Time to get loud, let the music flow 
Kick off your shoes and just let go 
Have a little party, call a few friends

Is it big bills baby, can you cop for me 
Wack the drop for me or grab a spot for me 
I want to spend those on the mink coats 
Throughout the whole coast, baby 

But on the weekend I'm blazing off 
And if you don't spend dough then I ain't gon call 
Get out there I'll show you how this playette roll 
Nice frames, spit a game that'll make you fold 

Toss it up, lookin' cute in the coup 
At the Meadows', tough with some 'taly in the boots

Only my associates always stay lacin' 
And when my squad come ain't' no replacin 
Quarter head or you know what you praisin'

Quarter Inch Jack,"Octane flows through my veins
I see the lights begin to change to green
Oh the power starts to rise
I clench the wheel now to start my ride
It doesn't matter if I die tonight
Driving faster I leave you behind
All I know is right now I'm alive
All I know is right now I'm alive
Devil's smoke of blood-fed fire
Remind me that tonight could be my time

Crash and burn into the stone
The finish comes and suddenly I'm gone
A race moves on in spite of me
These walls become the new machine",Driver,2002

No matter what they be
I just want to feel this way

Yesterday they said don't go away
Yesterday I said
Don't go away
But you did
I wish I could I wish I might have her this way every night
Again and again every time I sin
Lie to myself die to myself what is myself
I said it's time to pay
Don't go away
Yesterday I said
Don't fall away
Even now 
Why do you hate me
Ask me how 
You can be free
I know you want me know you need me
Want to sit around and feed me love
Look how beautiful you are

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

I've been waiting for a feeling that never, ever came
It feels so close, but always disappears

Yes, they're waiting to break out, you just have to try

Make it shine, lay your whole world on the line

If it tells you something let me know
So much is forgotten, so much worth unlocking
Won't you tell me how to break the code
And never worry 'bout the things you read

Give, there's a gift to give

Quartet Hors Saison,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I waited by the mail, but the check was never sent
So I called the Devil up, but I just got his machine
I left an angry message, said ""I gotta have the green""
I didn't give up then, but I made another plan
If Satan didn't want my soul I'd sell it to the man
I tried to find the number, but it wasn't in the book
I'd get the money anyhow, no matter what it took
No matter what it took

No paragon of virtue, at least I'm not a thief
It's so easily justified but always leads to grief
So I got a piece of cardboard and made myself a sign
To sell my soul below the market rate was my design
I went down on the street and I tried to make the deal
A Land Rover drove right by with Satan at the wheel

If you didn't know that we keep it fresh like douche
If you didn't know, y'all need that extra push (when y'all up on the mic)
We're rushing through with raw delight
We're dropping that shit while y'all niggas bite
Speaking 'bout ya copycats (ya copycats)
Ya weak beats and ya sloppy raps (ya sloppy raps)
We come though spreading light
While ya weak lyrics spread negative hype
We kicking true forms of music, sketches of sound increase
Niggas try to stop the force, (you know we on course)

Hey man, I've got a question for you,
Can you feel me? Speaking on you wack MC's
Ya saying ""Not really"", that's 'cause I cut ya hands off
Time to set the story straight, brothers looking for their fate
You was that nerd fake cat who went to school at Lamda Lamda
Trying not to recite the rhymes so you bite the poems
I slap your lip, so you talk sideways like Sly Stallone
Face the truth, my fists are guided to knock your left tooth
Lyrically, ya moms rhymes better than you and she's deaf mute
Step two times to the left, throw up ya fists
Direct 'em towards those wack MC's please as I reminisce
You might have more dollars than you have common sense
The LP's stand ground like Hercules
Let's take that fake cat, break back and make black
People around the world realize they trying to play us like 8-track
I formulate rhymes to educate all those who's killing
Music be the only way to express how I'm feeling
Ya conniving like Clinton, with more nerve than, Judge Judy
You'd be a good ass looking girl because ya rhymes sound booty

Ya comin' like counterfeit (phony)

I'm peaking, you keep weakening like Kryptonite

Niggas riot up, and then blame it on the blaze they've fired up

Kick brands so the whole crew could expand

Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!
