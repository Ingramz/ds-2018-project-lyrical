High Primo,"They say I was always destined for fortune and fame
Now that I've gotten what I wanted everything's changed
And now I'm living the
High life, high life
I never looked back once I left my hometown
High life, high life
I left behind everybody I know

And now I'm singing like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
And everybody sings along like

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life

They say you have to come clean with your past to move on
All of my dreams have come true but something still feels wrong
But I'm still living the
High life, high life
I never looked back once I left my hometown
High life, high life
Said goodbye to everybody I know

And now I'm singing like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
And everybody sings along like

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life

Everybody's dreaming of the high life
It may look good from the outside
But all I really wanted was a good life
With a memory reel of all the highlights
All I want is to sleep good at night
Look myself in the mirror knowing that I live right
So when I'm six feet in the ground
I'll be singing like

A million dollars in palm
Not a worry in the world, that's everything I want
I'm wishing I was there I feel like it's where I belong
I wanna be able to go pay all the bills for my mom
And make her smile
Pick up my family and take em out
On me
And my over capacitated bank account
Money is all I think about
Of my life it's a highlight
Tired of being low I'm ready for the high life
Look at me now
Look at how I get down
Stubs and Wooten on my feet
I'm the flyest youngin in town
But I'm loosin it
My vision has just become an illusion
And Now my highlife is low again
Struggling to hold it in I was on a mission
And messed everything up making all the wrong decisions
I know it's not the end Well then again it might be
And it's sucks god forbid you ever end up like me

And now I'm singing like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
And everybody sings along like

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life",High Life,2012

7 tons of steel and a twelve year old

Alabama singing 'in a hurry and don't know why'

You'd think somebody would hit a knee

Well he's got problems nobody wants a part of
When he got up and slipped out nobody stood up
They don't want to make a scene so they let him walk out of there

Here's the tale of a young black male
Raised in these city streets
Out here hustling to make ends meet
In a world that's so corrupt
That's ran by greed
Money and the power
For me I'm a survivor
I do what I have to and only God can judge me for that
So before you cash your stones down on me
I want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror
And ask somebody to pray for you
Cause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand

I was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers
Drug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla
In the city of Chi the home of the G's
If ya don't work ya don't eat that's been the code of the streets
As for me I was brought up at an early age
Learned how to cook cane started to gang bang
And its a damn shame I chose game
But see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame
And I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights
And be wondering which nigga wanna take my life
Until then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters

[chorus]
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray
Oh I pray
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray

well I'm surrounded by rats, roaches, and dope fiends
My whole world is being weighed up on a triple beam
Man I don't know what's in store for me god
Will I reach 21
Why is life so damn hard
See that's the question that's asked
And is there a heaven or hell can the young black live
Or will he be chained in the cell
I don't know as for me I only trusted a few
I had to hustle to survive now what else could I do
They say there's chances for everybody that's bullshit
That little girl had no chance when that bullet hit
I mean it blew to the sky
And all you heard was a cry
Oh lord don't let my baby die

[chorus]

Til the day that I die I'll stay true to my neighborhood
Fuck with my neighborhood nigga I wish you would
Ain't shit changed like oh once said
And oh no fool my nigga Fred ain't dead
Neither is Pook or Kansas City
True og's still here with me
My homie boo, boo what up
And you know I can't forget about my nigga nigga Novesnake
Nightime boats and herbie
Shine and Cherelle would ya pray for me
I rock genue death so dam sensless
Big houses what the fucking radio been missing
And there's one more nigga that be true to my heart
Mr. Motion you the reason while I'm breaking em off
So our
I peed em to dead
Whole reason was love
To that nigga twist for believing in me
I got a shorty to feed
My priority is to make sure this shit don't have to struggle like me
And if I could ask for one more wish
I tell em I wanna hug ya 'cause I'm missing ya since

Burning tears seemed to blind her eyes
""Oh, look, Papa, there goes Mama,"" cried the little innocent

find a two-step partner and a cajun beat,

Highliners,"They were farm kids way down in Dixie 
They met in high school in the 'sixties.
Everyone knew it was love from the start.
One July in the midnight hour, 
They climbed upon the water tower,
Stood on the rail and painted a ten foot heart 
In John Deere green, on a hot summer night.
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene in letters three foot high,
And the whole town said that he should've use red 
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere Green.
 
They settled down on eighty acres,
Raising sweet corn, kids and tomatoes,
They went together like a hand and a glove.
On a clear day, from their front yard,
If you look and know what to look for,
Off to the east you can still read his words of love
 
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene in letters three foot high,
And the whole town said that he should've use red 
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere Green.
 
Now more than once the town has discovered 
Painting over it ain't no use.
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it, 
The heart keeps showing through.

Eh sì, quindi che cazzo ti ridi
Sto a un nuovo livello, scusa pivello
Non so davvero chi sei
Nella scena rap vengo sul più bello
Sì ma non sono gay
Se giochi con me succede un casino
Come chi gioca a Jumanji
Io per ammazzare il tuo rapper preferito
Dovrei suicidarmi
Va bene essere scarso
Ma tu ne stai approfittando
Le bugie hanno le gambe corte
Sarà per questo che sei così basso
Usciamo solo se piove
Se piove fra non c’è la pula
Ne fumiamo una talmente unta

Highway 101,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

So goodnight you moonlight ladies

And many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
They fin'lly hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
And I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner 'round the horn of Mexico
I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
Seems like it all goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round

I'll fly a starship
Across the universe divide
Until I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can

Or I may simply be a single drop of rain

Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Hijos de la Calle,"Chorus: x2
Hijos de la calle, no hay quien les ladre
Con control machete, arman el desmadre

Verse 1: (hijos de la calle)
Un trío de mexicanos why cuatro venezolanos
Que formaron el relajo why a la cima han llegado
Contagiando al terreno que a muchos incomoda
Si no te gusta mi estilo (ha) entonces no me jodas
Muy lejos llegaremos porque eso es lo que queremos
Why en tarima que nos monten plum! sacaremos fuegos
Los hijos de la calle junto a control machete
Contando uno a uno al final sumamos siete

Verse 2: fermín iv
Míralo h? míralo h?
Est? inmenso el subestisón como si fuera ese nube
Órale va pa' arriba arriba cabrón
Muévete, muévete, muévete... que no se oye
Agarrale el ritmo súbele a la nube
Cabalga, alcanza trepale a la balsa
Para elevar levante
Crece suficiente este mariachi de la muerte
La bola viene cabrona why a verdad no viene sola
Con los hijos de la calle cuidándome la espalda
No tengo ningún miedo, raza pana

Chorus x2

Verse 3: pato
Te levantaste te levante empezaste armaste
Clavaste en parte restante de una pinche
Tras de yo encuentro mucho de similitud
Pues todos venimos de algún baúl why si un
Poco de adentro el umbral represento
Lo violento why lo que viene lento
No miento why presiento, presiento why no miento
Vente de nuevo de tiros directos

Verse 4: (hijos de la calle)
Levántense todos ha llegado nuestro estilo
No te metas con nosotros pues te voy a dar un tiro
Este dúo est? encendido no lo puedes entender
Es que los hijos de la calle ahora tienen el poder
Es la fuerza desatada why nadie nos dice nada
Si se meten con nosotros le caemos a patadas
Este ritmo es de barrio duro de improvisación
Si no les gusta lo nuestro larguens? de mi prisión
Nosotros siete juntos no tenemos competencia
Nos robamos todo el show why nos quedamos con la ciencia
Vete con el resto te vamos a atropellar
Why pao!, pao!, pao!, pao! pao!, pao! pao!
Te vamos a eliminar...

Stop gettin' high off of jealousy, Whether you are a dear or not
I'm comin' with all that I got ( I got), Then while you decide
We are undefined
My instincts says its hard to keep you free (I want to keep you free)
And my mother says men besides stability (Oh, is it true?)
My instincts says its hard to keep you free
But I told you this life exclusively (oh)

The games you play hurt me a lot (alot)
When there's none to play, Will you go or stay?

When my mother says men will leave eventually (is it true?)
Nothing lives forever, I agree

How about a rhyme to fortify me

Someone who does the laundry too

Do what you said you'll do
I hope you like to follow-through

My mind is set on bigger business
This is not a time for reminiscing
This is something new and interesting
Why are you trying to classify it
This is music for all humanity from me

Dreaming of hip hop tunes
They say you've got the proper tools
So what you gonna do
Keep doing things the way you do

They told me I was mistaken, infatuated
And I was afraid to trust my hunches
Now I am ready

Daddy don't be mad that I'm leaving
Please let me worry about me
Mama don't you worry about me
This is my story

Through mountains high and valleys low
The ocean, through the desert, snow
We'll say goodbye to the friends we know
This is our Exodus '04

Through traffic jams in Tokyo
New music on the radio
We'll say goodbye to the world we know

I know I could be mistaken, but my heart has spoken
I cannot redirect my feelings

My baby don't you know I'll never let you down
You've opened me to so many different endings
But baby I know that you'll always be around

By the door you said you had to go
Couldn't help me anymore
This I saw coming, long before
So I kept on staring out the window

Calling you, calling you home
You, calling you, calling you home

I am a natural entertainer, aren't we all
Holding pieces of dying ember
I'm just trying to remember who I can call
Who can I call

Home, calling you, calling you

I run a secret propaganda
Aren't we all hiding pieces of broken anger
I'm just trying to remember who I can call
Can I call

I don't cry, I wonder if you're alright
Late at night, I think about you sometimes
Wonder why I wonder if you're alright
Thinking of the love we made
Ran around, out of town, now you're back again
Confusing true love and pain
Threw it down, now I'm back on my feet again

Are you asleep
Or are you still afraid of the dark
Hugs and Kisses, pictures and romances
Things that I wish I could do without

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Then again I wonder 'bout
But I don't give a damn about you

Take a bite; the pleasure is all mine
Keep in mind I'll think about you sometimes
I'm alright; I'll think about you and I'll
Turn this plight into a singer's delight
Living in a house of pain
Ran away, and I'm glad that I ran away
Rather be out in the rain
Now I understand why my mother ran away

No use asking
When did I start acting like such a jerk (you too)
Washing dishes, birthday wishes, watching baseball matches
The other future that I wonder 'bout
So many things I wish I didn't wonder 'bout

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Now and then I wonder but I betcha
I betcha don't give a damn about

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart

To the house that I grew up in
Going back was something after all these years
I drove down Monterey Street
And felt a little sadness
When I turned left on Laurel and the house appeared
And I snuck up to that rocking chair
Where the winter sunlight slanted on the screened-in porch
And I stared out past the shade tree
That my laughing daddy planted on the day that I was born

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast

Across the street the Randol's oldest daughter must have come home
Her two boys built a snowman by the backyard swings
I thought of old man Randol and his Christmas decorations
And how he used to leave them up till early spring

And I though of all the summers
That I paced that porch and swore I'd die of boredom there
And I thought of what I'd give to feel another summer linger
Where a day feels like a year

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast

Then the door flew open, and my mother's voice was laughing
As she called back to my daddy, ""Come look who's here""
And I thought about years

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast",Years,2008

Sleigh riding all over the neighborhood

You'll be rocking with a stocking on your head
So the cold won't get to you
On Christmas eve you can believe

When the snow comes down

You close your eyes, and to your surprise
You see the Reindeer fly
It's choir singing fa la la la la
Go walking by

Singing and ringing ride along
And Church bells in the air
It seems so real, that you can feel
The snowflakes in your hair

Your face all shining bright
And when you look outside
You see the palm trees dressed in white!

For that perfect Christmas day

I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off
And let it go and
When you wake up
It will seem so yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be ok?

Ha!
Ok,
You can say you're bored (if you wanna)
You can act real tough (if you wanna)
You can say you're torn
But I've heard enough, thank you
You made my mind up for me
When you started to ignore me
Can you see a single tear?
It isn't gonna happen here.
At least not today,
Not today, not today 'cause

If it's over let it go, and,
Come tomorrow it will seem so yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off
And let it go and
When you wake up
It will seem so yesterday
So yesterday,
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be ok?

If you're over me, I'm already over you
If it's all been done, what is left to do?
How can you hang up if the line is dead?
If you want to walk out, then step ahead
If you're moving on, I'm already gone
If the light is off then it isn't on
At least not today
Not today, not today 'cause

If it's over let it go and
Come tomorrow, it will seem so yesterday

Hilary Duff,"Here I am again talking to myself sitting at a red light
Both hands on the wheel, how am I supposed to feel, so much running through my mind
First you want to be free, now you say you need me, giving mixed signals and signs
It's so hard to let you in, thinking you might slam the breaks again

Put the pedal down, heading outta town, gotta make a getaway
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane, this is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I've gotta get away

I can't keep coming back to you every time you're in the mood
To whisper something sweet in my ear
It's so hard to move on, 'cause every time I think you're gone
You show up in my rear view mirror

Is this just a detour, 'cause I gotta be sure that you really mean what you say
It's so hard to let you in, thinking you might slam the breaks again

Put the pedal down, heading outta town, gotta make a getaway
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane, this is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I've gotta get away

To a place where I can be redefined
Where you're out of sight, and you're out of mind
But the truth is I can't even say goodbye

Here I am again talking to myself sitting at a red light
Both hands on the wheel, how am I supposed to feel, so much running through my mind

Put the pedal down, heading outta town, gotta make a getaway

Hilary Duff,"Don't spit on me and shame yourself
Because you wish you were someone else
You look so clean but you spread your dirt
As if you think that words don't hurt

You build up walls no one can climb
The things you do should be a crime
You're the queen of superficiality
Keep your lies out of my reality
And when you're nice it's just a pose
You're one of those

Haters, traitors to the human race,
Haters, what a drag, what a waste
I'd like to see them disappear, they don't belong anywhere
Haters, haters

Spinning a web that's hard to see
Of envy green and jealousy
Feeling angry but you don't know why
Why don't you look me in the eye
You want my friends, you want my clothes
You're one of those

Haters, traitors to the human race,
Haters, what a drag, what a waste
I'd like to see them disappear, they don't belong anywhere
Haters, haters

Different life forms, different species
Broken promises and treaties
Talkin' about exterminating
Not the haters, just the hating

You say you're boyfriend's sweet and kind
But you still got your eyes on mine
You're best friend's got her eyes on yours
It all goes on behind closed doors
And when you're nice it's just a pose
You're one of those

Haters, trying to steal the human race
Haters, what a drag, what a waste
I'd like to see them disappear, they don't belong anywhere

Downside up, and upside down
Going fast is going slow
What could've been we'll never know

In this place that has no name
I can't remember why I came
Then I hear you whisper low
One more mile to Jericho

Nothing is ever what it seems
When you live inside your dreams

The walls will tumble, the walls will tumble
But I'm not gonna cry
My heart won't crumble, my heart won't crumble
If we ever say goodbye

Everybody gets the joke
Where's the fire, where's the smoke
Money, love and jealousy
Something's got a hold on me

But I will follow where you go

But I'm not gonna cry
My heart won't crumble, my heart won't crumble

One more word, one more wish

Rock this world, read my lips and watch 'em curl
Rock this world, it don't take much to please this girl
I don't need the glitter, don't believe the hype
You might say I'm the simple type
Like any other girl who wants to rock this world

Everybody's gone somewhere, so why don't you and I
We're all part of the same parade, just people passing by
And anything can happen, when the sun goes down like this
Maybe it's just a miracle when you find some happiness

Who's that girl living my life?

I'm the one who made you laugh
Who made you feel
Who made you sad
I'm not sorry
But what we did
And who we were
I'm not sorry
I'm not her

You think you're going nowhere
When you're walking down the street
You're acting like you just don't care
When life can be so sweet

Why you wanna be like that
'Cause if there's nothing new
You're not fooling no one
You're not even fooling you

So walk a little slower
And open up your eyes
Sometimes it's so hard to see
The good things passing by

There may never be a sign
No flashing neon light
Telling you to make your move
Or when the time is right

(So) Why not
Take a crazy chance
Why not
Do a crazy dance
If you lose the moment
You may lose a lot
So why not
Why not

(Why not take a crazy chance
Why not take a crazy chance)

You always dress in yellow
When you wanna dress in gold
Instead of listening to your heart
You do just what you're told
You keep waiting where you are
What you'll never know
Let's just get into your car
And go baby go

(So) Why not
Take a crazy chance
Why not
Do a crazy dance
If you lose the moment
You may lose a lot
So why not

Oh
I could be the one for you
Oh yeah
Maybe yes, maybe no
Oh
It could be the thing to do
What I'm saying is
You gotta let me know

Ah ay yeah ay yeah ah ee ay yeah
Ah ay yeah ay yeah ah ee ay yeah

You'll never get to heaven
Or even to a lane
If you don't believe there's a way

Why not
Take a star from the sky
Why not
Spread your wings and fly
It may take a little
Or it might take a lot
But why not
Why not

They think they know everything,
But they don't know anything about me

Give me a dance floor,
Give me a DJ,
Play me a record,

'Cause I need to go,
Need to getaway tonight

I put my makeup on a Saturday night,
I try to make it happen,
Try to make it alright,
I know I make mistakes,
I'm living life day to day,

Wake up, wake up on a Saturday night,
Could be New York,
Maybe Hollywood and Vine,
London, Paris, maybe Tokyo,
There's something going on anywhere I go tonight,
Tonight, yeah tonight

The city's restless,
It's all around me,
People, emotions,
Sick of all the same routines,

They need to getaway, tonight

My love is not up for negotiation
""Hello"" doesn't mean an open invitation
Don't take it personally 'cause
You and me will know
So, move on
Move on
Move on

Now, I'm not saying you're not nice
Let me give you some advice
There's a girl across the room
Who'd kill to be with you tonight
She's been looking over here
And she's made it pretty clear
So, don't lose your chance with her
By trying to get so damn near me

My love is not up for negotiation

Don't take it personally 'cause
You and me will know
So, move on

I get lonely in a crowd
Everyone is smiling
But I made myself left out

I got an imaginary shield around me
But nobody's ever really getting through
I keep thinking that they're gonna break me free

When somebody's knockin'
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying to love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me
Or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

Is there thickness in the air
Or are you heavy on my heart?
Why can't I just fit in?
Why can't I do what everyone else does?

People come around like a storm
When you least expect them to
For me I run for cover
When I should really face the truth

Cause danger, danger, danger you disguise

That I want more

And I decide
Only he can play with fire

Love me, love me
Feed the flame
If you want me back again
Burns in the sky, higher and higher
Baby, can you play with fire?",Play with Fire,2007
Hilary Duff,"Nobody believes me when I tell them that you're out of your mind
Nobody believes me when I tell them that there's so much you hide
You treat me like a queen when we go out
Wanna show everyone what our love's about
All wrapped up in me whenever there is a crowd
But when no ones around

There's no kindness in your eyes
The way you look at me, it's just not right
I can tell what's going on this time
There's a stranger in my life
You're not the person that I once knew
Are you scared to let them know it's you?
If they could only see you like I do
Then they would see a stranger too

Did I ever do anything that was this cruel to you?
Did I ever make you wonder who was standing in the room?
You made yourself look perfect in every way
So, when this goes down, I'm the one that will be blamed
Your plan is working, so you can just walk away
Baby, your secret's safe

There's no kindness in your eyes
The way you look at me, it's just not right
I can tell what's going on this time
There's a stranger in my life
You're not the person that I once knew
Are you scared to let them know it's you?
If they could only see you like I do
Then they would see a stranger too

Such a long way back from this place we are at
When I think of all the time I've wasted, I could cry

There's no kindness in your eyes
The way you look at me, it's just not right
I can tell what's going on this time
There's a stranger in my life
You're not the person that I once knew
Are you scared to let them know it's you?
If they could only see you like I do
Then they would see a stranger too

There's no kindness in your eyes
The way you look at me, it's just not right
I can tell what's going on this time

Back to the beginning
Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned

And wake my dreams
Let it wash away
My sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder
I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean,
I'm coming clean

I'm shedding
Shedding every color
Trying to find a pigment of truth
Beneath my skin

'Cause different
Doesn't feel so different
And going out is better
Then always staying in
Feel the wind

Let the rain fall down
And wake my dreams
Let it wash away

'Cause I wanna feel the thunder
I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean,
I'm coming clean

I'm coming clean
Let the rain fall
Let the rain fall
I'm coming clean
Coming clean
Coming clean

Rain fall down
Rain fall down
Rain fall down
Rain fall down
Rain fall down

Let it wash away

I wanna scream

Hilary Duff,"I remember summers, you and me lasting forever
Holidays come and we'd never, never ever be apart
I remember spending, all of my time, every minute
The two of us we had our own rhythm, in tune with the beat of my heart

Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter (what I do)
Since you went away, since you went away
Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I say
You left it

You took a holiday from us
Took a trip and left your love
If your heart wasn't down forever
You should have told me where it was
You took a holiday from me
I guess you needed to be free
Would have loved you with no measure
And now you got me asking

[Chorus]
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?)
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?) did you go?
(Where did you go huh?) Where did my heart go?
You took a holiday
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?)
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?) did you go?
Why did you leave?
This ain't no holiday for me

Walkin', watching you leave there's no talking
Back in my arms it's so shocking, guess forever was just a dream
I think we could have made it, but our history now is fading
My image of the future is changing & baby damn that thing called destiny, got the best of me

Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I say
You left it

You took a holiday from us
Took a trip & left your love
If your heart wasn't down forever
You should have told me where it was
You took a holiday from me
I guess you needed to be free
Would have loved you with no measure
And now you got me asking

[Chorus]

If I could take a step back, make it turn out different
I would hide those bags, and I'd tear that ticket
Never thought you and me would be done in a minute
Now I'm making new plans and you?re just not in it

If I could take a step back, make it turn out different
I would hide those bags, and I'd tear that ticket
Never thought you and me would be done in a minute
Now I'm making new plans and you're just not in it
(Where did you go?)

You took a Holiday from us
Took a trip and left your love

The kind of day you climb to the top of the world
And see your life unfurl
Before your very eyes
But when it falls apart
Then you realize
This is all a

To a higher place
Countdown
Into some outer space

Maybe it's a day when the angels'll come to sing
Or maybe its a day when the devil comes
To bring a fate you couldn't imagine in your wildest dream

Into a higher place
Countdown
Into some outer space

Never mind the smoke and mirrors left behind you
Don't you go
There is nothing there to really bind you
Just let it go and all your destiny will find you

Wherever you are, wherever you are
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Wherever you are, wherever you are

I feel a little lost since you've been gone
The blame helps you feel better
Until you run across the cloud I'm on

You're reaching for a hand that's in the past
And beaches where the sand has turned to glass
Your television life couldn't channel this love

You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
And now I'm wishing you were here
As much as I wish you would disappear
So will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
Can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
And will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)

A life boat in dead water
A ship inside, a battle that we broke
And we lost our true colours
We opened every door until we closed

And I could feel you in my air tonight
Coming through the waves in satellites
But our city skies will never light up

You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
And now I'm wishing you were here
As much as I wish you would disappear
So will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)

Hilary Duff,"Each and every day it's the same old game
And I play alone
Round and round we go but we never know
When we should get off

And we both tried, but that's just life
And now come to an end
The tears have dried, made up my mind
And know I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
I'm here alone, but I still got one thing left
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart

I guess the safer play would've been to stay
Just make your world
But the other side is calling me tonight even though it hurts
And we both try the best that's life and now
Come to an end
The tears have dried, made up my mind
And I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go
Even though I'm scared to death
I'm here alone, but still got one thing left

I don't know, know, where we're going
I can't breath, breath, all fading starts
I don't know, know, where we're heading
Just know, know, you're stealing my heart

I wouldn't change a single page of my history
I'm gonna keep all the letters you wrote to me
Each and every day it's the same old game
And I play alone
Round and round we go

When we should get off

I remember how my avenues were yours

Meet you when my heart was somewhere else
Outside in the rain
Saw you smiling, the stories you could tell
Have you moved on, moved on?

It's so hard to get a cab in midnight on Friday
Where you going?
Downtown
So am I
Sit right here where it's dry
And if said you're going my way
Well maybe we should share a ride

I could feel anticipation
Through my veins
Oh woah oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything could happen on a night like this
On a night like this

Wouldn't mind if we caught every red light
You're someone I can get close to
You're a stranger but there's something in your eyes
Like you know me
Could I know you?
Well I never fell in love at midnight on Friday
Standing outside
Of town
In the rain
Well this night is almost over
But if I had it my way
We would just stay up all night

I could feel my heartbeat
Electric to my fingertips
Oh woah oh
I could feel anticipation
Through my veins
Oh woah oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips

Our legs tangled up in this small space

Heartbeat, your bed
Sound out what we said

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2010
Hilary Kole,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things to say?
And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name?
I know the way I feel for you it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever

Yet be the best of friends

That gathered up a storm
A silent prayer to call
Her exiled children home
A western wind that wailed
Through ancient stone and rain

In a stranger's name

Oh, sullen night, oh, let them stay

A mother with a child
Left crying by the road

Hilary Lynn,"We were born in the country where life's never tiring
Where people from cities, they drove down admiring
The mountains and rivers they always imagined
To never have substance at all

I once met an old man who told me a story
Of a great British empire living in glory
I sat down beside him and listened intently
But couldn't find meaning at all

On the road to glory
On the road, always without a prayer
On the road, the road to nowhere
God, I pray that there's somebody there

I pick up the papers and read the opinions
Of high-flying critics who scorn at the millions
Of ordinary people who live in the shadows
And search for a light in the dark

I'm traveling this road and I'm playing in places
To handfuls of people with hope in their faces
They're asking me questions and searching for meanings
In songs I can't give them at all

On the road, the road to glory
On the road, always without a prayer
On the road to nowhere
God, I pray that there's somebody there

Living in the city you know it ain't easy
The cars and the taxis are passing so quickly
I sometimes imagine there's nobody listening
To the songs that I'm singing at all

I'm sitting here singing this song by the river
Looking at towers and grey concrete buildings
I'm dreaming of Ireland and wet summer evenings
And wishing I was back home again

On the road, the road to glory
On the road, always without a prayer

Whose virtues were varied and many 
Excepting that she was inclined
Always to make up her mind
And Jenny points a moral 
With which you cannot quarrel
As you will find

Jenny made her mind up when she was three
She herself was going to trim the Christmas tree
Christmas Eve she lit the candles tossed the taper away
Little Jenny was an orphan on Christmas Day

Poor Jenny Bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
She lost one dad and mother
A sister and a brother
But she would make up her mind

Jenny made her mind up when she was twelve
That into foreign languages she would delve
But at seventeen to Vassar it was quite a blow
That in twenty-seven languages she couldn't say no

Jenny made her mind up at twenty two
To get herself a husband was the thing to do
She got herself all dolled up in her satins and furs
And she got herself a husbandbut he wasn't hers

Jennt made her mind up at thirty nine
She would take a trip to the Argentine
She was only on vacation but the Latins agree
Jenny was the one who started the Good Neighbour Policy

Poor Jenny Bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
Oh passion doesn't vanish
In Portuguese or Spanish
But she would make up her mind

Jenny made her mind up at fifty-one
She would write her memoirs before she was done
The very day her book was published hist'ry relates
There were wives who shot their husbands in some thirty-three states

Poor Jenny Bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
She could give cards and spade-ies
To many other ladies
But she would make up her mind.

Jenny made her mind up at seventy-five
She would live to be the oldest woman alive.
But gin and rum and destiny play funny tricks
And poor Jenny kicked the bucket at seventy-six.

Jenny points a moral 
With which we cannot quarrel.
Makes a lot of common sense

Had you dropped me a letter I'd 've hired a band,
grandest band in the land.
Had you dropped me a letter I'd 've hired a band
and spread the welcome mat for you.
 
Now I don't know where you came from 
'cause I don't know where you've been.
But it really doesn't matter 
grab a chair and fill your platter 
and dig dig dig right in.

Hildegarde,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

Hildegarde,"You are my lucky star
I saw you from afar 
Two lovely eyes at me they were gleaming

You're all my lucky charms I'm lucky in your arms
You've opened heaven's portal here on earth for this poor mortal
You are my lucky star

Hildegarde,"Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending
Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo
Goodnight my love, your little Dutch dolly is yawning
Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day
Your doggy's fast asleep, my but he's smart
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight my love

Hildegarde,"There once was a girl named Jenny 
Whose virtues were varied and many 
Excepting that she was inclined
Always to make up her mind
And Jenny points a moral 
With which we cannot quarrel
As you will find

Jenny made her mind up when she was three
She herself was going to trim the Christmas tree
Christmas Eve she lit the candles tossed the taper away
Little Jenny was an orphan on Christmas Day

Jenny made her mind up when she was twelve
That into foreign languages she would delve
But at seventeen to Vassar it was quite a blow
That in twenty-seven languages she couldn't say no

Poor Jenny Bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
She lost one dad and mother
A sister and a brother
But she would make up her mind

In foreign languages, she couldn't say no

Jenny made her mind up at twenty two
To get herself a husband was the thing to do
She got herself all dolled up in her satins and furs
She got herself a husband but he wasn't hers

Jenny made her mind up at thirty nine
She would take a trip to the Argentine
She was only on vacation but the Latins agree
Jenny was the one who started the Good Neighbour Policy

Poor Jenny Bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
But passion doesn't vanish
In Portuguese or Spanish
And she would make up her mind
She instituted the Good Neighbour Policy

Jenny made her mind up at seventy-five
She would live to be the oldest woman alive
But gin and rum and whiskeyy play funny tricks
And Jenny kicked the bucket at seventy-six

Jenny points a moral 
With which you cannot quarrel
Makes a lot of common sense

Jenny and her saga
Prove that you are gaga
If you don't keep sitting on the fence

Jenny and her story 
Point the way to glory
To all man and womankind

Anyone with vision
Comes to this decision
Don't make up
You shouldn't make up
You mustn't make up
Oh never make up
Anyone with vision
Comes to this decision
Don't (don't) make (make) up (up) your (your) mind",The Saga of Jenny,2003
Hildegarde,"Once I visited my cousin, in Milwaukee, USA
She got boyfriends by the dozen, when she sang in a lowdown way
She was a positive sensation
The songs that she sang would never miss
My cousin was my inspiration
That`s how I got like this

I got a cousin in Milwaukee
She`s got a voice so squawky
And though she`s tall and kind of gawky
Oh, how she gets the men

Her singing isn`t operatic
It`s got a lot of static
What makes your heart get acrobatic
Nine times out of ten

When she sings hot, you can`t be solemn
It sends the shivers up and down your spinal column
When she sings blue, the men shout, ""What stuff!""
That baby is hot stuff

So if you like the way I sing songs,
If you think that I`m a wow
You can thank my squawky cousin from Milwaukee
Because she taught me how

Though my world may go awry
In my heart will ever lie

Melodies that must fly
Memories that must fade
Dusty and forgotten by and by

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

Because the Western folks all know

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh!

Tell ya little friend he can quit mean mugging

That's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress
But Louie Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over ya chest
