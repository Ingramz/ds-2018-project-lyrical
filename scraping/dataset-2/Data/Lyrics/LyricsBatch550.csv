Kid Rock,"This is the true story about mackin
Check it
Times are changin'
Talk about it

More so each year,
But the Early Mornin'
Stoned Pimp is here
So let it rain, and let the guitar rock

And if ya here me yawn
Just drop that top
Come on
Hey hey hey

Well well well well
Hey hey hey
Well well well well

And I be catchin' them northern pike
Like on a ten pound test
Success, never fess, take a guess
I be the early mornin' stoned pimp

Straight limpi,
Boone's Farm drinkin
At the party big booty pinchin'
Chillin, like a villain, balloon fillin

Whack MC killin, the fine ho drillin
With the million dollar talent
And the ten cent brain,
Been gone too long, too much cocaine,

But now that I'm back, on the block
I'm ready to rock
Left to right, all night
My game's tight, I wish you might

Take a bite
Out of this here toxic, melodic, neurotic product
Fresh from the harvest
Who'll be the largest, hardest smartest label in town

Top Dog get down
Radio won't play me, but still I got the kids around
The world goin' Kid Rock crazy
Wicked witches be flyin' on broomsticks

Kid Rock be comin' with the boom boom boom biatch
I from the sticks biatch
Straight from the RO
""Kid Rock I ain'ts no bitch""

Ah, yes you are ho
So quit frontin' like ya don't know,
When I step straight into the party with my homeboy Tino
""What's up?""

So get a good look bro
Get a good gander
I'm made in Detroit
But my name ain't Stanzler

Spreadin' like a cancer, a virus
While you're lookin' really gay like fuckin' Billy Ray Cyrus
I'm the highest MC of all time
Got my mind on the D

And the D on my mind
And the line gets drawn when my eyes can't see
Hit me twice with the Tussin and the morphine IV
I be, what they call an O-G bitch
I'm the motherfuckin' Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp

Now throw your hands in the air and let's rock y'all
Just throw your hands up high, hip hop y'all
Just throw your hands in the air and let's rock y'all
Because the Detroit party don't stop y'all

Just throw your hands up high, let's rock y'all
Just throw your hands side to side, hip hop y'all
Just throw your hands up high, let's rock y'all
Because the Kid Rock party don't stop y'all

Now I'm the self made mack on a mountain on Mars
Got the money green cut it with the high roll clause
A Lincoln Continental and a Grand Marquis
Rag top, drop down, rollin' on chrome D's biatch

The purple furs and the gold trim glasses
I only bust the fat asses
And I don't be givin a fuck who da hell can rap better than me
'Cause I'm a true fuckin' player and I mack like a real G

H-I-J-K, L-M-N-O-P is for pimpin
Early mornin' stoned pimpin
I been down, been around
From the bottom to the top

Partyin' down with the slimmies in the cities that I rock
Ooh baby, baby, baby let me love ya
Or if you want to get your freak on, I'll just fuck ya
With the Ooh, ahh, ooh, ooh, ooh ahhh, biatch, shit

I'm the Early Morning Stoned Pimp
Hey hey hey
Come on yo

Now throw your hands in the air and let's rock y'all
Just throw your hands up high, hip hop y'all
Just throw your hands in the air and let's rock y'all

Just throw your hands up high, let's rock y'all
Because the Kid Rock party don't stop y'all

I'm Joe see bitch
Let me get them digits
I might be a little small hoe
But I ain't no god damn midget

So stick it up your ass where the sun don't shine
I'm verticly challenged, your verticly blind
I'm 3 foot 9, it's 10 foot long
I'm gonna smack that ass after I pack this bong

I can flow on like all night long
'Til the break of dawn
'Til the early morn
I'm a thorn in your side

Can you feel me stickin
80 pills a day bitch, I ain't bullshittin
So groove baby groove baby call your momma
I'm like Charlie Hooker girl

I got the boogie drama
With the boogie drama
With the boogie drama
With the boogie drama

Ridin' around the neighborhood
Me and Kid Rock were up to no good
With the boogie drama
With your leather miniskirt and we got some wine

Playin' the radio ya look so fine
With the boogie drama
Well, Well, Well, baby
With the boogie drama

Let's get funky, that's my job
Punchin' 9 to 5, 7 times, times 24, times 12
Day in and day out
Let's get funky
Come on everybody

With the boogie drama
With the boogie drama

Kid Rock,"I want to go back
I want to go back
Uh 'cause I remember way back when
Got kicked out the crib and had a place to stay

In the Clem with some friends George and Jay
It was a funky fresh crew and I'd DJ
What a shock it was to be on the set
Comin' from a nice home now livin' in the projects

No regrets cause I learned a lot
And I earned a lot in the parking lot
Doin' dirt for the O.G's slangin' rock
They used to call me that little white kid

Who could rock on the two turntables
And that ain't no fable
Watchin' Eddie Murphy instead of Clark Gable
My whole life style switched Hoss

Puttin' in hours at the 76 car wash
But I could never wait for them weekends to come
Dumb ditty dumb ditty ditty dumb dumb
Boom, boom, the bass went

On turntables fuckin' it up in Duke's basement
Groove time productions, we kept the jam jumpin'
Open up your ears I'm tryin' to tell you somethin'
And give some love back to those that loved me

206 Court street and my second mom Tracy
Little Keesha and Cole
My mellow blow, and my homegirl Flo
Rock round see, you could find me some

But I kept my tables in the crib when I wasn't in the club
Tom Whit and Mike Shafer used to give me rides
And buy me groceries when I didn't have no paper
And I'm grateful for this

Sometimes I look back and it's these times I miss
Making demos on my old four track

Sometimes I can't help but think, I want to Go Back
I want to Go Back...back in the time
I want to Go Back 
I want to Go Back...go way back way back y'all
I want to Go Back...back in the time

I got kicked out again for bein fly
Got invited to stay with Tony and Eli
And they treated me like brothers
R-I-P to their cool ass mother

An my brother din dada
For the homies ain't here I still gotta lot of love
I want to go back, way back
And change things and bring y'all back

I'm pourin beer out for y'all
I'm singin I saw the light from my cousin Paul
Life brings a lot of tragedy
I look around at times and its so sad to see

A wasted life, or a broken home
But all I can do is take care of my own
I feel so alone like a stranger
And sometimes I express my love through my anger

And I lost a lot of friends for this
Blackman, T-Bone, Ernest KDC, and Chris
And the rest of the Beast crew
I ain't sayin that I'm wrong, but I still got love for you

'Cause I remember how it used to be
Make way motherfuckers beast crew's in the party
To the right, to the left
Many black men and Funk Daddy Def Stef

And sometimes I feel blessed for sure
To a been a part of one of raps last great tours
Ice Cube, Too Short, D-Nice, yo yo
Kid Rock and it don't stop

I want to Go Back...back in the time
I want to Go Back 
I want to Go Back...go way back way back y'all
I want to Go Back...back in the time

I remember litte Robert, cause I stayed with him
I used ta go and see Campbell, when I need a trim
And when times got grim and seen that I lost my way
I used to get blown of with Reve

Bumpin' shoulders and slappin' hands
Willie Knight had a disco, right in his basement man
Them New Haven jams
Me and Blackman running crazy scams

Not a black or white thing, a wrong or right thing
Just makin' that money, and pullin them honies
Spandex shorts and the halter tops
Slanging them rocks and runnin from the cops

The only white kid walkin' round on the block
Cruisin' in Amp's low ridin' ragtop
Go see Howard for what ya need
Underage buyin forties and bags of weed

Late night liquor from Bubba Coles
People used to say, Rock you got soul
Vince looked out and so did Lou
Had a studio budget from the cocaine loot

Chuck D and Murph were the original three
And now Richard D and Kracker are down with me
I got a studio record and a taste of fame
But when I roll through the Clem it's all the same

Even though things change, you know I ain't forgot
'Cause the love from the past gave birth to Kid Rock
But it's hard to go back to the things I knew
'Cause tha me life a have now lives for two

Yeah, and that's where I'm at
I want to Go Back...back in the time
And that's where I'm at

I want to Go Back...go way back way back y'all
I want to Go Back...back in the time
Bring it down
Way
Hey

Let it ride, let it ride
Hey... Hey
Way back, way back y'all",I Wanna Go Back,2000
Kid Rock,"It ain't no party like a Detroit party,
'Cause a Detroit party don't stop.
I said it ain't no party like a Detroit party,
'Cause a Detroit party don't stop.

It ain't no party like a Detroit party,
'Cause a Detroit party don't stop.
I said it ain't no party like a Detroit party,
'Cause a Detroit party don't stop.",Intro,2000
Kid Rock,"Oooooooo Yeahhhhhh
And while your out gang bangin
Tring to catch a murder case
Your hoes on my couch gettin fucked in the face

Bumpin to the base of some old school rap jam
This ain't tennis, but yo I'll use my backhand
On any grown man that tries to check rock
I want to head bang, I gotta hip hop

'Cause I'm gonna stick with what got me paid
Lickin that coochie with the high top fade
I'm self made like Henry Ford
I'm on this mic but it feels like I been here before

I want more than the next man
Respect, plus to cash big checks
And mack on hoes like Ruddy Ray
'Cause the reach around just sounds so gay

I don't even swing that way
I told you hoes before I'm the K
I to the D are O see K'n, rhymes sayin, guitar playin
Turntable spinnin at a basement jam

No fame, no money, but you wouldn't understand
What it's like to be so real
You got the beats and the rhymes, but you ain't got no feel
I don't need the fancy music to make mine

Just the beat and the funky ass base line
Drop a couple cuts on the track
A tracks to the mother fuckin wack
So while your making record that don't recoup
I'm in the house gettin paid like Snoop

Kid Rock an' I got all the hoes sayin'
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me 'till the break of dawn

I want my khakis washed, starched, and creased 
I want an order of fries with a side of grease
I wish for peace throughout this land
I want the whole fuckin world in my hands

I want a band like the US Funk Mob
See I can rap I don't hafta lay sod, just to make ends meet
October 31st yellin Trick-or-Treat
Boy aren't you a little old to be trickin

You see my mask and bag bitch, I ain't bullshittin
Hittin homeruns like Rusty Staub
I'm kinda anal, cause I ain't no fuckin slob
I'm the cradle that's able to rock any format

But still I'm labeled and treated like a doormat
Where's the whores at?
Westside hoes like cars, so I ride em for a test drive
I'm like a pringle, I won't go soft

I got a new jingle, I'm about to go off
Hey ho, check it out, I really like to turn you out
And if you be good to me,
I'll yoodle in your valley

Kid Rock ain't nothing nice
Got the salt and pork boomin with the beans and rice
Got a head full of lice cause I'm such a scum
Got a pocket full of money, but I'm dressed like a bum

Got a business mind, so if I loose the funk,
I'll still be in the house gettin paid like trump
Kid Rock and I got all the hoes sayin'
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby

Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me til the break of dawn
Come on, come on, come on

Oooooooohhhhhh Yeahhhh
Fuck me baby...let it ride, let it ride
Fuck me baby come on, come on...somebody
Fuck me baby...oh yeah
Love me baby...oh yeah

Come on yeah, all night long
Baby, come on, fuck me baby

Come on and do me daddy all night long
Come on and do me daddy all night long
Come on and do me daddy all night long
Come on and do me daddy all night long",Paid,2000
Kid Rock,"Ahh... 
I'm here and it's clear I'm gonna flow so yo black
Just get on up or yo get the bozak 
'Cause it ain't Kojak or Dr. Suess

It's the kid mother fucker and I'm gonna get loose 
'Cause I got the juice to spruce and get nice and
So enticing strong like a bison 
Ruff like brandy and no one knows

That I got more riffs than Randy Rhoads 
Smash, slash and when I trash I bash
I get ill I chill but you don't know the half 
I trip I rip and though I think I'm slick

I'm nothin' but a funky country hick 
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump 
Never been questioned by the F.B.I

Although I've tried every method just to get high 
L.S.D. is what I'm trippin' on
And O.E. bitch is what I'm sippin' on 
A big fat booty's what I'm grippin' on

But for now I'm gonna rock and keep rippin' on 
Down to the mother fuckin' A.M.
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem 
No brain no pain... Now see'mon why'all and tell me what's my name

3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I'm in
Half off the wagon with my feet draggin' 
Taggin' hoes gettin' lots of trim
Gettin' jocks and props for all the spots I rock 

I'm true I'm blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew yo I'm a bang for you 
Because the Kid Rock ain't no bitch yo
And I ain't no radio want to get rich ho 

So count my props you can't get with me and fuck all you cops you ain't shit to me 
But hoes with guns playin' hard for fun
So stay off my dick because I ain't the one 
And for anyone tryin' to bust me up

You better chill with that tryin' to fuck me up 
And if you're talkin' shit I'm gonna shut ya up
And all ya wack D.J.'s I'm gonna cut ya up 
'Cause I don't give a fuck about no one

And when I wax I tax and that's just how it goes son 
Yo ain't no sucker
'Cause I'm the kid..""rock mother fucker"" 
Straight from Mo-town and I won't slow down

I cease the cheese M.C,'s I moe down 
And I show no shame 'cause I'm down for mine
Now tell me what's my name 
It ain't Eric Clapton and this ain't slowhand

I'm the kid ya dig and I'm a rock the whole land 
'Cause no man can make a track this grand
And if you know what I know than just....",3 Sheets to the Wind (What's My Name) [Live][*],2000
Kid Rock,"See I was born a little pie-eyed motherfucker
Mamma she left me and my pappa was a hard trucker
Out on the highway we loved to roll
He never made me go to school

I never begged to go
I was a low class livin' raised out in the sticks
I was born to be a hick
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel huntin'

Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin'
Kissin' and huggin' on some distant lands
People always tell me I'm a twisted man
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit

And I was born to be a hick
Ohhh I was born to be a hick

See I love to spend my days just a squirrel hunter

You know I checked in New York City 
On the streets and on the subways 
And I looked around that tired town to find the one who loved me 
I looked out in the Hamptons thought she'd be hangin' with them rich folks 
But no she wasn't anywhere hangin' on the east coast

Kid Rock,"I want to make money to take away my problems, 
But my problems gettin' bigger with the more money I make 

I want to find love that's my problem, cause the money 
Makes it hard to tell the real from fake 

I want to spend time with my son oh every hour 
But the money and the problems and the women keep me away 
I want to be happy for just one hour, but the only time I'm happy 
Anymore is on the stage

Kid Rock,"Breaking the silence
Is the hardest thing in life
Knowin' that you're wrong
Feelin' like you can't go on
I've been a victim
So many times
But I'm man enough to know when I'm wrong

With the fresh cut mullets
Back row in sight
Pass the packed bullet
I'm gonna rock all night

Up tight right wingers
Trying to say I'm what
But I'm a flight bound singer
Not givin' a fuck

Hard luck of the devil
With the grace of God
On a level of Oz
And it makes you nod

With the body of a sinner
Mind of a saint
I'm everything you love
Everything you hate

Hit a lot of curves
Hard roads and hills
Got nerves of steel
And watched time stand still

It took too long
But I stood my height
You can say I'm wrong

But you ain't right
You ain't right
You ain't right
You ain't right
You ain't
Right
You ain't
Right
You ain't
Right
You ain't
right

You can save the environment
With all your wit
But can you save your children
From a world of bullshit
You look at me
With a loss for love
But if you took me out
Would your kid still do drugs
You want to point your finger in the unclear
You ought a point your finger at the mirror

You want to trip
Quit 'cause I'm a keep rippin'
You can bitch but the strippers gonna keep strippin'
I'm singing songs in the key of life
You can say I'm wrong

King Cowboy baby, you know my credits
Don't ask if it's true, fuck it I said it
Regret it? (Never) Pimpin'? (Forever)

Pull more hoe's than the free cash levers
So you better never, question the cleaver, cleaver
I sever whatever, forget her, and turn 'em redder than ever
You better wet her, and leave her makin' her miss me

But it ain't my fault you misplaced your light
Replaced your wife with some 2 bit missy
Now she's gettin' fucked up in Detroit city

Kickin' with the hippies, bikers, thugs
Hit me with a micky, fast women and drugs
1 love, for 2 minutes a 3rd minute I'm gone
Wake me up to eat around the crack of dawn

I'm makin' pancakes baby if ya crack the eggs
You'll feel the irish tornado when you spread your legs
No need to bag, and don't trail behind me
Just step up front a little lady and
Lay it on me

Got the funky fresh rhyme no beat to bite

And to ya'll hee haws who thought I'd never rank
I'm goin' hahahahaha all the way to the bank bitch
I got rich off a keepin' it real
While you radioheads are reinventin' the wheel

Got critics all trippin' off I don't know what
While I'm sippin' king louie not givin' a fuck
Trash me in the news, give me wack reviews
But you'll never find another who can fill my shoes

Who can roll the blues, who can rock the rap
Who can rock, who can roll, who can flow like that
Uhh black rim and a pocket full of phone numbers
From Pam Anderson to Suzanne Summers
Understand I want peace like Gandi
But until that day I'ma walk this way so

Lay it on me
I'm talkin' all night long
Lay it on me
Like a bang a gong

Lay it on me
With AC/DC on
From hells bells to the next 9 songs
Lay it on me

I can love you like that
Lay it on me
I'd rather fuck to Foghat
Lay it on me

Yeah I can make you shake
Slow ride it baby through the piano break
Come on, come on, come on
So step up front little lady

Lay it on me
Got to lay it on

Yeah yeah
Ohh lat it on me

Kid Rock,"Up and down that lonely road of faith
I have been there
Unprepared for the storms and the tides that rise
I've realized one thing, how much I love you
And it hurts to see, see you cryin'
I believe we can make it through the winds of change

God is great indeed
If you believe, in the everlife
Yeah we gotta
Make some sense of the piece that's not defined
And if you just hold on, I won't let ya fall
We can make it through the storms and the winds of change

Though I walk through the valley of darkness
I am not afraid
'Cause I know I'm not alone

And if the wind blows east, would you follow me
And if the wind blows north, would ya stay your course
And if the wind blows west, would ya second guess
And if it blows to the south, would you count me out
And if the sun don't shine, would you still be mine
And if the sky turns grey, would you walk away
Would you say I do, if I say I'll be
And walk this road through life with me
You know I love youuuuuu

On this lonely road of faith
On this lonely road of faith",Lonely Road of Faith,2001
Kid Rock,"I was hiding from the sun once again
I was running from time my friend
I've lost another war
So I poured one more, and went home drunk again

She was up when the key hit the lock
And the clock looked at me just like the devil in disguise
I saw it in her eyes
She'd be gone before the evening

So I poured another strong one
And chopped a line from here to Texas
'Cause I've lost another good one
She's on the midnight train to Memphis

With a brand new start
I swore I'd love from the heart
I meant to change my ways
But I've seen better days

Than the one that's here this morning, mmhm
With a wife and kids at home
With a job somewhere on some assembly line
I wish I had that life
I bet you wish you had mine

So I poured another tall one
And chopped a line from here to Texas
'Cause I've lost another good one
She's on the midnight train to Memphis

Dude, what station is this, K snooze
Kid Rock, I thought he was the American bad ass
He's putting me to sleep
Nudge me if he gets over five decibels
I knew his first album was the good one

But that's the way I am, and this is how I jam
All across the land from Alabam' to bandstand
Doped up rebel with an attitude, shit
So fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch

I won't switch, won't quit no vices
Flip the script cause I'm a slice the righteous
Haven't you heard I don't refrain
Free as a bird, and so I won't change

Livin' it up, givin' it up, fuckin' shit up, what
I'm a run the track from the D to Nantucket
So fuck it, if you don't dig that you can suck it
Yeah, and it don't, and it don't

With an old suitcase, I swear I'll leave this place
I'll get you back in time, can't drink you off my mind
So I'll see you when I'm sober
I been looking for some reasons
But I ain't found one down in Texas
I been changing with the seasons
Walked in a new line back to Memphis",Midnight Train to Memphis,2001

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell

It was the same old same how have you been
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away

I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

I saw you yesterday with an old friend

It was the same old same how have you been

Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

You reminded me of brighter days

I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church

I was off to drink you away

I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home

Kid Rock,"I was looking for America, in a western movie
Saw a young gun slinger with something to prove
And I came lookin'...like anybody else
I came searchin'...like anybody else
Lookin' for that golden calf

And I came shooting for the stars, like any young blood
I found a fat cat city and crooked judge
I killed anything standing in my path
I killed anything till I laid my hands
Laid' em on the golden calf

Now it's our last sand in open country
This is my last chance to be with you
This is the last dance for this kind of man
I'm still lookin' for something to prove

I come around full circle, aged like an old dog
Lookin' at them young bucks just green as frogs
But I ain't layin' back no time to laugh
I ain't layin' back
There's new kids a comin' gunning for that golden calf

I was was looking for America in a western movie
I saw pike bishop stridin' through aqua verde
He was headin down that dusty path
Headin down that blood path
Runnin from his crooked past
He's lookin for another life
Sick of chasin' down that golden calf

Now it's our last sand in open country
This is my last chance to be with you
This is the last dance for this kind of man
I'm still lookin' for something to prove

But there's always someone faster
Someone quicker on the draw
Someone with a hunger closin' in
Some younger steppin' up to be
The next out law

Now it's our last sand in open country
This is my last chance to be with you
This is the last dance for this kind of man
I'm still lookin' for something to prove

Oh I'm still looking for something to prove
This is our last stand...
This is our last stand...
This is our last stand...
This is our last stand...",Last Stand in Open Country,2002

Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock

I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out ""She's with me!""

Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

I don't need this
Fuck you ho's can squeeze this
I can't believe this
I'm so wasted

From all the fruits of life
That I've tasted
Never a clone on the microphone
I got shit built up

'Cause I never felt loved at home
And all alones how I spend my free time
Writin' freal rhymes
Drinkin' cheap wine

Easy whips
And a cracker

Another lonely night, another empty glass
This path I'm walking always seems to lead nowhere
I wonder how much you think of me

Times might change, love it comes and goes
How I wish I could have shown you how deep for you my love goes
And I know this might seem crazy, I would end my life for you
You know I don't want to, but I'd do it for you
Hey I'd do it for you

I wonder how much you think of me
It hurts to think the past is all that you can see

I wonder how long it takes to see
There's nothing more I want than you here with me

Kid Rock,"No man ever sounded so lonesome
No man ever made you feel such pain
Lord, it must have been a real mean bottle
That made you sing that way

The stories you told about prison
'Bout a young man gone astray
Lord, it must have been a real mean bottle
That made you write the songs that way

A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil
It's a miracle you're standin' here today
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel
It must have been a real mean bottle made you sing that way

You spent most all your life with strangers
With a ramblin' fever in your veins
Hag, it must have been a real mean bottle
That made you write the songs that way, oh, yeah

A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil
It's a miracle we're standin' here today
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel

She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

Hey gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's just that ho-ho-honky tonk women
Hey gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcee in Detroit City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
And that lady then she covered me with roses
She blew my nose, then she blew my mind

Son, it's just that ho-ho-honky tonk women

Kid Rock,"Well, I'm a-packin up my game and I'ma head out west
Where real women come equipped wit' scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the hills, chill like flynt
Buy an old drop-top, find a spot to pimp

Then I'ma Kid Rock-it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lotsa crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag that says ""chillin' the most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast

Give a toast to the sun
Drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix
And get tossed outta bars

Sift to Tiajuana
I want to roam
Find motown telephones and come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons

And set up shop at the top of four seasons
Kid Rock, and I'm the Real Mccoy
And I'm headed out west, sucker 'cause I want to be a

Cowboy, baby
With the top let down and the sunshine shinin'
West Coast Chillin' while the boone's whinin'
I want to be a Cowboy, baby
Ride at night 'cause I sleep all day
Cowboy, baby, I can smell a pig from a mile away

I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin' when my train rolls in
It goes""hooy-hooy-hooy"" Like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned brew, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind

Palm trees and weed
Scabbed knees and rice
Get a map to the stars
Find Heidi Flice

And if the price is right
Then I'm gonna make my bid
And let Californi-A
Know why they call me

Cowboy, baby
With the top let down and the sunshine shinin'
West Coast Chillin' while the boone's whinin'
I want to be a Cowboy, baby
Ride at night 'cause I sleep all day

Yeah
Kid Rock, you can call me Tex
Rollin' sunset women with a bootle of becks
See a slimy in a 'Vette, roll down my glass

And said ""yeah this dick fits right in yo' ass""
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
Call me hoss, I'm the boss, with the sauce, and the horse
No remorse for the sheriff and his eye ain't right

I'ma paint his town red then I'ma paint his wife white
'Cause chaos rock like Amedeus
Got west-coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayors, ball like Lakers

They told us to leave but bet they couldn't make us
Why they want to pick on me?
Lock me up and throw away my key
I ain't no cheat, I'm just a regular failure

I'm not straight out a' compton, I'm straight out the trailer
Cuss like a sailor, drink like a mick
My only words of wisdom are just ""suck my dick""
I'm takin' my pick

Up and down that and keep on truckin'
'Til I fall in the ocean

Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks

To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Or how we thought those days would never end

Got me feeling guilty of being white

But I believe in what is right

c'mon now amen, amen

Stop pointing fingers and take some blame,
Pull your future away from the flame
Open up your mind and start to live
Stop short changing your neighbors
Living off hand outs and favors, and maybe
Give a little bit more than you got to give

Simplify, testify, identify, rectify
And if I get high stop being so uptight
It's only human nature and I am not a stranger
So baby won't you stay with me tonight

It's a matter of salvation from them patience up above,
So don't give up so damn easy on the one you love, one you love
Somewhere you got a brother, sister, friend, grandmother, niece or nephew
Just dying to be with you
You know there's someone out there who unconditionally, religiously, loves you
So just hold on 'cause you know it's true

Kid Rock,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Chorus]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

Kid Rock,"Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home.
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown.

And I don't want no one to cry, but tell em'
If I don't survive

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

Free, like a river raging
Strong, if the wind I'm facing.
Chasing dreams and racing father time.
Deep like the grandest canyon,
Wild like an untamed stallion.
If you can't see my heart you must be blind.

You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can't keep no chains on me.

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

And I'm not good at long goodbyes but look down
Deep into my eyes.

I was born free!

Hey yaya yayaya
Oh hoo

Calm facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets.

Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set

And when its done believe that
I will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

And I will vow to the shining seas
And celebrate God's Grace on me.

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

Oh, oh oh oh wah hoo",Born Free,2010

My eyes grows thin as I get older

Yelling on the right

'Cause I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
Well, I can't change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do
The least that I can do
The least that I can do is care

Oh

I pray and pray for life's salvation
Faith is tried and true in tribulation
Love is lost and lonely, check the news

The least that I can do is care

For the life of me
I can't see how the devil keeps enticing me
All you see is a felon
I know God can see what's right in me
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place
When the worst case scenario is my birth place
I'm just trying to keep from falling victim to the murder rate
Take my life lesson, convincing the adolescents there's a God up in heaven
Sending down blessings
And your future ain't brighter than your present, quit stressing

Screaming on the left
And yelling on the right
While I'm sitting in the middle
Trying to live my life

And the weight of the news, It nearly broke my back
It was late September, and I remember oh so well
I put a rose in the bible and placed it on my shelf

Wish I didn't know now the things I never knew before
Now when it rains, it pours
Wish I didn't know now the things I never knew before

Back then when we were seventeen
Time was on our side
Holes in our jeans and a pocket full of dreams
The future was Friday night
And we would hangout down by the river bend
Singing our favorite songs
Laughin and drinkin, smokin and smilin
Now those days are gone
Now when it rains, it pours
Wish I didn't know now the things I never knew before
Now when it rains, it pours
Wish I didn't know now the things I know for shore

Like a deer in the headlights, I stood frozen in my tracks
And the weight of you not here nearly broke my back

Underneath the cold fall moon

He walked like a saint lost far in a world of sin

No mama to assure his situation
A misfit piss poor education
He talked a big game but never could seem to win

And southwest Detroit ain’t a place to talk no trash
You can throw some dap but it’s best not to flash no cash
You grow up quick, fightin’ for the upper end of lower class
And sometimes ya feel like sand in an hour glass

You better learn to play and pray God save rock n roll

He got a four-piece band for his graduation
A second hand van and they toured the nation
But no one seemed to ever wanna sing a long

They headed out west to find salvation
But the Sunset Strip’s a big temptation
The girls and cocaine seemed to write every song

But east LA ain’t a place to talk no trash
You can play for tips but how long can that life last
You grow up quick, writin’ checks your ass can’t cash
And sometimes ya feel like life’s movin’ way too fast
Hey there young man, you better dig down deep in your soul
You better find your way and pray God save rock n roll

If you could find a way I swear I won’t sell my soul
Hey God, save rock roll
Pave the way and hey God save rock n roll

A big fat check for his aggravation
And a renegade spot tucked way high up in the hills

His songs played strong on every station
And MTV in full rotation
And his garage was filled up with big Cadillac DeVilles

He sold his soul it was fabrication
Found success but lost his patience
Cuz livin’ on the road ain’t all it’s cracked up to be

He got dropped in the middle of consolidation
His wife took half and then taxation
Left him right back at the alter on his knees

Hey mister big shot, how’s it feel to be back?
Yeah you made it, became a member of the upper class
Forgot your roots and made everybody kiss your ass

Sure look cool, man, in your three piece with your snake skin boots
Hey that sure is cute
Little honey, sitting in the front seat
Touching up her lipstick with her hoop silver earrings
He said damn right I hung it there 'cause boy she takes me back
To the days with Lincoln Continentals and Cadillacs

She was a queen of the red white and bell bottom blues
Back in the she'd write her number on a matchbook days
When you'd take her out for a drink and then you'd walk her back
To your Lincoln Continental or your Cadillac
She looks so good, cruising up and down
This don't take no shit from no one all-American downtown
Main street all lined up with shiny and black
Lincoln Continentals and Cadillacs

He said that sweet girl, she moved on when as time slowed down
But I just kept on hanging around
And that sweet ride cost me too much when the town dried up
Let the bank take it back, paid in cash
For that old Ford truck sitting right out front
And this picture's all I have left of
And I always thought she would have but she never came back
No, she never came back

And I did so miss that queen of the red white and bell bottom blues
Back in the she'd write her number on a matchbook days
When you'd take her out for a drink and then you'd walk her back
To your Lincoln Continental or your Cadillac

But life ain’t so simple right
And times get hard and people can make you mad
But I remember when I was young
I couldn’t wait to turn 21
Sit in the backyard sun and drink beer with dad

Drinking beer with dad
Out there on the back porch swinging
Drinking beer with dad
Picking my guitar and grinning

We’d hem and haw, we’d cuss and fight
But that’s where I learned life’s best advice
We’d talk about when I was young and bad
Sometimes he’d make me fightin’ mad
Best education I ever had
Was out there on the back porch drinking beer with dad

Nowadays most things have changed
This whole world is heading down the drain
There’s no God in schools
Toting guns is the latest fad
A little discipline would sure be nice
A little lesson in wrong and right
Maybe it’s time young man to have a beer with dad

Drinking beer with dad
Out there on the back porch swinging
Drinking beer with dad
Picking my guitar and singing

I’d play him songs all through the night
I’d praise the Lord I saw the light
We’d stay up late and make mom mad
But half the time we’d just laugh and laugh
Some of the best times I ever had
Was out there on the back porch drinking beer with dad

Now son I’m so damn proud of you
And the young man you’ve turned into
You’re the best son a father could ever have
And though your grandpa’s done past on
Soon you’ll be 21
So come on the back porch son and have a beer with dad

Drinking beer with dad
Out there on the back porch swinging
Drinking beer with dad
Picking our guitars and grinning

We’ll hem and haw, we’ll cuss and fight
But I’ll pass along life’s best advice
We’ll talk about your old granddad
The things he gave us he never had

I can see her waiving on the corner smiling cause she feels just like I do

And this addiction I've been dealing with

Would we have a family
A castle with a view
And can we still be friends

Got a rope like a python hanging 'round my neck
Got a freak in my arms cold kicking on the set

Punched her in the eye and took my bank back

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2000
Kid Thomas Valentine,"Dear, it seems years since we parted,
Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.
 
It's strange how life deals you sorrow,
Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,

This shit done left music, we just fam now
Man I done brought niggas around who give a fuck 'bout rhyming
Gave 'em that look so y'all don't know but that's your man now
My shooters is yours, extra hands out
But not a hand-out
Nickle, you had me feelin' fly up in the No Fly
Walkin' through that Motorcity Inn like I was multi
Goons on both sides, somebody sneeze that nigga daddy wear a bow tie
And Crook, I'm always comfortable on your side
Sauce you a Boss, Horseshoe what it do?
C-Style hold ya head, Tray Deee can’t wait to meet you
And Jumpoff, when that whole shit jumped off, I ain’t gon name no names
But yeah I hoped that I ain’t come off grimy but dawgs I fuck wit them niggas that’s why I never threw my gloves on
Needed to clear that up ‘cause that shit been really botherin’ me for dumb long

Chemistry you never seen before
We the four, Well-known plus worth knowing you niggas either or
Even if we was poor never seen a tour
And Eminem didn’t put our CD in a convenience store anymore
We can still hit the streets and score
I help us finance our dreams on a triple beam
Never bicker for simple things
Loyalty is royalty with these Shady royalties
I will loyally help you pay all your lawyer fees
It’s much deeper than the art of rap
It’s realer than me signing a few autographs
Rocking my new slaughter tats
I was raised to keep it G since snap Starter hats
And bury our enemies like artifacts these are the facts
Like Chinese food in the fridge we a cold combination
Slaughter slaughter my whole conversation

It’ll be black roses on Mother’s day, on they mama front door mat
You know I'm, I’m quick to jump in front of fire in the line of fire
You ain’t got to ask what side I’m on I’m going homicide
May I simply cease to exist if I should be a bitch
If you should die and I should stay behind we actually a switch
As far as passing you a chick, you get the alley-oop you ask for the assist
This is a fact, it’s more than rap to me it's
More serious than holding a loaded gat to me I sold my soul to a bottle of Patron
And my favorite uncle died of an illness alchy related then he stole it back from me
And now he up in heaven like neph, you owe it back to me
I was taught that too much talking will make you fall faster
My actions show that I’m real I ain’t got to broadcast it
I called you and said that I had to fall back I had to recover
And here we are, that’s for my brothers

Look, the love I got for ya’ll goes unsaid
Was there when me and shorty unwed
For that I’m always down to pump lead
We formed a bond against the cowards
Only grew over time in the studio for hours
And tours with no showers, and towns I never heard of was no small fort
But we was all sports, Slaughterhouse t-shirts in our ball shorts
Quick all that other shit, that's just other shit
Love is love, we ain't even gotta discuss this shit
The part that's sick G?
My brothers love me so much, I think their punch hit ya’ll harder than it hit me
Four of the best in the world, I put a M on it
And if that ain't enough I’m putting Em on it
We back to hogtying beats up and stepping on it
Back on our old shit just like Nino Bless is on it
Crowds screaming, the fans can get excited
And oh, as far as that question? I won't even dignify it

cause you will get well soon
it’s your home

it’s your shelter

forget all the things you left behind

How do you face theses days alone

Does the light fades like it used to be 
Where i’m going there is no light

Kid with Man Head,"Guess what I found today,
One red hair on my jacket
Sad to think how that hair remains
All this time and all this pain

Guess what I found today,
One red hair on my pillow
I don't want it to be this way
Lying here with still so much to say

Don't go
Leave me standing here
Don't go
I don't want to know

Now I just try and remember well
The times we spent and how we cared
I just cry and remember hell
The feelings that you wouldn't share, but
Guess what I found today
One red hair on my jacket
And I don't want it to be this way, but
This time I won't throw it away

In my bed, on my wall
In my head, when you call
In my drawers, on your floor
In your dreams, out the door

Guess what I kept today,
One red hair in my back pocket
Take a minute to stop and try
A brand new life without a sigh

I won't forget what you meant to me
Even though my memories have faded
And that's the way it was meant to be,
That one red hair will always stay with me",Found,1998
Kid with Man Head,"Has she twisted your new ideal?
Who are you?
My good friend,
Take control

So when you wake and looking back

You, you wussed out and I know
You can't fight like me
You'll let it slip away
Yeah, you wussed out and I know
You can't wait like me
You'll let it slip away

Save it for someone who cries
Half alive
Someone weak,
Like you

Slow down sister

We let all this happened
Will this war last forever and ever?

All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it

You better hit bull's eye

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram

Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice

I'm kid kid, my face on every wanted poster
I'm wanted by every lady cop all over
That ass so big I catch a battery to hold ya
My hands so big you thought I told ya to pull it over
She pulled me over, pulled me out the Rover
Then she pulled me closer, do me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs start ripping my pants off

Wee ooh wee ooh wee,
Wee ooh wee ooh wee,

When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thing, I'll make that body sang
I make it say

Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key,
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift
Cause it's on tonight
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and head,
And I can't wait to get it on
Wanna do it all night long, Mrs. Officer

Kidd Kidd,"Word got around that a nigga got shot
Heard a nigga drew down' and he bucked so his ass got popped
We was on my block trying to move these rocks
Trying to stack this cash on the low, gotta duck these cops
We was off third and polock chilling in the back of the tracks
Niggas got packs, trying to get them racks
X5 I was riding in the back with the brother's' round kicking in the gat in my lap
17 had no dreams, drinking four loco's, Sprite and codeine
First class I was so lean, said fuck high-school, so I left Reed

No one told me life would be this way!
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same!
People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
Out here tryna make a way
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

Phone just rang heard a nigga got got
He was over in the East, last thing that he heard six shots
He ain't gettin' no love from the cops, nobody got caught
Real talk when I heard who it was, heart damn near stopped
Somebody done killed my brother, now I gotta get back
Let em know cause a nigga gotta feel that!
Sitting shotgun with the shot gun
When you hear the shots come, nigga don't run!
Already bad, it can only get worse
Hand full of steel cause the shit still hurts
Cut so deep when they put him in the hearse
Never saw 25, had to put him in the dirt

No one told me life would be this way!
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same!
People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
Out here tryna make a way
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

Once upon a time down town in a nine (9th ward)
Where they don't mind dying
Sworn to a life of crime, was a youngin' that only stood 5'5
Big money on his mind, clothes ain't wrinkled while his hands on his iron.
Shot six times right in front of my mom
Kind of 32, man, I'm lucky to survive
On that Pac juice real niggas don't die!
Bitch, I'm from A-town, slang crack on the same set
Blood stains there from a homie with his head cracked
O'Gs like A' wacks they'll be doing this shit way back since A track.
And we yell where the gang at
You can get fame there from the way you're going to bang that
Shoot for the head watch how you aim that
Price on your head and we gonna take that
It's about to go down, you ain't about this then you better go now
Sun going down, keep it going down!
Everybody lay down ski mask down!
All you gonna see is my eyes and my frown
Last thing you hear is my gun going pow
It happens every day round my way
This ain't nothing new you grew up downtown

People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
I'm just trying to make a way,
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

Tripping on heights, wishing for Nikes in different flavors

Uncles named Larry, that really never grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch through the bay bay
With waists so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day

So many niggas, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gang bang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they own
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good working with my hands
My generation never understood working for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan

Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl selling her body, wish she knew what it was worth.
Between God and trash, looking in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growing up she got to know hurt
very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her step-father that he was ike, so her mother he striked
she got to like like minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doing white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack

For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash, they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash, it caught on in a flash
They did the mash, they did the monster mash

The zombies were having fun, the party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'

They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash

Out from his coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?

It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash

Mash good!
Easy, Igor, you impetuous young boy
Mash good! Grrr!",Monster Mash,2018

And By Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
Cause you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody and messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care

When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, its your mission
And you won't stop till I'm there.

When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

Rest my head on something real

Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away

When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

I said, that I come from Dixie land
Suzanne, don't you break down and cry
I said, oh, Susannah

De laisser tomber sa raison
Sors par les fenêtres
Marche sur la tête

On down the road

And I couldn't get across
So I paid five dollars
For a big bay hoss

And he wouldn't stand still
So he went up and down
Like an old saw mill

On a warm summer day
When all the fish
Were swimmin' in the bay
With their hands in their pockets
And their pockets in their pants
Did you ever see a fishie
Do the Hootchy-Kootchy Dance?

Kidz Bop Kids,"I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

I know it's done for me

I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better

It's perfect, it's pa**ion, it's setting me free

Love me now, leave me never

Lost in your embrace

On my empty heart, all alone in my bed

Kidz Bop Kids,"Bah hum, but that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this years been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's still the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left
From last year, ski shopping, counter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 past along those lines

So deck those halls and trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with
Flash back to spring time, sun again
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course till summer time
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him
No, this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendars just one page and of course I am excited
Tonight's the night, I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-dos, a few cards, a few calls
Because it's RSVP
No, thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me with the world's smallest turkey
All ready in the oven, nice and hot
Oh darn, guess what I forgot?
So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear?
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
I'm spending this one alone he said
Give me a break, this years been crazy
I said me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale to a very happy ending

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year

The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer)
Had a very shiny nose, (like a lightbulb)
And if you ever saw it, (saw it)
You could even say it glows (like a flashlight)
All of the other reindeer (reindeer)
Used to laugh and call him names (like Pinocchio)
They never let poor Rudolph (Rudolph)
Join in any reindeer games (like Monopoly)

Santa came to say (oh oh oh)

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

We were both 18 and it felt so right
Sleeping all day, staying up all night
Staying up all night

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me
And take me away, yeah yeah

There's a piece of you that's here with me
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see
When I sleep I dream and it gets me by
I can make believe that you're here tonight
That your here tonight

If I could you find now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me
And take me away, yeah

I remember the look in your eyes
When I told you that this was goodbye
You were begging me not tonight
Not here, not now
We're looking up at the same night sky
We keep pretending the sun will not rise
We'll be together for one more night
Somewhere, somehow

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me
And take me away, yeah yeah",Ocean Avenue,2004

She was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
He was a punk

She did ballet
What more can I say
He wanted her
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well

But all of her friends
Stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

Five years from now
She sits at home
Feeding the baby she's all alone
She turns on t.v

Guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends
They already know

And they've all got
Tickets to see his show
She tags along
Stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slamming on his guitar

I see the soul that is inside

Haven't you heard
How we rock each others world

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise

He did the mash
He did the monster mash

It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash

To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'

They played the mash

Kidz Bop Kids,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy, you all know me I was scared as hell
He comes to me at night when I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside, he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake, but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare, on my street

It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten off of tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and down watch a movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I've never seen in my life
That was alright though, 'cause lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theatre set to ill
Buggin' , cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent
You know, nothin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred
And this girl named Nancy
But, word! When it was over, I said, yo, that was def!
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, on my street

It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock, and it stopped at 12 30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool to quench my thirst
I thought to myself, Yo! This heat is the worst
But when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone, but the TV was on
I thought nothin' of it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button, and I then almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind, it said
""You are my favorite rapper, but now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke inside my drawers and screamed, so long 'cause!
Got halfway up the block, I calmed down and stopped screamin'
And thought, Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin'
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I'm thinkin' since this is a dream, I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the big, bad, Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do. We've got a lotta work here, me and you
The souls of your friends, you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brains.""

I said, yo, Fred. I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work
The girls won't be yours, Fred, your face is all burnt
Fred got mad and his head started steamin'
But I thought what the hell, I'm only dreamin'
I said, please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep
But gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week
I pat him on the shoulder, say, ""Thanks for stoppin' by.
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care, guy!""
He got mad, threw back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, Hold up, that hurt

It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, Freddy, uh, uh, there's been an awful mistake here.
No further words, and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head and said
Oh please, do somethin' with Fred!
He jumped on my bed and threw the covers with his claws
Tried to get me but my alarm went off. and then
Silence
It was a whole new day, I thought
Heh, I wasn't scared of him, anyway
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street

Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon Jeff, answer
C'mon man
Hello
Jeff, it's Prince man, Jeff, wake up Jeff, wake up
What do you want?
Jeff, wake up, man. Listen to me. Jeff
It's 3 O'clock in the morning, what do you want?
Jeff, listen, Jeff, would you listen to me? Whatever you do, don't
Fall asleep

Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license

Lean your ear this way!
Don't you tell a single soul, 
What I'm going to say
Christmas Eve is coming soon, 
Now, you dear old man,
Whisper what you'll bring to me 
Tell me if you can.

When the clock is striking twelve, when I'm fast asleep,
Down the chimney broad and black, 
With your pack you'll creep.
All the stockings you will find 
Hanging in a row
Mine will be the shortest one, 
You'll be sure to know.

Johnny wants a pair of skates, Susie wants a sled
Nellie wants a picture book, yellow, blue and red

We just feel like we don't have the means 
To rise above and beat it 

So we keep waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 

It's hard to beat the system 
When we're standing at a distance 
So we keep waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 

Now if we had the power 
To bring our neighbors home from war 
They would have never missed a Christmas 
No more ribbons on their door 
And when you trust your television 
What you get is what you got 
Cause when they own the information, oh 
They can bend it all they want 

That's why we're waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 

It's not that we don't care, 
We just know that the fight ain't fair 
So we keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 

And we're still waiting 
Waiting on the world to change 
We keep on waiting waiting on the world to change 
One day our generation 
Is gonna rule the population

On a snow white Christmas Eve

Fifty miles to go
And she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year, she had a lot on her mind
And she didn't pay attention, she was going way too fast

Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared she threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel, take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go, so give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on, Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleeping like a rock

And for the first time in a long time she bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life, I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

I'd roll out of bed in the morning

Kidz Bop Kids,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day?
What if, what if, if today was your last day?

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you're never living twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

And would you call those friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are

So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back

But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?

So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'll go back to the days

Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the hater, what's up, Bobby Ray

So can I get a wish to end the politics?

We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did the words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
No, though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does
I listen to my favorite song
It's playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Like when you said you felt so happy you could cry
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can be addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you passed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
