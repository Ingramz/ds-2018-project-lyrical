Kasey Chambers,"If I could learn how to fly
My feet would never though the ground
I'd never have to say goodbye
I wouldn't have to make a sound
I could give away this heart
Leave it in the lost and found
If I could fly high I'd never come down

If I could sail across the sea
I would head towards the sun
I would never have to be
Anything to anyone
I could chase your memory
And then I'd never have to run

If I could sail away I'd never come home

But I am still here
There's nowhere else to go
Yeah I am still here
There's no-one else to hold
And I can't fly I'm not that strong
Yeah I am still here
And you're still gone

If I could fall into your arms
Promise never to let go
Would you keep me safe from harm
And take me every where you go
We could throw away the past
And then you'd never have to know
If I could hold your heart
I'd never let go",Lost and Found,2004
Kasey Chambers,"I used to make the fire
Now I'm running out of flame
The closer I get the more regrets
And I won't change everything
To have you back again
But I can't keep everything the same
They say it won't get harder
I'm gonna be OK
But it's just like me going against the break
And while I tie to your shoestrings
And I'm breaking from the strain
Those damn things hold on like chains
Yeah those damn things hold on like chains

[Chorus:]
Was I ever really more than ordinary
Did you ever see me like I saw you
Was I ever really more than ordinary
Did you ever need me like I need you now
I need you now

If I was a liar, I had a few more friends
The chances are my heart would never mend
Even know my conscience would go
Running back again
Doesn't really hurt to pretend
No, it doesn't really hurt to pretend

[Chorus]
Was I ever really more than ordinary
Did you ever see me like I saw you
Was I ever really more than ordinary
Did you ever need me like I need you now
I need you now [Repeat: x2]",More Than Ordinary,2004
Kasey Chambers,"Do you remember when I was a baby
Did I cry, did I cry
I only remember the days I was laughing
When you sang me sweet lullabies
When you sand me sweet bye and bye

Sometimes I wonder if you were an angel
Would you fly, would you fly
Or would you just hover right here by my side
Keeping me warm and dry
Keeping me safe by you side

Mother mother won't fall from grace
Light a room with the lines on your face
And if you were a river run dry
Well I'd sing you sweet bye and bye

All of the birds that land on my window
Sing your name, sing your name
When all of the time I am crying again
About how much the sky likes to rain
When I should be singing your name

Mother mother won't fall from grace
Light a room with the lines on your face
And if you were a river run dry
Well I'd sing you sweet bye and bye

And all of the flowers by the side of the road
They whisper your name while they grow
And if you were a river run dry
Well I'd sing you sweet bye and bye 

And if you were a river run dry
Well I'd sing you sweet bye and bye",Mother,2004
Kasey Chambers,"I'm just an old man
My hair is thinning
My head is spinning
I cry myself to sleep at night
And lordy lordy
Though no one hears me
I know you're near me
Will you always be my wife

And some days make me
Feel weak and shaky
Some fly right right by me
Like a paper aeroplane
And I hardly notice
That the world's gone crazy
But nothings clearer
Than the way your said my name

And I should of let go by now
Yeah I should of let go by now
But I kept your brownies
And your golden honey
And I smell your flowers
And I saved your money
And I hold your blanket
Close for hours
And I paint my heart blue
But I did it all for you.

I'm just an old man
My hair is thinning
My head is spinning
I cry myself to sleep at night
And lordy lordy
Though no one hears me
I know you're near me
Will you always be my wife",Paper Aeroplane,2004
Kasey Chambers,"When i grow up i want a pony
I'm gonna ride her from dust til dawn
I'm gonna brush her mane
And feed her sugar cane
And keep her in safe from the storm

If i had a pony
I wonder could i be your girl

When i grow up i want a baby
I'm gonna name it after Ralph Stanley

Kasey Chambers,"I've been acting, high and mighty
It's just the liar here inside me
It's complicated but so sincere
I'm saturated from living in here

I never wanted anything but a record and a band
I never wanted anything I didn't understand

I should've known better
I should've broke free
I should've known better
There ain't no guarantees

It shattered slowly
It's broken through
I should've known better 
Than to let myself fall for you

I've been paying less attention
It's hard to have the best intention
It's complicated but so sincere
I'm saturated from living in here

I never wanted anything but a house to call a home
I never wanted anything but to never be alone.",Saturated,2004
Kasey Chambers,"I'm a little bit stronger,
I'm a little bit wiser,
It's a little bit clearer in my mind.
I can shout a bit louder,
I can feel a bit prouder,
But nothing makes sense to me this time.

I'm a little bit older,
I'm a little bit surer,
I can fight a bit harder against the tide.
I can make it sound better,
Much better than sadder,
But nothing makes sense to me this time.

[Chorus:]

I thought it was good, I thought it was fine,
I thought it was just a matter of time,
The sun would shine.
I held my breath, I covered my eyes,
Thought I was just clearing the skies,
The sun would shine.

I'm a little bit braver,
I'm a little bit wilder,
I can stand a bit closer to the light.
I can stand a bit taller,
Like I wouldn't fall over,
But nothing makes sense to me this time.

I thought it was good, I thought it was fine,
I thought it was just a matter of time,
The sun would shine.
I held my breath, I covered my eyes,
Thought I was just clearing the skies,
The sun would shine.

If my collar fades to white
Should I hold my head up high

I thought it was good, I thought it was fine,
I thought it was just a matter of time,
The sun would shine.
I held my breath, I covered my eyes,
Thought I was just clearing the skies,
The sun would shine.
I thought it was good, I thought it was fine,
I thought it was just a matter of time,
The sun would shine.
I held my breath, I covered my eyes,
Thought I was just clearing the skies,
The sun would shine.",Stronger,2004
Kasey Chambers,"Well I am a wayward angel
I don't suffer I don't cry
And late in the night your sleeping
I come to hover by your side
So close your weary weathered eyes
These tears are just a faint disguise
Cause I am a wayward angel
I don't suffer, I don't cry

Cold in the heart of winter
Make your shiver make you blue
I'm stay close by your window
Give your blankets to hold on to
So sleep my baby for a while
You'll wake with the light of a mothers smile
Cause I am a wayward angel
I don't suffer I don't cry

I am a wayward angel
I feel no sorrow
I'll always carry you home
I'll bring salvation
Before tomorrow
I'll be wherever you go

Break like a first time heartache
Leaves you weaker leaves you tears
Hold my hand much tighter
I will walk you through these years
So close your weary weathered eyes
You'll wake with the light of a mothers smile

Cause I am a wayward angel
I don't suffer I don't cry",Wayward Angel,2004

Kasey Chambers,"Somewhere deep inside
Something's got a hold on you
And it's pushing me aside
See it stretch on forever
I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

Stripping back the coats
Of lies and deception
Back to nothingness
Like a week in the desert

I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

So don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause when you get back home maybe I'll be gone

It would 'cause me pain
If we were to end it
But I could start again
You can depend on it

I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon",Better Be Home Soon,2005
Kasey Chambers,"I live in a circle
Runnin' around and around and around and around
Walk over the wire
Pullin' me down and me down and me down and me down
Sink under the water
Fadin' away and away and away and away
Crash into the wall if
Only you stayed if you stayed if you stayed if you stayed
Hey Hey Hey
If only you stayed
Hey Hey Hey

[Chorus]
It could a been the color of a carnival
It could a been the light in the dark
It could a been the blaze of glory
That keeps us all from falling apart
It could a been better
It could a been bigger
Everything that I need
It coulda been me

I stand in the corner
Callin' your name and your name and your name and your name
Try tellin' myself
I was never to blame and to blame and to blame and to blame
Fall down to my knees
I'm slippin' away and away and away and away
Break under the strain if
Only you stayed and you stayed and you stayed and you stayed
Hey Hey Hey
If only you stayed
Hey Hey Hey

Kasey Chambers,"Break break away from everything
Cut cut it up and start again
Know know there's nothin' in between
But anyway
How much did it ever really mean

I I was the keeper of the score
Blind blind and broken on the floor
You You were the solider in this war
But anyway
Was it it me that you were really looking for

[Chorus]
I am ashes
I am wreckage
I am careless
I am breaking
You are fearless
You're the Saviour
We are dangerous
No more

Made made a mess of everything
Prayed prayed that it would never end
I I'm not angry bout a thing
But anyway
How much longer can you keep it in

Show show a side I'd never seen
Go go somewhere you're never been
Reach reach for something in between
But anyway
How much did it ever really mean

Kasey Chambers,"Sink or you can swim
But you can't change it now your fallin' in
So drift or you can fly
Just don't waste it all on
Reasons why, you break when you can mend
It's not that easy turnin' round again
I know it's hard to hear
But after all that's said and done it will disappear

[Chorus]
Don't look so sad
It's not that bad you know
I won't let go no
Don't look so sad, you know to go down easy is the hardest way to go

Laugh or you can cry
But know a million tears will always dry (so)
Face what you can't hide
You know it's waiting on the other side
So crash, and you can burn
You know there's always something there to learn
In time it goes away
But after all that's said and done it'll be ok

[Chorus]

It's all the same I know
When everything is sinking in
But, one day you'll wake to find it's
Best to leave it all behind
You're at the end so start again

It's the hardest way to go",Don't Look So Sad,2006
Kasey Chambers,"There's a fire on the mountain
There's a fire in my soul
There's a sign on the highway
It's a hard road

There's a break in a heart
There's a break in a bone
There's a ghost in the dark

There's blood in the kitchen
In the shape of a sin
There's a ship in the water
But it ain't coming in
There's a fall of an angel
At the end of the show
But who's gonna save my soul

There's a heavy jacket
There's a heavy load
There's a weight on my shoulders
It's a hard road

There's a broken bottle

Gotta get dragging this bag of stones

Held my ground and my heat, on the strength of the street

Kashmir,"Sometimes the girl is here 
With her indigo eyes 
And her brand new gear 
She won't stay for long 
And she has to walk straight home 
Patience, time comes, she says 
Kiss me but don't you tell 
This is over as soon as this fire burns through 

She's on the ocean 
He's in the sand 
She's stuck in motion 
He is sliding gently off her hand 

Springtime and turmoil 
She pours white wine 
And gets herself lost 
She falls over 
And disappears into the meadows 
Wayward and high strung 
She is lovesick and ever so strong 
Then it's over like none of it ever was real

In which we fling our worries 
And grasp for somebody's promise 
Of the good life 
Forever changing plans 
Restrained by envious spirits 
And wanting to want to give in 
And go for the country 
My love will always be 
Of vibrant and dense traffic music 
That fills me up when nothing is expected 

The push 
And the shock 
The handshake that could be changing your direction 
The mess 
And the chaos 
The sounds of someone close to falling apart 

Don't wake me from the dream 
Don't shake me from the notion 
That the day will come 
And I'll belong and not be lost 
So far away from hell 
From unpaid debts and world war 
Where my bare feet are walking on dew 
Without treading a needle 
On a needle

And the fall

Beaming through the glass.

And some so-called friends put me down
And they pity me for trying
Bad emotions push me around
But the vision shines on and on

It will shine when we all are gone
And I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here
Light it up - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about bad feelings and be a real man

Some men's world is only hate and money
Afraid of everything and they laugh at nothing
And they only live to criticize
You can laugh at me now [ha ha ha]

But the time comes to everybody
When you must decide
When that day finally comes along
You might wish you'd been a little more strong

Then you'll wake up in the morning cryin'
""Oh my God""
There it is - way down inside me
It's a real man

You got to grow up sometime
Be a real man
Suffer them slings and arrows
Be a real man

Now be a real man
Don't sell yourself for nothing
Be a real man
Don't take no crap from no one

Be a real man
Get your trip together
Be a real man",Real Man,1978
Kasim Sulton,"Some people tell me that love is a feeling
Or a possession
Somehow it seems so cold
And when they say love is sweet,

Does it mean that you eat it?
Maybe you drink it,
Does it fill up an empty hole?
I'm lookin' for a love and I may not find it

You know it doesn't mean a thing
Without some action behind it
Please come home
I can hear them calling

Please come home
Please don't leave us all alone
Your mama and your papa are crying all alone
You better let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice

'Til we get the true version of
The meaning of the verb 'To Love'
What does it mean to love?
And when somebody needs love,

Do they spend some money?
Say something funny,
Ask for some tenderness?
And when you want to touch of love,

Do you lie on your back?
Stand on your head,
How do you feel it best?
I'm looking for a love with no strings attached

To take me like I am, that's the only catch
Please come home
I can hear them calling
Please come home

Please don't leave us all alone
Your wife and your lover are crying all alone
You better let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice
'Til we learn the true version of

The meaning of the verb 'To Love'
Does it mean any more,
The more you talk about it
Is it anymore real

If you jump around and shout it
I'm sick and tired of hearing
'bout everyone without it and
Too much talkin' sends me walkin'

Night is falling and everybody's calling for love
Everybody's lookin' for their one and only
It's only just a game 'cause they're scared to be lonely
Please come home

I can hear them calling
Please come home
Please don't leave us all alone
Your brothers and your sisters are crying all alone

You got let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice
'Til we get the true version of
The meaning of the verb 'To Love'
What does it mean to love?","The Verb ""To Love""",1978

We invite you to, something epic y'all know?
Well we hustle out of a sense of, hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we 'come addicted
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to serving
But we feel we have nothing to lose
So we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watching every nigga watching me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see, from selling 'caine
Til brains was fried to a fricassee, can't lie
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar
Getting my thug on properly, my squad and me
Lack of respect for authority, laughing hard
Happy to be escaping poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation
For dips, four percent pertation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more, Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, grateful dim the light
Channel 7 news, round seven jewels, hand getting the mic
Forgetting all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure
Lock my body can't trap my mind, easily
Explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speaking in codes since I sense you peeking
The INXS rental, don't be fooled my game is mental
We both out of town dog, what you trying to get into?
Viva, Las Vegas, see ya, later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no fraud Willie's present gambling they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sipping margaritas
Yeah, can I live?
Can I live?

My mind is infested, with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity, my crew and me
Commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it in tangible goods
Platinum Rolexed it, we don't lease
We buy the whole care, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation, EXPLODE
On detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it balls to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it, even righteous minds go through this
True this, history school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and, watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous, dreams of
Getting cream let's do this, against T-D-S
So I keep one eye open like, C-B-S, ya see me
Stressed right?  Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?

We invite you to, something epic y'all know?
Well we hustle out of a sense of, hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we 'come addicted
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to serving
But we feel we have nothing to lose
So we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watching every nigga watching me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see, from selling 'caine
Til brains was fried to a fricassee, can't lie
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar
Getting my thug on properly, my squad and me
Lack of respect for authority, laughing hard
Happy to be escaping poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation
For dips, four percent pertation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more, Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, grateful dim the light
Channel 7 news, round seven jewels, hand getting the mic
Forgetting all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure
Lock my body can't trap my mind, easily
Explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speaking in codes since I sense you peeking
The INXS rental, don't be fooled my game is mental
We both out of town dog, what you trying to get into?
Viva, Las Vegas, see ya, later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no fraud Willie's present gambling they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sipping margaritas
Yeah, can I live?
Can I live?

My mind is infested, with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity, my crew and me
Commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it in tangible goods
Platinum Rolexed it, we don't lease
We buy the whole care, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation, EXPLODE
On detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it balls to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it, even righteous minds go through this
True this, history school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and, watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous, dreams of
Getting cream let's do this, against T-D-S
So I keep one eye open like, C-B-S, ya see me
Stressed right?  Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?

You know I like 'em when they're nasty
Uh huh uh huh uh huh 

All I ever wanted was a nasty girl 
To make a nigga hot and scream ""Don't stop!"" when you hit the spot 
Ain't a treat wit me 'cause you see me with the Lock 
Ain't gon' leave with me 'cause you see me in the drop 
Ooh I like that when it takes some game 
Justa get your name don't you see my chain? 
Got a lotta ice and she like ""Yeah that's nice 
You Kasino right?"", and I say ""Yeah that's right"" 
""That was you that I seen on TV last night"" 
I say ""Yeah"", she said ""I'm sorry, you ain't my type"" 
I want a chick I could holla at, throw a dollar at 
If she want to come chilly, tell her holla back 
Got the Ac fo' in the lot, tell her follow that 
Back to the room, checkout time ain't til noon 
""But I just met you"" but it ain't too soon 
Let's play house, you be the wife, I could be the ??? 

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was a nasty girl 
Someone who can go with the flow with the lights down low, oh 
But she can't be easy, sleasy 
Got to be based with freaky freaky 

Excuse me Miss, you never heard me say I was rich 
I just talk like this and walk like this 
All I ever wanted was a nasty chick 
Who gonna strip when I say so, skip when I say go 
Creep when I say no, uhh uhh I ain't think so 
Party just beginnin', I'm thinkin' 'bout it in us 
As I don't drink or smoke, I'm thinkin' 'bout women 
In back of the truck, wit her legs up (That's right) 
Sittin on 20's and she don't want money 
She knows I'm a freak so she brung a friend for me 
From around-the-way girls to a Playboy bunny 
Use to be too thin to win but now I'm chubby 
Just like a teddy bear, all the girls love me 
Want to play wit me, hopin', can't hit me 
If I got enough money maybe she could stay wit me 

[Chorus]

Tell me the truth, are you waitin' after the show? 
'cause you after my doe and an asskissin' no 
Let me know, do you want cash from the doe? 
Is it sex or pay check you askin' me fo'? 
Pretty chick, don't you think that I'm serious? 
I heard a lot about you, ain't you curious? 
How you, shake your hips and you, lick your lips 
Would you, give me a kiss if I give you my chips? 
Ain't that type of girl, let me save you a trip 
What if I was broke, all that I could give you is dick 
I need a girl that's gon' still be, bout it bout it 
No doubt about it, can't live without it 
Sex me in the SC, so well 
She need to ask me how she played, no replay 
Playmate of the month, all she need is a pimp 
I'm like the nastiest nigga since Larry Flynt

Give me a year, I turned this block into the Carter for ya
Started off small, ended up larger than them
Prayed to me, and sayin ""Our Father"" for them

With God trustin, money lustin
I'm nasty with the hands but with the guns I'm disgustin

Rarely, heavily armed, ghetto-created Don
They wan' take it to the streets, we do it like Vietnam
We express thoughts with less talk but more action
Soon platinum reaction with full metal jacket rappin
I make it happen, you the jokers, we the last laughin
You want to scream too, Wes Craven for all my people
Give you nightmares, roy-al lyrically lethal
Tape projections if you fiend for perfection
Excite rap addicts wathcin doe's go at it
This analogy's for savages living in drug palaces
If money got you misled, follow the realest
Face we fill, Vacant Lot, built from the rock up

Raise up lyrically, yo I blast mines

From the heart comes every word spoken
Slip and you sleep with the box left open
Body full of fluid that'll keep your flesh fresh
til they put you in the ground where you rot like the rest
I done had the best, tried to hit me but they missed
If you get the thought (thought.....) think about the risk
'cause I could be the calmest motherfucker you know, or be warned
Have you seen a hurricane em like the eye of the storm?
When my guns are drawn, you're not able to flee
'cause when your lungs are gone you're unable to breathe
I know you hear me, nigga do you feel my words?
This shit is eagle, spit the talons that'll shred your nerves
Round 1 shatters your spine, leavin' you numb
Round 2 splatters your mind, this leavin' you dumb

Clear as your shadow left behind

Like you'd grown up
Taught from dusk
Till after summer

Attention please, attention please
Can I have everybody's attention please
So humorous, we laugh at all ay'all 
The alliance has now been officially formed
Ruff Ryder, Flipmode, 2000, it's now official baby
It's another headbanger

[Swizz Beats:]
Swizz Beats, who hits on your streets every six weeks
I be on the MP so much that my wrist's weak
Ain't shit sweet, pile 'em in here
All my thugs in the clubs start wildin' in here
Now put your bottles in the air, then light your dutches		
Me and Busta keep it tight like liposucion
Niggas that don't like me get the knife for frontin'
Cause one night in the club gets your life on crutches
You got that whodie, I'll cock that forty
Flyin' in the 5 with the top back on it 			
Stop that shorty, I know you love me
Probably sample one of my beats then owe me money
Plus you don't know me money, so stop the rumors
Before you need the janitors to come mop the room up
Ryde or Die Volume two, smash the charts
Now put your hands in the air for the black Mozart, OH!

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Ohhhh), Now come on
(Screeeam), Jump baby come on
Get your hands up, (What!), now all my ladies do it
Get your hands up, (What!)
Now let me walk you through it
(Ohhhh), Now come on
(Screeeam), Jump baby come on
Get your hands up, (What!), now all my ladies do it
Get your hands up, (What!)
Now let me walk you through it

why'all niggas try to front, I'll send my crew on a hunt
Bunch of scheming ass niggas smoking gats and blunts
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode represent
For the Ruff Ryder, and my nigga Swizz
And we gonna be here to present
why'all niggas with some other shit to bang in the street
And block the fuck out, bang the fuckin' floor with your feet
Before we bang why'all niggas all with the heat
Feed why'all niggas more gutters like a mutherfuckin' all you can eat
And make you bounce how poncho will play the congo
And bang on the bongo, free to bounce on the bongo
From New York to Colorado, so just follow
I'm living for today and livin' tomorrow
Open up your mouth, I got somethin' big for you to swallow
Blow you through the chest with a hollow
Like the foul shit you waste and transpired right infront the impalo 
Yo, the general Busta Busta shock and memorable 				
You know we precious like minerals, and deadly like burials

[Chorus]
[Swizz Beats:]
Listen, Flipmode and Ruff Ryders bang out hits
S-W-I two Z's bang out clips 
Bang out chicks, for fun we bang out whips 
why'all go to war with revolvers that bang out flicks 
Now find me on two-fifth in the summer when it starts			
And iced up, nice cut, new pair of Jordans
Thinkin' of extortin, nigga your life ain't important 
Your camp hotter than ours?, the fuck why'all snortin'
My thugs bang out bricks, swing, mix, throw dem grams 
Hash smokers, hopin' more and out of soda cans		
(Yo Swizz, I heard you stole), Whoa! listen man
Mindin' my business will make you a missin' man
See the wrist and hand?, got plaques on the wall
And a fifth in hand, I'll put your back on the wall
Nigga don't ask me no more about nuttin' you hear
Just scream and shout and just wild in here

Stand Nachts auf der Brücke der Seen
Sie hatte Ihr liebstes verloren
Wie sollte ihr Herz das versteh'n
Da brach eine Frau aus dem Dunkel
Die Nacht war auf einmal so hell
Geh hin zu den heiligen Wassern
Wo auch heute noch Wunder gescheh'n
Wenn Menschen einander verlassen
Wird Maria die Tränen versteh'n
Sie kennt jeden Schmerz dieser Erde
Und sie kennt deinen Kummer dein Leid
Und Wunder an heiligen Wassern
Ja das gibt es auch noch heut

Sie hörte ganz leis eine Stimme
Du gehst diesen Weg nicht allein
Du siehst auch die Tränen der andern
Das macht deinen Kummer ganz klein
Dein Glaube er wird dich begleiten
Er führt dich heraus aus der Nacht

Que quiero libertad 
Aun que termine en soledad

We want the fame
C'mon (C'mon) 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to G's 
Stresses after battle with success comes greed (echo) 
They got me hot When they shot me 
Plotted my revenge 
To increase my ends 
Enemies gettin' dropped 
Win or lose 
Red or blue 
We must all stay true 
Play the game nigga 
Never let the game play you 
And for the fame 
Niggas change fast 
That's a shame 
What's the game 
Lost souls 
Who controls our brain? 
Who can I blame? 
The world seems strange at times 
Somewhat insane 
I'm hoping we can change with time 
I'm living blinded 
Searching for refinement 
Curse, I know death follows me 
But I murder him first 
And worse yet 
With each breathe 
Steps I take 
Breathless 
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 
Cigar ashes 
Coaster 
Crystal glasses 
We mash on them jealous bastards 
With a ski mask 
I'm the first one to warn them 
Blast it 
Wrapped in plastic 
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws) 
Ain't nothing left now 
Treated like a stepchild 
Was not for me 
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck 'em all) 
Be rocking beats 
Fake in fame 

Block run and shoot slugs 
We throw them back like hardballs 
Without the gloves 
No love for these fake desperados 
And thugs I bleed to envy 
Smoke and blow out they blunts 
Sipping Henney 
Drunk nights 
And hot days 
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways 
A wife on the run 
Full of common blunts 
Unconditionally married 
To my gun 
Fulfillin' my destiny 
On knees 
And ones desires 
Be pulling all my cabbage like priors 
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher 
Fortune and fame 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

Searching for fortune and fame 
Lost in the rain 
A lose of the game 
With life the cost of the game 
We forcing the change 
Mother fuck flossing the chain  
All the blame 
Belongs to the part of the brain (
That we never use nigga 
Plus my heart is in pain 
And if I ever lose homey 
Bet I'm at it again 
Outlaws don't die 
So united we stand 
And if family come before 
All the fortune and fame 
 
As I walk up in the crib 
Laid to rest my head 
Say some rhymes to angels 
Hope they bless my bed 
Hope they bless me the righteous way 
Got a homie locked down 
Outta town 
I sent him a kite today 
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog 
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog 
I was passed down the street fame 
Like glock clocked and keep aim 
Was raised up with a clock box 
And I ran with the local street gang 
They say the light is faded 
But still shine in the dark 
You can easy been a man 
But you is a boy in your heart 
And that's some game that I got 
From generation of game 
In the road of life dog 
We need to switch up lanes 
Think about it 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

I can't complain 
I've seen my fair share of the fame 
It won't change me 
Now I've got this piece of change 
I feel strange I got so used to the hood 
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good 
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery 
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me 
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself 
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help 
I pray for my health my mind and my family too 
State of myself my grind and my family crew 
Where one hand watches the other 
No we ain't blood 
But we still real brothers 
The struggle is real 
Nothing can steal 
What we build 
And that remains the same 
'Till that day we killed 
And that's real 
Life that I was aimed to be 
Love by my family tree 
That's fame to me 
How about it 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain

Kastro,"Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery
Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop, I wanna help
But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin' Earl
Since my stomach was empty, it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose, they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more 'cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace, if you can't grant it
Niggas fightin 'cross the whole planet, so it could never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there could never be peace

Somebody owes me, will they control me? Not
I ain't a hater player but I want all you got
Y'all babies had babies now we fightin' each other
My dawgs got rabies, they bitin' each other
And it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin'
And I gotta be blind, missed sign after sign
Time after time, after time, after time
And I don't like nobody, they don't like me more
And I'm good with that finally but it heard it before
Dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion
On Thanksgiving, we thankful, just for livin' in hell
Damn, homey, I don't mean to be harsh
But there's a devil in the ghetto tryin' to tear it apart
And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace? Just a piece of my heart, never

The only peace, we got, is the peace of our heart
Peace of our mind, or that damn piece
That we hold in our waistline
You feel me, dawg? C'mon, uh

So will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace, never
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there'll never be peace

Thangs is changin', nigga you better read the signs
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
We all believe God's new plan to make it out of this
Niggas spendin' too much time hatin' on each other
Niggas buyin' guns, loadin' 'em up, aimin' at each other
And the victim is you and me, it's sick but it's true indeed
The good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly
Deep in me, there's a part that wants nothin' but love
But the rest of me know, war is what's waitin' for us
So I stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck
Asking God to point out the impostor
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
'Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it
Soldiers dyin' for it and in the ghetto
They cryin' for it, but fuck peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool, there'll never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace?

Shit, fuck peace
On the strength 'til my niggas get a piece, we can't have peace
How the fuck we gon' live happy when we ain't got nuttin'?
You muh'fuckers are smilin' but I'm mean muggin'
Why, 'cause I gotta be thuggin'

It seems drugs done turned this whole motherfuckin' hood out
All us niggas actin' up, wild-ass, motherfuckin' adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood?
And you at the funeral every muh'fuckin' weekend?
Pssh, and you muh'fuckers talkin' about peace
Nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin' peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker? You ain't heard?
Lil' babies gettin' smoked, muh'fuckers killin' they whole family
Lil' kids gettin' thrown off buildings, muh'fuckers gettin' abused
Peace? Nigga is you out your fuckin' mind?
Fuck peace, we can't never have peace

Will I love her or shall I diss her?

Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree

Drop some conversation sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas they want to see me rise
'97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case ], lord knows how they hate me
Got a playa in the court room please don't let them frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
Count my blessings don't stress in this land with no love
Maybe if they see me rolling look at all this green I'm holding
I guess that's why the envious get their eye swollen
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut

Runnin' up, Gun c***ed like nasty gloves

So I'm in charge of rolling dutches
And we getting so high

And we go for early brunches
That turn into late lunches
And we ain't got a label
We just rolling with the punches
I make fun of your belly
And tell you to do some crunches
And you say well yea your ass jiggles
Go do some lunges

Am I in a maze
With me knees to the ground, head facing down to pray
While I'm a thousand miles away

Watch my gown

Don't let me drown

Aquí tienes tu bebida
Henny puro y un Tequila
Pronto sale la comida
Gotta go and get it

No soy mal agradecida

De lo que es destino pida
Muchas luces y cámaras
Siempre piensan que yo soy diva

Hago que todos me sigan

Was the day that you let me go
(It was a blessing in disguise)
Now I see that I'm beautiful
Cause all we ever did was fight
We were so dysfunctional
Now I forgotten all the times
And all the days that I was loving you.

Just like a ghost from my past (he's come back to haunt me)
Saying that you want me back (but that's impossible so)

[Chorus]
If you love me, leave me
Love me, leave me
'cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before
If I only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
(if you love me leave me)
If you love me leave me alone

Now there used to be a time

(I would've taken you back again)
(Now I got you out of my mind)
Now I'm totally independent
So you can save your little lies
'cause I know what's happenin'
You're missin' me but say goodbye now
To all the days I was lovin' you

Just like a ghost from my past (he's come back to haunt me)
Saying that you want me back (but that's impossible so)

Than you should go
'cause I promised myself
I'd make it alone
At the back of the shelf
'cause where I put what we had
I'll never going back, no

As tears come down.

Shedding his demise.

I can live without,

In heaven's frown.

And I just can't take a single step without you
Baby, to you I'll always be a faithful lover
'Cause my heart can't make a single beat without you

You make me fly, you get me high
You turn my world to such a better place
Your crazy touch, the sweetest rush

Around a pack of little on a leash.

We open in Venice, we next play Verona, then on to Cremona,
Lots of laughs in Cremona, eh boys, our next jump in Parma, that dopy mopie menace,
And Mantua and Padua, and then we open again. where?

With the neighbors still complaining 'bout the heat

""I feel love with people who tell you where to go
I don't know why the revelations bore me
I know I wont go outside

I don't know where I'm the prayer that is this city can seals) 
I know by the eyes
But Charly don't you staying in this world
You lay down in the hallway it was so white
Like a slow dance with a carpet cheek to cheek
And descenting with her view to to you
Higher Ground with people who tell you where to go
I don't know why they clutch their faiths
Their only defense against the void

I've been here before and I'm locking the door
And I'm not going back again
Her eyes and arms and skin won't make it go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone
Go on believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone
Go on believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
Yes I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you

Weak, frail and broken
Wasting away before
My very eyes

I told you never to say
The things you kept within
The brothers in honor
This is forever

(I promise disloyalty to you)
We are soldiers of war
Lost in inside betrayal
(I sacrificed myself for you)
With the rise of kings and tyrants

There is no glory
There is no trusting hand
I will defend you till the very end
Even if my hands spill blood in heaven
(Heaven)

Your higher place through the skies
Wretched smell of death, demise
Lost an eye for the sinner's death
Desperate souls, they never get back

Everything means nothing
When you lose the things that matter
Fading away
The dreams of tomorrow

Calling the words of survival
Calling the course of reprisal
Mothers and fathers
Sons or brothers

(I promise disloyalty to you)
We are soldiers of war
Lost in inside betrayal
(I sacrificed myself for you)
With the rise of kings and tyrants

There is no trusting hand

I know you want it, always earn your merit
You've reached the edge, broke down the pledge

Time after time I've challenged myself
My soul heavy with regret
Eclipsed by the things I dread
Witnessed by the skins I shed

No one wants war, no one wants war
But I'll take you there with one dead stare

No room to move, can't feel nothing
Sentenced to die, break free with me

Breathe, breathe to dominate
Fearless strike to un-create
Breathe, breathe to dominate
Power feeds to annihilate

Breathe, breathe to dominate
Fearless strike to un-create
Breathe, breathe to dominate
Power feeds to annihilate

And I stand here in redemption
For all the things that bring salvation
Battered souls for resurrection

One step closer to strike the deceiver
Sometimes I wonder
Nothing in this world can kill this hunger
I'll satisfy, intensify this thirst that grows inside
Determined, determined, my will to rise

Time after time I've challenged myself
My soul heavy with regret
Eclipsed by the things I dread
Witnessed by the skins I shed

No one wants war, no one wants war

Like leafs fall from a trees, natural progression

Suffer inside, everyday living a lie
Cleansed by those feelings you try to deny

Everything comes falling
Like tears flow from a soul full of sorrow
Everything comes falling
Like blood drips from a bruised aching heart

Fly to the bludgeon sky
Look at terror's eyes, embrace the full aura
That will consume your everything
Abandon your destiny to reach uncertainty
With nothing left to see you'll fade away

Gone are all the feelings
That battle has just begun
Die before I fall
My kingdom stands tall

Bleed my fatal blade
The rupture has just commenced
Die before I fall

One life, one time

",I Know a Place,
Katarzyna Laska,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day

Katatonia,"Dancing through the silent waves
The shimmering moonlight
Over lost angels remains
Whispering through gloomy halls
Beneath the gentle soft caress
Of dreaming shadows
Flowing steams of silver
Through tidal torrents of grief
Time was never there for us
The final tide took the last ones away
Buried visions - of sunrise
Beneath the seas - of torrid soil
Slowly sinking - in the mire
Shades of - emerald fields
Our eyes can't stand the flames
Single sparkles hiding in our palms
They linger before dying away
Fading from out sigh
Loathsome are the ways of those
Who the meadows shall receive
For every glimpse of daylight must vanish
And every soul submit to tide

Afraid of hell

But you didn't really notice
That I've left and gone
Away

And the trees grow high in New York state
And they shine like gold in the autumn
Never had the blues from whence I came
But in New York state, I got 'em

Closing my eyes I hear the sea
Must I wait, must I follow
Won't you say come with me

And it's on to south bend, Indiana
Flat out on the western plain
Rise up over the rockies and down on into California
Out to where but the rocks again

And let the sun set on the ocean
I will watch it from the shore
Let the sun rise over the redwoods
I'll rise with it till I rise no more

With curly hair while mine was straight
And I was much to small

While you stayed out all night

I dreamt that someone had come and taken you

To me

""Mama, the small hand's at eight
Get up or I'll be late
Please fix me something sweet and good
To eat now

For that bell in the yard won't wait
And neither does time""

Kate & Anna McGarrigle,"Just a little atom of chlorine
Valence minus one
Swimming through the sea, digging the scene
Just having fun
She's not worried about the shape or size
Of her outside shell
It's fun to ionize
Just a little atom of cl
With an unfilled shell

But somewhere in that sea lurks
Handsome sodium
With enough electrons on his outside shell
Plus that extra one
Somewhere in this deep blue sea 
There's a negative
For my extra energy yes
Somewhere in this foam
My positive will find a home

Then unsuspecting chlorine
Felt a magnetic pull
She looked down and her outside
Shell was full
Sodium cried ""what a gas be my bride and
I'll change your name from chlorine to chloride""

Now the sea evaporates to make the clouds
For the rain and snow
Leaving her chemical compounds in the absence
Of H2O
But the crystals that wash upon the shore
Are happy ones

Think of the love that you eat
When you salt your meat

There's been too much pressure in the border
And I need to calm down
Just to breathe here, oxygen in and out
There's been too much poison in the system
Festering toxins I am in round

Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air

We expire, but we got a life to live
And just lay, lay where we only forget
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are

Feel all, stop and slowly shock, to know
When we're to give, start the engine
To see the remiss, the homing sound

Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
Got to get this out, out of my head

Our heart's were young and free

I left her there and on that night

I though she was two-timing me



On a lonesome night so far from home

I heard a mournful sound

The girl I love is calling me

She thinks I turned her down



She begged me not to leave her there

She swore that she'd been true

But a jealous heart cannot believe

   Round each other we will twine

Now I've hurt you and it hurts me 
Just to see what we can do
To ourselves and to each other 
Without really meaning to

And we'll learn to sing together
Sing and laugh the whole night long

And the angels beckon to me
Before I go dear sisters and brothers

   Sing those hymns we sang together
   In that plain little church with the benches all worn
   How dear to my heart how precious the moments
   We stood shaking hands and singing a song

My burden is heavy my way has grown weary
I have traveled a road that is long
And it would warm this old heart my dear brother
If you come and sing me one song

In my home beyond the dark river

Until we meet where there's no more sad parting
Won't you come and sing for me

But nothing can make us forget when we kissed and how it made us feel)

The time was in the telling on the bank the scene was set
The sky was rolling blindly on, the daylight had not gone
She washed her hair among the stones and saw what was to come
All this will pass
There will be blood among the corn and heroes in the hills
But there is more to come my boy before you've had your fill
Men will come and rape the soil as though it were their own
And they will bathe their feet in oil as I have bathed my own

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

Stones will stand together as if searching for the stars
And all come crashing down again before they reach too far
She turned to face the setting sun, I turned to walk away
But then she called my name again and beckoned me to stay

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

She told me of the famous sons who write their names in peace
Yet be cut down before the time has come for our release
Just as I tell you here
Even now I wait for the coming day
Even now she waits in the dawn
For the tales she tells, for the gifts that she will sell
For the sight she knows, for a vision that still grows
With the dream in her eyes no one's seen

I listened for so long that day that I can hardly tell
If what she said was heaven sent or brought to bear in hell
That men of hope would stand alone and still be cast a lie
Just as Romans cast them on the day they were to die

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

Even now I wait for the coming day

Kate Bush,"She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do
A pseudonym to fool him 
She couldn't have made a worse move

She sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange delight 
Just like his wife 
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter

All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya! 
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya!

She wanted to take it further
So she arranged a place to go 
To see if he 
Would fall for her incognito 
And when he laid eyes on her 
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she 
Reminds him of his little lady 
Capacity to give him all he needs 
Just like his wife before she freezed on him
Just like his wife when she was beautiful
He shouted out, I'm

Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red

They say the storm will be coming back
Maybe you'll be coming back 'Cause I'm still waiting

Kate Bush,"Pray God you can cope
I stand outside this woman's work
This woman's world
Ooh, it's hard on the man
Now his part is over
Now starts the craft of the father

I know you've got a lot of strength left
I know you've got a little life in you yet
I know you've got a lot of strength left

I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking

That I never said

We look to the left and to the right.
We need help but nobody's in sight.
Where is the man that we all need?
Well tell him he's to come, and rescue me.

Do do 'n do do 'n do dow,
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow.

Move 'em out.

Kate Bush,"It lay buried here, it lay deep inside me 
It's so deep I don't think that I can speak about it
It could take me all of my life
But it would only take a moment to 

Tell you what I'm feeling
But I don't know if I'm ready yet 
You come walking into this room 
Like you're walking into my arms 
What would I do without you? 

Take away the love and the anger 
And a little piece of hope holding us together
Looking for a moment that'll never happen
Living in the gap between past and future
Take away the stone and the timber
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together

If you can't tell your sister
If you can't tell a priest
'Cause it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it 
To anyone
And you tell it to your heart? 
Can you find it in your heart 

To let go of these feelings 
Like a bell to a Southerly wind? 
We could be like two strings beating
Speaking in sympathy
What would we do without you? 

Two strings speak in sympathy

Take away the love and the anger
And a little piece of hope holding us together
Looking for a moment that'll never happen
Living in the gap between past and future 
Take away the stone and the timber
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together
We're building a house of the future together
(What would we do without you?) 

Well, if it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it
Just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future
Well, if it's so deep you don't think you can speak about it
Don't ever think that you can't change the past and the future

You might not, not think so now
But just you wait and see, someone will come to help you",Love and Anger [Single Mix],1990
Kate Bush,"We were working secretly for the military
Our experiment in sound was nearly ready to begin
We only know in theory what we are doing
Music made for pleasure, music made to thrill

It was music we were making here until
They told us all they wanted
Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red
It's a mistake in the making

From the painful cries of mothers to a terrifying scream
We recorded it and put it into our machine

They told us all they wanted
Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red
It's a mistake in the making
 
It could feel like falling in love
It could feel so bad
It could feel so good
It could sing you to sleep

But that dream is your enemy
We won't be there to be blamed
We won't be there to snitch
I just pray that someone there can hit the switch

They told us all they wanted
Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red
It's a mistake in the making

And the public are warned to stay off","Experiment IV (12"" Mix)",1990
Kate Bush,"The first time I died 
Was in the arms of good friends of mine. 
They kiss me with tears. 
They hadn't been near me for years. 
Say, why do it now 
When I won't be around, I'm going out?

""We needed you 
To love us too. 
We wait for your move.""

Only tragedy allows the release 
Of love and grief never normally seen. 
I didn't want to let them see me weep, 
I didn't want to let them see me weak, 
But I know I have shown 
That I stand at the gates alone.

""I needed you 
To love me too. 
I wait for your move.""

All the love, all the love, 
All the love we should have given. 
All the love, all the love, 
All the love you could have given. 
All the love, all the love, 
All the love
(""Run for the hills"")

The next time I dedicate 
My life's work to the friends I make, 
I give them what they want to hear. 
They think I'm up to something weird 
And up rears the head of fear in me. 
So now when they ring 
I get my machine to let them in.

""I needed you 
To love me too. 
I wait for your move.""

All the love, all the love, 
All the love you should have given. 
All the love, all the love, 
All the love we could have given. 
All the love, all the love, 
All the love

Kate Bush,"Just look at your father
And you'll see how you took after him.
Me, I'm just another
Like my brothers
Of my mother's genes.

All they ever want for you
Are the things they didn't do.
All they ever wanted, a little clue.
All they ever wanted, the truth.
All they ever wanted, a little bit of you.
All they ever wanted,
But they never did get.

The whims that we're weeping for
Our parents would be beaten for
Leave the breast
And then the rest
And then regret you ever left.

All we're ever looking for
Is another open door.

All we ever look for, another womb.
All we ever look for, our own tomb.
All we ever look for, ooh, la lune.
All we ever look for, a little bit of you, too.
All we ever look for,
But we never do score.

All we ever look for, a god.
All we ever look for, oh, a drug.
All we ever look for, a great big hug.
All we ever look for, a little bit of you.
All we ever look for, a little bit of you, too.
All we ever look for,
But we never do score.",All We Ever Look For,1990
Kate Bush,"With her hand in his hand
They were both happy again
You started taking sides
They started arguing
He said it was her fault
She said it wasn't at all
But the truth lies somewhere in the middle
Where angels fear to tread you go rushing in

Well I had to tell you then
And now I'm telling you again
Stay out of this
You must not interfere
Don't you see this is
Between a man and a woman?

Every day and night I pray
And pray that you will stay away forever
It's so hard for love to stay together
With the modern Western pressures
I don't want to say it
But I had to tell you then

And now I'm telling you again
Stay out of this
Oh, I know you mean to help me
And I know you've good intentions
But stay out of this
This isn't your problem
Do not interfere, you are not needed here

Let the pendulum swing
Between a man and a woman
Don't you see you're in the way
Between a man and a woman
Every day and night I pray
Let the pendulum swing
Between a man and a woman

Kate Bush,"One of the band told me last night
That music is all that he's got in his life.
And where will it go?
Surely not with his soul.
Will all of his licks and his R'n'B

From people who nearly died but survived,
Feeling no fear of leaving their bodies here,
And went to a room that was soon full of visitors.

Don't bump me,
Don't dump me back there [Repeat: x2]

Kate Bush,"Down in the cellar
You're getting into making poison.
You slipped some on the side,
Into my glass of wine,
And I don't want any coffee homeground.

Offer me a chocolate,
No thank you, spoil my diet, know your game!
But tell me just how come
They smell of bitter almonds?
It's a no-no to your coffee homeground.

Pictures of Crippin'
Lipstick-smeared.
Torn wallpaper.
Have the walls got ears here?

[Chorus]
Well, you won't get me with your Belladonna, in the coffee,
And you won't get me with your arsenic, in the pot of tea,
And you won't get me in a hole to rot, with your hemlock
On the rocks.

Where are the plumbers
Who went a-missing here on Monday?
There was a tall man
With his companion,
And I bet you gave them coffee, homeground.

Maybe you're lonely,
And only want a little company,
But keep your recipes
For the rats to eat,
And may they rest in peace with coffee homeground.

With your hemlock on the rocks.
""Es schmeckt wunderbahr!""*
