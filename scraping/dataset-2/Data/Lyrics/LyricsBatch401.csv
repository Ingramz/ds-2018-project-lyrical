Jaime Jamgochian,"I used to wish that I could rewrite history
I used to dream that each mistake could be erased
Then I could just pretend
I never knew the me back then

I used to pray that You would take this shame away
Hide all the evidence of who I've been
But it's the memory of the place You brought me from
That keeps me on my knees and even though I'm free

Heal the wound but leave the scar
A reminder of how merciful You are
I am broken, torn apart, take the pieces of this heart
And heal the wound but leave the scar

I have not lived a life that boasts of anything
I don't take pride in what I bring
But I'll build an altar with the rubble that You've found me in
And every stone will sing of what You can redeem

Heal the wound but leave the scar
A reminder of how merciful You are
I am broken, torn apart, take the pieces of this heart
And heal the wound but leave the scar

Don't let me forget
Everything You've done for me
Don't let me forget
The beauty in the suffering

Heal the wound but leave the scar
A reminder of how merciful You are
I am broken, torn apart, take the pieces of this heart
Heal the wound but leave the scar

Heal the wound but leave the scar
A reminder of how merciful You are
I am broken, torn apart, take the pieces of this heart
And heal the wound but leave the scar, leave the scar",Heal the Wound,2008

Jaime Paxton,"You were the best thing and the 
Worst thing to ever happen to me,
All rolled up in to one
And it's taken me this long to write a song about you

Should have listened to myself 
When you walked back into my life for the third time
Guess I should have closed my legs and my door to you
But I can trust you 'bout as far as you can throw me
And I can stand you just as long as you afforded me
And it's taken me this long to write a song about you

You were the best thing and the 
Worst thing to ever happen to me,
All rolled up in to one
And it's taken me this long to write a song about you

And I hope I never see you again but I promise you one thing
I may never see your face but I know you'll see me
Yeah I know you'll see me
You should probably watch out for me

You were the best thing and the 
Worst thing to ever happen to me,
All rolled up in to one
And it's taken me this long to write a song about you

And I'm sorry if this doesn't do it for ya
I'm sorry it didn't measure up
And I'm sorry if I left you feelin' empty
I'm sorry you let your lies screw you up
I'm sorry that I didn't love you more 
But I feel sorry for that whore you left me for
I'm sorry I gave you five years
But most of all I'm sorry it took me this long
I'm sorry it took me this long
I'm sorry it took me this long
I'm sorry it took me this long
To write a song about you",Five Years,2004
Jaime Paxton,"There's no beginning we've been here all along. 
I find it fitting I'll wake up and you'll be gone. 
I'll push my feet into the sand so I don't sink here. 
Feels like I'm stranded but the view is pretty sweet dear. 

I want you to tell me a story. 
Tell me you like me. 
Tell me you're sorry. 
Tell me you'll write me. 
Tell me you're gonna stay with me. 

I wanna feel the sunshine on my face. 
I wanna feel the sunshine on my face. 
I wanna feel the sunshine on my face. 

It's gonna be a beautiful moment. 
It's gonna be a beautiful day... 
Until you go away. 

I'll wait for you in my room again. 
You can come over if you think you need a friend. 
It doesn't matter if you've had too much to drink, dear. 
I'll drive you home if you don't really want to stay here. 

I want you to tell me a story. 
Tell me you like me. 
Tell me you're sorry. 
Tell me you'll write me. 
Tell me you're gonna stay with me.

It's gonna be a beautiful moment. 
It's gonna be a beautiful day... 
Until you go away. 

I look ahead to where I've been and where I'll go. 
Jump in headfirst there is no time to take it slow. 
I'm in the deep end if you want to swim with me dear. 
It doesn't matter where we go but we can't stay here. 

I want you to tell me a story. 
Tell me you like me. 
Tell me you're sorry. 
Tell me you'll write me. 
Tell me you're gonna stay with me.

Jaime Urrutia,"Desaparecen los días y se ocultan el buen humor
se nos esfuma la vida entre trucos y licor
estamos hechos de magia espejismos y ficción
la ilusión que contagia la grandeza del amor

nada por aquí nada por allá
tu y yo en la oscuridad
nada por aquí nada por allá

Jaime Urrutia,"Amor, la noche ha sido larga
Y llena de emoción, 
Pero amanece y me apetece
Estar juntos los dos. 

Los bares, que lugares
Tan gratos para conversar.
No hay como el calor
Del amor en un bar. 

Amor, no he sabido encontrar
El momento justo
Pues con el frío de la noche
No estaba a gusto. 

Mozos ponga un trozo
De bayoneta y un café, 
Que a la señorita la invita Monsieur 

Y dos alondras nos observan
Sin gran interés 
El camarero está leyendo el ""As""
Con avidez

Los bares, que lugares
Tan gratos para conversar.
No hay como el calor
Del amor en un bar.

Amor, aunque a estas horas
Ya no estoy muy entero, 
Al fin llego el momento
De decirlo te quiero

Pollo, otro bollo
No me tenga que levantar 
No hay como el calo
Del amor en un bar.

Jefe, no se queje
Y sirva otra copita más 
No hay como el calor
Del amor en un bar

Jaime Valle,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round Midnight,1995
Jaime Valle,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Jaime Valle,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Jaime Valle,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares

The autumn leaves are red and gold

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue

Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

Bet you I won't be blue always
'Cause that ol' sun's gonna shine
On Jerry Lee Lewis's back door step someday

I'm gonna lay my head
On somebody's lonesome railroad line
Let that ol' midnight special
Ease my troubled mind

Well, they tell me that old graveyard
Is a mighty lonesome place
Lord they put you six feet under
Shovellin' mud directly in your face

Well, goodbye baby, may God bless you
And may He bless ol' Killer a little bit too
Oh, don't meet you over yonder, baby
When they throw that Jerry right over you

Jair Rodrigues,"Quero ouvir a sua voz
E quero que a canção seja você
E quero, em cada vez que espero
Desesperar, se não te vir
É triste a solidão
É longe o não te achar
Que lindo é o seu perdão
Que festa é o seu voltar
Mas quero que você me fale
Que você me cale
Caso eu perguntar
Se o que a faz tão linda
Foi sua pressa de voltar
Levanta e vem correndo
Me abraça e sem sofrer
Me beija longamente
O quanto a solidão precisa para morrer",Medley Romantico: Minha Namorada/Eu Sei Que Vou Te Amar/A Volta/Primave,
Jair Rodrigues,"No meio da roda eu não marco bobeira
Eu entro na roda e não levo rasteira
Lá no terreiro eu levanto a poeira
É roda de samba e tem capoeira
Menina baiana que desce a ladeira
Sambando na roda não é brincadeira
Pego a menina e caio na zoeira
É roda de samba e tem capoeira

Pega a viola que eu quero te ver sambar
Firma o batuque pro nego cantarolar
Eu quero ouvir mais palmas, mais palmas
Mais palmas sem parar
É roda de samba que tem capoeira

Felicidade!
Passei no vestibular
Mas a faculdade
É particular
Particular!
Ela é particular
Particular!
Ela é particular

Livros tão caros
Tanta taxa pra pagar
Meu dinheiro muito raro
Alguém teve que emprestar
O meu dinheiro
Alguém teve que emprestar
O meu dinheiro
Alguém teve que emprestar

Morei no subúrbio
Andei de trem atrasado
Do trabalho ia pra aula
Sem jantar e bem cansado
Mas lá em casa
À meia-noite
Tinha sempre a me esperar
Um punhado de problemas
E criança pra criar

Para criar!
Só criança pra criar
Para criar!
Só criança pra criar

Mas felizmente
Eu consegui me formar
Mas da minha formatura
Não cheguei participar
Faltou dinheiro pra beca
E também pro meu anel
Nem o diretor careca
Entregou o meu papel

O meu papel!
Meu canudo de papel
O meu papel!
Meu canudo de papel

E depois de tantos anos
Só decepções, desenganos
Dizem que sou um burguês
Muito privilegiado
Mas burgueses são vocês
Eu não passo
De um pobre coitado
E quem quiser ser como eu
Vai ter é que penar um bocado
Um bom bocado!
Vai penar um bom bocado
Um bom bocado!
Vai penar um bom bocado
Um bom bocado!
Vai penar um bom bocado

Na minha casa
Todo mundo é bamba
Todo mundo bebe
Todo mundo samba

Na minha casa
Não tem bola pra vizinha
Não se fala do alheio
Nem se liga pra candinha

Na minha casa
Todo mundo é bamba
Todo mundo bebe
Todo mundo samba

Na minha casa
Ninguém liga pra intriga
Todo mundo xinga
Todo mundo briga

Macumba lá na minha casa
Tem galinha preta
Azeite de dendê
Mas ladainha lá na minha casa
Tem reza bonitinha
E canjiquinha pra comer
Mas ladainha lá na minha casa
Tem reza bonitinha
E canjiquinha pra comer

Se tem alguém aflito
Todo mundo chora
Todo mundo sofre
Mas logo se reza
Pra São Benedito
Pra Nossa Senhora
E pra Santo Onofre

Mas se tem alguém cantando
Todo mundo canta
Todo mundo dança
Todo mundo samba
E ninguém se cansa
Pois minha casa
É casa de bamba
Pois minha casa
É casa de bamba

Se tem alguém aflito
Todo mundo chora
Todo mundo sofre
Mas logo se reza

Mas se tem alguém cantando
Todo mundo canta
Todo mundo dança
Todo mundo samba

Dinheiro pra que dinheiro
Se ela não me dá bola
Em casa de batuqueiro
Só quem fala alto é viola

Venha depressa, correndo pro samba
Porque a lua já vai se mandar
Afina logo a sua viola
E canta samba até o sol raiar

Mas, dinheiro pra que dinheiro

Aquela mina não quis me dar bola
Eu tinha tanta grana pra lhe dar
Chegou um cara com uma viola
E ela logo começou a bolar

Dinheiro pra que dinheiro

Eu era um cara muito solitário
Não tinha mina pra me namorar
Depois que eu comprei uma viola
Arranjo nega em qualquer lugar

Dinheiro pra que dinheiro

Eu tinha grana
Me levaram a grana
Fiquei quietinho
Nem quis reclamar
Mas, se levarem
A minha viola, não me segura
Porque eu vou brigar

Dinheiro pra que dinheiro 

Pára depressa com essa viola
Porque o samba já vai terminar
Eu vou depressa correndo pra casa
Pegar a marmita pra ir trabalhar

Catch the skulls of a children, frozen and dismal
Coming with me
Creature, kill in name of Hell
The black mess is started, life's will terminate
With the wrath of the demons started the genocide

We were turning that key inside
To get in the moment

Can you see my vision
Of a red-hot summer in wine?
When love was the feeling
When love was the feeling
When love was the feeling
When love was the feeling

Tonight, wonderful things are about to happen
All of your wildest dreams are about to come true

I have a secret, I think you should know
I feel like I just can't keep it, it's deep within me and I feel like I'm losing control

Can you see my vision
Of a red hot summer in wine?
When love was the feeling
There's no indecision

Hiding in the shadows, there's terror in the streets
It came without warning, no one heard the call
Dark clouds are falling, the black rain will fall

Ride, ride the storm
Ride, ride the storm
The distant fire, burning on the shore
Oh the cities crumble, I hear the gods of war

Screaming for vengeance, there's no hope in sight
Lighting and thunder, striking the night
Ride, ride the storm
Ride, ride the storm

I know, burn in the conscience of every man
You don't have to push me, 'cause I'll make a stand
Won't you let me breathe?

Clear every shadow of doubt in my mind

All alone tonight
Something about you is making me smile
With tears in my eyes
Maybe you've noticed, maybe you can tell
What's happening to me
When you say my name and touch my heart again
It's making me believe
Why can't this be one of the times
When I can see with open eyes
Shine your light
I'll never forget for the rest of my life

Who'll be haunted by the dirty things he's seen

It's a shame all the jury knew the accused
'Cause now they're running free when they left her cold and bruised
There's a chalked white line stained with blood
Sorry Mr. Jones, we did all we could

There's a whole lot of people out there and they're all running free
Some will care and some will steal the last breath that you breathe
From you, from you

So Mr. Jones in a cruel twist of fate
Found the perpetrators in a drunken haze
Gave them retribution for their twisted ways
Now he's going down for years instead of days

Jake Bugg,"Morning, it’s another pure grey morning
Don’t know what the day is holding
When I get uptight
And I walk right into the path of a lightning bolt

Sirens of an ambulance comes howling
Right through the center of town and
No one blinks an eye
And I look up to the sky for the path of a lighting bolt

Met her as the angels parted for her
But she only brought me torture
But that’s what happens
When it’s you who’s standing in the path of a lightning bolt

Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta tow the line they want the water not the wine
But when I see the signs I jump on that lightning bolt

And chances, people tell you not to take chances
When they tell you there aren’t any answers
And I was starting to agree
But I awoke suddenly in the path of a lightning bolt

Fortune, people talking all about fortune
Do you make it or does it just call you
In the blinking of an eye
Just another passerby in the path of a lightning bolt

Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta tow the line they want the water not the wine
But when I see the signs I jump on that lightning bolt

When the moment got shattered
I remembered what she said
And then she fled in the path of a lightning bolt",Lightning Bolt,2012

Jake Bugg,"One Friday night I took a pill or maybe two
Down at the car park I saw everyone I knew
And before the night had started we had planned to crash a party
Just a place that someone knew a local house belonging to a gangsters crew
And at the door they shone a light into my face
Have to admit I felt a little out of place
But I made my way inside past a thousand crazy eyes
Then a friend took me aside said everyone here has a knife

I've seen it all
I've seen it all now
I swear to god I've seen it all
Nothing shocks me anymore after tonight

Those little doves had sent my mind and heart a-beating
To say I felt weird really doesn't need repeating
I could sense the mounting tension the atmosphere of violence
And then they took a guy out side and someone stabbed him with a knife

I've seen it all
I've seen it all now I swear to god
I've seen it all nothing shocks me anymore after tonight

I've seen it all

Making up the pavement
Of less traveled roads
Mining for treasure deep in my bones
That I never found

Went looking for reverence
Tried to find it in a bottle
Came back again
High on a hash pipe of good intent
But it only brought me down

Tried institutions of the mind and soul
It only taught me what I should not know
Oh the answer well
Who would have guessed
Could be something as simple as this,
Something as simple as this?

Traveled to each oceans end
Saw all 7 wonders,
Trying to make some sense
Memorized the mantra Confucius said
But it only let me down

Tried absolution of the mind and soul
It only led me where I should not go
Oh and the answer well,
How could I miss
Something as simple as this?
Something as simple as this?

I've been falling crashing breaking
And all the while you were
Stood here waiting
For me girl

And my stomach churns.
When it finally hits me out of the sky,
I knew this day would come I'm on the front line.

Whoa,
Don't know how to take it in, is love just suffering?
'Cause I can see where the chapter ends
I've got autumn leaves and heartbreak dreams inside, inside
Cause you and and me on this frozen sea we slide, slide

I'll wait all on my own like a flower in the snow,
With just my shadow following me out into the cold,
Where I walk past the trees to look for my love.

Some will kill and some will steal the last breath that you breathe from you

Is the thought of getting out

There's a tower block overhead
All you've got's your benefits
And you're barely scraping by

In this trouble town
Troubles are found
In this trouble town
Words do get 'round

Kick the bottom make troubles flee
Smoke until our eyes would bleed
Sparkle pop the seed

Hear the sirens down the street
The kids get light on their feet
Or they'll be in the back seat

In this trouble town
Troubles are found

Sitting on the pavement
Boy you've missed your payment
And they're gonna find you soon

If there's a beating in the rain
If there's a little bit of pain, man
You're the one it happens to

If I talk of getting out
I only hear the laughter loud
It's gotten ugly at home

Somewhere there's a secret road
To take me far away I know
But til then I am hollow

But it seems you had other plans
What's there to talk about?
What's there to figure out?
Sometimes I feel like an experiment

Tell me, where has the sweetness gone?
Where is the loving song?
Where, oh, where in the world?

Can't you just spin while I play?
Must we come up with a hundred and ten reasons why we're alive today?
I won't mind if you probe, babe
Start with my earlobe, babe
And then start whispering to me

Tell me, where has the sweetness gone?
Where is the loving song?
Where, oh, where in the world?

The only reason you used to need
To be around me was me

As the King comes thro' the gate.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

Happy faces line the hallways,
Those whose lives have been redeemed,
Broken homes that He has mended,
Those from prison He has freed,
Little children and the aged
Hand in hand stand all aglow,
Who were crippled, broken, ruined,
Clad in garments white as snow.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

I can hear the chariots rumble,
I can see the marching throng,
The flurry of God's trumpets
Spells the end of sin and wrong:
Regal robes are now unfolding,
Heaven's grandstand's all in place,
Heaven's choir now assembled,
Start to sing ""Amazing Grace!""

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!",The King Is Coming,1998
Jake Hess,"Our Father, which art in heaven, 
Hallowed be thy name. 
Thy kingdom come, 
Thy will be done, 

On earth as it is in heaven. 
Give us this day our daily bread; 
And forgive us our debts, 
As we forgive our debtors; (As we forgive our debtors!) 

And lead us not into temptation, 
But deliver us from evil. 
For thine is the kingdom, 
And the power, and the glory, forever!

Jake Hess,"You thought you had found yourself a good girl,
One who would love you and give you the world.
Then you find, babe, that you've been misused,
Come to me, honey, I'll do what you choose.

She'd make her friends think that she didn't care

Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need 
Tell Mama, what you want and I'll make everything alright

The only water came up from the ground
Hey, the wishing well, sing it soft and low
My head was mangled and my words were torn
Covered in blood like a newly born
Hey, the wishing well, sing it soft and low
I saw you there, I couldn't refuse 
Had just enough in my pocket to lose
Hey, the wishing well looking cold tonight

Nothing down there can feel the pain
Nothing down there can forgive the crime
Sing it soft. Sing it low
Sing it to your self
Sing it all night

Bent a lot of time in the garbage can 
Fighting over food with the garbage man
Hey, the wishing well sing it soft and low
None of them scraps ever fed my soul
None of that smell ever left my nose
Hey, the wishing well looking cold tonight

Nothing down there can feel the pain
Nothing down there can forgive the crime
Sing it soft. Sing it low
Sing it to your self
Sing it all night

We passed a jug with hands like lead
Cast about as much shadow as the dead
Hey, the wishing well, sing it soft and low
I laid down there with a tone-deaf leech
Came up swinging at a figure of speech
Hey, the wishing well looking mighty cold tonight

Nothing down there can forgive the crime

Arriva arriva zio 
Arriva arriva 

Bacia la mano finché non la puoi ta-ta-tagliare 
È doppio gioco in strada, occhio in strada, noi alle case 
Arriviamo un mese prima del comune ad occupare 
Con bombola del gas e luce attaccata alle scale. 
Arriva anche se non vuoi, passa sotto le porte, 
Come lo sfratto quando bussano e nessuno risponde. 
Scrittore del blocco senza il blocco dello scrittore, 
Pagare per scopare è contro la mia religione. 
Fatico a stare a galla, voglio andare dove si tocca, 
Questa fa la santa, voglio andare dove si tocca, 
La vera roccia battezzata con l'acqua sporca, 
L'Italia è in ginocchio, chissà a chi fa una pompa!? 
Musica cruda spacca il mercato come Frank Lucas, 
Tra me e te, baby, ci sono solo 3 Cuba, 
Arriva all'alba come la questura e quando bussa 
Vediamo se sei minchia molla o minchia dura. 

Bacia la mano finché non la puoi tagliare 
E non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare zio. 
Arriva arriva quello che deve arrivare 
Non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare frà. 

Lo leggi negli sguardi: popolare, 
È la parola senza muovere il labiale. 
Portavo il nome della via nelle zone 
Ora è la via che porta il mio nome. 
Tu giochi in casa al chiuso, 
Io no giochi in casa, in plaza era al chi uso 
Ora sono le giostre per tutte le volte che mi sono state tolte. 
Inoltre la sorte è una stanza senza porte 
Solo chi abbatte I muri ne esce. 
Tuo padre correggeva I tuoi sbagli 
Ora sei tu che correggi I tuoi figli. 
Due stracci addosso il lusso tra I vetri, 
Ora mi vedi mentre vesto completi. 
E no zio, non è Sanremo 
Qui arriva chi deve arrivare primo. 

Tutte le infamie, I torti e I conti da pagare 
Non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare zio. 
Arriva arriva quello che deve arrivare 
Non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare frà. 

Ehi zio, se sei al mondo sai che arriva, 
Come l'aumento ai cilindri di nicotina, 
E il pakistano alla pompa della benzina, 
E il nuovo film di Natale dei Vanzina. 
Oh, se parli troppo arriva arriva, 
Zio giocalo al Lotto è una cinquina. 
Frà impara chi comanda a Milano 
Non fare l'indiano, due volte come Calissano
Tutti galli nel privè, ma sono serie B come un film di Michael Paré, 
Non vai in Hit Parade e arriva, 
Non sei una star zio ti mancano le palle, sei una diva. 
Hai la collana con l'emblema, si, 
Poi vedi la mia ch'è grossa come la catena dell'altalena. 
Non sei un Dogo, e arriva arriva, 
Conviene metterti l'olio d'oliva. 

Tutte le infamie, I torti e I conti da pagare 
Non ti preoccupare, non ti preoccupare zio.

Dammi ste ventuno lettere che le trasformo in dinero
Sono stato di più a funerali che feste
Perciò vesto sempre di nero
Chiudimi dentro una gabbia co' sti quattro scemi e vediamo poi chi ne esce intero
Chiamami e trovi occupato, sono impegnato, sto costruendo un impero
Zio, Jake è il mismo di una gran turismo
Cresciuto a cristalli, cavalli, potenza tra le gambe, zio Sex Pistols
Lo sguardo ti ghiaccia la faccia, ho un flow che le casse le schiaccia dentro high pistols
In mano la clava di Fred Flinstones, seduto in ginocchio fra Bill Clinton
Oggi che i rapper non vanno più a tempo, scrivono favole senza senso
Io sottometto sto beat (?) li appendo come ha fatto Tenco 
Non siamo amici se abbiamo brindato, le tue tipe seguono El Chapo (El Chapo)
Non prendono cash da una pompa, sono antifurto, c’ho il cazzo blindato (c’ho il cazzo blindato)

Jake La Furia,"Baci sopra le guance, coltelli dentro alle pance
Il successo non ci nobilita e la strada non ci fa piangere
Legati mani e piedi
Testa al domani e cuore a ieri
Dentro i salotti ricchi e barocchi
E dai pippotti dentro ai quartieri
A me non mi disseta sbocciare, non mi toglie fame il caviale
Non è una collana o un bracciale che cambia il tessuto sociale
Senza la gente non sono niente
Sono un pusher senza il cliente
Il veleno senza il serpente, io ci campo sulle leggende

Io voglio solo spiegare le ali
Osservare la vita dall’alto e tornare nel posto in cui ho avuto i natali
Restare con i comuni mortali
Non sono mai davvero contento
Ho sempre in testa quel senso
Nella suite o nel cemento
Non so qual’è il mio posto e il mio tempo
Vorrei tagliare la corda ma la strada mi incolla le Jordan
Guardare per terra, arrivare secondo
Prendersi il mondo
Mela della discordia

Sono ali e radici, oro e champagne
Oppure sangue e sacrifici
Sono un mare di soldi, un mare di merda
Sono le mie cicatrici

Abbiamo le ali ed il coraggio
Radici all’atterraggio
Qual è il senso del viaggio?
I soldi o gli amici?
Se siamo solo di passaggio
Sogno un cuore di ghiaccio e il calore di un abbraccio
Ali e radici

Preparati al decollo
Per diventare immortali
Volare lontani, non ho radici
Strette intorno al collo
Raccontano che il domani
È di chi ha le ali

Siamo fatti di incubi e sogni
E di santi che scalano i giorni
La famiglia, gli amici, gli amori
A sto punto sono solo lussi o bisogni
A noi chi ci tiene legati
Cuori spezzati amici d’infanzia pregiudicati
Come fare a volare senza farci dire che siamo cambiati
Cosa mi dice lo specchio
Cosa?
Mi guarda sorride mi parla all’orecchio
Poi dice fottili tutti e scopale tutte
Perché fra un po’ sarai vecchio
Sempre col diavolo sopra la spalla
Angelo scuote la testa e non parla
Perché la verità è sempre una merda
È più divertente ascoltare la palla

Ora queste ali pesano meno
Se conquisto un pezzo di cielo
Se recido queste radici
Sotto la strada in mezzo al veleno
Vivo ed io non cerco il perdono
L’ho voluto quello che sono
Non è l’uomo a fare la scelta
Ma la scelta a fare l’uomo
Io vivo un po' nell’oro e un po' nella merda
Ho un occhio chiuso ed un occhio all’erta
Una mano a pugno e una mano aperta
Una carta giù ed una carta scoperta
Ho imparato guardando due mondi
Su ai grattaceli giù ai bassi fondi
Tra gli edifici o alle radici, ora sono pronto per saldare i conti (sì)

Abbiamo le ali ed il coraggio
Radici all’atterraggio
Qual è il senso del viaggio?
I soldi o gli amici?
Se siamo solo di passaggio

Preparati al decollo
Per diventare immortali
Volare lontani, non ho radici
Strette intorno al collo
Raccontano che il domani
È di chi ha le ali

Mai messo radici
Le ho sempre fumate
Mai avuto le ali
Scarpe consumate
Sempre fatto il mio
Anche se non ci credevano in molti
Ci vorrebbe un amico ora che girano tutti sti soldi

Fammi passare dai
Dipende sempre quanto dai
Ogni ragazza porta guai
La verità non conta mai
Tocca lasciare un segno perché siamo tutti di passaggio
Questa vita ha un dito sopra il grilletto e non scherza un cazzo
Dal top al fondo in mezzo c’è un mondo che vale la pena visitare
Mi guardo in torno e se non rispondo è perché sono in preda a crisi varie

Tu cosa cerchi?
Qualunque cosa sia là non nascosta bene
Oh bella Jake era da troppo che aspettavo un pezzo insieme
I rapper che spaccano oggi sono cresciuti sopra due dischi
Dal 2004 pompano Mister Simpatia e Mi Fist
Amici che vengono altri che vanno e chi li ha mai più visti
Lo vedi alla fine abbimo sfruttato anche i momenti tristi

Abbiamo le ali ed il coraggio
Radici all’atterraggio
Qual è il senso del viaggio?
I soldi o gli amici?
Se siamo solo di passaggio
Sogno un cuore di ghiaccio e il calore di un abbraccio
Ali e radici
Preparati al decollo
Per diventare immortali
Volare lontani non ho radici
Strette intorno al collo
Raccontano che il domani
È di chi ha le ali

Jake La Furia,"Se fossi bello potrei
Giocare a calcio anche se non sono capace
Potrei
Fare successo con musica che non piace
Potrei essere famoso e invece mi sbatto
Per fare i singoli e gioco solo alla play
Vorrei fare delle interviste
Con l'aria misteriosa e triste
Dire luoghi comuni alle riviste
Dire ""governo ladro"" e intanto passare per figo
Tanto se sono bello
Chi è che ascolta quello che dico 
Vorrei spacciare per geniali
Pezzi tipo, raga dai su le mani
Roba che manco i cani
E via coi complimenti dei critici musicali
E per scriverla mi bastava
Aver fatto le elementari
Fratè, è bella la vita del bello
Infatti suscita collere
Non sa fare un cazzo
Ma c'ha un milione di followers
Frà nella vita non serve il talento
Serve soltanto essere bello, felice e contento

Non serve a niente la maturità
Non serve a niente avere un gran cervello
Nella vita devi essere bello
Essere bello, essere bello
Non serve avere le capacità
Se vuoi la supercar ed il castello
Nella vita devi essere bello
Essere bello, essere bello

Le mie amiche fanno il book dal fotografo
Scroccano le ferie sempre a Dubai e Monaco
Io non ho capito cosa fanno
Ma se guardo le foto
Sembra che sono in vacanza tutto l'anno
Le belle non diventano mai vecchie
Han sempre un bicchiere in mano
Ma sono sempre più secche
Han sempre uno che sembra nonno
Che paga le borsette
Perché coi soldi dello studio
Loro si pagavano le tette
Postano foto a poppa
Mentre fanno dieci squat
Ancora non ho capito
Chi è il padrone dello yacht
Speriamo che un giorno gratto
Un ""turista per sempre"" e vinco
Perché se non sei bello
L'opzione è vien che sei ricco
L'opzione c'è che ti fai il culo
Dì che ti fai fare il culo
Ma se non sei bello tranquillo
Non te lo fa nessuno

Fuori da qui c’è la vita vera
Se ho fortuna dura una vita intera
In cui ti svegli col trucco di ieri sera
Poi mi sali sopra in canottiera
Tienimi fuori tu da ogni dipendenza
Tienimi anche lontano dalla violenza
La vita comincia adesso, siamo in partenza
Prepara le cose mentre faccio la benza
Sono fuori da qui, fuori per chi
Fuori per te, ci vediamo fuori prendi un tassì
Che ci beviamo tutto il bar e ci amiamo ubriachi
Ma sì, poi faremo i bravi da lunedì
Siamo così felici che quasi facciamo schifo
Mi sento che non rispecchio quello che scrivo
Starò fuori dalla noia finché respiro
Starò fuori dal giro
Tu dammi un bacio e fammi un mojito
Sono fuori dal primo

Come i giorni che non passano mai
Per noi, per noi
Come canzoni che non parlano mai
Di noi, di noi
Che siamo come treni che si perdono
Due stelle che non cadono
Più giù, più giù
Un cielo che oggi sembra più bello che mai

Fuori da qui c’è la primavera
Ci sei tu che sei la prima vera
C’è una luce nuova nell’atmosfera
Mi sento fuori da questa galera
Sono stato sempre all’ultima fila
Ed ho pianto solo con la tequila
Non sono più un pupazzo nella vetrina
Sono uno nessuno e centomila
Lascio la strada come stato mentale
Non voglio male, niente vita
Voglio una vita niente male
Mi han detto fuori c'è tutto ma non l’ho mai saputo
Io fino adesso mi sono soltanto autodistrutto
Ho volato alto, droga rock alcool
Credimi sono stanco frate, cerco altro
C’è profumo di novità
E non esiste profumo in questa città
Ridammi una vita ne hai presa metà
E Milano mi ha detto che ci sta

Come i giorni che non passano mai
Per noi, per noi
Come canzoni che non parlano mai

Jake La Furia,"Ho riempito la bocca quasi fino a perdere il gusto
Senza dire che è giusto
Distruggo le cose che tocco e di solito non le riaggiusto
Ho provato a spaccare me stesso
Con il sesso, la droga ed il resto
Tutto il male che vedo nel letto la notte è il prezzo per il successo
Ho preso pugni fino a farmi perdere i denti
Fino a farmi perdere i sensi
E non ho imparato niente
Pure meno di quello che pensi
Anche credo nel giorno, meglio del porno
Trenta balordi che mi stanno attorno
Tutti contenti che vado, ma dentro di me, frate, non vedo l’ora che torno
Faccio a pugni col mondo solo per vedere chi aveva le corna più dure
Sembro un pezzo di merda, ma, invece, sono solo un pezzo di sogni e paure
E ho speso più di quello che avevo
In tutto ciò che vedevo
E adesso non ho niente, non ho niente di ciò che volevo
I problemi con la cultura
I problemi con la questura
Non rispetto l’autorità, non era nella mia natura
Ho tradito un amico soltanto
Per avere l’amore al mio fianco
Però lui non mi vede la notte che affogo la testa nel cuscino e piango
Ho camminato su una lama infinita
Finché ho trovato te
A fari spenti, finché ho trovato te
Ed ho sempre riso in faccia alla vita finché ho trovato te
Fra i serpenti finché ho trovate te
E ci alziamo e scopiamo e beviamo e fumiamo
E scommetti che ti amo
E sei qui per me
Ed ho vissuto sempre solo nell’ombra finché ho trovato te
Ma quello che conta è che io ho trovato te

Quando fa troppo caldo vorresti passare al Natale
Con quell’aria glaciale
Quando stai tutto il mese in vacanza vorresti qualcosa da fare
Così quando tutti ti stanno a guardare
Quando tutti ti fanno sentire speciale
Tu vorresti sparire, condurre soltanto una vita normale
Tutti ‘sti flash che mi rubano l’anima
Se ne va tutto dentro una lacrima
Tutti i mostri che vengono a prendermi quando mi sveglio con la pelle madida
Bacio il senso di colpa ogni giorno
Pure se merito tutte le cose che ho intorno
Litigo anche con me stesso, non potrei scendere a patti col mondo
Sai che ho solo riso poco
Ho riso solo per le foto
Ho riso solo per stare al gioco
Odio farmi mettere a fuoco
Per diventare più forte ho mangiato
Volevo bere, però ho tracannato
Frà, Dio lo so quante droghe che ho fatto
Per amore ho soltanto scopato
Ho sacrificato la serenità
Per avere una fetta di ciò che cercavo
Finché ciò che per me è libertà
Con il tempo ha finito per rendermi schiavo
Come hai fatto a raggiungermi a tremila all’ora?
A fermarmi per dirmi “scappiamo”?
Non importa, ma ti amo
Baciami e andiamo
Tira tu il freno a mano

Jake La Furia,"Ciao, come va? ho visto che piangi
Sarà tutto il marcio che mangi
È una vita che stai per strada, sola e ti arrangi
Quindi sai, ti capisco, sempre problemi
Quando stai nel letto e tremi
Senti il cuore che batte e ti porta da un’altra parte
Tu con chi stai? con chi passi questa notte?
Da sola al banco a bere i cocktail
Che non fanno domande e ti abbracciano sempre più forte
Cosa hai visto con quegli occhi blu? la Milano dei tabù
Vivi veloce, muori giovane, in chicane il tuo tattoo
Sembra che abbiamo fatto una vita, vissuto insieme
Senza ali e senza catene
I piedi per terra tra i balordi e le scie di sirene
Tu lo sai, tu lo sai come si sta al mondo
Aspettiamo un altro secondo
Poi ti porto via da qua fino all’alba e poi fino al tramonto
E vedrai, rollane una che ci stordisca
Sette veli tipo odalisca
Poi sei nuda che balli come una spogliarellista
Tu raccontami una vita, poi mettimi in bocca le dita
Facciamo ancora due tiri e lo rifacciamo appena è finita
Mandami, mandami, mandami fuori
Mandami, mandami, mandami fuori
Mandami, mandami, mandami fuori
Mandami, mandami, mandami fuori

Cosa c’è?
Parla piano (e svegliamo i vicini, mi sa che abbiamo fatto rumore)
Io e te (gli occhi sempre più piccoli, non sappiamo più neanche le ore)
Sul divano (su mille cuscini, che hanno preso già il nostro sapore)
È così (senza pensare a niente, a tutti i problemi che avevamo intorno)
Lo facciamo (tienimi sempre a mente perché poi ti prometto che torno)
Proprio qui (se qualcuno ci sente, non saprà che ci amiamo da un giorno)
Dove siamo (diversi dalla gente, come fossimo gli unici al mondo)

Ciao, come va? ho visto che gridi
Al telefono e non respiri
E tuo padre che l’hanno beccato di nuovo nei giri
Quindi sai, ti capisco, ne ho conosciuti
Sono stato in branco coi lupi
E tu sei delicata, hai la faccia segnata e dopo ti sciupi
Con chi stai? chi ti fa colare il trucco?
Sembri una che gioca a football
Dai che poi si aggiusta tutto con una Vodka senza succo
Quei tuoi amici di cui ti fidi, sono in giro tutti farciti
E non vedono niente, non sentono niente, neppure se gridi
Invece noi sembra che ci conosciamo
Sei l’unica che non mi ha chiesto una foto
Vorrei baciarti e chiederti se andiamo
Andare fuori a scaldare la moto
Tu lo sai, tu lo sai come si soffre
L’hai provato troppe volte
Si sa che si muore se toccano un cuore con le mani sporche

Tu vedrai, rollane una che ci stordisca
Poi leviamoci dalla pista
Voglio stare con te prima che questa notte finisca
Tu raccontami una vita, poi mettimi in bocca le dita

Pero bailando quiero verte
Sólo dime tú cuándo paso a recogerte

La guancia che preme sulla tua guancia
Le labbra che premono sulle labbra
In questo posto in cui il mare incontra la sabbia
Sarà la forza di gravità che ci attacca
Muovilo come fosse un’onda
Come se fossi pronta a muoverlo
Come l’ultima cosa che fai
Finché il mare lava l’impronta, finché il sole tramonta
E racconta di tutti i baci che tu mi dai
Tu non sei come ste tipe, come le loro amiche
Tu sei un biglietto di prima per El Caribe
Il telefono suona però io non rispondo

Magari sarà solo un sogno, magari durerà una notte
Però la notte più lunga del mondo
La spiaggia ci farà da sfondo
Tu balla baby, balla forte
Fin quando arriva la luce del giorno
Balla come se fossi dentro una bolla che ferma il tempo
Una folla che sta spingendo ma che non ti avrà
Tu sei una foglia nel vento, sei come colla, mi arrendo
Non si controlla, tu dammi una possibilità
Se ti vedo ballare, nel riflesso del mare
Io dieci decimi, a te piace farti guardare
Mi fai muovere il collo fino al colpo di frusta
Sei quella giusta, me gusta

Questa fame che mi avvelena
Sparami il siero
Non voglio una fetta di terra
Voglio il mondo intero
Quanto si soffre per un desiderio
Rinunciare a guardarti sarebbe come stare in un monastero
Non appoggiarmi su di te a riposo del guerriero
Sarebbe come stare a lutto col vestito nero
Insieme siamo sincronizzati, siamo il bolero
Sei la realtà di un altro, però sei il mio pensiero
Io tra il giusto e lo sbaglio
Sbaglio sempre sentiero
Sarà per una donna che finirò al cimitero
Ma non so dire no ai tuoi fianchi, sembri un Botero
E del resto me ne fotte sempre meno di zero
Faccio davvero poche cose di cui andare fiero
Però non ti so dire no, sarò sincero
Io lo so che male fa
Ricucirsi l’anima
Domani me ne pentirò
Ma oggi non so dire no
Stare su una nuvola
Come una divinità
Il prezzo è caro ed io lo so
Ma oggi non so dire no

Non so che cosa avrò davanti, un salto nel vuoto
Perfino stare su una nuvola sarebbe poco
Abbiamo preso il nostro mondo e gli abbiamo dato fuoco
Mentre tutto bruciava noi siamo scappati a nuoto
Cerco di rimanere a galla, fiore di loto
Con te al mio fianco per sempre
Come sopra una foto
Abbiamo accesso la miccia ed abbiamo fatto il botto
Il resto adesso non conta niente, passato remoto
Io sono bravo solo a incasinare, questo è noto
Prima o poi dovrò rendere tutto quello che ho tolto
Sento la voce del buon senso ma io non l’ascolto
Voglio godermi i miei peccati, non essere assolto
Prendo il destino per il collo finchè non lo scuoto
Tu appoggia il culo sulla sella poi mettiamo in moto
Mi sentirò in colpa un altro giorno in un altro posto
Perchè non posso dirti no ad ogni costo

Con un freddo che mi arriva all’osso
Se la mia faccia è solo una fra tante
È colpa della maschera che indosso

Sono arrivato fino a qui con i pugni e l’orgoglio
Adesso ho una collana d’oro vero che soffoca il collo
Sento gli occhi addosso, io sorvegliato speciale

Quelli con cui puoi stare zitto senza che ti vergogni
Io sto seduto su un trono di cash come Johnny
Contare soldi non cura queste mie notte insonni
Potrei farti uno squillo, potremmo avere un figlio
Ma ti ho persa per un pugno di troie e tacchi a spillo
Che a malapena ricordo la faccia e il nome
Io ho chiuso un sacco di porte, nessuno ormai mi apre più il portone

Ci gioco, ma è tutto inutile, bimba, se non ho te
E ho fatto tanto per me, ma adesso non ho più amici
E non sto coi piedi per terra, una quercia senza radici
Carati e Dom Perignon e in superficie sto al top
Però dormo male, non vedo mia madre da un po'
Se casa mia è una gabbia, la città è uno zoo

Noi ci mordiamo sul collo per questi spettatori
E poi di nuovo in gabbia e poi di nuovo fuori
Questa musica potrebbe far fare i milioni
Ma è schiava dell'orgoglio che fa fuori i migliori
Al nostro tavolo è sempre pieno di giocatori
E se esce testa vivi, e se esce croce

Conto le merde che ho declassato sto all'angolo giudicato
Il patrimonio genetico di sto stato nel Rap è fallato
Memorie corte, carriera in pensione prematura
Le mosse contano quanto le abilità in scrittura
Non ho mai morso la mano che mi ha cibato
Salvo poi quando quel piatto davanti ne è stato avvelenato
E se l'ambiente davvero poi lo fan le persone
A me sta bene ma è col foglio la mia relazione
Più passa il tempo più resto, para, e non mi interessa
Più cresco più vi detesto, più pesto tengo testa
A sti fumetti cazzetti io c'ho progetti food
E da bollino blu il mio prodotto Cracco verbo shaboo
Vi tengo tutti a ruota, spiaggia d'Ostia negli Ottanta
Con la vena calda e la reputazione sempre intatta
Per darmi un tono non faccio concerti con la band
Se questa merda è testa o croce sono Harvey Dent

Respira, respira, respira, respira
La musica è dura finché una voce la sporca
Oggi scrivo e non parlo tanto nessuno più ascolta

Questa musica è sepolta di vecchi rancori
Ma se esce testa vivi e se esce croce muori
Noi ci mordiamo sul collo per questi spettatori
E poi di nuovo in gabbia e poi di nuovo fuori
Questa musica potrebbe far fare i milioni
Ma è schiava dell'orgoglio che fa fuori i migliori
Al nostro tavolo è sempre pieno di giocatori
Che se esce testa vivi, e se esce croce

Ti spacci per musicista e in bocca lingua da biscia
Perché l'ambizione di essere artista, o vola o striscia
Siamo passati dall'inferno della musica di nicchia
Diretti a un inferno di bimbiminkia
Io ho un cuore in sto purgatorio e tredici anni d'ora d'aria
Col fiato sul collo e sopra la mia testa più di un avvoltoio
Non ho la fame di ottenere sempre il risultato
Sono il risultato di chi ha fame col cuore tritato
Qualcuno indaga qualcuno ha fatto un identikit
Il Rap è morto ucciso da un ferro finto in un videoclip
Il mondo va al contrario fra i poveri hanno le Balenciaga
Come il loro rapper preferito che neanche li caga
Già, che neanche li piscia
Questi colleghi profumano di fragola come le nuvole fumando hashisha
Gioco ogni mano con malizia per me è sempre all-in
E batto cassa prima che il croupier mi fotta in deficit

Respira, respira, respira, respira
La musica è dura finché una voce la sporca
Oggi scrivo e non parlo tanto nessuno più ascolta

Non hai la faccia di Brad
Non hai comprato l'iPad
E soffri che non sei Dan Bilzerian
Ed a casa non ti aspettano tre troie, ma una donna seria
Che non voli con il g6
Guidi la Punto GT
Ma quelli dei Reality sono tutti dei miti
Non schiacci quelle bitches
Vai in giro con la bici
E ti fotti la ricarica per la sfida di Amici
Giocati il totocalcio, leggiti il rotocalco
Come ti brucia il culo, frà mettiti il Borotalco

Quando allo specchio tu sei bianca e bassa
Non sei Bianca Balti
Ed il tuo boy non basta

I bar sonno pieni di allenatori e le chat di musicisti
Tutti qua saprebbero fare meglio di Lippi
E rappare meglio di me anche se non fanno dei dischi
Sei figa ma sei piena di ritocchi
La gomma non si vede ma si sente se la tocchi (eh sì)
Forse sei un Fashion Blogger, Mary Poppins
La borsa ti si intona col colore delle borse sotto agli occhi

Culo di gallina, frate
Servi dei selfie

È la gente che ci vive, la polizia
È la classe che riscrive la democrazia
Questa non è più una crisi, è un’emorragia
Mamma, voglio fare l’emigrante
Che almeno mi lascino le mutande
Se ho già finito il sangue
E ho studiato una vita per esser grande
Finita che al posto mio c’è il figlio di uno importante
Mamma, per una canna tre mesi e tre botte in testa
L’erba la può fumare soltanto chi la sequestra
Comunque la gente piange e non protesta
Che se va male ti sparano i manifesta

E col naso rotto non si sente più puzza di marcio
Nella mia zona tutto è bruciato oppure è una merda
È rimasta in piedi solo la piazza o la caserma
Ed io non voglio fare le buste, né il carabiniere
Il mio orizzonte non deve finire nel quartiere
La mia tipa ha dato una pillola alla cicogna
In sta fogna non voglio dar vita ad una carogna
Perché è così che siamo, è l'indole dell'italiano
Vogliamo tutto e bruciamo tutto quello che abbiamo

Che tanto a un metro da qui
Cantando ""bevilo, bevilo""
Guardi ed è lunedì
E tu sei in piscina alla luce di luna
Nuda vestita soltanto di schiuma
L'acqua che scalda e la pelle che fuma
Bacia qualcuno che porta fortuna
E ti rimetti i tacchi ed i jeans

Quel tipo sembra Jay-Z e tu ti senti Beyoncé

Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn't know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn't know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?

Somewhere down the road I guess we took a wrong turn
I took your pictures, lit a match and watch them all burn
I can’t take anymore break ups, or make ups
So straight up, I won’t be there tomorrow when you wake up
But wait up, listen baby girl don’t get it twisted
We gave it all we had, attempted everything to fix it
Another broken heart, I can’t risk it
Girl its plain is simple, we took a shot and we missed it
And now the place I piss in, is where the memories of us are livin'
Down the drain, no more pain
But baby I ain’t kidding, when I tell you that you’ll always have a place in my life
But tonight I’ma make it right
Yeah, I’ma say

[Chorus]

Yeah, I guess I’m back at square 1,
Our love is rare, it’s too bad it wasn’t well done
Yeah we had a good run, never reached the finish line
Wish that we could start again, wish we could go back in time
Wish we could have seen the future, now we’re history
Consistently sending me text, saying that you’re missing me
I’m tryina forget about you, baby girl you’re killing me
And when you hear that last line, you’ll probably be pissed at me
But what can you, girl I’m tryna do me
Clean, slate, fresh start, baby I’m a new me
I promise that you’ll always have a place in my life

It started back in middle school
Back when it was puppy love
Now it’s so much more than that
It’s something I’ve been dreaming of
It’s crazy looking back, thinking ’bout when we were kids
But it’s funny cause my feelings for you haven’t changed a bit
I remember growing up, looking at my mom and dad
Thinking when I’m older, that’s exactly what I wanna have
And I think I finally found it, ever since the day you came along
I never doubted us, I swear I knew it early on
Baby you my best friend, yeah I hope you know
We’ll go down together just like dominoes
They say there’s no such thing as fairy tales
But this seems to be!
Girl I couldn’t tell you what you mean to me

[Chorus]

Yeah, remember laying on my roof, looking at the stars
I pointed to the biggest one and said that one is ours
You ain’t just a random girl, neah, we go way back
Always doing laps around my mind, like a race track
I been chasing after you ever since I was five foot
Circling your picture with a sharpie in my yearbook
That might of sounded kinda creepy, yeah it’s cheesy, but it’s true girl
I swear that you complete me
Cause you everything I wanted more, never felt like this before
Looking in your eyes sends chills down my spinal cord
I can only ṗray to God you feel the same
Yeah, girl I love you, that will never change

Jake Miller,"Wow
Wow, yeah

The other day I got an email, I almost didn't read it
But something caught my eye right before I could delete it
It was bold and underlined, ""Please Read"" was the title
Followed by ""Jake you are my idol""
It said and I quote, my name is Nikki and I used to be dancer
Til the day the doctor diagnosed me with cancer
So I said goodbye to all the hair on my head
And hello to my hospital bed
Yeah see I was just a normal girl, it happened so fast
There were so many days that I thought would be my last
However the fight was tough, and the battle was long
But I felt strong when I listened to your songs
You were, always there for me, you helped my heart beat
You were my only friend, kept you on repeat
I thanks God for you every single night
'Cause believe or not, you saved my life

I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives

Yeah the mailman knocked said it was for me
Handed me a box, sent from Tennessee
Written on the top ""for jakes eyes only""
Inside was a journal and letter that he wrote me
It said my name is Dillon I'm in 7th grade
I'm ridiculed and picked on almost everyday
Yeah they push me in the halls in between my classes
Yesterday they took my books then broke my glasses
I got no one to talk to, its like I don't exist
Sometimes I wonder if I was gone, would I be missed?
But lemme tell you the real reason for this letter
You've helped me through it all, you've help me feel better
Your words gimme confidence, your messages inspire me
You help me find my inner strength deep inside of me
Through all the bad times, you helped me find the light
Believe or not, you saved my life

I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives

I was sittin' at my table at dinner the other night
When I noticed a little girl sittin' to my right
She was lookin' at me like she knew me, I guess she did
'Cause then she walked right up to, and then she said
My name is Sami and I swear that I'm your biggest fan
I think she even had my name written on her hand
She said me and my brother used to listen to you every day
Until last year, when he passed away
I'll never forget seein' my parents cry
When they got a call sayin' that your son had died
Man I wish that he was here now, you were his favourite
He had your mixtape and never stopped playin' it
Your music gives me a feelin that I just can't describe
It's like I got my brother back, and he's still alive
I pray for both of you, every single night
'Cause believe or not, you saved my life

I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives

Now let me turn the table, and talk to you
I had a dream but you're the reason that its comin' true
Yeah I've had some dark days, when the sun don't shine
But you always reminded me that I would be fine
'Cause when no else cared, you believed in my vision
And now I got an army comin' with me on my mission
I thank God for all you, every single night
Cause believe or not, you saved my life",A Million Lives,2013
Jake Miller,"Yeah
I've been away for quite some time now
I think its time I come home
Yeah
And if you ask me, Ill say I'm just fine, but
Deep inside I'm alone
Damn
And I don't know if I can do this much longer
Baby, help me pull through
Trust me
The good life isn't all that good
When I can't even enjoy it with you

[Chorus]
Girl, I can't wait to come home to you
No, I can't wait to come home to you
I just need to see your face
I just need to hear your voice
This whole missin' you thing just won't do
Baby, I need to come home to you
Yeah, I can't wait to come home to you
Wait, you know what?
Screw it girl, I comin' back right now
This whole missin' you thing is now through
See ya soon

I haven't kissed your lips almost six to seven weeks, now
Startin' to feel like amiss
The closest thing I've seen in a smile in a while
Is the smiley face when we text
Girl, I hate to see you cry, and its hard to stay strong
So I'm constantly just tryna pretend
That it doesn't kill me deep inside
When I look into your eyes
Cause I always end up leavin' again

Yeah, but
Now I'm done doin' that
I come and I go, but I'm through with that
No, I'm never gonna leave your side again
So tell me, are you cool with that?
Yeah, ha, me too
Now its just me and you
I love you baby, I'll see ya soon

Yeah I hope you know it
But when I'm half way across the world
Its hard to show it
Always beggin' me to come home
So that's what I'mma do
Yeah, I'm hoppin' on the first flight out
Ill see ya soon
Baby, you my everything
Yeah I hope you know it
But when I'm half way across the world

Jake Miller,"Yeah, look
Let me tell you about a kid named Steven
He's slowly running out of things to believe in
Every couple of months his mom leaves him,
For no good reason his step-dad beats him
Not too many friends, only ever had a few of them,
But recently they don't want anything to do with him
Always eating lunch in the bathroom stall,
He just wants to feel normal and be cool again, yeah
Always feeling like the outcast, he's been going crazy ever since his dad passed
He needs guidance and advice but instead
He only has breakdowns and flashbacks of the car crash uh
It's been getting harder everyday, if he was still around everything would be ok
'Cause his dad was always the light at the end of the tunnel,
But now that same damn tunnel is looking dark and grey
He keeps quiet in the back of the class
And when the bell rings Steven hurries home fast
Scared to death the other kids will kick his ass on the long walk home
'Cause its happened in the past so
He's getting used to the black eyes and fat lips
But all he's got is a fake smile and cut wrists
Wishin' he could walk right up to them and show them the scars
And say look you're the reason that I've done this
Maybe they would finally understand and go back to how it was before it all began
But he's just a little different so they taunt him and they beat him
Yeah it's all just fun and games, they don't give a damn, yeah
His older brother ain't around, in and out of jail, hanging with the wrong crowd
He's been doing coke, smoking weed, getting drunk all his life he's a shame
No, he's not too proud
Now his habits are rubbing off on his little bro yeah, but guess what?
Little did he know that every time he did a line,
Every time he lit a joint,
Every time he took a shot he would set the mode
So Steven's sitting in his room getting high now
Doors locked, music up, with his lights out
He just takes another toke til his room fills with smoke
5-6-7 hours til he knocks out
Now he started stealing pills from his mom
8-9-10 at a time and now they're gone
And maybe for a moment all his problems seem to fade,
But the high fades too after not too long
And that's when it really sinks in and that's when it hits him
That these god damn drugs won't fix him
Curled up on the floor, can't take it anymore
Now he's talking to God 'cause he's the only one that gets him
On his knees, looking up, can't stop crying
""God I know we haven't talked in a long time
But this time I really need you. Please God help me, say something
Just give me a sign, because now I'm falling apart and
I don't think that I can do it. Please God, give me the strength
To pull through it. Tell me, Should I give up? I could end it all right now.
I just don't know if I'm brave enough to do it.
'Cause there's gotta be a better way than suicide.
Try to wait it out, give it time, you'll be fine.
But it's been so long and I still haven't been able to get rid
Of all the thoughts that I feel inside. So sick, so angry, so mad
And to top it off no one even knows that""
That's when he stood up, wiped his tears, walked over to his desk
And got a pen and a notepad
He just couldn't see it getting any better
So on a cold dark night in December, Steven knew exactly what he had to do
But first he sat down and wrote a couple letters
One to his step-dad, one to his mother,
Couple to the kids at school, one to his brother
Bringing them the pain that they once brought him
Tear drops on the paper one after another
Yeah, I hope that you all feel guilty.
'Cause I'm broken now and you can't heal me
And now you're all an accomplice in murder
Each and every one of you have chipped in to kill me
So the reason that I'm writing you this evening,
Is to say goodbye and to tell you that I'm leaving
But don't hold your breath 'cause I ain't never coming back
Sincerely yours, Steven",Steven,2013

Two years later runnin' round stage on her birthday
with another sold out crowd
I see you climb in the back of the shows now
Singing along to my songs
Tears of joy 'cause your little boy is right where he belongs
They say you miss the shots you don't take
Well I guess I made it in
Guess I'm doin' what I love and I'm troubling the world

I tried to knock

If you are where my home is
I guess that makes me homeless

So what now? I got no idea where I'm goin'
I'm lost with no direction like my GPS is broken
I'm walkin' round the streets thinkin' bout you every night
I'm feelin' homeless now
Lookin' like the man from I'm Alright
See I just wanna come back home, can't do this on my own
You were the only thing I knew for sure, guess that I was wrong
See I've tried to walk away but I just end up at your doorstep
Waiting for my phone to ring but nope, you haven't called yet
So I'm wandering, homelessly
Wish that you stayed with me
Thought that we were meant to be
Felt that you were there for me
But I guess not 'cause in case you failed to notice
You used to be my home until you left me homeless

Where am I supposed to go?
If you are where my home is
I guess that makes me homeless

So what now? It used to be just you and me
But you kicked me out, locked the doors and tossed away the keys
Put me outside lookin' in,
You would think that I'm just flyin'
But I'm a bigger wreck than the Titanic inside
I'm slippin' on sidewalks, I'm following street signs
I need some help, I'm feelin' stranded, losin' my damn mind
I'm blindfolded by you, girl you took everything that I own
I keep callin' your phone but all I get is the tone
So I'm lookin' up at the stars, these street lights they got me
I never planned on living life without you here right beside me
But guess I was wrong, 'cause in case you failed to notice
You used to be my home until you left me homeless

I tried to knock

What am I supposed to say?
Hey baby, how you doin'? I missed you home
By the way I'm bout to leave, ah good
I'm going on a fall tour
But I'll be back before you know it, then I'm all yours

We don't think it'll make the cut, could've written better verses
Deadline's in a month and now we startin' to get nervous
Stop getting so distracted, start pickin' up the pen

We follow you on Instagram, see everything you doin'

A day later I don't even have time to take a shit
I've been working non-stop and I'll be honest, I admit
Sometimes I need a break, this life can drive a man crazy
Especially when your label keeps callin' sayin' you're lazy

And to this day he still won't speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline
I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had rung my neck
When she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

If I had a dime
For half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all
I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd have known
That later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd have changed a lot of things
Startin' with me

I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks 'round here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell
And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standin' by the bed
When the preacher bowed his head
With the family the day my grandma died

If I had a dime
For half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all
I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd have known

Said this old truck is just a fixer up
She smiled and said hey that's okay
Just a couple letters missing from the Chevrolet

I pulled out of her country club neighborhood
She was over there looking so damn good
And I was feeling every bit of my side of the tracks
But she took care of that, when she pulled out that moon shine

Tasted like an apple pie
We were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
Sho' nuff messing me up
Till I couldn't tell the moonlight, from the stars in her eyes
I never felt so fine caught up in a good time between her
And that apple pie moonshine

Well we were dancing around in the high beams
Her hands in the back pockets of my jeans
The radio playing the perfect song
I still think about her every time the thing comes on
And I never forget that first kiss
When a country boy got to hold a real princess I can still taste the cinnamon on her lips
Every time I reminisce

Its sweeter than moonshine tasting like an apple pie
We were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff

To help you on the journey of your life

A hammer and a handsaw
A band-aid now and then
You'll need a home to come home to

Get a good square keep it level
Have grace to face the devil
You'll need an angel flying by your side
On the journey of your life

Ride the wind 'til we meet again
On the other side of life
You'll need some good luck and a Bible
Especially a Bible
A lot of faith in God above
And a woman you can love
You'll need a good song that you can sing on
And a shoulder you can lean on
And you gotta draw the line sometimes when push comes to shove
You'll need to lose some to be a winner
And have courage to surrender
You'll need to laugh a lot and keep it light
On the journey of your life

And no matter what dreams you're chasing
Never get above your raising

When they close that old pool bar down.
Now I know ya'll just didn't go on back up to your room
And turn on QVC and order out for pizza
What you probably did was go down to that old icemaker
Down there in the hallway and start fillin' up that bathtub
In your room with as much ice and as much liquid
Refreshments as it would possibly hold
And pretty soon you got a big ol' party goin' on, and you know

Dirt-bike and a fishin' pole at a fishin' hole with all my friends
Nothin' better than a BB gun in my backyard just huntin' squirrels
Took a ring from my mama's drawer and gave it to this little girl

Around every corner, cafe, back road, stop sign, stoplight streetlight glowing
Around every highway, driveway, fast song, slow song on my radio

Came up and gave me a hug and asked me how we’ve been

Thought we were over baby, but you kept getting closer baby.
One little touch never broke no heart girl,
But I always wanna finish what you start girl.
Now your gone and it's hitting me,

When they get a little tipsy
Corona cold in your hand, your brushed back hair
I took another sip of whiskey
And I didn’t let the ice cubes melt in the bottom of my plastic cup

And I said hey pretty girl you wanna get out of here?
And you looked up
Looking in your big blue eyes
Laying there that night

I said this sure feels dangerous to me
It feels like a struck match kissing gasoline
It feels a little better than it ever has
It sure feels good, baby let’s be bad
I feel your heart, I feel you there
I feel a little brave, I feel a little scared tonight
But it sure feels right

Well the sunrise hit the window
And there you were
In my Alabama t-shirt
I fly where angels sleep like a dream
You got me thinking ‘bout those 3 words
And I didn’t sneak off like I done so many times before

And you opened up your eyes and gave me a kiss
I said give me one more
And in those twisted covers
We were more than lovers

And you said this sure feels dangerous to me
It feels like a struck match kissing gasoline
It feels a little better than it ever has
It sure feels good, baby let’s be bad
I feel your heart, I feel you there
I feel a little brave, I feel a little scared in the morning light

So I can turn it up, and maybe turn her on
An American country love song

In every town and every place
There's a boy who's tryin' to take a chance and dance
And find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just lookin' for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes
Let them fireworks start
That American
Country love song
Ain't never gonna quit playin' on and on and on, and on

So let's raise a glass
Cheerleaders and quarter-backs
Cowboys and country girls
All around this small town world
To the same old pick up lines
We've tried a million times
All the bad and good is against
The ones that you ain't met yet

In every town and every place
There's a boy who's tryin' to take a chance and dance
And find a way to run away with her heart

Jake Owen,"Well the sun went down, all storefronts shut
They roll the sidewalks up around here
It's just kids and the cops out after seven o'clock
So you better had already bought your beer
You cut your headlights off trying to not get caught
She's out the window and across the yard
She slid it into the seat, slow rolled it down the street
'Til you parked it and the stereo starts
And they say

Nothing good ever happens after midnight
Maybe midnight's just misunderstood
'Cause if nothing good ever happens after midnight
Why does it always feel so damn good
Wrapped up so tight with me, no light
All night, it was alright, alright

You go as fast as you can, go as far as you want
With nobody out to slow you down
She was your rearview queen, you were her ghost street king
While everybody was asleep in the town
You watch the relights blink 'til the horizon's pink
All while her daddy thinks she's still in her bed
But when you're young and dumb
The only rule of thumb was do the opposite of everything
And they said, and they said

Nothing good ever happens after midnight
Maybe midnight's just misunderstood
'Cause if nothing good ever happens after midnight
Why does it always feel so damn good
Wrapped up so tight, your own paradise
And the dashboard lights, alright, alright

They say nothing good ever happens after midnight

My Camaro all painted up in flames
But damn, she was the one that was on fire
She was head-to-toe red, white and blue
That lipstick, tank top, daisy dukes
She had my head spinning faster than them four bald eagle tires

I was all caught up in that American love
Two young hearts, one cool car
And all we wanted to do was park, kiss, smoke, drink
I love this song, baby, what do you think?
She turned it up, windows fogging up
We were living it up, up, up in that American love

I parked the Chevy by the levy on a Friday night
We were naming all the stars up in that sky
And I named the brightest one right after her
And the summer sunset was something to see
With her leaning all up real close to me
And with a six pack, the next thing I knew, we were in the backseat, you know

I thought I'd show my face and say
""What's done is done""
When you see me, look away
Pretend your soul is pure

You can't go back to where you've been
You'll never see this place again
You'll live your life for someone else
Someone that you call yourself

Some call me The Bruiser
I'm your biggest fan
Call me The Bruiser
I'll kiss you with the back of my good hand

How can you feel anything
When your bones are cold?
You can't trade in these bleached regrets
For what you thought I sold

You know it's, you know it's no lie
You know it's no lie
You know it's, you know it's no lie

That music I hear

I'm just foolin myself

Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it isn't so

And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say

You're trowing your life away""

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2012

Could it be I'm falling in love (ooh)

I watch wild niggas blow
See how plush shit can get
But we ain't trying to kiss ass to blow up fast
We gonna take our time and rely strictly on the rhyme

Would you still be my man
And pass your bottle to my hand
Would I be in the rain
While you pass me in the Land

To get next to me and possibly sex me
Then slip Ecstasy inside a nigga's Pepsi
Money'll never amount to respect, B
And you don't wanna test me
'Cause God blessed me.

Jakob Bro,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2007

In to the places we never go
By walking through deep snow down forgotten roads
Been chasin' a light that comes and goes

No matter what
There is a new day on its way
And no matter what
There is more love to be made

A crowd of young people gather in the park
A black satin skyline filling with stars
It's still not that easy hearing your name
I will not pretend for anyone I am half the same

No matter what
There is a new day on its way
And no matter what
There is more love to be made

There are dreams I keep secret 
Where I go barefoot through gauntlets 
Going back for this old love
I will risk my neck time and time again

Be at ease, I'm not leaving I am fearful what comes
There is grace in the madness when all seasons come at once
You are safe in the arms of the unknown 
I just need to remind you that the brave, they carry on

No matter what 
There is a new day on its way
And no matter what 
There is more love to be made
No matter what 
There is a heartache on its way
And no matter what 
There is more love to be made

That's everybody

We come from the country where the rain follows plow
And the evenings are cold enough to pluck your feathers out
We hear your engines roaring deep and loud
As we work the mules on this bludgeoned ground
We've hunted these hills dry
We've long outlasted the winter and our last wood pile
Only one thing is certain
That's everybody

Our spirits' been broken been splintered to bits
Faith is believing what you ain't so

They can't leave and we can't go

We'd sell this valley if we could go up north
Where the sun sets dripping buckets of gold
Through snow topped thunderheads and rows of wind

And it's a book of blank maps
That's we're using to get us there

To the hilltops my daughter, my son
The rescue's too little to cover the slums
Cross the river deeper than it ever was
There's a pause in the evening
When prayers are supposed to be done

With battle songs filling their lungs
Move them out down under the sun
Give them tears for cherry red blood
Stack them old, we cradle them young
World is crazy or maybe just

Glory glory hallelujah be warned
God is still marching, still raising his sword
Board these windows and guard your stretch of floor
Something sinister's got you the minute you open the door

Tall and mighty, brick and stone
Don't feel like it did before
'Cause we don't live here anymore

We don't live here
We don't live here
We don't live here anymore

That ain't country in their voice
They ain't no local boys
Landlord's daughter is at the door
Saying we don't live here anymore
We're off the script, we're off the lease
Can't catch any decent sleep
Let it flood, let it pour
We don't live here anymore

We don't live here
We don't live here
We don't live here anymore

Been working hard to the bone
Face down, nose to the grindstone
If God is working, I'd wish he'd say so
Maybe he don't live here anymore
Glad I've got you here with me
Down in hell's half acre's infirmary
Hear that broom go across the floor
But we don't live here anymore

Jakob Dylan,"Moonlit girls hiding in the dunes
Stars are falling like rockets in ruins
I'm in the meadows where the roses bloom
The orange blossoms shaking loose
Lovers talking like lovers do
Summer's twilights had them fooled

Yonder come
Yonder come
Yonder come the blues
Clap your hands, stomp your boots
Yonder come the blues

My feet are planted in the waist-high reeds
In the shadows in the shape of trees
Through the kingdom's smoky leaves
You'd be laughing too if you could see
On the outskirts long and lean
Not baring gifts on a jet black steed

Yonder come
Yonder come
Yonder come the blues
Ain't no rumor, it's simply true
Yonder come the blues

A dozen fingers and an easy touch
Throwing ashes in the pixie dust
Locked and loaded right off the bus
It's got us numbered, the two of us
Sing that gospel and get your thrills
Raise the roof off and strike the bell
You'd be dancing too if you could tell
It's waking up and coming out of it's shell

Down the boulevard sirens pass
Into the underworld deep and black
With brass and ladders, pick and axe
Down the stairwell through the blast
Single file out, don't be last
Not every one of us is coming back

Yonder come
Yonder come
Yonder come the blues
Move on back and let them through

Jakob Dylan,"Now I woke up this morning and I looked all 'round
'cause then I realized she'd left this town
Oh mama come home oh mama come home
Oh mama come home your daddy is all alone
 
There's no one now to warm my bed at night
All my days are long and sad and filled with trouble and strife
Oh mama come home oh mama come home
Oh mama come home your daddy is all alone
 
Your daddy is getting worried so blue I can't see
Cooking for these youngins is slowly killing me

And your picture in a frame

And the men, they will whisper your name 

Umbrellas will be open
On a hill side of grace
The children will be dressed up 
And chase each other in the rain

And there's gonna be a darkness

Where the angels have lulled you to sleep 
They swallow you whole like a whale
From your head to your feet

Jakob Dylan,"I'm packing up to sing my songs, all these towns blend into one,
I'm somewhere in Madrid.
I got here on crowded trains with old guitars and a famous name,
Running like a kid, I'm running like a kid.
I carry 'round this old backpack full of CD's and Kerouac,
Living on the road.
I left my heart on the coast of Wales with the boy I met at The Last Hotel
But I had to let him go.

And that's when I was searching, I'm not searching anymore
And that's when I was learning about the things worth living for
Before I was open, before I knew I couldn't live a day
Without you
Without you

So I moved out west where the starlets play on the boulevards of West LA
And I tried to make a name.
But it never felt like home to me so I drove three days back to Tennessee
In a slow and steady rain.

And that's when I was searching, I'm not searching anymore
And that's when I was learning about the things worth living for
Before I was open, before I knew I couldn't live a day
Without you
Without you

Without you in the morning, to love me another day
Without you in the evening, when the colours start to fade
Without you on the plane ride to hold my hand and pray
Without you standing here when you could've walked away

Now I'm not searching, I'm not searching anymore
But I'm, I'm still learning 'bout the things worth living for
I am here, I am open, and now I know I couldn't live a day
Without you
Without you

That feels so right

Each time we touch, you thrill me so
It means so much, so much

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Screwball; Poet, KL...introducing Matrix
Back up, I'm 'bout to wage out
I'm 'bout to pull my shit
Clit a spip out
y'all niggaz don't know nothing about
The dangerous routes
The roads I travelled, the walls, the battles, the coke
The spots, the money, the rains that fall from the top
And still survive the bust shots
Spit flames; Niggaz gettin' slaughtered in flames
'Shit's not a game
I'm flowin' like a hurricane
I come through you town and let murder rain
Acid from the planes
When it's time to bang I bang out
I'll leave you on the corner with your fuckin' brains out
Creep up on you were you love to hang out
Like Old Dog and Kane when they pulled them thangs out

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Walk like a gangsta; talk like a gangsta
Gats done squeezin'; make 'em buck like a gangsta
Though cats; grillin' em
Bad bitches fillin' em
Thuns keep it real with em
Bitch niggas; killin' them

We live life like niggaz who can die any day
But you forget it's heaven, but we lie anyway
Smoke live ever lade, three times everyday
We spark three Scotts, my climb all day
My light in all directions, move in all ways
I travel like smoke that creep through hallways
Seep through doorways... cracks and crevices
My gage just die from lack of
How many niggaz that you know that can mop a D?
Know we dead ass won't, won't, won't, cop the pleat
But then you never met a nigga that's as cocky as me
Pull a flame, throw it out, make 'em drop and then freeze
Let 'em know I ain't playing; pop one in his knee
Have his team and cops come gunning for me
Have gat men coming; have 'em running from me
Where them missiles come from?
From Matrix be	, nigga

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[KL]
Ay yo, I'm low key
What the fuck you look like tryin' approach me?
Put your brains out on the ground with the debris
I rob with each, my whole click cop your squeeze
We don't get money niggas, fuck them petty thug niggas
I'm that gangsta nigga; pop slugs in your wick
I'm that gangsta nigga; said fuck what you did
I'm that gangsta nigga your bitch want to be with
New gel like hair grease
Just leave it on a small piece
But the picture's bigger than you
I'm living from Screw, Lou!
Open the gates 'cause I'm sending 'em through
I got the semi and the Henny and a mob that smash
All you over night thug niggaz just won't last
Got enough thuns and gun that'll come and blast
We could duck on you bitch ass niggaz and keep our freedom
Murk you on the low and tell your click when we see 'em
Fuck y'all, kiss our ass, we got cash now!

Jakob Ruthberg,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak with no restrains
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away, into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way, into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanation, no questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak",I Let the Music Speak,2014

Was läuft Jalaal es gibt neues von draußen
Fünf von den Jungs haben wir einer ist weggelaufen
Mach dir keine Sorgen, wir kriegen alle für dich
Muss Bruder wir bewahren dein Gesicht
Ansonsten ist hier draußen auch nicht viel los
Ein Leben mit Risiko sonst kommst du nie hoch
Was soll ich dir erzählen du weiß doch wie es ist
Zähl so viele Scheine du kannst bevor du sitzt
Wie sieht's drinne aus ich weiß du traust keinem
Denen, denen du traust die sind jeden Tag am Weinen
Seitdem du weg bist will die Sonne nicht mehr scheinen
Jalaal der Tag wird kommen wir werden vor lachen weinen
Ich schwöre auf die Träne meiner Heimat
Wenn du raus kommst bist du ein reicher Mann
Du bist mein Auge Jalaal du bist mein Blut

Alles klar Bruder? Wie gehts es dir?
Danke Bruder mir geht es gut. Wie geht es dir Xatar? Was gibt's neues?

Ach was mach kein Scheiß
Ich schwör's dir. Zieh's dir rein

Danke Bruder für alles was du machst

Kümmer dich bitte nur um meinen Bruder

Bruder er will so sein wie wir uns viel Para machen
Er macht Fehler und das haben wir auch gemacht

An dem ich rauskomme und mein Tochter ist acht
Acht Jahre alt und hat nie einen Vater gehabt
Es gibt Dinge die machen dich fertig
Doch ohne meine Tochter erträgt's mein Herz nicht

M'a laissé sans voix
Elle est là dès que je suis triste
C'est ma seule échappatoire
Elle me guérit, me donne l'énergie
Je m'évade quand elle me parle
Elle est ma devise dans la vie

C'est quand j'écris, que j'exorcise
Mes peurs, mes erreurs

Elle pourrait s'écouter
En toute circonstance
A tout âge elle nous fait vibrer
Elle nous met parfois en transe
C'est dans la nuit, oh, qu'elle nous séduit
Elle est là dans nos ébats
Pour que l'harmonie se dessine

Certaines ont le pouvoir
D'éveiller les consciences
D'autres font parties de l'histoire
Au-delà des différences
Elle nous unit, nous épanouie
C'est elle, qui nous guide

La musique fait battre mon c?ur
Une voix qui vient de l'intérieur
Je suis avec elle à toute heure

Que c'est fâcheux
Quelle tragédie, quel tracas
Mon dieu que c'est vache
Mon amoureux est reparti là bas
Mon dieu que c'est triste

Tu t'es joué de moi
Mon dieu que c'est cloche

Ramène-moi

Si vaniteux
Qui ne peignait que moi

There goes the girl I'll now be a fool about 
Ring down the curtain, I'm certain at present

Don't even know if she has been spoken for. 
If she is tied, the ties must be broken, for 
Life can't be that way,to wake me then break me

You can at least do this, 
Sometimes a boy encounters resistance 
Help me to win this miss.

Then they ask where you coming from
Like you the only one feeling how you feeling
Then you lie just to make it sound appealing
To him and her and even the family
That you keep close, just to blow the steam like Stanley
You the one that have to plunge in the back
Praying people in the front don't figure where you at
I get that, used to pray for the feeling, I don't miss that
I was stuck for a while, I'll admit it
The same damn thing, that you feeling man I get it but
I'm past that now, I sip this crown I don't mix no sprite
Only sip brown when I'm cooling with my niggas
So bitch go figure, its that kind of night, alright?

I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I fuck you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
Well fuck you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help

Maybe if I had some diamond rings and nicer things
And wider cream, and smaller dreams, the simple things
That would have brought money more quickly
Maybe then you'd get the picture
But even then still snapping for my niggas
Swear I'm always on the phone tryna make sense of figures
Cause the nigga that got it ain't never been the one to spend it
You get it? Neither do I
The thought suicide for the money
We just call it being hungry nowadays
Every nigga getting paid, just a couple getting laid
If the chips fall right and the dick alright
Can I stay all night?
I can lie pretty well
Cause you posting all of my songs
Knowing pussy gonna sell

I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,

Si tu sais compter dis moi combien pèse mon âme
N’oublie pas mon passé et le poids de mes drames
Si tu sais compter dis moi combien pèse mon âme

Car de nature je suis en marge
Un jour j’ai souffert le martyr 
Je crois que c’était un lundi

Alors je rêve d’amnésie 

Prends mes bonnes actions pour faire contrepoids 
Je sais que la liste n’est pas longue
Mais après tout c’est déjà ça
Je me débarrasserai de ma bagnole, 
De ma maison, de toutes mes babioles
Je te filerai même un bifton’ si tu oublie mes années folles

Dass die Bullen uns nicht provozieren
Und aus Langweille auf uns eintreten
Weil wir aussehen, wie Ausländer

In nem Viertel wo die Sonne nicht scheint
Wo die Hoffnung schnell verloren ist und der Teufel dich treibt
Wo der Exit nicht mehr nahe liegt
Wo die Freunde meiner Jugend noch mit 30 jeden Tag nur chillen und Karten spielen
Was zu schaffen ist dort irrelevant

Manche Leben noch in Freiheit, manche sind schon gefangen

Jede Schlampe modelt Agentur, Instagram
Jeder dritte Ist ein Fitness-Fan
Doch wenn die Kugeln fliegen ist egal wie viel du Spinner stemmst
Spuck weiter große Töne in dein Studio
Doch sehen wir uns persönlich red ich nicht, denn ich fick dich Cem

Immer unterwegs und dann wieder Stress mit dem Album
Erst will sie den Ehering, dann will sie die Scheidung
Breakfast bei Tiffany, gemeinsame History
Die Stimmung, sie ist permanent explosiv, die Chemie Nitroglyzerin
Sie weiß, dass ich fremdgeh', ich sag' nicht einmal sorry
Sie weiß, dass ich fremdgeh', ich sag' nicht einmal sorry
Airmax im Lexus, sie hat gern Sex im Lexus
Fünf K für die Airbags auf ihr'm Solarplexus
Drei Tage Hotel und dann ab zu Chanel
Sie stellt mir die Eltern vor, danach den Bruder, geht alles zu schnell
Sie schreibt mir bei WhatsApp, ich block' sie bei WhatsApp
Bin grad im Studio und schreib' einen Hit, warum du fickst du mein'n Kopf jetzt?
Ständig im Rampenlicht, bin nicht so der Beziehungstyp
Mach nicht auf Kardashian, Schlampe, du wirst nie berühmt
Erst schick' ich sie weg und dann will ich sie wieder
Genau wie Jasmina, Alina, Sabrina

Sie will, dass ich bei ihr bleib' (hello?)
Liegt vor mir im Designerkleid
Ich lauf' davon in weißen Nikes
Und meld' mich nur von Zeit zu Zeit, yeah
Die Beziehung ist on-off
Die Bezieung ist on-off, on-off
Die Beziehung ist on-off
Die Bezieung ist on-off, on-off

On-off-Beziehung, sie steht zu mir, so wie ich zu der Siedlung Blood in and Blood out
Sex bis zum Morgengrauen, fünf Tausend liegen bar auf dem Tisch, ich kann's ihr blind anvertrauen
Immer vertrauen, sie anzugucken Sightseeing
In den Nike Freeze und tight Jeans
Sie ist loyal, hat es tätowiert
Denn jeder, der sie ansieht, will auch Sex mit ihr
Ah, ich beiß' ihr in die Oberschenkel, ah
Und wir lassen uns von Drogen lenken ah
Alkohol steigert die Promille
Schwanz geht tief rein und testet alle ihre Sinne
Ich hass' es, wenn sie geht, doch lieb' es zu zusehen
Mach' tausend Fotos von ihr, so wie Buscapé
Kauf' ihr Unterwäsche, die sie nachts trägt
Denn alles, was passiert ist ab achtzehn
Ah, wir sind on-off, on-off, doch sie lässt nichts rein, so wie Buffon
Ich bin die Ausnahme, lande die Treffer
Sie gibt einen Fick auf die anderen Rapper
Und selbst wenn sie fickt, vermisst sie mich stetig
Sie rennt durch Clubs und macht gern auf ledig
Bitch, komm, erzähl nicht, hätt' ich den Ring
Wärst du die Erste, die sich schon direkt verehelicht, Realtalk
Wegen dem offenen Beziehungsstatus 
Sind die Bitches hier bei mir im Radius
Doch ich bleib' weiter konsequent
Wär' die Pussy kostenpflichtig, wär' ich Konsument
Wir sind on-off bis dato
Kennen nur Drama, so wie Tony Soprano
Sex in Milano, am nächsten Tag Streit im Hotelzimmer, fünf Minuten später 'ne Umarmung

Sie will, dass ich bei ihr bleib' (hello?)
Liegt vor mir im Designerkleid
Ich lauf' davon in weißen Nikes
Und meld' mich nur von Zeit zu Zeit, yeah

Komm' ich rein, gibt es keinen, der mich ignoriert
Dass ich den Königstitel habe, das ist tituliert
Wenn sich im Süden was bewegt, hab ich's instruiert
Fotzen machen einen auf Blockchef, peinliches Biz
Doch in Wahrheit ist es Frust, weil der Neid sie zerfrisst
Leere Worten, keine Taten weiter sonst nichts
Und am Ende werden alle wie Weiber gefickt
Yeah, über all die Jahre werden Freunde feindlich

Jam & Spoon,"(This one goes out to the one I love) 
I took a ride on a fairy tale road 
I lost my heart there once now I want it back 
I want it back 
I thought that love isn't cool and I... 
Now I am the fool cause it?s not like that 
Now I feel regret 

But, I'm not gonna tell you what I want 
I'm not gonna show it to you 
Find in me baby 
Oh no no 
Find in me baby 
Oh no no 
I'm not gonna show you what I need 
I'm not gonna give that to you 

Find in me baby, oh no no 
Find in me baby 
You got to find in my heart, find in my heart 
Find in me baby, oh no no 
Find in me baby, oh no no 
Find in my heart 
Find in my heart 
Find in me baby, oh no no 
Find in me baby, oh no no 

There's higher love on the one way 
There's more than that on the other 
Should I decide 
Could I decide 
You never know what I want so 
Takes all my spirit to turn on the cuddle light 
I'll turn on the cuddle light 
But, I'm not gonna tell you what I want 
I'm not gonna show it to you

Jam & Spoon,"When you're down and lonely 
And there's no one to call, 
Though you run for someone, 
Who prevents you to fall 
Come again, Come again 
No darkness is the trade 
Come again, come again 
Cause I will make your day 

All you need is an angel 
One is a friend to lean on to 
All you need is an angel 
Telling you something 
That will pull you through 
You don't have to think about 
You don't have to worry, 
Love will never let you down 
All you need is an angel, 
I want to be your angel 

All you need is a word 
One is a call and a kiss or two 
When you're out on your own, 
Think for yourself, 
But an angel will see you through 
You don't have to think about 
You don't have to worry 
Love will never let your down 
All you need is an angel 
I want to be your angel

Little do I know about 
Where you want to be 
But in and out of trouble, 
I hope it is with me

Come again, come again 
And I will make your day",Angel (Ladadi O-Heyo),1995

Jam & Spoon,"Lost in kaleidoscope skies, I am hypnotised
When you look in my eyes
Lost in kaleidoscope skies, I get so high
When you look in my eyes

Drippin' away, when you look in my eyes
In a kaleidoscope of dangle hope
And chrystal lullabies
You've spoken truth, you've spoken lies

Now I finally realize
Don't tell what you speak with your eyes",Kaleidoscope Skies,1997
Jam & Spoon,"Wake up see the morning light
This is you
This is today
You try so hard to get it right
Can't help thinking somewhere you lost your way
When was the last time
You saw a smile?
There's a scream on every silent face you see
They're singing set me free
I got a friend
Who burns like a fire
Says there's only one thing you'll ever know
It's out there somewhere
Way past the sunset line
Way out on the open road
And me I'm always looking down
Down that road out of town
Each morning and night
You can see me
I'm singing set me free
Set me free
Goodnight auberge
I leave you now
You must sleep
While I work the day
Till I return
To dream of you
Through the night
And that free, freeway",Set Me Free (Empty Rooms),2004
Jam & Spoon,"There she goes, a real life reverie
Every move a pose, every curve a melody
There she goes, little can you know
You're just another dish on her menu

'Cause she gathers glances
Puts them in her basket
Bathes in them and soaks herself
When she is all alone, all alone

She's addicted to your stares
But you could fade for all she cares
Your admiration gets her high
Just the thought of it can make her sight

She's a mirror lover, a mirror loving lady
She don't need a lover, get the message, baby
She's a mirror lover, a mirror loving lady

She breathes it in, fills her lungs with more
Of your devotion, that is all she needs you for
Fills her tank, sips on words like wine
Saves the rest for when you're gone tonight

'Cause she gathers glances
Puts them in her basket
Bathes in them and soaks herself
When she is all alone, she's all alone

She's addicted to your stares
But you could fade for all she cares
Your admiration gets her high
Just the thought of it can make her sight

She's a mirror lover, a mirror loving lady
She don't need a lover, get the message, baby
She's a mirror lover, a mirror loving lady

One-woman show
Her aphrodisiac is her desired reflection
One-woman show
You're just her appetizer
You won't feel or taste her either

Jam & Spoon,"Ten thousand times, I couldn't make up my mind
Heard one million rhymes and stepped over a few lines
But now I felt sure, I wanted more of this
But what I felt for, left me in such a bliss
Where have you gone
Cuz you're, where I belong
But you're, where I can't be
And I, can't even see
Anything, anymore and I feel so sore
I feel so sore

And if you could be here I wouldn't need none of this, believe me
I can't disappear here, let me just leave all of this
Let me leave all of this way behind
Way behind

Since I've been back, I've been on your track
Trying to make up for the love I lack
It's a shame and a fact
I thought opposites attract
Well I was wrong, for so long
But it's so long gone
And I can't hold on, to what my own soul wants

If you could be here I wouldn't need none of this, believe me
I can't disappear here, let me just leave all of this
Let me leave all of this way behind
Way behind

And if you could be here I wouldn't need none of this, believe me

Jam Hsiao,"I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do.
I could never see tomorrow,
But I was never told about the sorrow.

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again.

I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by.
We could never see tomorrow,
No one said a word about the sorrow.

How can you stop the rain from falling down?

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Jam Session,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing

Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland

And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,

And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.

Can't you see that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

My hat from my glove

About the way life change
How women used to like to wear decent clothes
Now they curse like men and dress like hoes
You supposed to be a virgin til you marry
But teenage girls find it normal to carry a baby
Babies havin' babies
Rappers like me always disrespectin' ladies
Wonder why its like that, well so do I
But I just turn my back and then I go get high
Cause I get paid real good to talk bad about a bitch 
And you bought it, so don't be mad I got rich
Ask your grandparents, is life the same
Man thangs change

There used to be a time when old folks were respected
Kids talkin' back was never accepted
Get spanked and your mouth got washed out with soap
But kids nowadays will curse out old folks
Then you tell me I need to be a role model
And get these babies off the 40ounce bottles
But I'm not the one who made alcohol legal
Liquor stores on every corner that's why we go
Buy 40 ounces and go get drunk
Don't respect our kids, like no good punks
And then they grow up to be hardcore criminals
Shoot 'em up, slang dope always pimpin hoes
I know its those that don't believe what I'm sayin on the mic right
So Baby D won't you tell them what its like

Its kinda hard comin' up as a youngster
Gotta deal with the roof that I'm under
Even though my moms got it hard
My daddy passed away, now I'm stuck without a father
But times have changed bro
I never ever seen Santa Claus comin' through the ghetto
But you know what I always see
I always see the white man robbin' the black man back G
And I don't even get in trouble for it
And I don't see nothin' forward
Always tryin' to beat the black man to death
Punk police want to hide behind your badge
Always tryin' arrest somebody
All we gotta do is beat him with the billy club
Here I come, I comin' with my gun
I'm shootin' in the head police now what

I tell you life is too short for it to be like that
We gotta be leaders, can't follow the pack
With all them fiends in the streets smokin' crack
What you give life is what it gives you back
Cause money in the ghetto ain't nothin' new
But when you get the money gotta know what to do
Buy you a business or buy you a house
Just so the police can't wipe you out
I heard it in the streets, they say you the man
So try to help your brothers and lend a helpin' hand
Now what we gone do

We came to stack some bodies, killin' everybody like John Gotti
I said we came to stack some bodies, killin' everybody like John Gotti
Now run up and get gun up the slack black
I'm hittin' blackjack in the casino when I mack slap
What you want to play like Al Pacino with this
Type of style with the lyricist this funk of hits
And the biscuits I drop
Motherfuckers know I come down and show me ?
I don't really care
From the front or the rear
Word to your mother I'm bout to smother and smear
Its that master all I intelligent
Chain that I swing from the others is irrelevant
For you motherfucker step up to the m-I-see
I'm down with Shorty, Ant Banks and Mally G
Its Malik and I freak it's obsolete
My technique motherfucker know I flow over beats 
Like water, slaughter dick in yo daughter
And my nuts up in her jaws when she suckin' on my balls
Yiggy y'all niggas best to ask somebody
Cause I'm shootin' motherfuckers down with the shotty
Its the motherfuckin' master blaster
Its, its the motherfuckin' ghetto bastard",Thangs Change,1995
Jamal,"1995.
Crack the bubbly
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Yo, word is bond

Yo, look who just jumped up on the scene
Pocket full of green, but in leather and all
I be's that nigga named Jamal
Mackin' hoes in the tight clothes with pretty toes
Kickin' flows for all the rowdy bros and it goes, look
1, 2, to the breaker 1-9-9-5
Jamal representin', keep it live
It don't matter how I come on these funk raw tracks with raps
We bout to still make snaps
We got bitches for days, rich as it pays
Damn shits changed since back in the days, get money
And my mouth is where the blunt stays blazed
And I get dazed to kick a phrase to amaze
I'm gettin' busier, leavin' hoes dizzier
Than they even been with the grown men
Is he a straight looney type of nigga
That'll drop the temperature?
Bitch, I ain't really into ya

Chrous:

To all the tramp goldiggers
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all
To all the misrepresenters
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all
To all the bitch ass niggas
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all
To all the tramp goldiggers
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all

I drop the lines above your mind y'all
When I be comin' on that ill tip
My whole crew pack nines, don't make me have to kill shit
Uh, I bring the flavor to you ear
Smash and trash MC's from the front to the rear
In '95 until, I still kick the ill lyrical miracles
Leavin' rappers hysterical
I keep it raw and when I got the gat I hit'em all
And on the M-I-see I rip'em all
Yeah, word up, this is dedicated to my peeps
on 6-0 and 6-1 on the Illedelphiatic streets
Take it to the recently deceased 
H-Town, Tall D, rest in peace
Word is bond, as the beat heat up
Psychotic thoughts starts to lead up
I got the sauce to make the Billboard bullet speed up
Yo, word up, right on, Jamal gots the vibe y'all
And that's the deal on the real, I gets ill y'all
It's Philly's finest behind this doin' damage
No matter how scandalous they can't handle this, handle what?
Underground sound, I stick my dick in the ground
And I turn the whole world around!
And blow the sun up, word is bond, we blow the sun up
Niggas they run up, tryin' to stop the come up and get done up
Put your guns up, I blaze your buns up when I rock your spot
Niggas they all stiff when the red dots to they knot

-Shook Ones pt. 2 -Mobb Deep

Verse 1:
Take it to another level of mic murdering
I'm dippin' off the bom bom zee it seems to me lifes slipped
Yeah it's kind of hard not trippin' on these phoney MC's
I'm a resort to gun grippin', blastin' killin' niggas
Jamal is the real raw dog bill a nigga
So many motherfuckers rappin', yappin' about scrappin'
Marley use to strappin' bust in caps 
And dust 'em al off nigga break north
Fuck these bitch ass niggas cause they all soft
Fakin' moves over hoes
Switch they dress code and mode
And now they want to impore, up in the game
But I'm a blow they ass out the frame
And do it for my niggas fuck the money and the fame

Hook 

Verse 2:
Marley G drop the sickedest rhymes are the wickedest
Beat to the many motherfuckers that can get with this
Peep how I demolish, abuse fools that run up on me
I'm gettin' busy by my lonely
For the 9 nickle I'm a get ill like sickle
Cell anemia when I be gettin' technicle
On the M.I.C. I represent and kill shit
Fuck the stressin' I only spit real shit
And niggas best to recognize no time for bullshittin'
Keep your eyes on the prize
So what I'm after is long term like satin
Everlastin' weed and it's all guaranteed
For me to wreck shop on behalf of my people
As long as I'm alive I'm gonna live illegal

T-ree F Squad
Muddy Waters
Don't get it twisted nigga

Aiyyo everybody in this motherfucker will get touched
Fuck such and such, I roll tight like handcuffs
Rock that ass to sleep with discrete techniques
I beez that, freak of the week like I made Knee Deep
Hold up! Rotate around the solar, badder than Cobra
Composure never sleeps, my stream pumps Folgers
I'm sauteein MC's with fried rice up in the wok
Without the MSG and chopped celery
See, I made it, my flavor situated
From the nickel plated mic that's hot, to leave your brain inflated
Plus, I'm thick like Quakers on papers
Bodacious MC's get turned to lower cases
Lettering, and the medicine, that I'm swallowin
Get you hollerin, like Marvin Gaye when his father shot him
In the chest, I roll with two stacks of Tecs
And mad niggas in sets that'll roll up in your rest
UHH! Mister Fantastic's crafted off that 50 sack of ass kick
When I'm blasted, my mathematics get drastic
That you can't see with bifocals
Watchin MC's go up and down like stock brokers
I leave your brains on tilt, with ill skills that's milk
That's rougher than jeans that Gloria Vanderbilt
I'm poppin mad shit, plus I can back it
Your man'll be like ""Yo, get that dust off yo' jacket""

It ain't a test or quiz that my Squad can win
Those who know the biz, know we wreck kids, get biz
You'll digest, multiple stab wounds to the chest
Then I copycat, kill the rest
With no method to my madness
Bless the apparatus with the baddest
Determined to be the last man, standin on the planet
You'll get attached, like a blood suckin' leech
When you fall into my rhythm of speech
Your ears get embraced with a touch of the bass
Head get wrapped up, neck get thrown in a neck brace
Rough rhyme mechanical, lyrical at it who?
Will ironically chronically murder you and your crew
My directive, through where I live, is kinda primitive
See I get to the bottom of the problem, and make shit give
Step in the jam, hooded and high, plastered the master
Cast to the masses grabs the mic
Ten dollar rappers is what L.O.D. goes after (Tweek, Tweek)
To my Squad, there's no matches, we bashes
Do photo flashes in all flavor S-classes
Bomb attack on wax, lyrical mini mac to your back
Tie you up, throw you in the Ac'

Here to kill your whole scene and your motherfuckin team
Little 'Mal, the raw dawg, I know you heard of me
You probably know some bitch niggaz who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fucky with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggaz talk about killin and never get to it
Fuck the yappin, be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggaz better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin way too slick
See em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us

Droppin degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme
I don't give a fuck I kill em with just one rhyme
Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin dues
And I'ma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin but the real it's
tight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?
Niggaz act shifty so I shift a long
three tri three chrome, it's the same ol song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar Pah
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back

Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, blasted, my Magnum P.I.
Oops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, heavens to fuckin Merkatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
with a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
you start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
raw water turn sons to grandaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha!  I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey do your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter

Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggaz ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggaz always got somethin smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggaz is pussy and ways and actions show it
Most of y'all niggaz dead, and don't even know it

Act trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife


Aiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G
Redman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad
Next up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell
First up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout
Lord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous
Busta Rhymes

Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P.
Niggaz and bitches be eyein me
I'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile
I'm great distance like AT&T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
a hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back

For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and lose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six
For you mindless, niggaz I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
lineups, on LSD fine fust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggaz, we're like Afghanistan guerillas

If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggaz groovin
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggaz blastin off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon
It's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!

While they runnin they face, I'm lettin the plan bake
Formulate, now look at the plot, we got
More and more shit that's hot, show to rock the spot
Clock or knot, nigga the whole pot
Ready or not, we comin, snatchin every comer
Witcha ho in the Benz-O, dumbin like a motherfucker

You can be my lady, you could even be my lollipop sucker
The road dawg baby comin like the mad trucker
Lot of jealous niggas lookin funnier than Chris Tucker

Not a problem my squad can't fix
Cause we can do, it in the mix
So when you niggas talk trash, you can get a bust ass

This is how we ride, throw your hands from side to side
It's party time, and don't forget get yours, cause I'mma get mine

Ridin dirty, and bustin like thirty-thirty, til a nigga end
Knowin that the shit is fucked I'm still here to win (what?)
Cheddar (uh) if you ain't about it then I think you better
Hang the little plot you got, don't sweat it main
My nigga, my life's uncut like Kane, real raw
Y'all don't know shit about Jamal or what I'm in it for:
Cash, cars, fly whores and tours
Fillin my pipe, with no messes and no limits
Them other one scrimpin, has the tent froze frigid
Fraud as a gimmick, dick lickin chasin chickens
I mash for the cash with the click and
Rip a show then I'm dippin in the whip and high trippin

While y'all niggas hoppin and skippin I stick the clip in, yo
Accelerate on the gas, move fast
Blast, find a nigga FOOT in your ass
Colorful niggas, just peep the whole contrast

Bust your shit up, what the fuck, nigga get up
Violate, niggas get they whole SHIT lit up!
Break fool, niggas know the rules, rob jewels
Champagne bath, throw the Moet in the pool
Nigga caught a motherfuckin strain on the brain
Ridin on the train, I'mma whip a Benz in the rain
Oversized click on the rise so realize we be
Dem niggas that dead up all you funny little small fries
The franchise, Flipmode damagin all of you fall guys

Yeah, now, now is you motherfuckers ready for this, c'mon
Do you really think you ready for this, c'mon
Do you know that you ready for this, huh
We gonna see if you ready for this

I be the street sweeper, nigga
Quick to leave your whole block shook an' shot at
From fuckin' round with the Midack
Eleven, twenty-four, act 47

Fuck who's standin' around them get close up and down an'
I done came here to get brains
Shoot you twice in your stomach
Then leave your boxin' shorts full of shit stains

You're, bitch maid, you ain't a gangsta, you a sucker ass
These niggaz, scared of your bark, but bitch I touch ass
And bust back, what's that, it's face mob in effect
With Icarus, Reggie, Jamal and Treach

I told you that talkin' wasn't shit to me
So bitch be more specific when you spit for me
It ain't shit to me, you a hoe in fifth degree, a discharge from a dick
Disease, you lil' maggot, part time thug for a faggot
Plastic ass chump, you don't want no static

Real niggaz, louder, real niggaz, louder, louder
Real niggaz, yo, real niggaz

Yo, yo, yo, it's Funk Doc, I thought you knew
P P P in the back an' they parkin' to, jump
Thorough borough, bricks, ashy elbow kid
I fuck chicks off Elmo Flicks

My tape is off safety, tongue the gun
Mouth to barrel, I spit, it numbs the front
So what cha, what cha wanna, yo, my boys is beastie
We grew up untamed, unemployed an' eatin'

You sharks in the water, avoid the deep end
We only fuck chicks that enjoys the beatings
Young Ike Turners, disco inferners
Concentration camp, nobody turn up

I roll up a X that came with kits
Leave you with nightmares, Dana Dane was with
I can train yo' bitch, with a chain an' whip
It blow the block down while I change the clip

Yo, don't approach me wrong, little kids call me 'Smokey-mon'
'Cause the blunts that I light set off smoke alarms
And I stand on the corner 'til my coke is gone
Niggaz, wanna get they ice picks, poke the don

But they know I got a gun big as Oprah's arm
And I know a old lady, that'll choke their moms
A attitude, that's what I don't walk without
Nigga, I'ma time for it, you just talk about

Ic is the man, and I never been to Japan
Got a Japanese bitch, with my dick in her hand
This is the plan, I'm about to get in the van
Go and get rid of the man, I done did it again

Skunk I blow, then off to the trunk I go
Pull the pump out slow, dump out foe
I'm the nigga, that the streets raised
I'm the nigga, that'll make 3-ways outta nigga PJ's

The nigga, that'll smack the shit out the DJ
If he don't give Icarus shit a replay
Poker flush, y'all niggaz joke too much
And my gun got cancer, it smoke too much, we

Real niggaz, louder, real niggaz, louder, louder
Real niggaz, yo, real niggaz

First of all, you gotta have balls unlike some who act hard
I was real ever since I shot out my pops black balls
I'm real, I can sense danger and tap calls
I'm real, I feel when haters wanna clap mal

I look a nigga, eye to eye when I speak
I'm transparent, I can see if you a killer or a freak
Or a bitch that'll do anythin' to get rich
Or a snitch that'll drop dime on the click

Or a fake, that'll rather see me at my wake
Or a Jake tryin' to infilitrate, give me a case
I'm real like, bitch, get the fuck out my face
I'm real like let me stick my dick in ya mouth, give you a taste

I'm a real nigga, if I don't get no bigger
I'm five five, still knockin' out tall, niggaz
We real niggaz plottin' on dummies with tall figures
Real niggaz. hands on forty caliber triggers
Bullets hummin', real like Redman's fifth comin'

Trigger Treach
Bastards blunts, Buddhas bullets, black gats is the lingo
Fuck a jolly jingle, old bitches break for Bingo
Christmas time I crack Yak, an' Kris with Kringle
Gettin' funk from Nymphos an' scratch my nuts witcho' single

Who's the game scratcher minus the rap masters
Name is Hey, with the Gay-G after
My thugs on the street with the heat, listen to me
See them diamond D.M. medallions, snatch, you give 'em to me

Mally G's a part of me, Icky slips his ownself Mickies
In crowded armories, fuck with Redman
You're a dead man at the robbery
You'll be, Adebisi greasy, put him on to me, fuck that

I'm a throwin' flames Fanatic, bashin' brains come at it
Beat you with the shit that they used to frame the attic
Your skank-ass, go 'Voo-doo', poodle-wig wearin' rashy
Rusty and trusty, musty wack nasty

Jackal and some weeds, honey
Uh, when you come around
Oh, you make me feel so good
So good life, honey
Honey, honey, honey

Let me know if I could steal your heart away from you
Let me be and tell the girl you’re on a dream
Honey, dream
Even the lights gonna light but the atmosphere’s right
Can I get a little friction kind of sticky note, quickly wanna fool around
Fool around, fool around

She had a long day, I said I’m on the way
She told me come through and don’t forget the foreplay
Of course I’m tryna beat it like a court case
But I’m not a player, now that’s just my record forte
She got me tempted to taste it like it’s gourmet
Honey drippin slow like that Ohio playa’s album cover
Or like some sorbet in the middle of summer heat
No shelter went underneath of that fountain from her
She love me and like her back
I swear we make a perfect match
Got my hand on the bible flat
Iron mat, winkle out
Stretch to the kings
Is out of mustard mix, she started to be the only one I think about
Dream about nightly too, I met her team in ‘92
Let’s sip a little ’90 proof

See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

I've seen trouble all my day. 
I bid farewell to old Kentucky, 
The place where I was born and raised. 
(The place where he was born and raised )

For six long years I've been in trouble, 
No pleasures here on earth I found. 
For in this world I'm bound to ramble, 
I have no friends to help me now. 
(He has no friends to help him now.)

It's fare thee well my old lover. 
I never expect to see you again. 
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad, 
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.
(Perhaps he'll die upon this train.)

You can bury me in some deep valley, 
For many years where I may lay. 
Then you may learn to love another, 
While I am sleeping in my grave.
(While he is sleeping in his grave.)

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger 
My face, you'll never see no more. 
But there is one promise that is given 
I'll meet you on God's golden shore.

Well damn, how the hell you think we livin?
How you think it feel to be a Simmons
Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving
People want to know why I ain't on my brother's label

If I did this whole rap game be unstable
Went over to Arista wit Mr. Davis, for the change of neighbors
It's only fair that we share those naked papers
You can tell a cat serious about rap and it ain't luck

Never ever  in a million years 
Was this what  I was thinking of 
Crazy  some how it never crossed my mind 
My first friend becoming my first love 

Used to be the one who play with my toys an 
Never would of thought of you as a boyfriend 
If you'd asked who I was looking for  
I would have said someone like the boy next door 
Growing up if you had ever told me  
You'd be the one I'd be wanting to hold me 
I would have laughed and said you were crazy 
Never be with the boy next door 

So hold you, showed you, everything in my life 
When we go cruising in your ride 
So why, was I taken by surprise 
Found love growing in my own backyard 

Playing hide an seek 
In the summer heat 
Didn't wanted to go inside 
Want to hang out until sunrise 
Whenever I was down, never had a doubt 
You wouldn't be in my life

Wanna see me slip up
Cos their man wanna (slurp) me up

I'm here and you are there 
Miles away 

All you gotta do is believe 
That anything you want you can reach 
There's no limit to what we could be 
So open your mind 
And set yourself free 

I believe we fear what we don't know, 
we can be our own enemy 
But if we concord and 
If you took my hand 
I see a girl you see a man 

Everybody has the same dream 
A dream in their heart 
Get a chance to make a life 
Love somebody they won't 
Open your eyes we're all the same 
We won't be scared 
So let's sing together now 
Na na na na 
In this Universal Prayer 

And in this dream I have at night 
That I don't understand the world at all 
You might be right but it seems to me 
That we've come to fight to far 

Cause I believe that fears 
I try to save our souls 
And hardest time will come 
And all this pain will go 
So try to understand 
The precious things I've said 
Every woman every man 

Oh oh na na na na 
Everybody has the same dream 
A dream in their heart 
Get a chance to make a life 
Love somebody they won't 
Open your eyes we're all the same 
We won't be scared 
So let's sing together now 
Na na na na 
In this Universal Prayer 

Everybody has the same dream 
A dream in their heart 
Get a chance to make a life 
Love somebody they won't 
Open your eyes we're all the same 
We won't be scared 
So let's sing together now

If you ever feel like you need,
Someone to be your antidote to lonely,
I'd be quicker than you'd imagine me,
Let me deal wid lonely

Oh lonely don't love you, baby but I do
Lonely don't wanna make you feel good
Not in the way you know I would,
You don't have to entertain lonely
It's getting what it wants when your not with me,
Never let that lonely capture you,
Always know that I'm here for you.

Verse 2:
Lonely don't want you happy,
Lonely don't want you next to me,
Lonely doesn't wanna make a compromise,
Lonely's never going to apologise.

For getting you down, for letting you down,
I could never be like lonely no,
I care too much for my baby,
Never forget that you can call on me.

Leave lonely out in the cold,

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, You gave it away
Well, this year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby don't you recognise me?
Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

(Merry Christmas!) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I Love You"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in her heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Oooh Oooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again coz

Are dried seeds that've sown
