Héctor Lavoe,"Vamos todos a bailar
Al estilo Africano
Si no lo sabes bailar
Yo te enseñaré mi hermano

A ti te gusta la bomba
Y te gusta el baquiné
Para que goces ahora
Africano es el bembé

Che che colé, que bueno e'
Che che cofriza, muerto 'e la risa

Oye tú sentado allá
Pareces venezolano
Ven aquí vamo' a bailar
Que todos somos hermanos

Lo bailan en Venezuela
Lo bailan en Panamá
Este ritmo es africano
Y donde quiera va' acabar

Che che colé, que bueno e'
Che che cofiza, muerto 'e la risa

Ya yo sé que te gustó
Quieres bailarlo otra vez
Bailalo en la punta del pie
Y veras que bueno es

Ya yo sé que te gustó
Quieres bailarlo otra vez
Pues ponte bien los zapatos
Que los tienes al revés

Che che colé, que bueno e'
Che che cofiza, muerto 'e la risa

",Che Che Colé,1973
Héctor Lavoe,"Señores voy a contarles lo que le pasó a Vicente
El era un carterista y le robaba a toa la gente
Pero un día metió la mano adentro de una cartera
Y en vez de encontrar dinero se encontró una ratonera

Ay que guiso, ta' guisando
Sigue guisando que vas muy bien
Hoy encontraste una ratonera
Que vendrá después

Vicente no escarmentaba siguió robando y robando
Pero ya la policía a Vicente lo estaba velando
Y dicen que en la 110 y la esquina Lexington
Allí estaba el escondido, adentro de un zafacón

Ay que guiso, te agarraron
Sigue guisando que vas muy bien
Hoy te cogió la policía
Y mañana el juez

Sigue guisando
Sigue robando

",Guisando,1973

Héctor Lavoe,"Qué problema, caballero
En el que me encuentro yo
Decía Ramón Puntilla
Cuando a su mama llamó

Tengo un pollo sabrosito
Con el que quiero casarme
Pero acaban de informarme
Que no, que no me puedo casar

Porque, es novia de mi amigo
Y eso sí da que pensar
Odio a todos los que aman
Y que felices están

Porque yo, no puedo tener
Un amorcito que me comprenda
Y que me diga papi
Y que me quiera bien (mami)

Dios mío ayúdame, quiero olvidar
Ayúdame, ayúdame
Ayúdame a olvidarla, te lo pido
Ayúdame

Ay, que yo la quiero tanto
Y no, y no la quiero perder

Qué problema con Mariana
El que se encontró mi pana
Y yo que me la pasaba gozando
De la noche a la mañana

Qué problema con Mariana
El que se encontró mi pana
Ramón Puntilla la quería
Ramón Puntilla gritaba

Qué problema con mariana
El que se encontró mi pana
Ayúdame, ayúdame, ayúdame
Ayúdame a olvidarla

Qué problema con Mariana
El que se encontró mi pana
Y se pasaba prendiendo velitas
Toditita la mañana

Qué problema con Mariana
El que se encontró mi pana

Héctor Lavoe,"Aquí ya tienes el amor que prefieres
Aquí ya tienes el amigo que quieres
Aquí ya tienes tu ilusión
Buen cariño y un sincero amor

Aquí ya tienes la ilusión de tu vida
Busca lo mismo dale tu calor
Esa pasión que yo se que enloquece
Dame amor, dame amor, mucho amor

Encontrarás alegrías
Y tendrás felicidad
También sabras de lo bueno
El tiempo te lo dirá

Yo se que piensas que todo es mentiras
Puras promesas solo falsedad
Borra en tu mente esa tonteria
Y verás que todito es verdad

",Mucho Amor,1975
Héctor Lavoe,"Yo era un muchachito cuando murió mi viejo
Fue tanta la miseria que mi viejita y yo
Comíamos llorando el pan mugriente y duro
Que horas de miseria mi mano mendigó

Mi pobre viejecita lavando ropa ajena
Quebraba su espinazo al pie del tinajon
Por míseras monedas con qué calmar las penas
Las crueles amarguras de nuestra situación

Fui creciendo a la bartola y en mis años juveniles
Agarré por el camino que mejor me pareció
Me codié con milongueras me acodé con copetines
Y el mejor de mis amigos cuando pudo me vendió

Engreído me hice el guapo y me encerraron entre rejas
Y de preso ni un amigo me ha venido a visitar
Sólo el rostro demacrado y adorado de mi vieja
Se aplastó contra las rejas para poderme besar

Por eso compañeros con tantos desengaños
No me convence nadie con frases de amistad
Y hoy vivo con mi madre quiero endulzar sus años
Y quiero hacer dichosa su noble ancianidad

Me siento tan alegre junto, junto a mi madrecita
Que es el mejor cariño que tiene el corazón
Ese si que es un cariño que nadie me lo quita
Cariño que no engaña ni sabe de traición

A usted amigo que es tan joven
Le daré un consejo de oro deje farras y milongas
Que jamás le han de pesar cuide mucho a su viejita
Que la madre es un tesoro un tesoro que al perderlo
Otro igual no encontrará

Y no haga como aquellos que se gastan en placeres
Y se olvidan de la madre ni le importa su dolor
Que la matan a disgusto y recién cuando se muere,
Se arrepienten y le lloran, no comprenden su valor

¡Su valor!",Consejo de Oro,1976
Héctor Lavoe,"Las horas que a tu lado yo pasaba
Eran las horas mas felices de mi vida
Son horas que en mi mente van grabadas
Y son horas que jamás nunca se olvidan

La muerte con su poder podrá alejarnos
Y con ella bajaría yo hasta la tumba
Pero mientras en mi ser
Viva mi alma y mi corazón
Mis ilusiones bella existencia serán tuyas

La muerte con su poder podrá alejarnos
Y con ella bajaría yo hasta la tumba
Pero mientras en mi ser
Viva mi alma y mi corazón
Mis ilusiones bella existencia serán tuyas

Serán tuyas, serán tuyas

Oye mamacita linda
Oye lo que estoy cantando
Te estoy diciendo te quiero te quiero
Mamita tu me estas matando

Si Dios un día cégara
Ay toda fuente de luz
El unicerso se alumbraría
Con esos ojos lindos que tienes tu

Tu nombre sigue viviendo
Y vivirá en mi recuerdo
Me acuerdo que te quería
Me recuerdo que te quiero

Mami, mami espérame en el cielo
Espérame vida mía
Pues si en la tierra sufrimos
En el cielo todito sera alegría

Ay hace tiempo que quería
Cantarte esta inspiración
Nacida del alma linda
Nacida del corazón

Si amar es un pecado
Quiero ser pecador
Si querer es sacrilegio
Pues sacrílego soy yo

Ay mami dime lo que quieres
No te puedo dar mas ná
Si ya tu tienes mi vida
Que más te puedo yo dar

Toma mamacita linda
Mira que te entrego aquí
Mi vida, mi corazón, mi alma
Soy todito para ti, Tití

A mi nunca me habian dado

Mas de lo que había deseado

Héctor Lavoe,"Seguro firme y decidido
Buscando u na mejor sonoridad
Agrupamos el sabor con el ritmo
Dándole vida a este conjunto musical

Unidos en una sola pieza
Modernos los rumberos nos vamos a tocar
Rechazando a aquel que nos combate
Y respetando a quien no sepa respetar

Pa' Lante alta la frente
De frente vamos a demostrar
Que no nuestro no fue un golpe de suerte
Somos hacha y machete y esta es la verdad

Héctor Lavoe,"Tu amor es un periódico de ayer
Que nadie mas procura ya leer
Sensacional cuando salió en la madrugada
A medio día ya noticia confirmada
Y en la tarde materia olvidada

Fue titular que alcanzó pagina entera
Por eso ya te conocen donde quiera
Tu nombre ha sido con reporte que guardé
Y en el álbum te olvidó lo pegue

Tu amor es un periódico de ayer
Que nadie mas procura a leer
El comentario que nació en la madrugada
Y fuimos ambos la noticia propagada
Y en la tarde materia olvidada
Tu amor es un periódico de ayer

Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Oye noticia que todos saben, ya yo no quiero leer
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Tu no serviste pa' nada mami, y al zafacón yo te eché
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Echa, camina, apartate de mi vera
Apartate de mi lado
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Tu eres el diario, la prensa, radio Bemba, radio Bemba

Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Para que voy a leer la historia de un amor que no ni puedo creer?
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Te quise, te tuve, te mantuve, pero ya no te quiero
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
A tu casa yo no voy Polito, va y tumbe la chaveta, la chaveta
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
En el álbum de mi vida en una pagina escondida ahí te encontré

Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Anda vete de mi vera cosa buena, ya no te quiero ni ver
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Que te pasa estas llorando, tienes alma de papel
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Y como el papel aguanta todo, así mismo te traté
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Analizate tu historia, y así podrás comprender",Periódico de Ayer,1976

Que me iba a poner a gozar y a vacilar

Timbalero, timbalero

Ella va triste y vacia 
llorando una traicion con amargura

los amores que a tenido le fallaron 
y dejaron en el aire las promesas 
y dejaron en el aire las promesas.. 
Ella va triste y vacia 
llorando una traicion con amargura 
por aquel que le decia

va olvidando sufrimientos del pasado

llorando una traicion con amargura 
por aquel que le decia 
que era su amor y su locura

pero en todo este pasaje de la vida 
ha sabido mantenerse con decensia 
aunque muchos habladores la confundan 
aunque muchos traten de inventar con ella

Héctor Lavoe,"Yo soy la fama
soy tristeza y sonrisa pagada
que con dinero se puede obtener
y escuchen por qué
doy placer y de regreso yo no pido nada
si es  trabajo llegar a la fama
y a la fama poder mantener.

No tengo amigos
y si un amor fácil lo consigo
así de fácil lo he de perder
Mi madre dijo: No creas ser un gran tenorio
pararás es un sanatorio
y allí fama todo has de perder.
 porque yo, yo soy la fama
soy aquel que la gente reclama

Héctor Lavoe,"Con la misma frialdad que tu me das
Que me hace de ansiedad enloquecer
Voy a darle a tu invierno soledad
Una brisa glacial, en cada anochecer

Me iré corriendo de tu frío pasional
Tienes la piel hecha en cristal de hielo
Y me parece que tienes al mirar
Un resplandor sin luz ni fuego

Con la misma ingratitud que tu le das
A ese amor sacrificado en tu querer
De la misma manera que me haces penar
Un día al despertar se que me llamarás
Cuando te vaya mal se que me llamarás

Y sigue, sigue el camino
Oye síguelo hasta luego
Pero yo seré un volcán y tu seguirás en hielo
Tu seguirás mamacita
Oye como un bloque de hielo
Pero yo seré un volcán y tu seguirás en hielo
Pero para ti soy luz
Mamita pa'ti soy fuego
Pero yo seré un volcán y tu seguirás en hielo
Sigue, sigue, sigue sola
Ay frisada en el sereno
Pero yo seré un volcán y tu seguirás en hielo

Mira, mira como vas mamá
Buscando loca el consuelo
Pero yo seré un volcán y tu seguirás en hielo
Porque ahora le llamas tu
Óyeme consuelo al fuego
Pero yo seré un volcán y tu seguirás en hielo

Cuidao, cuidao que te quemo
Pero yo seré un volcán y tu seguirás en hielo

Y tu seguirás en hielo
Loca, loca y sin consuelo
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Buscando quien te desfrize
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Quien te ponga calientita
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Como yo te pongo a ti Tití
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Fuego, fuego que te quemo
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Llorando vas sin consuelo
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Apagale el fuego 
Apagale el fuego 
Apagale el fuego 
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Anda yo le apago el fuego
Y tu seguirás en hielo
Aunque me queme los dedos
Y tu seguirás en hielo

Y allí fue crucificado

Héctor Lavoe,"No me preguntes que me pasa
Tal vez yo mismo no lo se
Prestame unas horas de tu vida
Si esta noche esta perdida
Encontremonos los dos

No me preguntes ni mi nombre
Quiero olvidarme hasta quien soy
Piensa que tan solo soy un hombre
Y si lloro no te asombres
No es por falta de valor

No se, quien eres tu y no interesa
Solo se que mi tristeza necesita tu calor
Y al esconder mi cara en tu cabello
Pensare que solo es bello
Este instante del amor

Pero no, no me preguntes nada
Hazlo si quieres por favor
Bebamos en la copa de la aurora
Y esta noche pecadora
Emborrachame de amor

Haz lo que tu quieras pero
Emborrachame de amor
Emborrachame de amor
Emborrachame de amor

Tendras que ser un gran varon....

He'll close his eyes and the world turns red

She had a smile that made the devil cry
She held is hands, looked him in the eye

Today's the day, you can bet on that
I heard her close the door, she ain't looking back

Well, the answer's over there beyond the wishing well

Take the fire in your hands
And place it at her feet
Walk upon the mountain
Then you'll sail across the sea
Her eyes are taken from the stars above,

Her voice is five hearts breaking
Her voice is five hearts breaking
Her voice is five hearts breaking

The skies are fire and he's waiting to die

Hector Muñoz,"The last to know, party's over and we won't go
No one to laugh at our jokes anymore
There's the door, don't forget your hat.
The stores are all closed, couldn't buy a break anyway
Saint Jude he couldn't save you or me, I suppose

[Chorus]
More miles than money, look at out lives and it's so funny
More miles than money, we fall in love and it's never funny
We're the last, very last to know.

Last to know, we play the jokers in this minstrel show
Cause no one cares in this showbiz crowd anymore.
Got another cigarette, I'm not quite through with this story yet,
Nothing left here that we should fear, I suppose.

[Chorus: x2]

From the cradle to the grave all the memories never saved
Nothing here that we should fear so I'm told.
As the night slips away and we stumble towards another day
There's nothing more that we can say, I suppose.

[Chorus]",Last to Know,1998
Hector Muñoz,"If you found me lost on your porch one night,
Would you take me in and hold me tight?
And wrap a dream around my head,
In case I tumble out of bed?

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time

If you found me hanging without a prayer,
Would you cut me down and lay me there?
And wash the sins off of my hands,
So I might get another chance?

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time

If I lost the buttons on my coat,
And I couldn't find the golden note,
Could I use your hands to find the light,
So I might make it through the night?

So I count my blessings in this world of sin;
The holes in the wall let the cold come in;
Could I use your skin to keep me warm,
So I might make it through the night?

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time",One More Time,1998
Hector Muñoz,"Sometimes I come home,
I don't expect too much
The lights are off now
It's only two

How I wish my breath
It didn't hurt so much
Then you'd be up babe
It's only two

Why don't you sleep?
You look as though you need it
The barricades and reasons
They mean nothing to me
Now they mean nothing to me

Well all my friends they laughed,
They laughed at all my jokes
I got one more story,
It's only two

How I wish my tough
Could erase the past
They you'd be up babe
It's only two

Why don't you drink
You look as though you need one
The barricades and reasons
They mean nothing to me,
No, they mean nothing to me

If these were different times
Then you'd be up,
And we'd trade stories
It's only two

Why don't we pretend?
I's all we have between us
The barricades and reasons
They mean nothing to me, now
Why don't you sleep?
You look as though we need it
The barricades and reasons
They mean nothing to me,
Now they mean nothing to me",Pissed Off 2am,1998

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.

No lo hagas por mí, que a fin el cabo somos solo amigos

Why que sientes con él, lo que en su día tu sentías conmigo

Pero lo dudo
Conmigo té mesías en el aire
Volabas en caballo blanco en mundo
Why esas cosas no podrán volver

why es que lo dudo
Porque hasta a veces me has llorado por un beso
Llorando de alegría why no de miedo
Why lo dudo té que te pase igual con él, igual con él

Anda why ve, entregale
Todo el amor que un día mío fue
Todo lo que te enseñe puedes gozarlo ha su lado
Pero no pienses en mi es un punto ya pasado why olvidado

Yo no te prometi nada que no pudiera cumplir
Te ensene lo que es carino te ensene lo que es vivir pero hasta ahi
Me has llorado por un beso suplicando mis caricias
Asi yo te espero ver parada en la misma esquina mi china

Hello there 
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim 
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you I miss you

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me

con su corazón de grillo.

rebelde y angelical!
¡Así, como es,

con su cara de muñeca.
La quiero así,
con su cabecita hueca.
La quiero así,
con sus sueños de papel.
Y aunque siempre esta en la luna,
no la cambio por ninguna,
yo la siento como el sol en la piel.
Soy feliz a mi manera
y me gusta que me quiera,
así como es.

sin que cambie fácilmente.

Que hoy necesito el recuerdo matar
Sin un amigo, lejos del pago

No es que la llore por que me engaña
Yo sé que un hombre no debe llorar

Esa pampa le diría 
De qué modo la quería
Con qué fiebre la adoré
Cuántas veces de rodillas
Tembloroso yo me he hincado
Bajo el árbol deshojado donde un día la besé
Y hoy al verla envilecida
A otros brazos entregada
Fue pa' mí una puñalada

Y de celos me cegué
Y le juro todavía, no consigo comprenderme
Cómo pude contenerme
Y ahí no más no la maté
Tomo y obligo, mándese un trago
De las mujeres mejor no hay que hablar
Todas, amigo, dan muy mal pago

Now my broken heart's the only thing that's broke about me
So many people should have seen what we got going on
I only wanna put my heart and my life in songs
Writing about the pain I felt with my daddy gone
About the emptiness I felt when I sat alone
About the happiness I feel when I sing it loud
He should have heard the noise we made with the happy crowd
Did my grandaddy know he taught me what a poem was
How you can use a sentence or just a simple pause
What will I say when my kids ask me who my daddy was
I thought about it for a while and I'm at a loss
Knowing that I'm gonna live my whole life without him
I found out a lot of things I never knew about him
All I know is that I'll never really be alone
'Cause we gotta lot of love and a happy home

Magazines are writing stuff but I don't ever read them
Some of the folks I used to know would see and start believing
That I would pass them by on streets and never reach to greet them
I still remember folks even though I rarely meet them
Don't you know I miss the times when we used to hang
Before twenty deep depended on a single man
Before a single heart was broken by a single blow
Before all our careers depended on a single show
I grew up with a lot of love in a happy home
Now I got a lot of cash and I'm on a road
I realize privacy's becoming difficult
It's all right now but what about when I'm old
I know my good friends now they'll last
The same ones that stood by me when my daddy past
All I know is that we'll never really be alone
'Cause we got a lot of love and a happy home

I write a lot of songs will anybody ever read them
You hear them on the radio but will you really read them
Why do we have our idols and why do we wanna be them
After we see them on TV we really wanna meet them
Don't you think they miss the time when they used to hang
Before a fan base depended on a single man
Before a single heart was broken by a single show
Who's gonna stand who's gonna fall I really wanna know
I grew up with a lot of love in a happy home
My daddy use to play me vinyl but now daddy's gone
I used to practice with my mommy on the piano
I still get nervous every time I know she's at a show

I had the perfect dad I wanna be the perfect son

Don't waste my time,
Don't break my balls,

If you find that some survive
But they can't always win

You won't see me drown, when I sink or swim

Sink or swim

Don't spell this out in tears,
Don't play those games, or say these names,
And let your fears.
I told you no means no.
You got your chance, you broke my heart,
It's time to go.

You'll find that some survive
But they can't always win

And I stand up, in the shallow end
You won't see me down when I sink or swim

I just bite a hand that feeds me, instead of loving ones that need me, but I wanted more this time
I was wrong, it's hard to say, at least I learn from my mistakes,
I would change everything (yeah, yeah)

I pray that you'll see what I've become
I would give it all away to write the wrongs I've done
I don't wanna fall for the same mistakes again,
What's it gonna take for this misery to end?
Anything I can do just to make it up to you,
I would change everything

We'll remember the fires
The burning car tires

We'll waste away the weekend with perfect regard for how cavalier we used to be
That beautiful insanity the apathy surrounding me
Don't close your eyes or we'll fade, away

The days we went crazy, the nights wild and hazy

'Cause that's what I said I would do from the start
I'm not alive if I'm lonely, so please don't leave
Was it something I said or just my personality?

And always keep a hand on my pride

I'll make a good day, out of the pain
And if you got a long way down, I'll feel the same
I'll give you shelter, out of the rain

Cause baby you can have it your way
I'll keep you safe and warm you know I'm never gonna stop
Cause babe I think well make it someday

The beautiful, beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the Throne of God

Where bright angel feet have trod
With it's crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God

Washing up its silver spray
We shall walk and worship ever

Lay we every burden down
Grace our spirits will deliver
And provide a robe and crown

Soon our happy heart will quiver

eyes,

shirt sleeves. 
Her body has not truly been stripped til her clothes have been ripped by his nail
bitten fingers, 
Her beauty has not truly been seen til her beauty's been seen by his tired
eyes.

The smallest cruellest insults she ignored his subtle ways.

kiss her eyelids.)

pretend.

Breathing new life in to the sad witch and she promised me three wishes and all I wish is she should remain here.

She is unfaithful to a husband 5 miles away,
She lives alone and she rues her wedding day,

She married beneath herself that's what her girlfriends say.
Her smile is sad but not the saddest I've ever seen,
The saddest smiles are in the dirty magazines,

But you were mighty and graceful when sober, but all that gin, but all that wine.

Just like you've seen me get through these things before.

We will always talk this way,
Tired and slightly jaded,
We will waste our tears and we'll be waiting years,
For the friends who always promised that they'd phone us.

We will always feel this way,
Faintly optimistic,
But we will speak the truth and we will never lose,
Oh the feeling that our hearts could be unbroken.

We will always feel dismayed, it will only ever be OK.

Don't want to wait and see anymore

Told a little truth
About the way she was feeling
She was pulling out the loose threat on her nylon skirt
She was eating far too much chocolate

Both of us being polite

This was not what I meant at all
She said 'You do as I say. But not as I do

It used to go to our heads but then you went to his bed.

You might not go home to him you might stay here with me. 
It is just wishful thinking that all this hard drinking might lure you back to my ramshackle stable,

But she is more beautiful.

I feel heavenly when she says I am heavenly,

And flows over your collarbone down to your breast,
Where my hand lies ever so gently.

And my hand starts to move down your stomach and in between those thighs,
To a soft warm place I call home and may god protect your home.

There's a lady who cries and builds a shrine for a miscarried child,
And a small boy who cries and cries and cries and cries and cries.

To see a friend who I'd almost forgotten,
He gave me hope that I still hadn't lost you,

That we were meant to be.

We had a love that was better unspoken,

But the film wasn't wound on, the camera was broke so all of the pictures were lost.

There was a photo of her face, she looked about 23,
A photo of her grey flannel dress that was cut just below her knee.

The weight of the stars made the night fall down,
Her hair made the whole town swoon,
My heart was led by her pale skinny legs to the mattress in her room.

No matter what my friends say there's no rhyme or reason,
I know I did something wrong.
Oh she had the wit, she had the knack,
The night didn't seem too long.

The freckles upon her back, the grey hairs amongst the black,
The quiver in her lips when she spoke far too quick,
The lines upon her hands.

and i bet that she's got healing hands
But I bet she's never met a man who understands her quite the way that I do. 
And how was I supposed to know that she's the one betrothed, 
To a catholic boy with stronger faith than I,

We love the city because it lets us down, We love the city not the suburbs that surround.
We love all the dirty things, that lead us to think, that maybe true love could be found.
We love the city because its how we live, We love the city cause it never loves us back.
We love it all because sometimes, even though they're hard to find, 
It contains all the virtues we lack.

I am competent, not merely adequate, its impossible for me to be unkind.

Oh curse my mind for not ceasing my mouth when the moment was perfect. 
She said 'Shut up, wake up, I can smell the coffee why can't you when its so near', 
She said 'Hold it, embrace, it these feelings are so real but you just choose to ignore them.'

She drew a picture of me, the likeness was uncanny.

They tell us what to feel, how to love and when to heal.

It's just about this feeling, just about these kicks
It's not the sale of records, not me the shining star
They're just my ways of living, my passions as they are

Watch me play, I just know a few chords on my guitar

It's not about the drugs, not about the booze
Just about rock 'n roll, the energy I use
It's not about the make up, not about being cool
It's all about surviving and music is my tool

Watch me play, I just know a few chords on my guitar
Hear me sing, I just sound like Dylan with a too tight bra

It's not about the glamour, not about the chicks
It's just about this feeling, just about these kicks
It's not the sale of records, not me the shining star
They're just my ways of living, my passions as they are

It's not about what you do, it's all about who you are

Heideroosjes,"If I look around in society today 
I just can't find the words 
I don't know what to say 
Hatred has replaced 
Compassion and respect 
We seem to accept 
Things we should reject
Sometimes I really think 
No one gives a damn 
We teach a lot of rules 
Which we never exam 
So maybe I just should 
Act like one of those 
And punch a harmless granny 
Real hard up her nose
Let's sing a song together 
Cause we are all fucked up 
In a society of violence 
It's better to be locked up
Give me a gun 
I blow your head away 
I just want to kill 
A rich kid today 
Lend me your knife 
And then I'll stab you in the back 
I just like some blood 
It's cool if you can't hit me back
Give me your car 
I'll drive it off a bridge 
I can't return your keys 
They're stolen by a midge 
Spare me some coins 
So I can cope some dope 
I will feed it to your sister 
And hang her on a rope
Let's sing a song together 
Cause we are all fucked up 
In a society of violence 
It's better to be locked up
Oh my god what's going on 
Did we lose it all? 
If we stay intolerant 
Down is where we fall 
Why not put a smile on 
And share a pint of beer 
Everyone is welcome to have fun 
And give a cheer",We're All Fucked Up,2006

Last night a little angel came pumping on the floor

Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long, it don't mess up his hair

I walked the ward with you, babe
A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain, babe
A million times for you

I'd sell my soul for you, babe
For money to burn for you
I'd give you all, and have none, babe

It's good to talk of lighter things
Of brighter times about to come

Something's lifted off of me
Shrugged it's shoulders, went away

What is that light shining
From behind his head
Is the The Chosen One
Or is he just standing in front of the sun

All his life he's been guru-chasing
Mountain climbing, deep soul diving

And those brave, brave words 

Some of us live too hard
Some of die to young
And some are destroyed by what they might have done

A hermit who held no hope
In his withered heart

He lived a life of counterfeit 
Pretending his life was sweet
Let others take chances 
He was too afraid to make

And slowly turning round with nothing but the sound
Of your bare feet on the wooden floor

And lily

Will you ever know
When your time is done

Hands flat to the wall
And slowly trace the boundary 
Of an empty room

Undoing all the silver buttons on my dress
And both untouched by sleep
Me, with eyes wide open
You, in oblivion
Never really making it to the same place at the same time
But I never would've believed that it would end this way 

If you can't hold on tight then let go
And that's all that I know
Maybe today the rain will fall
And the patterns there will show you
Whether to stay or to go

I held you while you cried for the loves you'd lost
And listened while you re-invented your own past
And when I'd had enough and was on my way
You called me back again
You never really wanted me, you just wanted the company
Well, here's another name to add to your mythology

A meaningless sound 

They could sing Gloria
Oh that I am

To trickle through and bathe their empty eyes
Are they not yet aware, would they care if they knew
That they have the power
No they don't move an inch, no they don't raise a hand
To seize their hour

Is that too much to be askin' for,

I wanna love like Johnny and June,
Rings of fire burnin' with you,
I wanna walk the line,
Walk the line,
Till the end of time,
I wanna love,
Love ya that much,
Cash it all in,
Give it all up,
When you're gone,
I wanna go too,
Like Johnny and June,

Like Johnny and June,
And when we're gone,
There'll be no tears to cry,
Only memories of our lives,
They'll remember, remember,
A love like that",Johnny and June,2008
Heidi Newfield,"[Chorus]
Knocked up, shame, shame
I done ruined my family name
Here it comes
What granny's been dreading
Belly full of baby and a shotgun wedding
Hand me down crib and a pick-up truck
That's what you get when you get knocked up

Daddy hes a good looking guitar man
I was his from the very first kiss
I was thinking about me and him making some plans
But I sure wasn't planning on this

[Chorus]

I ain't nothin' but a kid myself
Still figuring right from wrong
Judging by the shape of my figure now
My menacing days are gone

[Chorus]

Rock a by baby don't worry none,
Bout your vineyard daddy done
Poppas gonna love her little one
And all these tears don't mean diddley squat
Then your one day that your momma got, knocked

Knocked up, shame, shame
I done ruined my family name

[Chorus]",Knocked Up,2008
Heidi Newfield,"What can of car does she drive,
Is her hair as soft as mine,
Where does she live
Does she have any kids
Does her touch make you weak

What's it like to love her and to lose me
What kind of perfume does she like
Does she melt in your arms on rainy nights

How long have you known
I've known all along
What do the two of you read
What's it like to love her and to lose me

[Repeat: x2]
I hope she's everything you need and dream about
Don't let what we had keep you on your easy way out
When you lay down with her tonight
We'll see who loses sleep

What kind of car does she drive
Is her hair as soft as mine",Love Her and Lose Me,2008
Heidi Newfield,"5 years since you went way 
Hurts like it was yesterday
Play with fire and your gonna pay
Lord knows I'm tired of pain

I'm sick of living in the past
You took my heart and I want it back
You were my first but you didn't last
You just cause me frustrations
Tonight I'm gonna set myself free
I got my self a new recipe,

[Chorus]
A can or two of gasoline,
One match and a mighty big flame, 
All the heart ache and suffering
Is gonna melt inside of me
A picture book and a pile of your clothes
You and me going up in smoke
A sure fire way of lettin' him go 
Yeah nothing burns like a memory

I gotta bottle of 80 proof
I tell you what were gonna do 
Well its two for me and one for you
Honey heres to liberation
No more pain and misery
I finally found my remedy
And its,

I got an old mustang
I got a small town get out anywhere but here dreams
And an open road
What am I waiting for

Well I'm five years in to a two year plan
Still standing here with the walls closing in
Behind this open door
What am I waiting for

Oh oh what am I waiting for
I stayed here for love watched it disappear
Now there's nothin' but yesterdays holding me here
I can't take no more
What am I waiting for

Oh oh what am I waiting for
Well these blue skies and sunshine and good times
Are mine for the taking
I'm always saying I'm crazy for staying
So what am I waiting for

I can hear God now
From a silver cloud
I got plans for you child
What you worried about
You know life's too short
What are you waiting for

Heidi Newfield,"I know how to hold you till the morning sun comes up
I know how to kiss you till you just ant get enough
I know how to draw you in from across a crowded room
And when you get to me boy I know what to do

[Chorus]
I don't know nothing about this heart ache
I don't know how to watch my whole world walk away
You told me ill survive it someway
So ell me what do I do now, 
When tears fall down
When tears fall down

Now I hear my lonely voice echo off these walls
I listen for the phone but you don't ever call
I lay in a bed alone and still reach out for you
Well this house ain't nothing but cold and empty tomb

Heidi Newfield,"I get dressed in the dark each day
You used to think that was so sweet
By 6:15 I'm in the car driving

I keep my change in the car ashtray
I haven't smoked in years and years
But lately at night I've been craving

I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you

[Chorus]
Something between us changed
I'm not sure if its you or me
But lately all I do seems to wreck you

Every now and then after work
I don't go straight home
I might sit out by the lake and wonder

But I can almost see the face
Of a little blue eyed girl
And the boy who thought he knew everything about her

I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you

[Chorus]

I don't know what the hell you want from me
Is there something or someone I can be
One of these nights should I keep on driving
Drivin'

Cause I don't know how to pull you back
Don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you

Heights,"I see her voice
Inside my mind
I know her face by heart
Heaven and earth are moving in my soul
And I dont know where to start
Tell me tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine.

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like tryin' to catch a falling star

At night I dream and she is there
And I can feel her in the air
Tell me tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine.

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?

Heike Makatsch,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times, 
Doin' things that you don't understand.
 
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.  
 
Stand By Your Man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to 
when nights are cold and lonely.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And tell the world you love him.
Giving all the love you can.
Stand By Your Man.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And show the world you love him.
Keep giving all the love you can;

Might be this better to let it all out

So many times I got lost in my youth to not see
There is one thing I should confront tonight
Might be this better to let it go out of sight

Go out of sight and just forget tonight

Were never to be

Don't take nothing with you but your soul think!

Eating chocolate cake in a bag.

Hein van de Geyn,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Hein van de Geyn,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Hein van de Geyn,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

All you can count on are the raindrops

Hein van de Geyn,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2008

Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

Heir Apparent,"Dark figures dancing madly underneath the moon
Chilling cold of fright surrounds you here
Shivers running down your spine like frigid blades of ice
The wind blows applause throughout the hills
Nighttime brings vague and shapeless visions into view
Images of evil catch your eyes
Danger lies amidst the shadows everywhere you turn
'Cause in your dreams the darkness never ends...

Nightmare - faces in the dark surround you
Nightmare - images of Hell around you
Nightmare - nowhere left to hide
Nightmare - haunting you tonight

Memories of haunting voices burning in your mind
A strange uneasy presence in the air
Your heart pounds, your breath stops, you tremble with fear
Cast into a cauldron of despair
Caught within a wrath of torment every night you dream
Soon you'll be afraid to close your eyes
Imaginary fears are flowing like a steady scream
As you approach your midnight-mare

Nightmare - nowhere left to hide
Nightmare - haunting you tonight

Don't go out alone
Don't go out alone!",Nightmare,1986

I see you smile and look away
I sense a passion burning deep within your heart

Looking for the answer to the question in my mind

Another dream has come and gone
I watch it fade away

And now I wander through the maze of my emotions
Looking for the answer and waiting for a sign

Tell me now - you lead, I'll follow
Will I be with you tomorrow night?

I look into your eyes as you look into mine
I see you smile and turn away

And now I tremble in the midst of my emotions
You are the question and the answer to my dreams

Though the barricades are only in my mind
I can't seem to break through the walls
Even though I am made of steel
Like steel to a fire I weaken and bend in the wind
Create the desire for crossing the wire
I'm laying it all on the line

Crossing the border
Leaving the sadness far behind

Surrounded by anger and fear
I'm the eye of the hurricane
Like a leaf on a tree in the wind
I yearn to break free

You know we doing this for you and yours
St. Paul, Minneap, MIDWEST Heiruspecs, check your map
Work harder at assembling, words that leave 'em trembling
Let 'em ring, keep ripping 'til my lips get chapped
And you are now checking the best sound get down
My new mission in life is to tour and wreck towns
'til the other local niggas get mad and step down
Leave 'em all shook like they got the clap, ha-ha
And I couldn't give a fuck if you're feeling it
I outlined my rhyme book in chalk would you believe I'm killing it
The village idiot has got a lot of tales to tell
I'm a fool and now I'm knowing that these tales will sell
Put 2 and 2 together and you get a hole
A whole lot of cats trying playing out they roles
They, play, on, say songs through speech
I smile and exhale more than air like in green mile
I fell ill last year, so ill that I was bed ridden
So ill that when I came out MC's got masks
This illness never left, now when I talk I'm afflicted
This ill shit is stuck with me until my death, I laugh
Ha-ha

Man. I ain't the right personality type to kick some yada-yada hype
For y'all to pretend to write
Despite the fringe benefits, penning this is my life
Tight lipped enough to suppress grins when bending mics
Strike
I pitch words that change-up, slide, sink, and curve
Not a standard issue sidearm, but still serve superb
Sound meets concussive force and forges alliance
Hit the earth, ground ripples and burst, Codename: Seismic
Fucking up all landings, steps, strides, and stances
Dr. Footshock trauma, metatarsals and phalanges
We can't quit, shit'll be over like that quick
When that cinema plays images of last days, laughter is magic
It ain't the ripple in the riddle, the flow's undertow we patrol
Amphibious menace, snapping jaws and death roll
Swamp gator related to sewer species
These beasts be Lake Placid drastic, best believe me

Let the beat hit you like a rock, rock
Take the rhythm, strangle it and just rock, rock
Keep the beat like a clock, tick-tocking on
Move to the break of dawn with us, rock, rock

We gets down like Heidi Fleiss humming Cheap Trick
I've been sewing up a fat as crop I want to reap it
Move swiftly down the road, swinging low while your left lost
Stock soul with a body kit, get it?
We gets down like a snapped bungee chord a rush
Wet up verses like a wave out of blue crush, must we
Keep annoying critics that think we even listen
I'm Felix, and in my position they would never get it
If I'm a master of ceremonies then I want to MC your funeral
The last ceremony you'll ever have fucker

We gets down like the last ceremony you'll ever have
Burying cats, too many are too drab
In the lab, grabbing every thing we've got to keep it on lock
Blessed with the gift to move swift like agent smith
Can I get down? Oh yeah, no question 'bout that
Hotter than the flames on your message board
Forging out blades, melting metal, blacksmith with mic chord
We gets down like Icarus, we 'gone melt the whole floor
I wouldn't lie to you, this year we reaching out like sunlight
Moving every proving ground to show we run right
We're ""zehrgut"" in Germany, in Chi Town we're raw
No flaws, you heard this sound and went home with dropped jaws
Pause for a second
We gets down like bullets whirring over your head to wreck shit
Seen you running from the club and you were looking desperate
Inspired to write, right after our set, your page is desolate
We gets down like 10 yards completed pass
Completely pass those competing in a weaker class
They say sticks and stones can break your bones
Your breathing fast, cause these words could beat your ass",Get Down,2004

You've seen the live show so you know how it is,
I've seen the light grow for these Twin City kids

The green it might grow for these Twin City kids
(They greet me like whoa, all these Twin City kids)
Ten gritty kids trying to rock the mic
If I'm one of 'em the other nine won't sound right

Standing up on a stage looking good sounds tight
But you've gotta shine bright if you want the limelight
I fight with this rhythm in a lopsided bout for you
I thank y'all just for coming to check us out (for you) 

I thank y'all for taking time out your day,
And listening to us,
I hope we rub you in the right way
You might say that he has fun with it

Six or seven years and still he runs with it
Interlocks still the click, no I ain't done with it
I chase the raps like a cat at the club chasing digits
Paced to rip it,

But always keep it in perspective
For you dudes were new too
Here is our objective
Step onstage, get the face looking mean
Put in a little dirt and make it right like the A-Team

I play the night like a daydream
Stay to fight and make scenes when up against your team
You weigh the triple beam and rock guns
I leave the nipple clean and rock tongues just for fun

Helen Baylor,"Girl stands at her window
While fleets of ships and angels float by
Heavy footsteps lead her down the hall and to the edge
She says she'll jump before she learns to fly

She dreams only in black and white
A rose and a crow are the same in her mind
Thoughts of self destruction brings her to her knees
What happens when you try to find eternity'

Where did she come from'
Her heart and soul are not as one
She's got no love only disguise
She sparkles starlight in her eyes

Tell me tell me can you, find the words to say
When white fades to grey 
Tell me tell me won't you, find the words to say

She stands at a crossroad
She stares down streets that are seemingly bare
New life comes from wiping dark tears off her eyes
Wherever she turns now there's nowhere left to hide

Where did she come from'
Her heart and soul are not as one
NO love; ONLY disguise

Helen Baylor,"I met an old friend today in the cafe on the hill
To see him after all these years somehow did not seem strange
We laughed and reminisced about the life we used to live
And I could tell at least with him that nothing much had changed
An invitation to the party was all he had to offer
Everyone will be there and all the high you need is free
As he checked the time and he paid the check he said we ought to hurry
And I could tell the one he was talking to .......was the old me...and I said

Look a little closer
Can’t you see that I have changed?
I am not the girl I used to be
My life is rearranged
Look a little closer
I’m not the one I use to be
I gave my heart to Jesus and He gave a brand new life to me

As we began to leave the table and started for the door.
In my heart there was a stirring and I knew there was something more
In his eyes there was an emptiness that only Jesus could fill
It reminded me of how I use to be before I accepted him...
After an awkward moment he broke the silence when he said
I hear about a savior or was it something that I’ve read?
But I don’t need religion there’s nothing to it anyway
I asked him if he wouldn’t mind if we took time to pray
Lord help him look a little closer
Help him feel your loving touch

Remove the blinders and change his heart surround him with your love.
Lord help him look a little closer...help him know that you are near..
Do for him what you have done for me...lord set my brother free!

He split the Red Sea to help his people go free

Helen Bliss,"I wonder what he'll think of me
I guess he'll call me the ""old man""
I guess he'll think I can lick
Every other feller's father
Well, I can!
I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his puddin-headed father ever had
I'll teach him to wrestle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornin's for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill!

Bill, my boy Bill
I will see that he is named after me, I will.
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

I don't give a hang what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack.

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well.

Aha-ha-ha-ha!
He might be a champ of the heavyweights,
Or a feller that sells you glue,
Or President of the United States,
That'd be all right, too
His mother would like that
But he wouldn't be President if he didn't wanna be!
Not Bill!

My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And as tough as a tree, will Bill
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss him or toss him around!
No fat-bottomed, flabby-faced,
Pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

And I'm hanged if he'll marry his boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnette...

Hey, why am I talkin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born, yet!
I can see him when he's seventeen or so,
And startin' to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound
On the way to get 'round any girl
I can tell him
Wait a minute!
Could it be?
What the hell!
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with no money!
You can have fun with a son
But you gotta be a father to a girl
She mightn't be so bad at that
A kid with ribbons in her hair!
A kind o' sweet and petite
Little tin-type of her mother!
What a pair!

My little girl
Pink and white
As peaches and cream is she
My little girl
Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be!
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
From her faithful dad
She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two or three
But my little girl
Gets hungry every night and she comes home to me!

I got to get ready before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot o' bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
In a fair hand dressed
In the best that money can buy!
I never knew how to get money,
But, I'll try, I'll try! I'll try!
I'll go out and make it or steal it
Or take it or die!",Strange Music,1996

I expect to live single all the days of my life

My love's gone and left me the one I adore
She's gone where I'll never see her anymore
She plunged her fair body in the waters so deep
She closed her pretty blue eyes in the waters to sleep

Before you tell me you're through
Can't we sit together and figure whether
This is the right thing to do

Missing the thrill of nights that we've known
Can't we talk it over before it's over

Helen Darling,"If you get out in the drivin' rain
Stand in the eye of the hurricane
And never think twiceIf you turn your back on selfishness
Cause your thougts are for someone else
Cause they've changed your life
That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough
That's how you know it's love
When you heart insists that you give it all
When you no longer fear the fall
And you just let go
When the past is finally dead and gone
Fate leads you somewhere to the one
That has your soul
That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough
That's how you know it's love
No part of you questions
No part of you doubts
You're only sure this is what love's about
And nothing and no one can stand in your way
Or keep you from saying
What your heart is dying to say
That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough
That's how you know it's love

I love my mister man,
And I can't tell yo' why,
There ain't no reason
Why I should love that man.
It must be something that the angels done plan.

Fish got to swim, birds got to fly,
I got to love one man till I die.
Can't help loving that man of mine.
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,
Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).
Can't help loving that man of mine.
When he goes away
That's a rainy day,
But when he comes back that day is fine,
The sun will shine!
He kin come home as late as kin be,
Home without him ain't no home to me.
Can't help loving that man of mine.

My man is shiftless
An' good for nothing too
(He's my man just the same)

He's never round here
When there is work to do.
He's never round here when there's working to do.

The roof is leaking in,
But he don't seem to care.
He kin be happy
With just a sip of gin.
Ah even love him when his kisses got gin!",Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man [From Show Boat],1999

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say

I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

I'm so grateful and proud

Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk

Like a melody can?

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

Helen Forrest,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse.

The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine

Helen Forrest,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered [From Pal Joey]",2000
Helen Forrest,"It was just a neighborhood dance
That's all that it was, oh, what it seemed to be
It was like a masquerade wall, with costumes and all
Cause you were at the dance with me

It was just a ride on a train
That's all that it was, oh, what it seemed to be
It was like a trip to the stars through Venus and Mars
Cause you were on the train with me

And when I kissed you, darlin'
It was more than just a thrill for me
It was the promise, darlin'
All the things that fate had will for me

It was just a wedding in June
That's all that it was, oh, what it seemed to be
It was like a royal affair with everyone there
Cause you said, ""Yes, I do"" to me

Helen Forrest,"Love needs no debating,
It's ""hello"" or ""goodbye""
Yet I'm between a kiss and a sigh.

You keep hesitating;
Can't I get some reply,
'Cause I'm between a kiss and a sigh?

Won't you explain the case?
What will I have to face?
Would I be out of place in your arms?
I don't mind the waiting, if I only knew why,
But I'm between a kiss and a sigh.

Helen Forrest,"Mr. Meadowlark, we've got an awful lot of serenadin' to do
Mr. Meadowlark, I'm just a city slicker and I'm countin' on you
She's got a country guy who whistles, my whistle's so thin
So when I begin that's where you come in

Mr. Meadowlark, if you should cop a gander when I'm kissin' my chick
Needless to remark, I hope you'll have the decency to exit but quick
If Mrs. M. thinks you're out steppin', I'll make it alright
Mr. Meadowlark, meet me in the dark tonight!",Mister Meadowlark,2001
Helen Forrest,"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME

(Deborah Allen - Rafe VanHoy - Don Cook)

You only get around to me when someone else has said goodbye
Somehow you only want the ones who noly going to make you cry
It seems no matter what you do you never get their loving affection
It should be obvious to you you're looking in the wrong direction

What's the matter with me
What do I have to do to make you see
Just how good it could be
If it's really love that you need
What's the matter with me

When you're lying in my arms waiting for your heart to feel
How can you be so close to me and not know the way I feel
You say it makes you feel so good to know you can cry on my shoulder
I must really be a fool to let it happen over and over




",What's the Matter with Me?,2001
Helen Forrest,"Yours is my heart alone
And without you, life holds no charm

Yours every thought I own,
Our love the theme of every dream

All that makes life seem worthwhile
Dwells in your eyes and the spell of your smile

There is no song half so sweet to me
As your voice whispering I love you dear",Yours Is My Heart Alone,2001
Helen Forrest,"Never thought that you would be 
standing here so close to me 
there's so much I feel that I should say 
but words can wait until some other day 

Kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear

Since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time
You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you

Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

Ah, kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long time
Haven't felt like this my dear

Since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time
You'll never know how many dreams
I dreamed about you

Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

Long, long time
