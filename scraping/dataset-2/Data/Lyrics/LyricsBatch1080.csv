Team Pitbull,"Russia, Mr. Worldwide
You can catch me in Russia
At a millionaire’s night
Nah I ain’t no Russian
But I get what I like
Baby know Russian
I’ma tell you what I want

Girl it’s on tonight
You got me trippin off them strobe lights
You know this vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
From the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night

So where you wanna go baby girl, no I don’t care
Any universe, any atmosphere
Clock say 1:12 so we’re outta here
We can do it everywhere
She throwing up dubs screaming west side
I got a cali king you can fit just right
Pick cars depending on what’s the best drive
Give you the keys, let you test drive
Top floor, with the sweet sounds great
Looking out the window over the tristate
She come mad early and leave mad late
And I ain’t eating at the table, don’t need no plates
Her clothes in the bedroom floor,
We’re not even in the bedroom no more
I get a text message in the morn
Like daddy, go ahead and to me like that tonight

Girl it’s on tonight
You got me trippin' off them strobe lights
You know this vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
From the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night

Baby we can go from the hallway to the backroom
Go upstairs, back down soon
My couch’s soft, my floor too
We can take a day if you want too
Turn john like tv, hd, 3d
I spin you around like a cd
Baby don’t make it so easy
She won’t let
She wrecking my place like Tasmanian devil
I’m giving the base, she giving the treble
And we turn it up, to the next level
I told her we can do it when the sun’s up
Or we can get it in when the sun’s down
Or maybe we can meet halfway
Either way, baby girl I’ma put it down

Girl it’s on tonight
You got me trippin off them strobe lights
You know this vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor

Until you're driven half awake

Safe inside the covers and freezing
Alive?

Protecting ourselves
As you watch from outside
And everyone's thrill
It crashes in you heart

Until you're driven half awake
All you ever want
Safe inside the covers and freezing

No one would ever stop.
Couldn't tell the difference between them
And then you struggle under quake
Hope you never stop
Hope you never finish breathing

Where does the pain stop and the tearing trough begin, if ever?

Hear the crowd cheer

In 1985
I was doing time alive
I made a plan to escape
And live as the lady of the lake

Hear the crowd of ghosts
Their voices dry and hollow
Can't you hear their calls?
They cheer me to the gallows

Was the year I came up for trial
I listened to his song
And watched the sun make the shadows long

You a punk
I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatching, jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or something

You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see em, try to be em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th wonder
Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under
Face one up, to take over, the break's over
Nigga I'm the god MC, me, Jay Hovah
Shit knocking, almost a crime, get Cochran
Banging to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They want to see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros

We celebrate this, while you sitting back screaming you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spitting sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just giving face lifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Who start shit? my style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you want to see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazing in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm resident evil, moving like ?

Millionaire that flow like water, rap niggas running
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the mac at yea, niggas caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't fuck with it
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets tecs honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was looking you found us
Moving with speed, tried to play superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaoh's of Egypt
Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it
Keeping my team top seeded with the sweet 16's
Bulging out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holding, ? shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it

Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screw face in forty-two ways, aim better
Than toothpaste, Jerry McGuire
""Show me the money"" like clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zoning
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the omen, foaming
White sheets got ya wrapped like a roman
Back in new york, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
Niggas is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seeking, grill hunting, still fronting?
Keep squeezing, fuck it, I leave the whole street wheezing
No motherfuckers hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got em scared to drop like soap in jail

Yeah, there you have it
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours

Oh I'm blazed, in a daze

I can fly, I can float
Meet your boy up on the boat

Yo keep the weed coming

Got me gone off herb
And I earn when I swerve to the curb
For the derb and the bourbon
Fresh out early and
Hanging with the soldiers
Still got the feelings that we pearling
Show me where they working
From the bank dawg
Money on a fifth of henn
Tell the motherfucker drink up
Why the skunk weed starting to stank dawg
Bitch go and get some gin
We gonna get the party cranked up
Put your bank up we gonna need more
Weefer chain cause our cryptic addicted to weed smoke
Get incisions of pure seeded snow
Take a puff choke shit of this weed dope
And I'm off my square now
Went and yelled out
Where the nigga trying to get sloppier
Dropping ya
If you trying to get us
While we uzing them
Rolling with the three 6 mafia
Popping ya popular
Buck at niggas with the rock
Close encounters of the herb kind
Leave you sitting on the curb crying
South side getting bucked up
In a party with a burb mind
We gonna tear this bitch up
Cause we fucked up
Gone off that sticky
When I zone off can't hit me
Have me going in illusions
Trying to get me
Infatuated with drugs
Smoked out snorted out drunken and blown
Getting crunk in that mode
Twista gotta stay high
Smoke a skunk till I'm old
Now chucking like I'm sea sick
On the front porch with the mob
And we be thick
Roll when you see twista and three 6
Who can bog the motherfucking mind
Like an eclipse on the weed tip

Tear Out the Heart,"If there’s one thing I HATE, it's the feeling of being ignored.
Now everyone is an enemy to push past.
I knew your punk ass wouldn't last.

Everything you live for will one day DIE.
You better hope that you never fucking see me again.
You're nothing more than a WASTE of my time.

I've made it this far.
I can make it anywhere without you.
This is what it comes down to.

Out of all the things I've seen, it's an industry of suits and cheap stabs.
We bit the hand that feeds.
Now we're STUCK HERE, begging for table scraps.

Everyone’s an ENEMY.
I knew you wouldn't last.

EVERYTHING YOU LIVE FOR IS STILL GONNA FUCKING DIE.",Boiled Nails,2015
Tear Out the Heart,"Am I breaking through?

I started falling as if I never had a grip.
Moving on isn't easy, nothing that matters ever is.

Looking back on everything, I had the world in front of me.
Spent most my nights fearing change, but what's the use?
BURY ME WITH MY YOUTH.

How is accepting this so impossible?

Have I lost my youth
 or am I BREAKING THROUGH?
Will I face the truth that I'm losing all of you.

I started thinking, am I out of line or just out of time?
What makes you think this is easy?
When I have poison on mind.

Back then, there wasn't more to me than a problem with authority.
I could handle anything but the truth.
BURY ME WITH MY YOUTH.

So many nights spent jumping fences,
DRUNK AND RECKLESS.
Everything is changing in front of me,
so I'll take chances.
I'll take my chances NOW.

Am I breaking through?",Breaking Through,2015
Tear Out the Heart,"NO HESITATION
Not sure I'll make it.
There is a place for this,
and it's not here.
Way past exhaustion,
and now I'm nauseous.
The state of mind I'm in
you'd call your hell.

I GUESS I'LL SAVE MY BREATH
IF I CAN'T SAVE MY SOUL.

You don't make me,
you only make me wish we never met.

There's nothing but judgment
from people I can't see.
If you can't think clear,
I'll stay here until something changes me,
but IT WON'T BE YOU.

Feel free to HATE ME.
Nothing is changing.
There’s a time for this
and it's not now.
I've lost my patience,
and now I'm anxious.
My chest caving.
I'M NOT WORTH SAVING.",Curse You,2015
Tear Out the Heart,"Scars hurt worse than open wounds.
The more I think, the more I'll assume.
A falling out like a stitch without seaming. 
That was a mess not worth cleaning.

I lost EVERYTHING.
I lost ALL MEANING, but I can't let go now.

I'm not afraid to admit that I was wrong.
""People change.""
Oh, I was DEAD WRONG.
Now it's come to this.
I feel as if I DON'T EXIST.
I lost control.
I'll dig myself out of this hole.
Just give me the chance.

Leave it all behind. Leave it all behind.
I'll bleed for this until my veins are dry.
Leave it all behind. Leave it all behind.
There’s a light beneath my bloodshot eyes.
I'll choke it down until it makes me SICK.
All you need to know is I BLEED FOR THIS.
Leave it all behind. Leave it all behind.
I'LL BLEED FOR THIS UNTIL MY VEINS ARE DRY.

I'm not the same punk kid with nothing to lose.
I had a soul not worth selling.
That was a story not worth telling.
Now it's come to this.
I feel as if I DONT EXIST.
I let you down.
Maybe it's time I blame myself.

I DON'T FEAR DEATH.
I FEAR THE PAIN THAT IT COMES WITH.
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE.
I'M AFRAID TO LOSE MY LIFE.",Damage Control,2015
Tear Out the Heart,"Inspired to create. Driven by hate.
We experience progression through aggression.
All the while, closing our eyes and pretending.
Pretending that we're not LIARS.
We're not COWARDS.
We're not THIEVES.
Always in search of the almighty villain.

The world’s corrupt, our lives forever FUCKED…
Yet we still believe in the storybook ending.
Because HOPE is the END ALL, BE ALL.
We're no longer kids.
It's not about the end, it's where it all begins.
We'll carry on because a FIGHT is what let's us know that we're still alive.

After all, we're DEAD EVERYWHERE,
Not just dead inside.","Dead, Everywhere",2015
Tear Out the Heart,"Someone snuck across my room,
while I was fast asleep.
They whispered in my ear
""I can't take you with me.”

We hunt down the haunted.
Paranoia has got the best of me.
My perception is distorted.
Insomnia can take the rest of me.

It's THE EPITOME OF MYSERY
I live each day with a devil beside me.
I swear every night in my head it feels
like Hallow's Eve.

Something crept into my tomb,
while I was long since dead.
It leaned over and whispered
""This is all in your head.""

Tear Out the Heart,"I came from NOTHING,
and I'm not coming back, 
not going back.
I want what's mine.
You have the edge but I'm holding the knife.

What do you know about sacrifice?
Or putting your life on the line?
You left as the pressure was building up,
and that's what makes you a CHUMP.

I couldn't take anymore.
I'm tired of waking up
FACE DOWN ON THE FLOOR.",Error,2015
Tear Out the Heart,"You can take me back to another sunrise behind the wheel.
With all the damage done, I'll make sure as hell these wounds won't heal.

Who I was is DEAD and BURIED.
We can't go back.
Who you were is DEAD and BURIED.
Tonight we're digging up the past.

Carry on, keep the fight alive.
We're never going to rest until the morning light.
Anything to escape our minds.
What ever it takes to FEEL REAL tonight.

I need to take my own advice, and less for granted.
The kids we were back then are LOST and FOREVER ABANDONED.

Everyone around me has forgotten who they really are.
I'm sick of the games.
Sick of the lies.
LIFE DOESN'T FIGHT FAR SO WHY SHOULD I?",Feel Real,2015
Tear Out the Heart,"I've got secrets that I'm keeping.
I've got demons in my head.
I've been hoping I'd stop thinking and the past would JUST STAY DEAD.

I can KICK and I can SCREAM but in the end it won't change a single thing.
I can trick, I can scheme, but that's just not me.

I've felt this coming for quite some time.
I hope and I pray that everything will be alright.
THIS ISN'T OVER.

I've got secrets that I'm keeping.

I've been hoping I'd stop thinking and the past would just stay dead.
I can kick and I can scream but In the end it wont a change a thing.
I've been hoping I'd stop thinking and the past would just stay dead.

I often lose track of time.
There’s just so much on my mind.
Before there wasn't much, now I feel like I've had ENOUGH.

I've been this way for all of my life.
Just know this isn't over yet.
 I'll land on my feet, on that you can bet.

I'm through with playing nice.
You're full of SHIT and LIES.",I’ve Got Secrets,2015
Tear Out the Heart,"This can't be real,
A series of words strip away all the warmth that I feel.
You're lying, just say tell me you are.

I wasn't there.
A constant reminder of damage that won't be repaired.
The distance never seemed so far.

This scar is permanent,
Summer will always turns to fall.
Please don't leave me yet.
Why can't you take me with you?

This is a start,
a light brave enough to bring comfort to me in the dark.
Eyes are open once again.

You're always here.
Just as long as I'm breathing then nothing can take that away from me.
I am incomplete but I'm not broken.

Wounds will always heal,

We're all REJECTED.

I may be a lot of things but I know that I'M NOT FAKE.
The truth is I stopped caring, so fucking spare me.

Stop me if you've heard this before.

Don't blink or you'll miss it again.

Take me and bury my bones.
We never had a chance. I never had a chance.
Take me and bring me home.
We never had a chance.

Somebody WAKE ME UP.
I've had enough of holding onto the pain I love.
Somebody wake me up.
I've had enough.

I may have said those things and I meant only half.
I'd rather keep my sanity and live the life you wish you had.

I stand corrected.
We're all REJECTED.
I don't feel right here.
The more I try, the harder it gets.

Tear Out the Heart,"You have NO IDEA what I've been through.

And that was the beginning of my own true love and me
Well I asked her for a candle for tolight me up to bed
And likewise for a handkerchief to tie around me head
She tended to me needs like a young maid ought to be
So then I say to her, ""now won't you leap in with me too
Well she jumped into bed, making no alarm
Thinking a young sailor lad could to her no harm
Well I hugged her and kissed her the whole night long
Till she wished the short night had been nine years long
Well early the next morning the sailor lad arose
And into Mary's apron threw a handful of gold
Saying, ""take this to me daer for the mischief that I've done
For tonight I faer I've left you with a daughter or a son
Well, if it be a girl child, send her out to nurse
With gold in her pocket and with silver in her purse
And if it be a boy child he'll wear the jacket blue
And go climbing up the rigging like his daddy used to do

When we gonna make it work?

Too many people living in a secret world

To walk on tiptoes everyday

Tears for Fears,"Heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
Well here's to the boys back in 628
Where an ear to the wall was a twist of fate
I will shine a blinding light
Through those hearts as black as night
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But as least the seeds of love will be sown
Now once in awhile when I feel no shame
I get down on my knees and I pray for rain
And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case
There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face
Hand on my heart I will make a stand
For the life and the times of the mirrorman
In my head there is a mirror
When I've been bad, I've been wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a Badman
This is the Badman's Song
Guilt in the frame of the looking-glass
Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man
Try and fit themselves together again
Lies in disguise in the name of trust
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust !
What's your problem ? What's your curse ?
Won't it make the matter worse ?
In my head...
And they say "" Faith can move move mountains
Fire can cleanse your soul ""
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter - No !
I heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day
(I'm in trouble every step of the way)
Sweet talking boys who can do no wrong
When the stories are tall as the day is long
With such a thin drawn between friend and foe
Lord help me now and bless my soul !
Look at yourself - See how you lie
Your hands start shaking and you don't know why

Your hands start shaking and you don't know why

They would just pour like every drop of rain
That's why I believe it is too late for anyone to believe
I believe that if you thought for a moment, took your time
You would not resign yourself to your fate
And I believe that if it's written in the stars, that's fine
I can't deny that I'm a Virgo too
I believe that if your bristling while you hear this song
I could be wrong or have I hit a nerve?

But now you're laughing at the sun
With all your high class friends you think you've got it made
The only thing you made was that tanned look on your face
With all your cigarettes and fancy cars
You ain't a clue who or what you are 
You're dreaming your life away
Fish out of water 
Go swim in the tide today
Fish out of water
We used to sit and talk about primal scream
To exorcise our past was our adolescent dream
But now it's sink or swim since your memory fails
Now in Neptune's kitchen you will be food for killer whales
And on the crucifix his mother made
Hangs one more martyr to the hit parade

These are the reasons and these are the laws
In one life you're rich, in the next you are poor
Save your excuses, your tensions and fears
Be sure as you go and you go with the flow
And you reap what you sow as above, so below

Mind your lip and swing your hips
And be selective, be objective
No pain, no gain, no pain, no gain, no pain, no gain
No pain, no gain, no pain, no gain, no pain, no gain
No pain

You come from the foam - crested brine
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight
Partly fish, partly porpoise, partly baby sperm whale
Am I yours? are you mine to play with?

Joking apart, when you're drunk you're terrific
When you're drunk I like you mostly late at night
You're quite alright
But I can't understand the different you
In the morning
When it's time to play at being human for a while
We smile, we smile, we smile

You'll be different in the spring, I know
You're a seasonal beast
Like the Starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide

Your lunacy fits neatly with my own

I will shine a blinding light
Through those hearts as black as night
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But as least the seeds of love will be sown

I get down on my knees and I pray for rain
And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case
There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face
Hand on my heart I will make a stand

In my head there is a mirror
When I've been bad, I've been wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a Badman

Guilt in the frame of the looking-glass
Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man
Try and fit themselves together again
Lies in disguise in the name of trust
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust !
What's your problem ? What's your curse ?
Won't it make the matter worse ?
In my head...
And they say "" Faith can move move mountains
Fire can cleanse your soul ""
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter - No !
I heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day
(I'm in trouble every step of the way)
Sweet talking boys who can do no wrong
When the stories are tall as the day is long
With such a thin drawn between friend and foe
Lord help me now and bless my soul !

Your hands start shaking and you don't know why

Tears for Fears,"Fill the sky with love 
Fill the sky with love 

I wouldn't mind but she just turned up on the doorstep 
Wishful and ashen, slightly bedraggled 
Last time I saw her she was howling at the moon 
Roaming the forest, lupine and rabid

Woah is she wild? 
Does she see my inner child? 

But then she knows it's like a curse 
To find our chosen roles reversed 
To unify my universe 
To call me mellow 

If only I was half my age and she was older 
We'd live on ice-cream on Coney Island 
I though it's gravity that drags down my balloon 
She stays in orbit way after midnight 

Woah slip and slide 
Does she go all dewey-eyed? 

But then she knows it's like a curse 
To find our chosen roles reversed 
To unify my universe 
To call me mellow 

She'll dress down for us 
She'll break new ground for us 
Watching me cracking up 

She'll hang round fellahs 
With all the groundswellers 
Driving me like a truck 

But then she knows it's like a curse 
To find our chosen roles reversed 
To unify my universe 
To call me mellow

Tears for Fears,"I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention

With one foot in the past, now, just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?

And dreaming I'm a doctor
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
Oh, I feel so

Teatro,"There was a time when men were kind 
When their voices were soft 
And their words inviting 
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung
No wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
As they turn your dreams to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And I still dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather!

So different from this hell I'm living
So different now, from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream [From Les Misérables],2007
Teatro,"Love, love changes everything
Hands and faces, earth and sky
Love, love changes everything
How you live and how you die
Love can make the summer fly
Or a night seem like a lifetime

Yes, love, love changes everything
Now I tremble at your name
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Love, love changes everything
Days are longer, words mean more
Love, love changes everything
Pain is deeper than before
Love will turn your world around
And that world will last forever

Yes, love, love changes everything
Brings you glory, brings you shame
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Off into the world we go
Planning futures, shaping years
Love bursts in and suddenly
All our wisdom disappears

Love makes fools of everyone
All the rules we make are broken

Love will never, never let you
Love will never, never let you be the same

Teatro,"They call you Lady Luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very unladylike way of running out
You're on this date with me

The pickings have been lush
And yet before this evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray

Luck be a lady tonight
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight

Luck, let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I've know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck be a lady with me

A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it ain't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice

So let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me, baby, I'm the fellow you came in with
Luck be a lady tonight

A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd have a soul
A lady wouldn't make little snake eyes at me
When I've got my life on this roll

Teatro,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life and I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look a new day has begun

",Memory [From Cats],2007
Teatro,"Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently, night unfurls it's splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night

Teatro,"Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And there are dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why can't I?

Someday I'll wish upon a star

I knew you were the classic one

The whispers then soon changed
And like a knife right through my heart
Sweet misery again

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name

I'll have you know I feel the same

If I believe what I've been told

You love 'em and leave 'em for less than a song
But they still can't forget that smile

I wish you could be here

Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!

[Tech N9NE]
When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9NE's filled""

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit Withe-out
'cause why'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys 
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, see now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of jake investigate

What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it

I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!

[Chino XL]
Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg

De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!

Tech N9ne,"(1st Verse)
I was born in seventy-one
In seventy-two I started to walk
Seventy-three
Seventy-four
Seventy-five
I learned to talk
Seventy-six I tried sexing
That was around the age of five
Seventy-seven
Seventy-eight
And seventy-nine
I started to ride
With my 
Uncle Ike
In eighty and eighty-one
I was about ten
But the first time a little chick
Made me cum
Was eighty-two
Or eighty-three
My life really came alive
In eighty-four
I was thirteen
But
Nineteen eighty-five's
The number
I met this bitch
Who told me if I got tight with her
Together we would grow rich
Type of chick
That'll make a brother
Feel good inside
In my mind when I'm sleep
Woke
When I walk
When I ride
Getting to me in the classroom
Used to follow me into the bathroom
And I loved it
She was wild
And everyday
People bore me
Captivate
Activate my hormones
When you speak to me
Softly
Offer me
A piece of you
Cause
Me so horny
She let me foreplay
And that's it
She said
If I would rap
And make some dollars for us
Maybe I can get a hit
I was writing
Then I found myself fighting
For the juices
When I found out
That our little agreement's
Non-exclusive
Ah damn
She let celebrity status hit
So I'm thinking of tactics
How to leave ran down
Prophylatics
On the mattress
So I practice
Hoping to stuff my fat dick
In this rap bitch
Knowing when I stuff my cactus
In that catfish
Imma flat shit
She's turning me into a killer
Devour fools 
I'm powerful
Like Mecha-Godzilla
She said
If I keep rapping
She'll keep clapping
But ain't nobody strapping
Till she see paper
And then we'll see what's happening
And I hear her say

(hook x2)
You heard of Tech
He's like the best 
He built his nest
In the Midwest
The boy can flow
And he be busting like
Boom boom
It's like I'm stuck
I feel I'm cursed
About to load the N9na
Tech cause in a sec
I'm finna be busting like
Boom boom

(2nd Verse)
Ninety-three 
She invited me
To a party in L.A.
So popular
She introduced me to
2Pac the next day
She took me to this party
In Beverly Hills
Where me and Chris Tucker
Couldn't get in 
Because of our ball caps
And they was all about dollar bills
She was a G
And got us all in for free
Ran into Pac again
She talked about him so tough
I knew she was cocking him
But I never did hate
Because I knew
Heated sex
Was our fate
As I got clever
And a lot better
She started letting me and my boys
Hit together
Me and Pac hit the slot
Now it's out in the open
Didn't take long
To make her get it on
Came on strong
And Thugs Get Lonely too
Was our slogan
She wanted me
And Chino XL
But he backed off
And said that's hell
He don't dip into every female
Waiting to exhale
With a
Wet tail
Wish I could be with baby
Daily
But I recall
The Veteran Click saying
Tech
Don't turn a tramp into your
Lady
I don't know why
I want this bitch
She always dis and
Won't let me
Showcase my shit
This bitch is driving N9na
Crazy

(Hook x2)

(3rd Verse)
Fuck this
I'm ready for
One on one ruckus
Still she like
Don't touch this
When I'm alone with her
It's on
When the bone hit her
Get her
Hoeing off in L.A.
With my folks
Me and Yuk, Phats, Gonz
L Q Max Key
Hella knocking your back out
Bitch
Long strokes
You a nympho
Who the pimps though
Me and Roger Troutman
Had you at Juan Momma house
Shouting
Through the talk box
You exhaust cocks
And you ought not
Ever get caught hot
Why she always gotta have the vault lock
Kinda mad when I really
Thought back
Me and Rza hit that ass
On the video set
Why did we hit
Raw
Bitch told us
How she fucked
Eminem
cool G
KRS
Monch
Exhibit and
All
Type a niggas
When Felony fucked
He said
What what what what
I was next in line
Right after he busted his
Nut nut nut nut
I heard
My homey Rodney say
She want me and Lynch to hit
Sac and MO dick
And she said she wanted it so bad
Cause we so sick
I saw you at 92.3
The Beat
With Jay-Z and Damon
I know at times
I'm hella complex
But now Imma put it in lamens
I want to fuck you
Not with Jimmy Jam
Not with Terry Lewis
Not with Quincy Jones
Not with QD3
Just me and you
And Imma show you all the things
That I can do
Go platinum plus
Get trapped in your lust
So I'm hoping me and you can
Bang bang
I know you're a groupie hoe
But I still
Want your coochie though
Before I go
I want you to tell these people

Many death situations but that ain't (Why)
I got the spirit of an angel mixed with demoniac ways of livin
So this means I'll beat the evil out of a non-believer until praise is given

Torcher is evil though it says in the (Bible)
You got to be righteous spirited for the (Arrival)
I'm righteous and wicked but I wonder (Can I go)
If there's a heaven but on earth it's (Survival)
Connected with angels but to demons (I'm vital)
Approachin with hate oh yes it's (Homocidal)
Like denouncing Selena at (Cinco de Mayo)
Certain death (Oh no) Oh no

I'm on the road to heaven and hell
Don't even bother me ever since eleven and twelve
I've been that prodigy though life has never been swell
Somewhere there's gotta be where a good samaratin prevails
But they get straight sodomy
So I learned the ways of man

Fillin my pants
Gun in my hand
For the demons on the land
On the other hand I really am

I ain't got to stress if you can't tell it
Look into my eyes

I'm half cupid half relic (Cha cha)
He who treads the path of the best is also he who sins are repentable

In the new millennium
You can't play with nobody's mind

Deliberately messing up a good thing
Or holding up a grind
And
You already knowing life's a big fight
Against time

Crime minds
Really shine
Who's dying
Is the kind
Man
When some of us
Find that life ain't beautiful
We switch to
Pharmaceuticals
Your nine to five
Ain't suitable
For the cuticles
I'm going bad
Currently I keep ending up
With even less
Than I had
Record company
Is dealing me something sad
How do you expect
A man to sit
And wait with three kids
For you to
Figure out
What Tech's SINGLE is
Going bad
I feel like
I just might
Act a fool
When I see 'em
Gotta a nigga
Feeling petty
Looking forward
To perdeium
I got some issues
Most of these record execs
Are soft as tissues
Defecate on they self
When they here some
I'm gon get yous
Understand this
When a Rogue's at
You're trying to hold back
His dough sack
And try to bozack
And he go cock
The 4 4 back
You chose that
So cut these ties
And I'll rise
Let's compromise
Or else
I'll hop a plane
With my guys

While I'm hanging on

In triple
Stage darkness

Mind state of a pirate
I'm irate
Used to be cool
Till some straight fool
Lit the pilot
Will I be that
Mid-town bound
In the middle of a riot
Or at a wherehouse
Shipping platinum
Shaking hands with
Violet
No love for the bane
False foes in the game
The Qwest wreck was a shame
Twas a journey full of pain
But Tech N9NE will remain
Hella brave
And untame
So make way
For the reign
I'm bringing Highland and Wayne
No thanks to Qwest
They on the receiving end
Of the gun
I cursed you
Everytime I climb
You're getting fired
One by one
But taking one with me
Cause she knows the true meaning
Of a modern day hippie
Who creates jewels off mushrooms
And bombs sticky
HOG STYLIN'
Mid West Side
And Newday
And King Tech & Sway
These are the people keeping me alive
To this day much love

(intro)
I've been around the world
And I Yi Yi
Don't know why people
What?
Why people go to the strip club
To spend their dough 
Just to see butt
To see these ladies strip
And take off all their clothes
I do not know why
They choose such a spot
I just don't know why
We get hot
It's probably cause 
They make it hop and twurk the pole
And their headlights are sitting bold
Makes it look like its getting' cold
Can I hold you tight
Hop on my lap
And do that dance
I come to spend ones and huns
On lovely skin
Booty weighs a ton
Let the game begin 
Cause here I come

(Verse 1)
Teccanina swope down like space invaders boy
Pull out the piece like on you haters boy
Forget about the haters 
I don't want to talk about 'em
On this right now
I want to talk about
That butt them breasts
Yes yes want to test
Now sanity stops
When the fannie g. drops
Fantasy locked
On makin' the canopy rock
Panties be hot
When we walk in
All vanity pops
In every glam if she's stocked
Make her make it
Frantically hop
We're all at the tittie bar
VIP and all of the kitties
Are sittin' with me
They're all knowin'
Who we are
TECHN9NE, baby
How you doin'
What you drinkin'
Caribou
Is what I'm thinkin'

Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo,

Travelin' lookin' for them
Who does what
Make it hop

ATL, California

Here I come baby
Enough to make the big bucks
Here I come baby

Watch that booty clap

Catch me on the couch
With two stouts
Mouth to mouth
Bounce to the techno festival
See lots of lezbo
Lets go ghetto
Or heavy metal
We slam dancing
Blair witch raves
In the woods
Up in Cameron
Rollin'
Diggin' the private schoolers
St. Theresa's bishop Hogan
Those are the kind
That do ya
Get that sarabell explosion
All of my homies kick it pockets

Sexy mixed mullato

With a stack of hundreds
Kick her that

What ya'll doin' after this scat
With this back activist mack
Blasphemous acts
Hit em with a stack
That will distract a bitch
All I want to do

In the cat in the hat for risk
If you really want to master this
Know it's a whole lotta cash to get
Me and my homeboys
Will get with
Your homegirls
And get in our own world
We gotta be ready
To get up and go
To the bedroom 
Or up in the bathroom
Givin' me and my homeboys a show
Baby get low

Give it to me papa
Hit the na na na

You want this record cool go get it
Hot when the flames lit
Gloc where the bane sits
Shock when the pain quits
Pac would've banged this
Instantaneous when I aim at the miscellaneous
Ask me ask ask why why I'm the strangest
Because
Nobody ever wanted me rapping
But I knew within me I could make it happen
Flipping hella different to get it cracking
Never biting nothing I was never jacking
Millimeter spitting ripping up a show
Got the people trippin' everywhere we go
And now we getting you to know that misery is coming
We were summoned now the haters running when we gunning
Yo you don't know

Well me and Dorothy and Toto's on your ass when you visit

Step into my brain got it so dark that you can't see Godd dammit

My flows eternally coming out your mouth
Your makers in some haters doubt
And yes it's pitiful
Not even my pinnacle
Better know when I bust
I can do it everyday with a mind full of lust

Anybody with a bigger mouth up in here better hush

As the smoke clears
You wonder why this woman packs the most fear
She keeps a broken heart and a three-eighty close near
From me to you
If you sense she's psychotic better watch what you do, what they do

They say the Psycho Bitch was made from us (Psycho Bitches)
Say they get nothing but hate from us (Psycho Bitches)
From the Anghellic you ravenous (Psycho Bitches)
Stay the fuck away from us (Psycho Bitches, Psycho Bitches)",Psycho Bitch,2001

(1st Verse)
I was kicking it
With this chick for a minute
She picked me to hit it
Real stiffly I sitted
He spit
Then we quit it
Then I told her
To miss me
And splitted
Quickly I lit it up
No problem to get it up
Then she called and said
She needed me to help her
Get rid of what
A baby
She said she wanted me to kill it
No evidence
Blood
Don't spill it
I'm saying at first
I didn't feel it
But then I started to ponder
On what was coming up
Yonder
A baby by a fling
Made days seem
Really somber
So we both were in agreement
The baby I seen it
Thinking of killing it
Made me almost fall
To the cement
This ain't a job
I can do myself
I ain't got the brain for this
So I called a homie in Kansas
Who was trained for this
He said
The way I rap
And make skrill for a living
He said he kills for a living
For the grip span
He's a hit man
So I paid him a fee
He told me
What date it would be
Me and her was down
But I really don't think
The baby was G
So we three road to Kansas
Baby probably thinking we scandalous
Can't even walk
And we band his
Life
Man is trife
Walked in
And he told us to relax
I sat
And he took
Her and baby to the back
Before I came
I smoked some dope
To calm me
They came back
And she was baby less
And she was looking like a zombie
Baby gone (Baby gone)
Were we wrong (Hella wrong)
Gotta move on (Gotta move on)
Let it alone (yeah)
I dropped her off
But she didn't hate me
For killing the baby
She said she still
Wanted to date me
Crazy
I'm riding and I'm thinking
Why
I took a life
But I ain't tweeking
I know God
Probably thinking
I should die

(hook)
Real killer
That is me
Real killer
That is me
Real killer
That is me
This is what you call a what
Real killer
That is me

That is me

I don't really give a fuck
Real killer

Know that ain't nobody iller
Real killer
That is me

Natural born killer
That is me

(2nd Verse)
A couple of years later
I'm creeping with this chicklet
Little thick chick
Hit it raw
And gave her triplets
I need to learn to hold my liquid
So I called my man
In Kansas City, Kan
I told him I
Needed him to do it again
After he put 'em away
I asked him
Homie how could you
Be so raw
He said to me
How could you be so raw
We scatted
One year later
I splatted
In the same chick
She wanted to have it
But I made her do
The same shit
So I murdered five kids of mine
I'm 'bout to sit in hell a lifetime
Bid for mine
Cause of abortion
No more
Abortion
Now it's blown out of proportion
Insane
Never again

Picture me in that casket, blasted
Never nobody knew how long the pain lasted
Keep my eyes tight I'm frightened
But I fights like Tyson
When playin this game of life I'm loosin long to be enlightened
Absorb my mind state
Reduce the crime rate and take me out
When runnin toward the Lord I see em fake me out
Shook me so from church I played hookie
Listen to the words of a brotha
The sick stutter
So ya better better get the get the bags ready
Comin killa killa like Schagnetti
My brains contaminated, hella rotten
It wasn't me who killed you (Who was it, what was it)
The affects of the mildew, my brains wilted
In my eyes the world is a bit tilted
Lord take me away before somebody else get killed
Bloods spills seriously
This is the letter to my homies I'll be missin
God told me to behold a pale horse but I didn't listen
It's hard mane
My life is scarred mane
I'm loosin my mind

remember ya spent thirty minutes in the hospital parking lot crying
When the blood test read the baby of another woman was mine

Should of left long time ago like Mary J. say
Just let it go like Ray J
I know your momma heard you yelling May Day
Spent my life trying to are A to the P
You were sick of me always being be	 to the are O K to the E
There was nothing else left for me
I was a bum
But you still wanted some
Through the rain, snow, and thunder
Foul-ups, bleeps, and blunders
But no man shall tear us under is what you said
Shoulda put multi bullets in my head
When you found that Evil Instinct was a song
But the events actually went on
This is the letter
To my homie, my friend who put up with me for 8
So now to take me really quickly's my fate
I'm sorry
For makin it hard

Can't see me leavin my angels with nothin

From the words of a patriot
""I often fear that the sins in my past
Will come back to haunt me
But the consequenses are more than I can bare""
I feel that shit
This piece right here
Is about what comes with fame
And the struggle to keep family within a family
I give you......This Ring

(1st Verse)
This ring
Got me a top notch
Straight hot fox
We sought rocks
And the Ewok Slot
Was caught
Got dropped two
Playing hopscotch
On the block
Ought not twat plot
Yo for hops knot I brought dots

This ring
Helped me remain sane
No dame games
Came from bane
To a changed man
No cane thang
Refrain from gang bang
Slang a praying brain
Reigns family fame
Then came pain

Say hello to TECH N9NE
Everybody want to be down with a nigga
Women get a whiff of the money
Thinking of taking it from me
They get up in the club
Giving the love
Throwin the pussy
Full of liquor and bud
Booty hopping around up in the MO
Get to looking around
Every ho want to lick a nigga low
Infatuated
With niggas with dough
Get 'em in the sack
And try to make 'em let it go

Tech N9ne
Be autographing bitches
In front of rappin niggas
Who think of having figures
They get to grapping triggas
They can't imagine villians
When they come back and get us
We get to whacking niggas
I ain't never wanted no parts of this
I don't ever want to break
Another heart for this
Why the Devil gotta make it
Why the Lord gotta make something that'll kill
Something so marvelous

(Hook)
This ring
Brings demeaning Demons in
G-strings
Songs we sing
Make 'em fiend semen
And green things
Clinging
Dreaming
Thinking of being Miss Thing
With this ring
But if i wasn't Tech N9ne
Bitches wouldn't even want to be with
Tech N9ne
If I did no music
Then would you respect mine
This wedding band and music draws a line
Between
Life and Tech N9ne

(2nd Verse)
This ring
Was supposed to protect a nigga
Best for niggas
Who couldn't stop having sex
With bitches
Bless the Mrs.
Who stress to kiss us
Even though we spend on
Checks with strippers
Obsessed with clitorises

This ring
Made a nigga feel macho
Cry fo
Lie fo
Die fo
My ho
Nigga I go face
Diablo
With a hostile gospel
If I can't have tres or cuatro
Little vatos
Imma let a lot flow
What the sell
Up in Osco
Up a nostril

That sound like Tech N9ne
Nigga where the weed
Where the muthafucking
Blow
And the hoes (yes yes)
Next to me
Is Ectasy
Asking me if i want to roll (yes yes)
Bitches never gave a fuck about a fling
Make's it exciting
When a married nigga
want to fuck around
And a bitch know he down for a fling (yes yes)

I've been tested
And a lot of times
Been invested
Didn't know this Tech shit
Would constantly
Get a nigga molested
Been aproached by some of the best tricks
In the game
And they came strong
But I hanged on
To this ring
And I hope my son don't sing the same song

(Hook Repeat)

(3rd Verse)
Quincy J told me
Super stars are good providers
But
2 times outta 10
When we on tour
Family's not besides us
What
Can a nigga do
When he make ends
Add more to the time they spend
While he make ends
Everything else breaking
And the bond at the house
May end

And your wifey steadily yellin bout quality time
And you think
With all the fame and fortune
Shit outta be fine
But what happens when
The divorce papers just gotta be signed
And you lose half
And your children
'cause you gotta be N9ne

I want to relaxe wit 'em
And spend time to the maximum
But if silence is golden
Then me making noise is platinum
I gotta be Tech
And Daddy and Hubby
But music
Women mixed with family's ugly
I know and you know
That hell will be
Hot for a nigga's infidelity

But until then
God forgive me for any
Promises that I broke
Family
Can I be
Forgiven
For all the
Liquor and weed that I smoked
When I succeed
Will I cope?
Will I still breathe without both?

This shit is gonna have us stacking
If there is a God
Imma take the
X away from generation
Place it at
The end of S.E.
For the duration
Upon the level
Tell the devil to what
Skip a human
Imma tell him
Behold pale horses
Like us
Shame on a nigga
When he's feeling
Hella down
for a ninety-nine killing
Ain't giving a
Fuck I'm putting Nair
In your leave in hair conditioner
Now you Hari Krishna
To my listeners
In this rhyme
You will find
Psychotic scriptures
Saying it's something
Disrupting my mind

(Hook 1)
TECH N9NE
Your mind is fine
There's just not anyone
Like you
The whole wide world
Don't matter
No
They can't flow
Like you
Understand

(Hook 2)
My thoughts are twisted
So mixed up
(repeat x 4)

Verse 2:
A
I'm lifted
be	
I'm twisted
see
I'm sick and sadistic
A,be	, and see
Something's I do
I just can't stand
Up in my bathroom
I sex
Six women
Mentally
Just me and me
Me and my faithful
Right hand man
Tie up a Muslim
And shoot him with liquid pork
On Ramadan
With force
I'll make a Christian
Read their kids
The necronomicon
On Christmas
Don't trip on this lyrical syphilis
I flip this
So the yonks will catch vapors
Like menthalyptus
I'll feed a dominatrix patient
Pain pills
Give Wu haters permanent
Fang grills
Trick the artist formerly known
And give him
The same slave deal
I'll lift a couple of
Dr. Dre's reels
Sell 'e to Snoop
And No Limit Soldiers
Just so i can see
How paid feels
Hazy Shade
Of decade
Hookers with grave shields
Where AIDS fills
The carcass
Bet a milli on it
Techa N9na be the darkest
Heartless
I spark from the gut
So what the fuck
I'm trying to contain
The insane
But what

(Hook 2)

Verse 3:
Welcome to my
Asylum
It's hectic
They call me dyslexic
Rogue infested
More vicious than Cujo
Fraudulent tested
The punks arrested
Got the neck slit
Exit
I'm twisted
I know Hollywood backwards
Says doowylloh
Force feed me a
Sumo
For about nine weeks
Playing Club
Nuevo
Till he's blue
Though
Then stuff him in the front seat of a
Yugo
Body filled with beef and toaster
Strudel
Let up the break
And watch him race
To the intersection
Now he's through
Though
Yastuvo
I slide with a gang
Of twisted individuals
Somebody better be
Looking for the criminal tendencies
Never will they get us
In the penitentiaries
Killa
Millimeter N9ne rips vinyl
I know
Mix flow like Korean Albino
Wino
Once breeded an elephant
With a rhino
Called it the hell if I know
Throw Chuck Manson
Off in a pit
Of militant Jews
Banging hella opera
The real meaning
Of helter skelter
Is when they skin that
Forehead swastika
Am I twisted
Am I twisted
I'm twisted
Better keep your distance
Mama gotta call the Psychiatrics
For mental assistance

I'm kickin it wit this chick up in the club I'm off the Lou
And when you're on that Caribou you know just what you do
I called her Bianca, then she said ""What is that Bianca shit?""
I looked and cracked a smile and said Bianca means you, bitch
You's a Bianc' baby, whether you like it or not
But you hot especially when x and vicodin popped
If you trippin' you can hike it and hop
Cause you know what I came to do
Me and my villains come to strike it and stop
Pipe it and prop, ya leg up and get up
Bianca hold ya head up, ya sex wet the bed up
Everybody's ponderin', wonderin' about my slang that I spit
You can use it when you refer to a dame or a chick
Don't be trippin' about the choice of words I'm usin' on this script
Don't step off in my face cause you can bet I come equipped
You wanna know what to say to get the Bianc' to let you blend? (What?)

You know that big-lip pretty nigga wit the gold teeth (oh) be rapping with Tech,

That nigga fine if he willing, I'mma blow his mind (bitch!)
Big lips and all the things involved got your whole brain dissolved
You couldn't squeeze in these drawers if you was my dick and balls
I tell you man, theses dames are lame, greedy, raunchy, and dykes
A nigga gets a bit of fame and Bianca’s be like:

But Kutty be like (Ho no slow yo' roll)
Buffoon to busy tryin' to zoom off into the (upper room!)

Weed and hashes, and hits of acid, addressing me
Just ‘cause I rap, bitch you gettin’ nasty
Gone wit'cho nasty ass pizzazz ashy slash sassy, Beatrice!

Biatrices means more than one Bianca
They actresses, bring 'em sex toys and ganja
We activists, ain't no yes boys, we monsters
And macks at this, ring ya best noise we conquer
The fact is this: say you don't wanna when you want to
Relax to this ecstasy and Willy Wonka
We slaps a bitch, 'cuz me and my niggas are bonkers
We stacks the hits, no Coleco, Tyco, or Tonkas
Emaculate get the motherfucker you honor

Some freaky little things I ya

Yo, ya bet to know I gotta
Flex a flow about a
Sexy ho I gotta
Let ya know about her
Me next to go inside her
I repped the mo beside her
We did it show at Granada
Sexy dark chocolate
I think her name was Aua Young Scholler Halleljah
What I got to do to get inside the coller
So I took her back to the mo
She rode it like a pony
She was O.G.
Young chick it was better than it was supposed to be
Was a Mexican and Italian chick named Mexital Marie
For a minute she wondered about the chance she gets to wild wit me
I'm ridin' with her and she had an enormous fart box
So we pulled over and I fucked it doggy style in the automatic car wash
Later that date she took me to see bait
She bought a nacho plate
But only Tech N9ne got ate
The cerebellum was great then she sat on top of the snake
I didn't even see bait so with my other bitch I had to skate
I got contex
Plus I got bomb ex
So after Grant then it's Kutt and baby I'm next
So we can triple team up and fuck your spleen up
Between us get 3 nuts then you can beam up
Now ya sexual peak is met so don't fret
When I call you up and say what's happening baby it's Tech
I'm callin' to see if you down for heated sex
So we can flex and you can lick the barcode on my neck

Yo, yo she was a black gold, center fold classic
Chirped to Mack mode, that ass kept asking
Provalaks and a double stack bag of exstacy
It's on now exactly (fiesta)
I blasted (fo-eva)
Another mate I can check on chess was best for less dimeanor
A record exec for Techa Nina
Like a man wit no arms
But she let Kutty plow the peach sorta like horses do farms
A true charms tale
Addicted wasn't supposed to see the booty
But I lucked up and Dave Weiner gave Kutt a thumbs up (keep it real)
From L-A-X to sunset
Trunks get the donks wet Beyonks let
Outta towners hunt sex for contest
Rican and black urinary freak in the sack (ol' what's her name)
Janelle used to let me skeet on her back end at the Grafton Down to the Best Western
Let's turn this camcorder on time for some action

[Chorus]

She was a supermodel
I met her in Miami
A video girl worl was candy
And she said I'm sour on the outside but sweet between the legs
A freak talked about what got her body hot
Like lokkipops and sheets
I replied like ma
I'm diabetic so I'm allergic to sweets
We continued politicing bout if I got a chicken
And her favorite way of all positions I listen to her talk
Mesmerized by her eyes and the glide in her walk
She was sent by Satan himself
Temptations prayin' for help
But couldn't help it still
Found help in two shots and a pop of a pill
We peeled on our way
Blue Fountain room 318
Close the windows and le me sin blow
Like a whirl wind smoked and joked about each others girlfriends
And it's still a secret mi amor forever ima keep this behind closed doors

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I can't stand yo persona, the drama, yo marijuana, or yo momma
I really despise yo am a so comma I disapo who you honor
I see what you people can offer, I wonder what mommy taught ya
If it was up to me the G, I wanna sought ya, caught ya and then offed ya

I hate what you become, hate you have your freedom
Hate watchin' your reruns, hate givin' you refunds
I call 'em, how I see 'em, when I see scum, I free from the legions
Cerebrum, I see none, see your just really dumb

Hate seein' your whores, hate cleanin' your floors
Hate doin' your chores, won't be in your awards
Funk bein' your whore, hunks bein' of course, you punks being endorsed Chumps being assured, dumped being divorced

To test you like a sickness, I bet you'd like to lick this
From Texas right to Memphis, built with ex dykes and glimpses
Of everything I hate, it would be great for you to skate off in a lake
A beautiful fate, I hope nobody is at yo wake

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

We're livin' in the cold age, road rage
Dark no sole, no way
Jose Cuearvo, there goes yo day
Every scare, everywhere, knows bogay

This life is too soft, haters more true talk
I hate the way that you cough, hate you when you blew off
You coofa, your crueler, so cool off
If we were arm and arm in handcuffs my arm I would rather chew off

So many reasons why I can't stand you
The man who's scam is to ban you
Cram you in the can under land in Grand View
Damn you if you stand near my farm, I slam you
Sammain', champaign your family and you

I'm a monster when it comes to you, conquer every one of you
Trade tours, paid for, your neighbor
'Cause they whores, pray for, decor
'Cause your state will create race wars

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I hate you when you destroy buildings and kill millions of children
From black white Chinese Sicilian, I thrill
When you feel sin, dealin' drugs to billions
Awaiting your death, miserable until then

I wanna put my Rebox and get on top of his esophagus
And watch the Appocolypse drop him in Necropolis
Never was menogamus, doggin' is, you're botherin' all of us
Gotta get loose from those to ex to soddomus

I hate what you stand for, hate all your scandals
When your life's baned for, I will not burn a candle
The way you live is not easy to handle
You vandals toss 666 in your blood sample

Yo, the world is very different now, no more hugs
Just shrugs and crips and bloods and drugs
Not see show no love, never we be equal
My name is The Grinch, this song is dedicated to the evil people

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug

Just use hot water don't put no soap on your wash cloth
That way when you get home no questions you won't leave her bent
Don't be a dope and use the soap cause it will leave a scent

Don't tell a number two that she's your one and only
Cause if she know it's way easy to go her own way

Lord knows all the different situations, trials and tribulations
Aggravations that a niggas facin'
I get complacent that's my ass, I'm a memory
They spillin' liquor on the curb when they mention me
But they're ain't no fear in me, get it how you live
That's if you hearing me then dug down and dig
Lace your boots man, prepare for the struggle
Stay in them trenches, hella dirty, grit and hustle

[Chorus x2]
Ain't nobody every gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle ya heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty


Nigga
I got a pocket full of G's, I'm constantly servin'
My Nina knock him to his knees, I'm constantly dirty
Super Villain, check my powers, I get the early worm
Chop with choppers, lose the coppers with just a single turn
True to life, through the mic, they got me tellin' stories
With the fame and the lights, I feed my territory
Gutter livin' with precision, them busters know they phony
Flip my profit keep on rockin' it for my dead homies
They wanna follow my shadow and waddle in the mud
It's the infallible cannibal with the dirty gloves
""Absolute"" with this ""Power"" they call me realistic
Savage Bakarii still comin' up off that fetal living
Givin my life, to the night, on the dirty
All my might, when it's right, then I strike on them early
Twisted like livin' dirty, super savage, I'm out to get that bread
Gutter livin' that's my habit until I rest my head

[Chorus x2]
Ain't nobody every gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle ya heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

Which one of y'all can I holla at when it's time to pay rent?
And who you thinks gonna loan me money when my last bread is spent?
I got an even shorter list of people to call on when I'm in a pinch
So I might just walk around with my jaws clenched like The Grinch
I'm, headed for trouble 'cause I can't sit here and struggle
How do I bubble if I don't get out and hustle?
I'm in the wind put the spud on my muzzle
Put on my hood, grab my gloves and my shovel
Tie up my boots because the mud it gets thick
And hit a lick so quick, they think I love this shit
It's real life gutter livin', nigga comin' straight from the brain
Some handle the pressure and others break from the pain
It's been fifteen other damnedest and ain't nothin' changed but the weather
Times' still gettin' harder and niggas can't stick together
All through my teens, my twenties, even when I'm thirty
T-Will'll be gritty, grimey, constantly dirty...

[Chorus x2]
Ain't nobody every gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle ya heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

Yo!
Ain't nobody gave me nothin' but God
He gave me talent, these civilians perpetrating the fraud
That point is valid, got niggaz sayin' they made me
The only thing that was made was music 'cause nobody ever properly paid me
Don't get it twisted, that little money was appreciated
It got me out there again, glad that's alleviated
But the nigga that say I didn't have a followin'
before Mitchell Bade hit the streets must be inebriated
Soon as Mitch hit, it hit!
Because we some talented motherfuckers but they still talk shit
Keep that shit low black - that shit be gettin' back
to a nigga that will fight for you at the drop of a hat
I tried to tell 'em, let me do this here
They talkin' like they don't want Nina gettin' through this year
I'm still strugglin 'hard, how can niggas disregard? I'm thirty!
Watch what you say when you speak to little birdies
I'm constantly dirty...

[Chorus x2]
Ain't nobody every gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle ya heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

Constantly dirty, constantly dirty [Repeat x4]

[Chorus x1]

Tech N9ne,"[Chorus]
He won't play me on radio cause they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
[Repeat 4x]

[Verse 1]
Don't nobody want to deal with a nigga that got it together
For real and even think his own thoughts
Everybody want to do what everybody else doing the copy cat is what
They been taught, Imma get in the brain of the lame
I contain pain and imma give it to the rap game
The way you're doing it the way you're pursuing it you're
Gonna ruin it villain it's a god damn shame.

Are you ready for the real here we go now,
Most on the radio can't flow now,
Everyday I gotta cut the radio down
Sound like another pac or an O-Town
You can't have a contest or a show down
When two cats got the same kind of flow sound
Tecca Nina I'm coming to put the mo down
Run up in the record label with a four pound

Am I too versatile cursed to drown in the bowels 
Of the earth man I'll be first to growl and burst out the vowels
Of the original murderist verse out the mouth
Big Tech N9ne's gonna be the one running the race
That's real I'm speaking to everyone in the place
I can deal with you don't like the drum
And the bass if you can deal with a mother fucking gun in your face

I can't get with it, record labels and the industry is sick with it
P.D.'s some really don't know a hit for shit
Kick the bitch if you diss my hit, you might get pistol whipped
Catch'em in the hall, hitt'em in the jaw
Give it to the fans they can get it all
Cause the industry is punks, Tech I'm ready to get krunk
I'm comin' to straight dump with a pump

[Chorus]
[Repeat 4x]

[Verse 2]
How many 2 pacs and JZ's and Master P's can they conceive?
Don't they know a few gloc's 380's and master keys will make'em bleed
How you gonna say black people won't listen to this or don't listen to that
Like saying a fool can slang cane a fool can gang bang but never will get hit with a gat

You better get your story straight cause I ain't no devil for real
I'm a rebel for real that Tech N9ne is on some other level for real
You're a pebble to real niggas songs like Psycho Bitch and Real Killer
Einstein nigga that's a mill stealer the idiots say black folk won't feel us

What you think we dumb? Do we all gotta run when the heat come?
Showing original tongue it'll be fun but the mother fuckers want the bums
And the weak ones Suge Knight punked
The industry quick that's because most the industry's bitch nigga
I'm a man I don't be running from nobody we deal with niggas who trippin' and giving us shit

Radio won't play the unk fay thought they wanted rap
To advance but they ont day when I die imma aunt hay
Every industry faggot who giving money to an unk pay
Tech and Tekneko get people involved from KC to Mexico
Strapped with that fat desert eagle run up on the industry 
And let the heat go

[Chorus]
[Repeat 4x]

[Verse 3]
You can look into my E.Y.E.'s and you can see why these
Mother fuckers don't want to see my steeze
Cause imma killa when lyricals come undone I do miracles
And I come from the kingdom of rumble drums
And hums become bumbles, I'm the one that begun the gun tongue get sprung
Got everyone comin' in bundles

Act like a bitch treated like a bitch, act like a chump
Treated like a chump when the funk jumps what you gonna want?
Ain't gon want nothin' industry punks you can run but ya can't hide from the ride
You can say that it's dope but I won't buy it, you can think Tech 9
Really won't fly but I got a killer ear and a killer eye

Def Jam take chances in my opinion, they give advances to the niggas
That's really on universal loud laface, that's some of my favorites
But the ones who call the shots most of 'em on some hater shit.

That other shit, for ya mother sis or your brother bitch
Not no lover lick, packing blackened fat and blubber shit
Yeah, the radio dead cause the industry is punks put the 
Double barrel to its foe head

Come on now

I hear 'em whisperin' in corners speakin' dirty talk on us
Bout how we too grown up, that we unknowners 
And my persona is rock 'n rollish yo' nigga told us
Every word that you quoted 

Said I wouldn't be the one that sold it, but ha we exploded
I'm that rap nigga that you heard with 2Pac, Sole
Lynch and Bo, Wake Up Show wit King Tech and Sway
Yukmouth, Thicker Than Water, Gang Related, Eminem

Roger Trout, MC Ren, nigga Spice-1 and them
Hit 'em wit a venom send 'em down kill 'em when I spit
When I get a bit of scrilla Tech is givin niggas shit
Love 'em love us but the playa hatin niggas betta split

It'll neva be another Tecca Nina when I quit
You better kneel when you hear a nigga that's real 
I feel 18 when I bust from the grill 
Because, (if you keep it young)

Yo song is always sung 
So street life taught me to keep 'em sprung
God sent me to kill, lyrical scripts
The miracle whipped you demons and hatas who tripped

Listen I really feel, my Villainty real when he spit
Fuck them plus anybody they go get, and shit

You can pray and pray on my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on

The storm consumes all the sun and moon fall 
When you saw the mega morion dregorian Jet and are you Paul's
Extreme case of blue balls cuz you bang
Got fruit all in his veins 

What I'm sayin' is I will reign murder you all in his name
Biss malla wit the fist in a pistola 
Dismiss the kiss from a hiss giva
Wrist slita male bitch or witch wit a twist

A glitch man abyss swimma, trick
I will never slide, never fall, never fail
Never the devils side, ever call, never hell
But I got these muthafuckas prayin' for my downfall

But the orange hair means time to clown y'all
Thanks to Jenny I'll get the message to many
The circus is comin' and gunnin' wit plenty
I heard that Bakari got a poster of me burnin'

To get his earnin' concernin' not I killed him but he ain't learnin'
Nigga you couldn't burn me wit acid or in a fiery pit
You couldn't burn in a volcano were lava is spit 
You couldn't burn me if you damned me to hell where Satan sit
The only way you can burn me is wit ya bitch nigga

Why don't you niggas keep ya mouth shut 
Without us you clout sucks you doubt us and get ya mouth bust
We veterans and better then you young cheesy cheddar men
Bouncin' across the nation and you home watchin' Letterman

I'm the nigga that got 'em listenin' I know its sickenin'
To know I'm the nigga got girlies coochie glistenin'
From listenin' to my shit and when I get her for christenin'
She splits again cuz I made her spit the nitro glycerin

I'm on you, callin' me a old negro
But I don't know a young nigga that could hold me though 
Plus the dough be low, average and I hold the glow
But they want me to fall so they can say ""I told you so""

But if I'm mutli punks would say I just lucked up
Keep talkin' that shit might getcha fucked up
You some Jimmy Rucker Tommy Tucker type of muthafuckas
Glamorize and specialize in gettin' butt fucked

Niggas think they dope then gonna try to check me
I'm here to let yo ass know you need to respect me
Although you ain't sayin shit you gettin' on my nerves
I'ma keep on keepin' on mufucka that's word

They say I don't fit in
But I won't listen

You can say what you wanna 
I'ma come up on a 
Life from livin' gutta

To suck, me and Kuniva, let this diabetic dick touch your saliva
I think I'm gone and crazy, fourteen to forty eight
Ever since we've fucked
I've been coughing and loosing weight
Skank ho, trying to creep

Taking a piece of my soul every time
That I bust a nutt she's like a succubus
A nymphomaniac laying me back on the filthy mattress
Cum stains on it smelling like catfish
Still I hit it, yeah I did it
Her pussy travels
She doesn't have a pivot I remember when she was timid
Your scandalous ass taking a pass this cash
Got him on tape suckin' your tit snortin' and passing hash
I still had to grab that ass
Had to laugh at stories about your ragged ass maxi pads
You silly bitch, she used to be a nerdy bitch
Now she's in the backyard fucking thirty kids

Now besides being on X, and regardless me loving sex
We getting close to you Lex, its grindin' every kick
Fingers up your pussy, your hands rubbing my dick
As soon as my wife push me
Your man's fucking her trick
You don't care if she know I trip
But she's starting to get ??? to it
'Cause she's finding matches in my pockets that say I strip
Which means I might get caught
Loose everything that I've brought
The house the kids and the car
I know this sounds bizarre
But we should give her a call
And see if she want in
That way its three way sex and we can all be friends
I know you done if before
Don't act like you haven't whore!
I'm about to loose my wife I can't afford a divorce!

(Send me I warn you) She Devils in the house lemme here ya
(Hey) Off top I gots to get near ya

Fucking with your pussy is a handful (for real)
You think I'm drowning but I'm clowing
So basically bitch you a damn fool
And that's a given fact
Plus I remember back when you was young
I could see a hundred niggaz through your gap
And all of them was probably hitting that, that's embarrassing
You stuck with thirty children, seventy miscarriages
In and out of buildings, ain't carin' who it is
Fucking newly weds, didn't mean to do it but you did

Devil is she, she never to be (faithful)
Credit to free its better that she (tranquil)
Even her apple
My cock unlock the keys to your asshole
Stop the plot through the freeze with my cash flow
Cock the Glock at them ??? in the castle
Fresh out of school with a disease in the tassel
Skis in the satchel
You just my (ho) that's the reason you stack dough

Shit this feels good baby whatchu say this was again?
Don't worry about it, just relax
Ooo here, let me lick on this
Its gonna cost you
I got all of it baby
Well that's exactly what I need

I'm a product of reganomics, neurotic
They sayin homage is gone up, inhaling chronic
The oddest I'm stayin honest - I'm bout to make it famous
So you can take that J-O-be	 and you can shove it up your anus
I ain't never understood how the world works
But I always understood why the girls twerk
for a baller not a nine-to-five
Barely makin it with disgust behind ya eyes
So I just, grip my piece, rip off fleece
Out to take ya lip off chief, with my peeps
We ruthless - if you got money then deuce it
Goofs get toothless, with loose off two-fifths, we useless
I want to kick it but ain't got the dough
Sneak in the concert, trip and make 'em stop the show
We gots to go! Push me and I sock the po'
Gettin the bail from my parents is impossible

I stay rid of you lames (y'all gay!)

When Kans City mo' brains, it's gritty slow game
We diddy-bop with really no change (y'all bang!)
And people holla ""How ya do dat dere""
""Why ya pants hanging low, and why you grew that hair?""
Lightin a bleeze or with my people ridin a Regal
Always in trouble with coppers 'cause we drivin illegal (drivin illegal)

A stallion
Ass like pow
Chest like bang
Lips like ooh
An angel mane
But she had the devil's eyes
I had to have her cat

[Verse 1]
Pass me the 151 and coke cat
And later we'll find where the dope at
but hold that
I seen something so fat
That wish I could've drove back
To get my codac
Strip teeasa!
Loving who got the visa
Got up and she will please ya
Not of then she don't need ya
Product Gucci Felecia
It's a duty to feed ya
Amnesia
Caribou and tequezia
Off the turnbuckle baby bub I have the booties and boobies
It was nootie so cootie was a cutey
I gotta get neara
I got mucho dinero
Look at her look at herself in the mirror
Moving like Shakira
Made my way
To the front of the stage
100's for days
Big body I wanted to praise
Will she get with a nigga? maybe!
She bent over and said thanks and I whispered in her ear

[Chorus x2]
Tech: I love the way you make it slither baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like something that I want to run through
Girl: You want some, ooh
Tech: You know I want to
Girl: Baby we can have fun too (I love the way you make it slither baby)

[Verse 2]
Well she asked me for a lap dance
And Trav said she too fine, fat chance
Boy I'm Tech N9ne I rap and
I slap hands
With millionaires plus I got stacks man
She approached me slowly
Holy moly
Chef Boy are Dee's cheese and beef ravioli
Hold me close
Nose be ope
How much evil can dough provoke
How much she told me nope
Cause this one was on her
I'm hoping I can get the chance to put it on her
She slithered on me put the booty in my lap and got to gyrating
Was I waiting
For the pushing grabbing and vibrating
But this is really when my pupils got to dilating
What kind of magical hocus pocus was I facing
Over and over I tried to explain it the best that I could
She put the mouth on the crotch of my pants and said (HERRRRRH)
[Hook]

Tech: Shit
Girl: you like that baby?
Tech: How about me and you leave here baby so we can do that shit you just did
Over and over again

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
Said she needed 400 to tip out
I whip out
The grip so quick so we can dip out
The trick house
Told my homies not to poke they lip out
I'm going to rip out
The guts and try to throw my hip out
Now it's time to trip out
Got at the bitch house
Was three fine female roommates my homies missed out
Took me to her room and threw me right on the bed
Got right on the head
What a wonderful night it was said
Then along came 3
36 double D's
Sizes kissing and licking on me
They coming to do what
Wake my dude up
But one of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood
Then the other and the other
Instead of bud lovers
I'm trapped with blood sucking motherfuckers for eternity
Brought me here to straight feed on a nigga
All because I said to a stripper

Tech N9ne: Whatever
Girl: want to get high?
Tech N9ne: Let's do it",T9X,2002
Tech N9ne,"Yo what's up.
For those who don't know.
I go by the name of Tech N9ne.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
Some of the things already known, that are familiar with me.
and my thoughts.. so these are the real thoughts.
I'ma share with you like this.

Don't you come near me 'cause the Devil's sittin' next to me
I drink my drink, and smoke my weed and pop my ecstasy
Then add some GHB and mushrooms to the recipe
This means I'm really lettin the beast within get the best of me

If you can hear me, I need help
I'm caught and I'm stuck and I'm trapped in this self
Don't understand this fucked up hand that G dealt
Lazarus help me 'cause it's hazardous to T's health
He's set trippin' he's tryna get a nigga killed
and get a nigga peeled, the other side is gonna rid 'em in the field
No sentimental feelings, send 'em in the cold buildings
I tried to tell him where you go you will not see your women and your children
He popped, fifteen hits of ex in one night
Lick dick tips have sex with some dykes
And he won't use protection for my erection
Constantly makin' me get that pencillin injection

Wait, I hear voices, speakin' from inside
I'm out front waitin', he creepin' and he hides
I can't help but notice he's kinda stuck up, I'ma let it slide
But in the meantime shut the fuck up, and just ride

[Chorus]
Oooooh I'm a psycho baby.
Oooooh it's about to drive me crazy.
Oooooh I'm a psycho baby.
Oooooh it's about to drive me crazy.

When I was younger I used to faint at the sight of blood
Now that I'm older I notice that it ain't at the sight of blood
Now the sight of blood equals the very first sign of love
Menstrual cycles, feeling like you right at your height of drugs
Bleed for me baby, made your heart rage
Fuckin' you makes me feel a murderous sensation, blood mixed with ejaculation
Cum bustin', bump heads 'til concussions
After we done fuckin', if I can't get the spirit I've won nothin'

I got children, and a wife
He's thinkin' of leapin' off a buildin', takin' flight
By now somebody shoulda killed him, end his life
Too many motherfuckers feel him, and his mic
Somebody stop him 'cause he's fuckin' up my livelihood
With me trapped inside this psycho how can I be good
To my wife the (?) only close to it for money, he's in it
A monster running back and forth from the free clinic
If you a friend, time to say toodaloo
'Cause ain't no possible way he can ever be true to you
Careful your appointment could do the due
If he wants to kill hisself, what the fuck you think he want to do to you?

[Chorus]

I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'
Brain deteriorating 'cause I'm ex pill poppin'
I got more troubles, whatever you got it doubles and triples
and quadruples, havin fantasies of eatin' nipples and noodles
Drugs take the pain away
Used to have a lotta love but now I fade away
The fact, that women love the music and they open they legs
for a psychopathic nigga that's so fucked up in the head, it's beautiful
(Told my parents this isn't suitable)
Devil bitches'll learn (No!) Gotta recruit a few
(This nigga's gonna do me harm! I'm drugged up and I'm torn!)
(Look at this motherfucker he colored my hair orange!)
You can't touch me, everybody loves me
Listening to my music, children are gettin' ugly
If I told you everything I was thinkin' it wouldn't be G
Tellin' you how many crossed my path just wouldn't be me
But they know, 'cause they way low
About some ex and fry and jayo and fuck a halo
Alotta Jim Beam to have grim dreams would be healthy
(Aiyyo I'm trapped in psycho's body, can ya help me?)

Tech N9ne,"I'ma tell y'all a lil' story man, yaknahm'sayin? 
Yo this is a song about, somebody who did me wrong dawg
I thought you was my homie man I guess not
Fuck it

You was supposed to be my, dawg
Homie when I first met you what was told to me was, fraud
What a shocker, and imposter, I've been crossed, I lost ya
My best friend turned out to be an enemy, that's endin' me
Hidden, no sympathy, no empathy either, homie I never denied ya
Nuttin' that you wanted - women? I never playa-hated
I hooked you up, booked you up from the beginning
This enemy had love for you, shared blood for ya
When ya wanted to dig I dug for ya nigga
But you a double-crosser, nasty hand-tosser
I shoulda known you was evil when ya told me you was cool
For we could be sex fools when we under the steeple, the retrieval
I'm tryna get my life back
No more stoppin' women from puttin' a knife at ya cap
Remember when we was kickin' it, bitches was givin' it everyday
We did it in every way, but the respect went away
You got a mind of your own now
You're grown now, can I ask you a question?
Did you forget we kinfolks nigga, we the same complexion?
I'm stressin'  you was always in front of me so I listened
Everyday you wanted me on a mission
I even let you have sex with my lady like a G
Infatuated with you and not me
I sucked it up, I got back wit her, you fucked it up
By lettin her know I was creepin around, with every chick in the town, Buster!
I shoulda known not to trust ya
Listen I'm losin' my life because of you!
I lost my life because of you! I'm losin my wife because of you!
I even had sex and a baby with the crazy bitch you introduced me to!
Now I'm straight depressed, I hate your flesh
But fate was just, belate to Tech, laid to rest
Every time you got drawers, you made my poor little life fall
Nigga ya got balls you ain't never had a partner like me
Real, I never ever sold ya pipe dreams
Personal yes it might seem, nigga when you was burnin'
I went to get the doctor's side cleaned
Looked out for ya health, and this is the respect I get?
Hater, ya neck I'll slit, but I cain't 'cause I'm attached to ya
And I don't know why, sometimes I wish you would just die
That would eliminate all this hurt
Maybe I could get up outta all this dirt, ya caused me
So strong, nothing could stop you, not even cerebral palsy
I can't believe it; my best homie turned on me
You musta forgot we grew up together
I'm through, life is over now, there's nothin' else to do
Point the finger and blame it on you

(It's all because of you, you, you)
I lost my girl, my world, is upside down because I found you wasn't shit
(It's all because of you, you, you)

Peekaboo anybody home? where you at?
Tryin to be sneaky creeping behind me mutha facka I saw that rail
Maybe its a mirror or a different person he was grabbin his nuts and spittin and curseing at me fag!
There somethings in this life that I fail to understand even as even as a grown man I don't comprehend
Like how in the fuck did I walk up the stairs and some fucking how I ended up down here
Well laughing and giggleing like a little school girl with my homies Jay and Tech ain't even there Hmmm
What the fuck not a damn single bitch in this place but some ones figgin my nuts
I got it done well sittin with my pants around my ankles dry humpin my hand
A lot of mother fucker claim the insanity plead but not me 
Its this house that's gone mad I'm insane as can be!

It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

Ain't no wicked we can kick it if you blue or beamed up

If you, see me step off in the clubber with some pros
With about 6 of `em cut no longer waiting to be chose
And if you hear me tell my homies anything goes

[Repeat: x8]
With these chickens dippin' to Davy's right when the clubber close 

If you see me on the grind getting' mine
If you bust in the room and find me hittin' yours from behind
If you hear me bustin' rhymes rippin' each and every time

If I got it at capacity and you still got a line 

If I'm rollin' on dubs, if it's K-Town bud

And I'm pullin' out the latex and given it to who's next

[Intro]
The strangest, straight derangest, start it J, start it J
Uh, MidWest Side, IIIDQ found laughin
 
[Verse 1]
Lets get it on, raps new phenomenon
Hitt'em up with the flips
Rupture your dome
Calm down, you say me song sound like Butch?
You say I'm washed up? Nigga what!?
This is when I kick it with this rhythm-simplistic
Fuck dem 9 rhymes, make them go blind every time
On that cannabis, edist, not for a weak mind
But the mind of a gauge
On stage cuzz minimum wage has me on maximum rage
Page mac, lets scrap, the conniseur of rap
See me, come tight like a pig in a bikini
Please! All emcees know I be on my Q's and P's
Even Run-D.M.C. is on a deadly disease
High voltage, take a look at the psychosis
Deranged, I claim, let me explain
Fatrocious, flows be cocked from KC to Wisconsin
My killer flow makes me jerk my Johnson
 
[Verse 2]
Mushroom headed keeps me pathetic,
But the ?
Treating life like I'm moving bombay
Brother with the ganja stickin it
Gonna stick it if you let it
Come here, no come?
I'll run dancing
Just call me the strangest, straight G, bombay
Distinguish the fuck of shit
From hip-hop comes this
Apocoflips got control of your hips
Its venomous, how the rap metamorphasis
MC corpsesis around me
They found me jacuzzin with my sorcerists
Fire up the paper & get blowed
Then roll to a spot with bianca
Then bust holes in these hoes
Cuzz they want to kill me like they killed Bruce Lee
On the set, no shit
Told my bianca that's what she gets
Middle West flex flows, mics to sex those
Middle West flesh holes, insane games
Never that plane Jane
 
[Verse 3]
I give myself a see-section
With a rusty jagged weapon
Bungee wit 100 feet of slack
IN front of my kids with no discretion
Strange days like Julia Lewis and Angela Bassett in a casket
Trippin with the 9
Get your brain blown like a head gasket
Missouri is in the house for the '99 shot
Futuristic ladies love me a whole whole lot
When demons try to do me too
They know they wicked
So I bust if you ain't down with IIIDQ
Who are you!?!
Neena Tech, respect, MidWest Side
For life, grab a mic, and flip it like a dyke
The soundlab got my microchip screwed
Mounfunction, ?, now I'm cool

no shame, aim triggas, brain splitters, game quitters? NO!

Man I had a ticket I had to grab 'em
Come to find out I was in a rhyme bout a couple years ago

Out the roof, scoop the group we be troopin' large crowds
Yes we are foul and we rich now

Used to be all of me, but it's all on the bitch now
They wanna get me stuck, they comin' into my world
It's too late I got my wife, my bitch, my girl

I was nineteen, met a nice queen
Car was light green, naughty as ice cream
But she too jealous nickaleas
Sort of ridiculous with the liffa kickin' it

We can never be inconspicuous, my bitch
Rolls with me, it's so sickly in love with me
But she give me Felicia 'ol hickeys
But go get me in the wee hours to get me slow quickies
So sticky, roll with my homies she so shifty, my wife

Married a monsta, carried a youngsta
Said if you cheated, it will come back to hunt ya
She said my filthy world, makes her wanna hurl
And that's my first verse, my wife, my bitch, my girl

Can't really touch it durin' the day but in the night, tame it

Got a big butt, a big slut who get bucks
You might look up and get your chick sucked
'Cause she's bi sex, keep her thighs wet
Spontaneous I don't know what we gonna try next, my wife

Dump checkin' to [Incomprehensible] with some check's and you lose

Out of balance the playalistical values and lyin'
I done challenged the way of mystical powers and [Incomprehensible]
I can silence an egotistical chick in a fight
I'm defiant with an evil twist my girl, my bitch and my wife

Ain't no bitch on this planet that is a match for me
They get sick and they stand it 'cause Nina packs the three
Have to be, crash to see if natural cause a catastrophe
Exactaly, my wife don't like me, my bitch get's hyphy, my girl

Might knife me twice just to spite me, my wife
If I break her heart, my bitch

Wait a minute, I’m from the West Coast Conference
Like Kobe or James Worthy
You could just call me the King of the Valley
All I need is a game jersey
Nigga nuts and guts get served up
When I get it, I’ll spit enough, aim sturdy
Cut it up, gut it up, with colds cuts
And in a oven I’ll heat it up, came dirty
I be off’a that Crip tonight
Turn ‘em into liquid ice, paint his jersey
Leave ‘em in the back of the alcove
Like Helter Skelt’, stick it to ‘em like velcro
Nigga, I’m a bitch killer
I’m a dig a ditch, quick to rip ya
Paint a murder picture wit'cha
I’m a jack knife, strip ya that night
Split your legs open and dick you
But them quick into rippin’ your guts
Deep heat, deplete you with the meat cleaver
That I didn’t see you either
Phone call or receiver, court order delete you
Tech ordered the meat, I’m bringin’ the seasonage
And a suicide note, do-or-die Loc

‘Cause I be Dalima, motherfuckers hatin’ me for the longest
Could it be critical ‘cause I’m lyrically flawless?
And if I’m heated I cannot be mentally cautious?
(Diggin' the pain) I get deep peepin’ the flame
Only can I be held accountable for makin’ the change
To whatever regards are gonna be (Insane)
In the middle of a stage, I’m bustin’ like a 12-Gauge
You can never bring it to a nigga that’ll hang you up
Slip a couple millions up in your drink for you
Homicidal with the fully-loaded rifle
An undecided of whether or not I can peel brains or guts
(I get spaced out sometimes)
And it’s like I’m a heathen, whether or not you believe it
Everytime I rap a motherfucker stop breathin’
Have you ever been in a dilemma for a reason? (Nah)
Well, let me introduce you to the crucial upliftin’ future (Indeed)
Recruit you and seduce you to the mutual group of (My friends' souls)

We done put together the fettiest chemical frame
Energetic when I let it, embed it in your brain

I might be a small cat, but I won’t use discretion
Hit ‘em with a weapon, if he steppin’ with a mall rat
20 minus 11, I make ‘em all scat!
Not prosperous now, Tech’s not with his crowd
He’s lost in his clouds
Rather be off’ed than soft with his style
I got hopes that my life might get better
But I’ve been broke, so I might swipe your chedder
You better get ready to give me, I got a vendetta
Comin’ to get it, whether weed or money, whatever
Nobody said it was gonna be easy, people deceive me
Or leave me in the dark and buried off in Necropolis
One day you gon' see on me TV, you better believe me
Takin’ over this and never the opposite
Rewrite my life, gimme light, inner fight for what’s right
Allah Liberate, Cuidado
151 Rum is how we run from slim sums, then comes Diablo
I need a medic ‘cause I murder energetic
In the cerebellum never tell ‘em I got
One of the worst problems in the Medulla Oblongata
And you ought to go in one hell of a shot!
No more darkness, how did I start this?
Feelin' bizarre shit, like kickin’ your carcass

First thing I wanna say is (what!)
Y'all can't fuck wit us
Y'all can't fuck wit us

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
It's the one
With a name of a gun
Look at me mamma what I become
It's a, monsta, gangsta, fast
But I want to, thank ya for the last
Thirty-three
Because everybodys heard of me
And if they say that I'm fakin' momma it's purgary
Cause your son comes with thunda now
That's why they wonder why we headline when I'm underground
In this mainstream game
My gang brings pain, to cowards
Said I'm done Calli give me the power
Come on wit it (HAA!)
You industry punks I hope you fakes die
Cuase most of rappers have a queer eye for the straight guy
Was that shit loud enough to hear
Loud enough to eco throguh the city and bust your ears
Patrick tried to sue us for a whole lot of bucks this year
Sell crazy somewhere else trick (Were all stocked in here)
Hey! I think I wanna say it again, y'all
Y'all can't fuck wit us

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Krizz Kalico]
Y'all can't fuck wit us

Yo! Big Krizz Kalico

[Verse 2: Big Krizz Kalico]
Fuck niggaz that got it in for me
Pretend to cry, still got there energy
Loud, dudes feeling to be proud
Dude full of frown
Which is two hands and both thumbs down bitches
For the Bianca's and Beatrice's
The Beatrice's is miraculous
You don't want to go on after us (No)
This is a slip of ridiculous
Can't get with us flows
Actually a bit of babalin' in your soul up
We all grown up
And when we blown up
Don't get to frontin'
I'll get you country boys nuttin'
You can cut us to thirty we stay on for an hour
Cause them heads boppin' in the crowd's ours (ABSOLUTE POWER!)
Main thing is taking over this mainstream
The game seems like they been waiting for a new A team
Ask Busta Rhymes, he said that nobody had the gift like him and Spliff
But me and Tech N9ne, well y'all ain't fucking with

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Tech N9ne]
This beat make me wanna say hallaylooya (HAHAHA)

Y'all can't fuck with us
Y'all can't fuck with us

[Verse 3: Big Krizz Kalico]
Okay this stopin' addiction (Now we got y'all listenin'!)
Just a fraction of friction
From the act you was missin'
If you was actually listenin'
You'd see whose ass you be kissin' (MUWHA)
Your dealin' with one hell of a brotha ya see
I'm anghellic but devils bring out the devil in me
I might pull the bullet so cover you see
A goody, goody get hoody less for messin' with me

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
This is my testament Tecca Nina been pressed against war
Simply done best to get to get next to it so I repped is all
Grab your breast to this havin' sex next so pop your crystal
Crock ya legs a bit rock ya bed drop them DRAWERS
Tis to men to
The one you wan to take a stand to
You chumps in trouble we bout to bubble like shampoo
You might try but you can't do what Aaron and Sam do
You tryin' to ban who

Tech N9ne,"What you're about to witness
Is one of the best collaborations of all time
Kansas City's
Humboldt County's
Show 'em we are what we are (hey yo!)

When I rap no never know what the fewer, better
A mouth full of cheddar make a greedy setter
Got a mean vendetta, my team is too clever
Never ever gonna stop, 'cause I rock forever (forever)
You ain't never gonna see me when I be me
When it comes to the rhymes, can't beat me
All the girls say, you complete me
Even some 'em weekly wanna meet me (haha)
Bust on the scene like Jeezy (yeeeah)
And everybody want a Potluck CD
After the show, collect the dough
Then we go to the hotel blowin' smoke
You gonna hold the Po' because my flow is dope
Because I'm invincible, you can't sink the boat
Fuck American Idol, we rock hardcore bitch
Get stupid, get dumb, matter fact let's thizz
Underrated in about my peers
Put the pump in the back of the Benz
Quick better tell all your friends
It's Potluck and Tech N9ne rockin' again
And we rockin M-O with Krizz Kaliko
His flow is so cold, gotta go gold
And a lock in the do' like a fo-fo at a show
Man I'm never so-so
Under syllable criminal won't forget it but let it go
In the stereo, sure up and gettin' high
Motherfuckers starin' but pity for 'em baring
But when they lyric go and if you wanna bet 'em they gonna die
Now we gotta roll the riches (no lie)
Hanging up the colder bitches (don't cry)
Gotta stand in the street with my hand on my dick
Cause I wanna be sayin', I'm rich bitch (bitch!)

When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are
When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are

Anybody got another pill
I gotta get a motherfucker to give me the artificial loving
I wanna be trippin', I gotta be high
Tryin' to kick it hella wicked until we die,
Never the nigga to get a milli when I'm trippin' and buckin' it
I'm the nigga in the party with your bitch and I'm fuckin' it
But you gotta be ready to get up and go
If you wanna start up a fight over raggedy ho's
Me and Potluck, put the cocks up, in a hot slut
Tryin' to bust a nut before the slot locks up
Given a minute to get us up in it but everybody shiver when I deliver the jock pops up
Underrated he made it a bomb with the heat
Makin' it so it ain't never calm in the street
Tech the nigga with One Ton, nigga we come from nothin'
We bustin' like hell spawns on a bu-bu-bu-bu-beat
Verbally you heard of me, murder thee, mental capacity
Flippin' with Missouri in back of me, pack a be
Thinkin' I'm 'bout to be Tech attack a motherfucker with the tongue
Nigga you better be steadily bringin' the melody,
Readily, 'cause every nigga's thinkin' ahead of me
We'll never be fetty because I bring it like a bullet from a gun
So what you really wanna do?
Get back on the road, get a sack, crack a brew
Put a bitch in the back and I give her what she really
Want a motherfucker to makin' it do, what it do
With the Carrabou Lou, 151, Malabu Rum, and Pineapple Juice
You know the party gotta be fun, compatible groups of nigga's
Chillin' with your home girls in 707 with the liquor

When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law

Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are

Bartender can I get another round
With a little bit a ice and a lot more Crown
Keep it strong with the clowns when I'm in your town
Bet it all goes down, 'cause I got that sound
Say what I want to when I jump up on your rhythm
When I smoke better try Humboldt
Better hit 'til you cry and choke
Now know why I rhyme so dope
Party all day and night with a hoe
Gotta get that dough like I just passed go
Where the next show better be the best, yo
Kick it at the hotel, I just get so frisco
All the way to 'Isco, flow magic and I say presto
Let a nigga get a little sip of X-O
I pull the best one and tell the bitch let's go (come on)
I do what I do, rap what I be
Flow straight heat, gettin' high in the street
Got what I need, grow a mouth full of seed
You can take it from me, we the top of the peak
Do what I can for the fan, I am what I am, I'm another weed man
Green like a vegan, not a mean man
I don't gotta green thumb, I gotta whole green hand

We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll

To vertical murders sho dumpin' on niggas with Strange

My patients will scorn the heavy fuckin' spitters on

My swagger so mean wit the mini machine on my back
For violence I fiend, I move with a team (?) crack
Go loco for rojo, I put that mozzle to ya back
And take you on a walk ya won't come back from

Don't you run up when I'm wit a bitch

Chump, I don't do battles and this rap will outshadow ya spit

And you heathens ain't street deep so keep beefin' and get yo head tore off
So dim scram fo sight of thee grim hand

Then I can give it to you with singin' and rappin'
Don't think I can't be clappin' at your habitat

Ain't no running from
Karma, ain't no running
Ain't no running from
Karma, ain't no running

I'm the caboose of the wrong doings you produce
The wild tail of the tornado running loose
You tie the noose, I kick the chair
I'm the cyanide that snatch your life while you gasp for air
The echo of the ""fuck you"" that boomerangs to hurt your loved ones
The thief that held your son, held by ransom
The pervert that raped your wife
The hand that held the knife that took your life
You shot Tupac and Biggie
Now I'm coming after you like v-w-x-y-z
This is cause and effect, the domino effect
The ""what goes up, must come down"" effect
You hoping, though, that you had a hand in doin' the doin'
The conclusion of the evil that you ended and start pursuing

[Chorus]

This is the payback from the past
You threw me down like I was just a piece of trash
You gave me cash every week just enough to live
But didn't get what I deserved instead I was deceived
Still young and didn't know about this in the street
Of the acts, so crass and shady
Don't crush your dream show and your whole entity
Subliminally you're on the hire from a slavery
Remember that what goes around, comes around
God is watching you and everything that you do
Do you remember everything that you did before
The way the bad action opens karmic door

I'm a leave it up to Him what he got for me

Because stupid is how everybody sounded
Nigga you think you know me, but only if you knew me
Homie, you would leave me by my lonely
I'm thinking death and destruction
Images of blood and pus and I ain't looking for nothing but trouble
Thinking of murdering you when I'm just lounging

Block it out and keep it moving
I'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing
Gimme the Bible, yes I need it 'cause Tecca Nina's in ruin
Mentally I'm fuckin' up when really I don't know what I'm doin'
My tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidly
I'm gobbling more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me
The holy father must have flipped and became mad at me
Because I'm pondering a wicked insane strategy
How to end it all (Yeah), many men will fall (Yeah)
Any sin I saw (Yeah), Nina been involved (Yeah)
You don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall
The taste of blood on my tongue makin' me want to brawl
No sentimental shit, death is the penalty
For any bitch you try to re-kindle this
It'll get your temple hit
'Bout to bubble, about to pop just like a pimple get
Send it something so insane I'm so not for simple shit
So teeter totter mothafucka if you want it
But just keep it to the left of me, crazy 'til the death of me
Pussy money more money blood and guts is the recipe
Half and hell of drama for Nina is a necessity
Good and bad is fightin' within me and I'm the referee

Instead of human beings
I'm havin' feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding
Causin' your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving
Entered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles
Keep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles
I'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows
As I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles
My eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums
It's time to hit the streets with guns
I'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run
I plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done
Until the pain coincides with my violence and agony
Oh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me
But it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds
The Hitchcock of hip-hop, the end is comin' soon

Irritate
But get all buddy buddy in my face
I hate envious motherfuckers
Better migrate
Off into something other than my state
If you was better than us
Gettin' more cheddar than us
You would be measuring up
You niggas ain't clever enough
All of you bitchin' because you wishin'
You was in a position
Fuck you niggas

Strange music
Trap and tech having threats
From cyber thug niggas

Tech N9ne,"[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
And I was told in school I was a fool and money, I'd never gain none
But I used my flow as a tool, they was cruel
Said I'd be no rapper, but I did work and became one
Now it's a cryin' shame, I'm buyin' things and they got debts they got to pay back
I think I know why my teachers would look in my eye and say that
And whys that?

[Chorus: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Cause I'm a Blackboy
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin'
Yall don't think I see them purses yall clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little white-boys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through
True definition of a Blackboy

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
It must be the way that my pants sag
Or the sparklin' diamonds on the watch my left hand has
I know my appearance is looking like I am bad
In your department store all I wanna do is pop a damn tag
Made it honest, that's why the blacks get mad at you
Even foreigners shop and got big gratitude
I make more than you, but you got the attitude
Like I can't be shoppin' at Saks Fifth Avenue
I'm just tryin' to buy my baby some creed spring flower
But they don't know that the Tecca Nina cheese means power
So they look at me like none of my breed brings valor
Thats why when you see us in passing we seem sour
Last time I checked, my power shockeras
I was on top of the indy charts and not a slotera
But I'm the author of darkness and I like the opera
So why when I'm at Macbeth they wont treat me more propera?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Brother J]
Frontline, shoot, soldiers represent that
Frontline, shoot, Grand Verb, it's the snatch back
Head wrapped in the desert, boombox on the camel back
Escape from the clone lab, fugitives spook black
With finesse in you, its the knowledge from way back
The prophet of the page don't eat right till it all cracks
Blackboy rappin' from the pages torn
Street scriptures more classic than the Jimmy Cracked Corn
A spawn of the movement, keep the music movement
So my purpose stays clear and my music stays groovin'
I do it for the real, I don't need Jena Six
For me to know America is still on that bullshit
So people think that black are just ball players and singers
That massa complex is what fuels the street bangers
And street soldiers to stand up
No choice to get it right, so these Blackboys can finally get they man up

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
I'm a Blackboy and always gettin' underestimated
But when I move next door, I know you hate it
You had my whole family investigated
And when they didn't find no crack, you said I ate it
Uh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated
Over ghetto life that was designated
You see this Blackboy, you know heaven made it
I don't want to go if I got to integrate it
You know pellot boy, be happy you made it
Just take what you got, and stop complainin'
OK, weather man will stop the rainin'
On my people head, and start explainin'
What your people said, believe in the bible
But you still act barbaric and psycho
My name is Ice Cube, bitch, it ain't Michael
I'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you

[Chorus]",Blackboy,2008
Tech N9ne,"I was born in 71' in Kansas City, MO
My momma was a heavenly one, so the fam was pretty slow
When it came to rap and R&B and plenty more
Check it, if it wasn't on gospel, apostle
Or written in the Bible, then it go
So when they tell the baby don't do something then I end up doing it anyway
Like, don't listen to rap, it's the evil music of today
But, I really fell in love with the sound that was coming out form the East Coast
So we got it and twisted it up a bit, now the industry's having a heatstroke
Some say that rap is dead, but when I get the white, black, and red
And jump on the tour bus, do fifty eight shows, then I'm back with a big black sack of bread
Can't believe that that was said, cause I'm here with a stack of fed
And I got it from rap/hip-hop or whatever and I did not have to beg
So, here I stand, the mic in hand with my rap attire
And I like my fans spending grands cause we got the fire
I merchandise like 5 G's every half an hour
And you cry like a baby so your mic must be your pacifier

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
Wah wah wah (Crybaby)
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
Wah wah wah (Whatcha crying bout?)

If it's negative, I don't wanna hear it
Eliminating player haters with their evil spirits

I hear 'em talkin', they mad at Smurf and Souljah Boy
They hating big in the magazine, and don't even know the boys
I know the ploy, washed up rappers wanna attack people
Run up to the car, pull out the mac lethal
Man that's a problem with the black people now
What ya need to know is that, in the world there's a lot of dough to stack
And the ones that wanna hold us back ain't been outside they cul-de-sac
Every nigga I know is strapped, rip shows that'll blow ya back
But notice that, I can put it right down to where the shoulders at
Hating on the south? Why? Trippin' off them chips they got
You don't like that it's screwed and chopped
But you wanna get off in they pot
Wanna be MC you talk a lot, up in the spot and you hot
'Cause they eighty fours be poking out
What the hell is you cryin' bout?
Everybody wanna be killa but not for reala
Bout the method of making money you gotta get the milla
By doin' it like I do it do the work and believe in it
When you do it to the fullest ain't no problem achieving it
When I was broke, homie I went for mills
Got on the mic with the intent to kill
Stronger than ever, and you a gimp for real
I drink Caribou Lou, and you drink Enfamil, chump

[Chorus:]

You should be clapping when folk make it up outta the ghetto
Or trailer park, it don't matter even if he black or if he guerro
But, you don't know how to be male
Instead of a Timberland, you probably in a stiletto
Better yet in a baby shoe, jealous or maybe you
Sick of me cause I'm making dinero
And you don't wanna get clapped at
You want a standing ovation? I thought not!
You say you better than rappers on radio, man that's false chop
Try to run up on me, 'cause a benzo will never be in your car slot
Try to step up on the scene, my infra-red beam's right at your soft spot
If you was on TV and balling you wouldn't groan and trip
He'd keep hatred, envy, and bloodshed on his lip
Tech got long cream with chrome things on his whip
?? with a chrome thing on his hip
But just know your hip will not stop the hop
'Cause when you look at the big picture, my block pops a lot daily
So keep on thinking my clock stops the shots
And I can quickly bury you in your Osh Kosh B'Gosh, baby

Oh my goodness, is they talking shit again
When I been player on the day I become U.S. citizen
Haters keep wishen, I'ma take a lost but I'm finishin'
Killer but squirer just like Percy Miller no limits then
I aim for digits, 100% of my people came to get it
He used to be bigger but became a midget
Taken out of the game, livin' lame he lived it
So he gotta hate on the next man, 'cuz he don't got the money 
We left him on the bottom, now he the ex tech fan
Get the fuck outta my face, its you mistake I'm getting hotter sit and watch me expand
You take falls I take her and take drawls

Tell it like it is, when I rap so y'all identify
Start from the ground formulate an enterprise
Get outta here before u get punished and penalized
Ive been in fires to stay in this lane hommie
I swear when I rap, I say it ain't a thang phony
I'm icy, I'm shiny tho' I dont' got a chain hommie
Even when inside this booth I keep my thang on me
And when it rains homie, I don't complain hommie
Eliminate the cops so I don't have to strain hommie

Popper a done deal, every one of your soft soldiers

I do this for my partner standing out there on the block
And do this for haters on the sideline at night
Despite what they saying I just cant seem to stop
Gettin' this guap, I gotta a lot, partner I'm almost to the top
I gotta cop new watch, fresh grill and new cloths
I'm trying to come back candy low, side ways on fours
I gotta that bread, it be the money ova these hoes
'Cuz my friends be turning to foes, and harsh words lead to blows
They be mad at me 'cuz I'm the shit, while they just shit
And I gotta off my ass and get it while they just sit
They upset 'cuz im getting bread while they layin' in bed
Even tho I started at the bottom I'm a hundred miles ahead
They still be talkin' dime on me try to slander my name
'Cuz I'm the main man, but they wanna watch it change
They hate me 'cuz they hate but please make no mistake
They know me but can't stop me 'cuz I'm Paul Wall the great

Tech N9ne,"Hmmm, I don't even wanna fuckin do this song for real, but I wouldn't be real if I didn't

I be sittin' by myself and I be thinkin' mama what have I become
All I wanted was a family but I when I look I be the only one
Losin' everything but money everybody left and I don't even get to see my young
Only happiness I get is in the studio when I get to do another run
On the road
Doin' shows
Get the woes
When it slows
Gettin' cold
Gettin' owed
But the flows
Gettin' sowed
I been doin' this a minute, but I think I want to end it, 
Cause I think I'm on a higher level when I go
But the music I be doin' it, be losin' it, I'ma make it really tough for me to grow
All I wanted was a family portrait
See my babies on a ranch with horses
But I was fuckin' devil bitches in corsets
I was never really good, then I torched it
I'm sorry Mrs. Jackson I'm speakin' for real
And I never meant to make your daughter cry
But I guess I'm a failure with women
I'm lost and I feel like I ought to die
Feel like it, I'm rottin' away
My life is just off in the gray
How much does it cost I will pay
To lay and be off in a coffin today
I mean off in ashes, this life and after it clashes, if I get blasted,
This is suicide letters all over again I thought that I passed it
But I guess that I didn't cause this one is written and there is no mending
But I broke I'ma a joke when I croak I just hope that I wont be descending
But this ain't a joke I want you to know that tech nina is never pretending
Alone in my bed with a gun to my head asking where is my happy ending
Yea

[Chorus]
Tell me who it is
What about me
Where is my happy ending
What about me
Is this a life worth living
You know how it beacons
But how does it end for me
Will I ever live
Or does he have it in for me
Will this pop before I stop breathin'
Is there light in this dark I'm seein'

Yea
I put my life in this music
Nina is inside out
I set my heart out for people
They know what the inside bout
Will they keep feelin' nina forever this I doubt
Can never cry for help so if you listenin' this my (shout)
I'm searchin' for the passageway to happiness
But I'm worldly so I have to lay in nastiness
Yes this a strange year, worldwide fames near
But the games queer, sometime I feel like I'm Rudolph the reindeer
But instead of a red nose
I stay in my red clothes
And the music they said blows
Is on the top and the cred grows
Can you resurrect a motherfucker that feel like he possess a dead soul
Deteriorates when inferior state almost equal to bread mold
Now as my head goes, wish I could shed those
Because all of the times the nina was shorted, when I bled froze
So now that I'm cold blooded and hella sick is what the med shows
The tred slows and don't even think you revivin' a dead rose
Yea

[Chorus]

Listen
I'm on the verge of insanity but I'm competent
I'm breakin' so I picked this one to vent
The reason I look away when you talk to me my brain is producin' evilness
I'm drownin' in 151 and rum I meant, thats how I feel
I sit in the mirror with this gun and practice how to kill
But I know damn well that the people like me really wanna know how to chill
This is life is bout it check bout a number
Think of all the love I lost
Because my quest is not a meal
I feel like you stupid
Don't talk to me I'm crackin' up
I don't mean laughter I'm full of bitterness and its backin' up
And I live with angels but lately demons been shackin' up
Tug of war with my spirits, see the blood I'm hackin' up
I love my kids and my fans, inside I sob harder
Cause you paid the price for my life and its right like bob barker
And I wont pretend that its OK, I'm no facade starter
So I guess my only happy ending is at a massage parlor, yea

I'm sittin' here with another female and it's 'posed to be exclusive
Beauty, fully loaded booty hips and thighs
I want a raspberry lemonade, baby, and whatever yo name is on the side
You speak unique, beautiful teeth I just peeped
It's makin' me weak to the point I can't even eat
Cause you give me butterflies, them butter thighs need to be publicized

Never like them other guys, cause when I want it I'm on it

Take my order anytime, I come here many times
A week so she can give me mine, baby girl is plenty fine
Business meeting, capital grin, was sippin' when she caught my eye
When she came over to us I said, ""Can I get yo number on the fly?""
Smell like no other, look like she strip undercover
Wish I could follow her home and just say thank you to her mother
Another interested brother who'd love to become your lover
Burn rubber to the spot to tell my dogs how much I dug ya
Outta here but I'm not gonna leave this place without gettin' in yo face
I'm not a disgrace so I gotta see how you taste
And I move at a puma's pace

I wanna make you my squeeze cause these other chicks you supersede
I call her waitress and homie, I call him server

Cause she's bliss, I'm tryin' to get in yo knicks
I want you so my order you can 86

And don't be tippin' her below 20 percent
She need plenty for rent, leave her with pennies, then see her vent
To get money's her purpose, you don't tip, go get burgers
Believe her's is for TIPS meaning Tuition Ensuring Prompt Service
I'm nervous cause I'm gawkin mom's curvage
I'm beyond flirtish, us hookin up we both concert it
Where you get that smell from? She would never tell one
But she told me this, she say me she liked me cause I'm well done
Now your girl lookin' real, real stanky, ain't she?
Cause she know you lookin' at the waitress thinkin' hanky-panky
Her attitude is wonderful, even got the strength to thank me
Even though she a single parent breakin' her back but ain't so cranky
I had to make her my girl, now she goin' eat with me

Stop, everybody what's that sound?

I threw her in and let the beat bump

2K11, ridin' solo
In the Benz on twins hella low pro
Slangin' CDs out the trunk for mo' dough
My mojo said, ""a thick bitch"" so I go slow
I pull it over tryin' to get up on her bumper
Wantin' to crunch her so I said, ""baby my new CD is a slumper""
It'll make the trunk thunder, girl your rump give me lumber
Up under the sheets I can put you in a real deep slumber
But she said fuck Tecca Nina didn't feel her
Did everything within' my power not to kill her
Disrespectful bitch I really wish that I can grill her
Light on my head that said put her in the trunk man you can steal her
I put the hater bitch in a head lock, she flippin' out

Wait a minute I think this bitch is trying to kick a hole through my speakers
Get my gun then I open the trunk and said

Get out the god damn trunk, get on the ground! Take off your god damn belt!
Put it 'round your anckles, I'mma tie up your wrist myself!
I just wanted to drink and show you what the dong'll do!
BITCH! The hell wrong with you?

Eyy, the hot sex was not slam dunked
Rolled for hours then I stopped right off Van Brunt
When a bitch talkin' crazy like a lost man's chump
Short say ""I throw a bitch in the god damn trunk!""

Hours turned to days, days turned to weeks
Had to drill holes in the trunk so she can drink and eat
Whatever I stuffed through the holes hot dogs and ho-hoes

I gotta ditch this bitch with the quickness

Yet another one of Crystal's weekend excursions

It's been fun momma, fed her my catalog like Adderall
Fucked up in the trunk with rump is how I had her y'all
In a ditch, walked back to the trunk, wicked is how I sounded
Whispered, ""Bet that you love Tech N9ne now, bitch""

In a ditch near shelter five
Uh-it appears the car is still running-uhm

And your soul is my rogaine, I have a thirst to know your brain
When you enter my domain gotta take this number for your name
But you don't have to drink cyanide, I'm gonna be right by your side
If we gotta take that riot ride on the enemy and defy your side
Fight for the place we're building

That's what you wear on my Earth

To envy material or admire, my way will extract any type of divider
I'm offering this wider Understanding of life and tiredly
Blissfully vading friction and fire, cha

To build anything your family choose, but within my rules
All white shoes with red strings for all my crews
That lets me know you Tech's people listening inside my pews
All your dreams and aspirations, this is the affirmation
That you can reach 'em and my world is not a disaster waiting
The ruses and lacerations no chooses of aggravation
I'm just try'na rehab a nation from exasperation
It's not an exaggeration, I'm something more than your blood and gore
On a level higher than devils or that of Satan

[Chorus: x2] 

When I did ""Anghellic"" I was good and bad, straight confused
Then an angel turned to Devil Boy when the Reparation blew
Them demons had ""Absolute Power"" when I drug abused
So the angels searched through the ""Vintage Tech""
What they found was the love was through
Then an accident would happen that made life necessary
So now receiving God, the angel was ""Everready""
But the Melancholy strikes, the eleven angels mommy's life
So the Misery sat in the angels now becoming ice
As mom got ill and iller, when it hurts her he can feel her
To the strain of the pain made of bane
There's no more angels straight up KILLER!
My apologies, it's not very God of me
To go crazy and try to teach the whole world ""Sickology""
I was then split in two, back to the beginning view
Angel demon cause the killer showed me death was overdue
But I gotta live for my kids, all the evil stuff I did
Taught me to teach you, you can love then no matter how much sluts you did
Or dug, you met my demon back when I had that grudge
But I gotta let you know most of my spirit comes from up above
I'm mostly angel, and you know sometimes we fall

I'm just a fucked up individual
I love lust and crushin' you for a interval
Plus bust the gush off in a centerfold
Eating a meaty muff like it's a dinner roll
You should have kept away like I told you
How can you press to stay when I'm rover?
I think it's safe to say that my fate's to lay and I'mma waste when I'm older
So just step and give me the cold shoulder
Cause I'm a mess, the Nina's the most vulgar
And I'm a threat, you'll never get no closer
My kiss is killing you, wake up and it's over

[Chorus: x2]
Why can't you see me for the animal I am? (I warned you!)
Expose my beast inside? Yes, dear, you are willing to
You took my invitation and they all told you never to take me in
Why can't you wake up and see that I am killing you?

I never knew why I had to be so cold
Inside of me so froze, it's gotta be no soul
Because when the lady want me in oath mode
I put on my ghost clothes and get on a close road
I'm tryin' to tell you that I'm sick in the insephalon
I thought I could do it, but I guessin' we can never bond
As long as I'm chasin' the gold like a leprachaun
My heart'll be covered in cold ice intephalon
I'm sick with it, I'm brick with it, N9ne twisted it
Ten times outta ten, if you lookin' for what it stems
I can guarentee that you gonna find a bitch did it
But I'm takin' it back, I won't blame it on you
Cause I be the one that be gamin' on you
Famous and heinous the painin' you do
Cause I'm blatently playing and laying the crew
I ain't proud of what I turned into
All my fire keeps burning through, burning you
Up in the inside, I'm knowin' the heat is concerning you
I don't know what's gonna become of me
All I can say is don't anyone love me
Because I'm a monster, I'm sick and I want ya
But you better back up and when I come shove me
But then again I really, really need you
I want up inside of you, wanna bleed you
Get the last drop and then I'mma leave you
Every last one of you I'mma speed through
Covering every lady wanna see you
Open up wide, I wanna feed you
Into the pit of evilness, I'mma lead you
(I'm an animal, take what I like then release you!)

You are so evil to me, you are the goddamned devil!",Killing You,2009
Tech N9ne,"How could I be so down at a time like this, when I'm high like this?
On the billboard charts, many major tours overseas, when I fly like this?
I've been thinkin' about the people that need me
They needy and all of the pain that I might miss
Sooner or later it seeks me, reach me
Then bleed me deep in the rain inside my pit
I'm goin' down now, because my mom frowns
In a research psychiatric center without her son around
And I'm deep off in this hole, when I'm out here rockin' shows (They say)
I should be hyped cause my life is so rock 'n roll!
But I feel like The Grinch mixed with Ebenezer Scrooge
Let the fever ooze, up out of me, clouded me, never eager to, let up
When I'm in an interview, they probably thinkin' they gonna hinder dude
'Cause he be lookin' like he might offend the rule
Never intricate to remember blues
Because is always right here, with the Hennessy and light beer
Let it enter me and fight fear, yeah
I know I quit, but I started back, the homie caught a gat
And my bodyguard Nicholas just had a heart attack

I'm sinkin' again, I'm drinkin' again
Drownin' and wildin', you're breathin' again
It's easy to sin when you're bleedin' within
Needin' the grin, cheese and recede in the spend

That's how I feel in the morning
(Lower than low, lower than low)
That's how I sound when you're callin'

I'm high, but feel like I'm fallin'
I'm sorry, but I'm feelin' lower than low!

My smile is forced, my style is warped
Morale is corpse, now that my really good pal is torched
I'm just gone with the wind, I'm home with the gin, to the dome when I spin
I'm a zone cause the phone must be roamin’ again
Another tone, I'm alone now, don't want me to spin
Time with I’m just mind this, might find Miss Nine missed
I find my mind in this line dish, dine quick, not even a second for mindless
In the middle of a time when the music's flyin' I've depleted my kindness!
Low like the grasses, low like poor folks on grass shit
I'm so below the casket, ragged pulse of the maggots
Why do I feel this illness?
I'm lookin' for somethin' to come and kill this a little bit
I got my head in the hills cause the real shit is
Momma is sufferin', takin' pills with the stillness
And I feel it, I can't shake it, in any case my space is the basement
I can't erase my embrace of encasement
I'm chasin' hatred, my taste's not complacin'
So as I go to the flo', the industry finally opened the do'

I wanna be with a woman and just This one, but the taste of blood is still on my tongue.
If I could just eat food instead of her D boobs, I want this one alive when the morning comes...

I just want to be a normal boy,
Just wanna be a normal boy.
If I only could just keep the women off my tongue, then she can be my number one lady.
I just want to be a normal boy,

If I only could just keep the women off my tongue, then she can be my number one lady.

Oh please, oh please, oh please
Just give me just one more clit,
One more tit,
One more bitch.
What does I gotta do to get me fixed?
Cause I gotta have this one in my mix.
She's so beautiful I would slit
Both my wrists
If she split
When she finds out that I'm so sick.
I eat women.
I really eat women.
They're really delicious.
I gotta be knowin' so I can make her the Mrs.
I gotta date with her so I can tell her my wishes,
Even though I'm a beast but she don't know that I'm vicious.
So I meet her at her place and she's so sweet.
Made me dinner but really want her meat
From her cheek,
Maybe her feet.
I'm trying to be discrete,
But I really want to eat
Her out completely.
Teach me,
To keep it away from her,
The eating and tape on her,
The chewing away fingers.
Once she feeds me I'm lovin me tasting her.
Can I just have a normal night?
I just want to be the man to live normal life
Normal wife
Keep her in the formal white,
But the psycho creature with the horn will bite.
It's almost sun up now.
I'm getting done up, wow.
Fellatio.
But I found out she was insatiable.
She wanted me to do her too,
Don't want to see me through her view,

Started doin' my deed,
But then I accidentally chew her out.",Pinocchiho,2009

I reflected on what I did before I ran into 'em
I used to be a fat jerk now I flirt cause the scent of a woman
Now I don't act like, walk like, the nigga that you used to know
Now I sing and rap about the strange life, it's beautiful
Tell it to 'em like a Genu-is, spit it out like I thought you knew
Bubblin', hope you hear me Thizz, prayin' to God I make it through

He can go really fast, slow it down and stop that shit

You tried crimes against me cause you couldn't follow the guidelines.

She been through trauma, more drama, the dawn is gone, it's more tinted
On this side it gets out of it, how does a prophet who loved God
As his father slip and then get the bottomless side of it?
How come an angel gotta be sick in the pancreas like she an atheist?
Maybe it's the faith that is making this lady
And crazy has made me this skeptic, next threat is lupus on top of epileptic
Never rested, psychiatrist forever tested, reverend blessed it
Brethren, Heaven, Tech is beggin' for effin' X-Mas
Hopin' momma ain't left an exit
It better get better quick, how you let her get sick with bread invested?
In the church every Sunday, I've been searchin' for one way
Or another, you're gonna have to curse me or burst me with a sunray
To let me know that you're coming or en route
I'm 'bout 99, but I need 100% proof!

Show me a God, ""Ahh!""
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade!
Show me a God, ""Ahh!""
And if it is, why ain't he doin' his job?!
Show me a God, ""Ahh!""
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad!
Show me a God, please!
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees!

Where is the passion of Christ? What happened to passin' his life
For the masses? Bad it ain't happenin' twice
Cause my mother's stacked in a lab and it's stagnant at nights
I need your help, and I'm not askin' it nice
All in life it's been paramedics
All my life comin' up all I heard ""Is there a medic?""
A youngin', all I could do is stare at it
Seizure after seizure, if I was you
Wouldn't never let it be heredit-tary
If Aar' get it, I swear that it's scary
Sittin' in a insane asylum
God or God's ghost, man I aim to find 'em
To take away all of this angel's pain inside, come rain
If Momma go, how come I can't deny them?
And she only 54 in a ward, watchin' her war
And it's more blood and gore, and she tore cause people are so deceivin'
And I'm on the floor, cause with nor Lord this war absorbs more poor
Havin' all the soldiers screamin'

Think of how all the victims of Katrina feelin'
They need a ceilin', they say that Mother Nature, she the villain
I plead a million, the bible, I read a billion, still I'm free to see the real
And my feet are grillin', cause hellish heat is buildin' up
Think my momma ain't ill enough? It's killin' us
I will erupt if they're pillin' her false, still ain't no healin' her
I been searchin' for answers, but I find nothin' but Mansa
That puts a damper on the current problem at hand, bruh
Or whatever it is, I will never forgive
Anybody who take Maudie better get her to live
She's so sick that it don't matter how much cheddar I give
To the thing or the lady, here's a letter to his
Majesty, why ain't you stoppin' these tragedies?
My mother's glad to be with you, but her life's been a raggedy one
What's gonna be done? In two thousand and twelve when hell's gonna be
When the Earth aligns with the sun?

Y'all ain't shit on stage

I hit the stage
Grab the mic and blow 'em all away (I blow 'em all away)

The gig is over, the gig is over (when a play)
The kid is older and getting colder (many fly by)
But his will hold ya, so listen closer to (a-a)-r-o-n

Because Aaron is scaring these glitz spitting pricks in the game
Hit with this gift, everybody get a whiff of this script and it's pain
Gotta talk about the people with a attitude
Hiss me and slipped in my lane
I've been wrecking crowds for a long second now
Got 'em guessing how tech is blessed
And yes, the best in-town rep
On the real, I keep it trill
And when I spit, I ain't spilling about my million
It's the feeling that you get with this underground headliner
Mainstream ignored a bro
And they be petty, so jealousy is sure to show
But they rich and got more to blow
And everything's affordable
But they gotta go before me
Because their stage show is horrible

You know I love your mama

I just wanted to have a bite with her, or something
Didn't go get up on that show to fight with her, or nothing
It was Keyshia Cole, Eric Benã, Gorilla Zoe, Tech N9ne and T.I.
But Keyshia was acting bia-bia
Why she acting like a (what?), like a (what?)
She ain't know I grab the mic and light it (up), light it (up)
She say, ""she don't know me""
But I'm the number one independent in the country
Man, she the only one acting funky
And the people at the summer jam, they want me
She say, ""she ain't goin on before somebody that's local""
And she went postal and loco
Saying, ""her not closing, is a no-go""
Down talked me real low though
About how she got more doe and just did a tv promo
No show better than the mo. bro with the s & m logo
Damn baby, much success is sitting in your favor
Slam the n9na tech before considering the data
Fans waited, so we went, so she'd get it for later
But frankie said, ""excuse my daughter, she's a bit of a hater""

I understand senor already
But in this case, on this show, I'm a top priority
In Lawrence, your minority and I'm the majority
Check it, I was young and broke
But I'd fetch it, if it was freshest
Shelf the store for the Eric B. and Rakim record
Promoters called us and said,
""We got this show and want you to close us""
Ghostface and brother Ali rocking with a band in 'sota
We couldn't wait to see Rakim rock
But he never ever showed up
He swole up cause he didn't wanna go up before us
Man, what's wrong with these people?
Think that the world gotta kiss their asses
Five hundred capacity but you wanna get two hundred passes
Thought it was about gouda
Forty water told me,
""N9na, get ya cabbage, stay savage and ravage the average""
Y'all better hope radio and video
Keep me from slithering, into they circle
I'll change it, that's why they shivering

Yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack

I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
Me wanna get dollars
Don't wanna holler but you makin' me
I'm a little dysfunctional

And I'm that way cause back in

Wanna pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be, cause he

But he don't know I'm roguish
Surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded
Will explode if you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo

The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose, then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but can’t get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push to play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

Don't make me mad

I ain't no killer but don't push me
Goody-goody choir boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoody
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me
Tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses, probably be fine
But if you get too close you'll find out that I

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
You could fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad

Your first lesson given to you by (Mr. Smith!)
KC MO stand up, young niggas represent

Ey, ask me what I wanna be when I grow up, I ain't just gonna blow up
I'm a star I got astronomers tryin' to get a close up
Telescopes and cameras, rappers wanna use glamors
But I'm gleamin' from the planets, homie, mine is called Kansas City
The cloud in my pocket's gotta rain on 'em
Such a star I saw Heaven's walls and wrote my name on 'em
So comfortable at the top I hopped on a plane and claimed Everest
You might as well say the boy is Himalayan
I rent my rooms on the moon, Mr. Smith is comin' soon
The angels feedin' me cereal with a silver spoon
My hair line is Craig Smith Airlines
A ride from Kansas City to LA is as long as a fan line
I'm high as '08 gas prices, my votes are
Twice as high as Obama's and I ain't gotta ask nice
I'm high as Tech's tour bus, the light skinned one
So if you're lookin' for me dog look up and try to find the sun

[Chorus: x2]
I'm in the air
High in the air

KC, Nesto!

Yeah, don't mean to brag but I froze my piece
And I'm gettin' higher then a nose bleed seat
Don't bring her to my session, if your ho sees me
She'll drop dead in the studio like ODB
Yeah, it's the owner and I'm very cool
Plus this weed keep me higher than an air balloon
Copy cat, like what I'm wearing dude?
I'm so fly, I walk around with a parachute
And even rappers lie too
But I'm the only human with an astronaut suit
See yo entire verse? Say that your iron squirt
When you only shootin' in the air like fireworks (Pussy)
If suckers still on that hatin' shit
I'll stuff 'em in a bag like potato chips
I'll bend they ass up like a paper clip
Tech, sign me and see how quick your paper flip

[Chorus: x2]

I ain't gotta introduce myself, y'all know what it is

Why call me underground when I rock the stars?
And even they can't see me with a pair of binoculars
My hip-hoppin' gave a good side swipe to Mars
One-Third an extinction hit, which left the limelight Ajar
You want your scripts to fly, not in my solar system
Cause I'll dismiss 'em like they wished to die
Mack mother-nature and I ripped her, why?
Civilian ladies love me, so bro, excuse her while she kiss the sky
Call me master more exalted than a priest, a pastor
Blasphemy have me blast fags fast with Magma
In the air like Dancer and Dasher
High in the sky, above all mountains off in Alaska
Higher than a million heroin hits if it'll last ya
Super-Celestial when everyone's stuck off in the pasture
The wack, I will cast ya down, below those who get caught up in my Rapture
Don't be callin' me ""dog"" cause I want you to say it backwards

[Chorus: x4]

Your first lesson for today man
That was it, Sickology 101
Y'all know what I mean

In the air, motherfucker
Sound like a bird flying around
Yeah, Wyshmaster on the track

Tech N9ne,"[Chorus]
Let me in the door
You keep sayin' you hear me knockin'
What you standin' there for?
Who I gotta kill or sleep with?
Cause I'm the worlds best secret
Let me in the door
You keep sayin' you hear me knockin'
What you standin' there for?
Cause I'm the one that do that music you feel
But you still review this
Let me in the door

Right now before my goons have to tear it town
We don't wait in line and we don't stand around
We at Club Zen and drinkin', actin' brand new
Actin' like he never seen my face and I ain't got loot
They know I'm Cash Image and I'm with Tech N9ne
And before the club close, The owner gon' respect mine
Spend a lot of money and that's the bottom line
Ten cars on chrome, Plus the neck shine
Baggy jeans on and J's with a lot of bucks
And you ain't gotta know me
You could tell my dollars' up
Poppin' collars in the club, turnin' bottles up
And all the models in the club wanna follow us
It's Mr. Chevy Man, You hear my song playin'
And every time we in the club
We be spending grand's
First deny Tech then deny me
And I was number one on 103 for forty weeks

[Chorus]

You say you hear me knockin'
So why you don't wanna let me in?
But I ain't buggin', So tell the cops to come and get me then
Complain about my shoes, ain't really talkin' 'bout shit
Dude, I spent like three hundred and fifty on this outfit
NV ain't gon' let me in, zen actin' funny with me
What it's gon' cost me, homie?
I brought a little money with me
I don't wear tight shirts, my pants kinda baggy
KC hat tilted, so now they wanna red flag me
I'm by the bar every time, point blank, Period
The door man hatin', takin' his job too serious
Me, Cash Image, Tech and Kaliko about big business
So what I'm talkin to a bouncer for?
The woman see me, Scream my name like announcers, bro
They actin' brand new this week
So I'm about to go to the block and bubble and get plenty cake
I just wanted woman and I don't like this club anyway
So fuck y'all!

[Chorus]

I get money from music, Kinda like to spend-spend
When I hit the town, I know they gonna let me ends in
But these other clubs be trippin' like I begin sin
You hear me knockin'? (Oh yeah)
Well let me in then
Cause NV ain't so friendly
They got a gay assembly of femmes
Who think the blacks be packin' Semi's
(That's why they don't sell no Henny)
Stink butts who think bucks
But they don't know my bank account is like a Brinks truck
Could buy it any day
Two poin one on a new building and lease 'em and the N9ne has plenty say
The rhyme, it give me pay
So I resign cause NV gay
And plus NV stands for no vagina's anyway
That place, Me and Lil' Weezy-Wee get no love
That's why when I brought Chingy in there
He peed in your club, not in the toilet either
You don't enjoy the beaver
You'd rather plot on how to get below your boy, The Peter
America's Club and Fase 2, I erase you
My pants are too baggy even though I'm clean and I'm paid too
Orlando South's racist, they treated me cold
And Lucky Strike and Power & Light won't let the N9ne in to bowl
Whoa, guess my Dickies the wrong clothes
Play my music but won't let me and my homies through the doors
Over a million records sold, Lot's of money to fold
They should let me in any club in KC, MO!
And I'm the biggest tipper, bartenders know me well
And waitress's love me, so club owners go to hell!
You got that blow to sell but you want this bro to fail
But it really ain't me 'cause it is your destiny to go to jail
And when you're though servin
You might see work on Club N9ne
When you walk up, you might be hurt
You might skeet-skirt cause you ain't gettin' in
If you ain't got KC hat and a white t-shirt, aye!

Tech N9ne,"[Tech N9ne]
I used to press my Dickies with Stay Flo
Sold pieces for my reli, chasing peso
Now they want me with nothing cause I let my pay show
So I hop inside of my Mercedes and let the bass go
On you hating ass niggas
I deserve everything I get, A creating cash getter
I ain't putting the 2 on the 10
I'm making vast figures
You fags bitter, mad
Wanna be faking class with us
How they thinking they gonna come and conquer us?
Little Mini Cooper hating on a monster truck
Ponder such, I'll have you up in yonder, stuck
Not a nare nutta brother stutter that conjure a,
Nothing, nothing, The Ruger's penetration
Inside of ya head is what's sounding like it's bassing
Boom, Bing, Bang
All you haters in the game, Strange lane taking aim
Ain't a damn thing sane, I get it in
Want some drama? Well I can fit it in
We can make it so you're no longer a citizen
Suction from beneath you
We just a little dust'n
All because I'm bringing the bucks in

They wanna leave me with nothing (Huh uh)
But they ain't talking about nothing (Huh uh)
So I ain't tripping on nothing (Huh uh)
They come to get me, I'm busting (Uh huh)

[Big Scoob]
On the block it was hot to not to run from the cops
I used to cop and used to chop
And dump my rocks at Ms. Scott's
And on the late night at Ms. White's
I'm fucking with Will, We used to play fight
Then one night, We came up with Vill
Young thugs dump drugs
Nigga hungry for meals
Young thugs jumped blood
Nigga itching for kills
Shit was real in the field, man
This shit was too real
Lost my homies to this shit, man
This shit is for real
But nigga, Nowadays the streets
They go hard on the hustler
All these pussy niggas lacking
So us real niggaz suffer
Not plentiful for me no more
It's hoes in the game
Since I smell when paper folding, man
I rolling with Strange
Pour some whiskey, Party with me
Tell the Feds if they miss me
They ain't coming for me now
Then nigga, Bet they don't get me
So all you motherfucking sucker niggas wishing me gone
Big homie, Strange Music
Resurrection, I'm home

[Messy Marv]
All I do is sell dope and nigga talk bricks
Talk with bananas and talk clips
Ride around and smoke kush with the yurner on me
Drink them champagne bottles with the flower on 'em
All that talking loud will get a nigga a hit
You see them cherry red chucks?
Yeah, I'm with the shit
Anyway I bounce out, man
I hit 'em up and I'll lock up with you
We could get 'em up
I still wear a gold grill, 10 across the bottom
They call me 19-5 cause a nigga got 'em
Click-Clack, nigga
Yanka get yanked on
There's been a lot of hating, nigga
Since I came home
Anything a nigga do, homie
It's Federal and come with football numbers in the level 4
They wanna bee a nigga dead, man
But nothing, Tech fuck them motherfuckers 
They could keep hating

Tech N9ne,"[Intro - Chopped and Screwed Voice - talking]
Hey, now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up!
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit - get the fuck out!
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit - get the fuck out!
For those who love raw shit - welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is - Tech N9ne!

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
This is style I use pitch, to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick, mellow tone is what you spit
Switchin the pattern, bust out that quick midwest chatter
Some people hate but it ain't matterin, but the people gather, it's flatterin
Switchin the pitch, mixin, there's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin full clips on a mission for bliss when I be rippin this shit
Make it excitin, got to be invitin when you're writin your piece
Never be dick ridin, if you're goin to be bitin, you're ignitin the beast
This is melodic, melodies, if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales, you singin off-key is garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction, don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin motherfuckers in music, that's how we do it!

[Chorus]
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
Such an oddity with it, this is Sickology
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)

From our west coast instructor - Crooked I (Crooked I ...)

[Verse 2 - Crooked I]
My killer Daytons can keep me crushin the competition
Comin correct when creatin the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier, got a crooked copper missin
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty - if I'm thirst-ay!
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm puttin swag in my style (in my style)
It's a emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, this song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire

[Chorus]

From our east coast instructor - Chino XL

[Verse 3 - Chino XL]
Everybody start lockin their windows and doors, Chino might get in
It's like light-ning, how I'm strikin a triflin rifleman
Bullets flyin up and I'm numbin the bum, like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine, he could get rich from the recycling! (yeah!)
Chino be curdlin blood, don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction, like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me yo
I'd rather hear Hannah Montana, than half of you rappers on the radio!
Startin drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
With a sick delivery, like I drive a coroner van (damn)
I'm demented, spittin writtens as sick as I can
Grenade grippin, fittin to detonate Disneyland
I am teachin Sickology, try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

[Chorus]

Yes I got to be vicious, this is Sickology

[Outro - Chopped and Screwed Voice - talking]
For those who don't know what the fuck's goin on
This is Sickology 101, you punk motherfuckers!
Hahaha, let's kill these niggaz

I'm like a walking drug

Want sex from a nigga like me
I can feel her nightly
Even make her fall off in love
Get away lost off in hugs
Stalkin blood for an awesome plug
This is addictive
Vicious and wicked slick talkin stud
I take good gals
Recruit um, pollute um
Put X in they wood valve
To shoot um
They chewed um up and true enough
They would be poppin, droppin, pursuin us
Plus screwin the crew an such
A ruined slut livin through a nut
That was then but now I see um
They be on the same shit
Brainless
Itchin to get that quick trip wanna be painless
I don't fuck wit it no more that I can arrange it
I was like Dracula attackin her when I give her game
Hella vein language
It was they choice to trip
I kept her moist and slick
Now she's an annoying chick
I started avoiding Ms.
Give her them toys and split
I polluted so many women with bad habits and drugs
I guess I'm poisonous

Then you wanna say you love me on Monday
You buggin,
Thinking everybody gotta bow down because your off in your lovin'
If your on your telephone
And then she lose it when you use it
If sleep, don't leave it on, nigga, for true she will go though with it
She call a bitch back from your phone and chew the chick a new uterus
Even if that situation not lewd the bitch is ludicrous
Bad when you gotta better bitch around
Sad cause you never wanna kiss her now
Never would got up in the women
If I knew about menace
And now never wanna take her down
If she take her seroquel, and selects
The bitch would probably stop and then try to catch yea
Slipin with a beauty itchin to get chya
You betta hope you neva leavin the stretcha
If you with a psycho
Don't go thought with it
Be throught with it
Right in the midst of happiness
Her mood will switch and ruin it.
You thinking you know women and your just so intuitive
Bet that a nigga,

At the end of this
You will have to shoot a bitch

Turn around flip and then get you into deep shitted
Pussy was imbedded and get it your indebted
You could make a penny or money the man said it
You can run a bitch by adjusting the antennas
But if she demand it your betta forget it

Even I know this sly hoe like rivals

Either that and your turn your back
And the bitch attack with a blade up in your spinal
Should have listen to phone call, just stop with them harassing threats

Tech N9ne,"[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Hahahaha, in the world of BET
I'm just too better than rock and roll huh
In the world of MTV
My name is too gangsta huh, hahaha
Man, Stragne Music we got this baby
This year we got this one baby
Red hair, red everything
It's Tech N9ne baby like it or not

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Never been a harder rhymer in my region globaly that's holdin' me I'm totaly hard and bossed up
Why you think the majority of the rap musical authority sword me and balled and crossed 'em
Cause they don't wanna let the crazy kid in then
Spit his hiems speakin' a grim religion
Of rhyme, forbiddin my hisems are hidden
My mind, to written then spittin' the kid in
The N9ne, is playin' you, slayin' you, sprayin' you, perminitly delayin' you, swayin' through
It's the gay in you that's hatin' who somethin' that hella beyond that does
(I love Kanye, his shit is bombay, but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my retina
That I won't be lettin' ya
Threatinas better respect Tech the messengas
Too dope on this to be
History listen this is a mystery
While they spittin' and dissin' me

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Krizz Kalico]
This is me (this is me)
I'm a king, I'm a klown, I'm a G (I'm a G)
I believe what I want
Got you singin' my song
But your seein' me wrong
So what's a matter with me?
This is the belief (the belief)
The religion has arisin' from the deep (from the deep)
Darkest prison if you listen you will see (you will see)
If colision your decision you will reep what you so forget what you know this is me

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
This is Tech bra
For years I've been the next to collect a plethra of checks lets get extra
Is what I set ta
Travis let's go select the baddest rappers infect the planet leave 'em in exta
See I'm a vet the powers don't really wanna let the best
Come and wreck the sets and test your sector
Instead of rawness like Inspecta Deckta
Eldest rather set they specs on Mason Betha
Slept on my records
If you knew my musics hanibal lecta
What the hell you callin' for Masta Flex for?
Don't pester me I won't sweet you be on a quest to
Investagate your techma respect the
Shockra tease in hop to these
Hot degress me and Mr. O ahpotraphe
Never listen to these popasees cause they suck!
(I love 50 Cent he gritty went he vent but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my demeanor
The Tecca Nina will blast arenas
The grass is greana
Made it ma to the top of the world
Kiss me, miss me (This Is Me)
Can't you see?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
The industry treat me like a ride on the short bus
That's why I'm tellin' they youngstas when your retourt cuss
And make a fort fuss
Cause you went out on Sam Goody on F.Y.E. with they money and you support us
Strangas, Shadys, Psychopaths and Juggalos
Loseas, Shootas, College women and gutta hoes
Rock it from prescios doe
Drops it just lets it flow
Cop it don't knock it you block us stop at the record store
This is Aaron Yates thizlely in rain
This is for little Donnie this is for all ?? pain
This is, for the sickness of Marty Sue
This is for all the ?? Lou
This is for Ike and Ricky
?? Rhonda, Barbra, and Marla really
This is for be'zle and I know that rest of my family is with me
This is my friends, this is the end, this is a G
This is life, this is worng, this right, this is me

Now the people got the light on me I'm about to fight on the mic and you knowin' ain't nobody fuckin' with me,
Automatically haters be mad at me when I be rippin' it niggas get to trippin' 'cause I'm livin' it up,
Got the industry in the palm of my hand and I promise I can?t offend a fan when I say I'm not givin a fuck. when I sing I'm not givin a fuck,
I'm 'bout the music and doin' it when the people they ruin it when the listen it be drivin' me crazy,
I'm different people they call me evil and devil Imma let 'em see the level of animal it made me,
'cause I don't give a fuck I just bust your crew up,

Tech N9ne,"Yo, what's up wAnnotatehere you at? (Leaving the club)
Meet me at the crib baby (Alright)
How many you got with you baby? (Three)

What's up, where you at baby? (Leaving the spot)
Meet me at the crib baby (Okay)
How many you got with you? (Four)
Alright we gon' party, let's go! (Let's do it)

After the club we usually go straight to Chubby's
That's where the 3 in the morning grub be
And even though Icons is lovely
Tonight the pad is gonna be a must see
'Cause hussies are coming to give up they pussies, trust me
They comin' to muff me, plus three:
Makzilla, Irv and Big Nick we's 'bout to bust V
Open until we lust free, she sucked D
Gushed me, then roughly rode this ding-a-ling like a Huffy
Luck-ily, another 36 cup D abruptly, came into the room to fuck me
She said, ""Tecca Nina touch me, your dick is thick and husky
It must be like a ride at Cedar Point in Sandusky""
Well, what do you know, baby girl rushed me
The TNA was so silky and fluffy, unjustly I crushed, B!
And not one of these broads is ugly, 'til the next morning
When they crawl in they hubby Snuggie, looking rough as rugby

[Chorus]
Yeah, we hit the spot if we choose her
Then she dipping out
To take her to my house (It's the after party)
We can all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

You can take the under-route
Tell your man you at your mama house
No but really (It's the after party)
And we all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

Full of that liquor, ready to stick all this dick up in a-uh
Bitch out at Nina's, I never seen but I'm fixing to fuck
Already popping I'm running late, but just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at Wal-Mart and bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter, my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy's about to get cooked, rather chicken filleted
Found me a victim, we made our way through the kitchen escape
Into the garage and the lip massages was about to began
Lethargically sucking, hardly fucking with Pinky to me
So I told the slut to hike up her butt and let Kutt intervene
All in her guts in between, the Benz and the bucket and screamed
""Nigga you're fucking my whole lining up with my husband to be
Drowning too much and if he-"" shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout on her butt with relief
Just another episode of back to naughty
Tecca Nina I can't thank you enough for the after party

[Chorus]

When freaks come out at night, the freakiest stays out the latest
They hit the after party, they got somebody take care of they baby
So it's cool, no rules, no security guards
Let your hair down, yeah, now do what you want
Man fire up the weed, whenever you please, best believe
That you got the green light, the special guest is me
And we've, been drinking and smoking all night
It's time to find a ho to be stroking my pipe
A bitch quickly grabbed my dick and asked why it was so soft
I said that it wouldn't go off, she gave it a quick blow off
And she did and me dick start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise and
Her thighs was moist, it was my choice to go up in it
For a minute put my dick up in it, she said it was splendid
She usually charge niggas, they like to rent it
I told her put it on my bill bitch and send it

Tech N9ne,"If you at the rink put ya skates on
Roll with the nina celebrate and that the day gone
Just because the DJ ain't diggin and pumpin they song

Ain't no rah uh reason ya fronted ya should've just kept it one hunit learn how to make ya face stay stone

She really dont know she about to ditch her man
And give her pants to me cuz this her jam
Damn
Tecca Ninas everywhere keep it necessary to
Steer very clear
If he dare to stare and glare that's very fair
Be drinking, Be merry
Where the ladies with the dairy air?
More black women pooping up at my shows
Like Tyler Perry there
Oh
And they didn't know I won an MTV award?
New York yelling for me like they've seen me before
They know that underground clown come so sick and dark
But they didn't know they'd see the N9ne on 106 & Park

Even though it's a Thursday
Eyes on us when we stepping out on the curb free
Chickens want the business giggling
Acting flirty
Little momma swallowed all of her vodka
She still thirsty
Probably because shes got something that's mixed in her hand
Straight to the sipper
Or maybe
It's because the reason I got my hands on you
Dancing like a stripper
We super cold head to toe
We sharp as a machete
We the hottest show in KCMO
The new Malcom & Eddie yeah
It's me and Big Yates
He know my spits ate
Shit so sick he got me spitting on The Mixed Plate
Like a disgruntled employee who just quick Gates
You read the front of the fitted homie and it's

Ask who the president and they are going to
Say

So every time we hit the clubs like a movie scene
Filling them women with their cups with Kansas City Tea
PHENOM!

That's the noise you make you lady do
Fresh hypemen had me on the turn tables in 82'
Sleeping with women and popping bottles
While he was eating baby food
Murdering raps and spitting facts
Something I was made to do
See I raised a few eyebrows when I started up
Veteran Click gave me worldwide we was hard to touch
Ya'll can start the fuss
And I'm going to close you down
Popping you dick licker
Only when there is hoes around

Killer city will show what that world be like
My world be tight
But my flows be sicker
Behind the counter and cut you
At that Paul's Liquor
I'm a show me nigga

So I gotta get paid off, I'm a baller nay lost
Crosses and your wall lookin' like ragù and hollandaise sauce

It's just pre-mental planning maybe you will understand me
Started as a local, haha

The time it took to do this shit was kinda loco
I know
Put me on the beat then I flow
I'm fuckin' with green because I go
Seems like I speed through obstacles like my life's on nitro
I see the light posts I'm speeding through the night glow

They feel severe slaps from here clear to Iraq
I'll near trap but this here's cracked
And I get them chicks with their boobies lifted and rears fat
What me and Travis doing every year after year stacked
Then we off in the Bahamas where the peers at cheers cat
And we don't fear packs cause we standing near straps
Come to me with that queer crap you'll get your vaneers cracked
Yeah I might be a weird brat
But I get them tears from your dear 
That'll have her speared in the lair when her brazier snaps
Watch who you sneer at
Because if we see a rat he's smeared flat
He's about to feel snakes and hear bats
So whats next is a mere splat
On her face because the P was shear wack, haha

Tech N9ne,"I see you

I see you looking at me
Looking at me, so I ask

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

You're crazy,
I like you, but you're crazy, my tours paid me
So I used that dough to allure ladies to whom bathe me
Never know that my minds for sure shady
Pure Hades, rev x steady they couldn't endure to save me
Why did I let this stripper burn me on the arm with her cigarette
In the same spot ten times in a row
When I felt that burn upon the clitoris?
I'ma get her wet, sorry to get carried away,
I feel stupid 'cause I ain't did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts,
I get vexed but I ain't bit her neck
Open, I try to contain it but that damn dame thang's soakin'
Alter ego say why you let them gang bang folk in
Strange lane hopin' I can maintain copin'
But ain't nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I'm suffering, I'm stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin' hollerin' my god,
Afterwards I like really hots scolding water on my balls

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

Mom? Dad? I'm no longer the boy you're used to seeing
I've changed a lot, plus I've grown to hate every human being
My mood swings have now turned my dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I'm doing things I don't normally do
When illusions seem to be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck, if I was sane I would of put down the mic and say
Fuck it I'll never rise to fame
But with the wicked records I contain,
I could probably jump without your name
No lovey-dovey let's ignite the flame
If you're lucky you survive the pain
Sorry that ain't very marry to say,
Why is this game so scary to play?
Well let me think, 'cause every day
My balls are getting too hairy to shave
Pause a minute,
I'm stressin' the game if I go to hell,
Then heavens to blame
I don't mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think that I'm hella deranged (hey)
When I was seven years old,
I fell on my head and I severed my brain (hey)
If you think I'm lying then
Ask my mama nigga she'll can tell you the same
Should I be ashamed?
No, I'm living my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent outta a shape my nigga let me ask you this

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

I stab you with this mic
And rap this verse I'm rappin' to you
Matter fact I'm rapping through you,
Never say my motherfucking name
Unless you absolutely have to I am not no fucking jacket
With no matching shoes
And you are not no fashion guru
Can't even see you niggas,
Y'all wish I was rappin' to you
Matter of fact act like I'm rappin' to you
If that gives you passion
To use this as an excuse
Then just jump up out of conclusion
That I'm attackin' you dudes
Is just like old fashion voodoo
Y'all ain't even the shit,
No y'all ain't even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my toobos
So I'm slapping you foolish
With wooden paddles you stupid
Baby sitting little bastards like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic
But it's more like schizophrenic
And I can speak can anyone tell me just where my medicine is
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man I swear I'm all up out of my brain like graduate students
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears, come here,
Give me your face, let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look
If I could peel it back with a skillet
Then I'ma fill it crack when I hit it,
Then I'ma spill it back when you heal it
Damn it Bobby boy, what in the hell,
What in the heaven, what in the earth
Where is your mom? What are you cursed?
Where are you from?
Where was your birth? Where were you first?
Why weren't you in church?
Why is there dirt, all on your shirt?
Man I think that you're going berserk

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

Am I a psycho? (psycho)
Am I a psycho? (psycho)
Yeah I'm a psycho (psycho)
I guess I'm a psycho (psycho, psycho, psycho)",Am I a Psycho?,2011
Tech N9ne,"The boogieman

And just when they thought 
That everything was peachy keen
Somewhere deep within the shadows
There were other things to be seen
An untamable beast with an urge to feast
And only alone would he stand, 
the culprit of fear on the 67th tear
There lies, the boogie man.

No introduction needed
N9ne times you must repeat it
Mind trying just to lead it
I'm N9ne, who supposed to be this rough MC
Who's glutton-ny would rhyme grime,
Trust believe it
A legend ever since the projects
Odd tech would get respect when he wreck the set
But never get the props that was god blessed
So this is me, never let the prod rest
The object of rawness inject your steps to darkness
Led the industry to whispering the name
History became a mystery
'cause listeners in the game
Wish to sing the same
Which cerebral glitch will lead to lane
And this will be your pit
For me to split and bleed your brain
They heard the name
But can't put a face to it, 
Oh what a shame
When he rains
And when he stands still, he turn to lanes
From sane to straight wicked, don't tell me you ain't heard the saying
The boogiemans real

[Chorus]
He's underneath your bed
Trapped inside your head
you tried to fight it
But you decided it's just that,
Boogieman
We fear what we can't see
This webs a tangled weave
Laughter inside you,
Tries 'n' blind you,
From that boogieman.
An in that voice you hear
'Eliminate your fears'
What do you do?
Discover the truth
That is The Boogieman
And now you know it's real
And everything you feel
Hits you again, you will stand
Face-to-face with that Boogieman

They don't wanna have to try to do as I do
That's prolly why it ain't been easy for me to slide through
I chew rappers up, on stage and mics they by-Flew,
Out with the ravens, flight to hatin, haven lies you
'cause you don't want change
And you don't want strange,
Rearranging the main lanes to brain games from plain jane
That's when your fames strange
And you can maintain
you think you sang such an insane rain, same thing
And I'm the shadow in the dark
That came for battlin' in the park
And they skidaddled when I barked
That give a rattle to their hearts
'Cause they're afraid they will all fail
Darkness will prevail
The boogieman is not a tall tail

Wat a tough act to follow
you afraid? tell me are ya?
When this came you were nada
Tell your lane sayonara

(The boogieman, the boogieman)

Tech N9ne,"Yeah
Like this (like this) 
I'ma drink this henn, I'ma keep this grin, 
But if you look at nina closely I'm tryina contain this beast within.
I know some of y'all already knowin' that I got a lotta cheese to spend 
But that don't change the fact I go insane I gotta heap of sins please begin.

I saw a glimpse in all of this when I was just yay tall and I pictured y'all and it wall to wall but they all said I was just Delusional but the people startin' callin' us and I'm ballin' tough but the crawlin' rough and I never though of stuff with saw enough.
What the problem is now I got em here tellin' all these kids I'm the K.O.D and they pumpin up the volume and listenin' hard when I give my heart is it Delusional.
When I'm thinkin' I'ma boss in the biz but I'm lost and I fake it that I'm off in the lid but they pay the cost when it is dark at the crib

Some say that if tell them to hate my people are at the gate ready for sealin' your fate that is up for debate cause when I make my music ain't no evil from mister yates callin' me
A cult leader I don't really know but I'ma fosho heater wickedness commin' from mine rove they could blow me but the folks wanna soul see us at the bottom with the devil look around and it be no N9na they say I lead em to evil like I was Jimmy Jones and feedin' the people when I bleed in the steeple the reason they seizin' me ain't no decreasin' my ego my powers for good I think would I shrink if somebody took away how good I ink but that would never happen I'm makin' it with the rappin' but they want me to collapse and when I could I sink

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.
Delusional I'm fightin but I'm losin feel like we offer up confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to read alibi.
Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong, feel like I'm tellin you to do wrong hear me!

She feel like I'm, gonna make them hate because I was around and kick it and make them babys and now that I made it gotta escape them daily and that's crazy cause all I'm doin' is makin' the industry pay me but when I show my face feelin' everything's great did a show then we ate then I'm outta that state she said I'm a good provider but daddy of the year man I'm outta that race how I compensate for the losses they get often dates that's too personal we'll stop the tape

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.
Delusional I'm fightin but I'm losin feel like we offer up confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to read alibi.
Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong, feel like I'm tellin' you to do wrong hear me!

They say I'm seein' things but everybody know I'm bein things we dem kings like it or not we runnin' this gotta lotta hype cause I wanna spit and I come to grip on the fith you gotta know techs never gonna miss I know I might be a little psycie but its nightly and brightly inside of me makin' me a little frightening rippin' it with the right team I bring hella light when resighting when its all said and done I'm sickened and heavened caused this a damned reverend ALL 6'S AND 7'S

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.

Suck me up and then I can become her energy drink (gyah!)

Us through get up at the dawn let tech spew flip it like an omelet
Ever since the calm bet you tech ain't made you yawn yet
All signed checks in my pocket are the color of pawn shrek
The industry never passed the baton guess I grabbed it
If its beyond us even so I get the gauntlet
This music shit was enough to make me vomit
But I kept you all astonished make way for the kc comet

Honestly when I walk in I come off like bomb threats
Cause them don't want tech to go straight non vet
Throw on jets and get all the way to this land that was promised

Knockin' 'em out my chain go side to side just like a pendulum

This is what goes on now that I'm in their light
Now they know that I get my flows on they comin' out in their tights

Don't stare too long and envy 'cause you might get eye-ritis
Now to get me for shows and lyrics it's high prices

What, do you mean?
You're the creator

What I saw was amazin after raisin up and
gazin at the vapors that I'm creatin, nights and days I'm pavin
the way for ragin, Techaholics, makin havens
Next to all this hate and craze and death, we call it a place of consummation
of perfection, fulfillment, the Tech runs the building
Respect one's resilience, from threats guns and illnesses
This place is realness, it feels as if it's lifted
A bit sick and twisted and real wicked, villages
And I'm the main man, that made every effort to gain fans
Through all my pain I obtain grands
Millions just cause of my brain now my lane stands

Stress lifting, mesh kids in sets, with them Tech listenin' vets
Expression is best written, less hid than flesh
Women, sex driven, that's livin', yes been impressed
by the way the Tech is blessin' 'em - it shows
cause the land it steady grows, and I'm the man with fetid flows
But understand he said he knows, that he ran a deadly road
but he woke up with a family, bros, in a land of uncanny souls
And they adore him, even if they can't afford him
Be the rich, and be the poor then, really get to be before him
To get laced, on mistakes, and big brakes
Quick pace, lyrics they pick in this place

He played me some stuff in uh, in L.A., off ""Tha Carter IV""
He has a, he has a record on there with umm

Am I in the Twilight Zone? Cause my mic's on
But I never thought the world would buy my songs
Cause in my land I am the highlight inside my dome
but now it's my height, they try bite, cause my life long
In this hip-hop, everybody's lip drops
When I spit the gift that quickly shifted cause I get props
It's terrific; they recognizin' me on every level if you missed it
If you look you findin' me on the very rebel, this is listed

Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with' the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load

And then I'ma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies 'cause of cannibalism
Breakin' 'em off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible 'cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then ya best pick a better habit
'Cause I'm an anomaly, able to give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challengin' my astronomy
Hoppin' out, I don't stop when the flame stone
Now one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwin' it up in the air, takin' it there

Welcome to Los Angeles, a discovery of palentology
So play me and I'ma be shinin' on them haters

And when I'ma cock it and pop it, and what I'ma drop on my dude
Inevitably, instead I'ma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask ""What in the world is you provin'?
What, when you already the best? And what the hell is he doin'?""
Well, I'ma be choppin' and cuttin' and breakin' and beatin' and shakin'
And fuckin' everything up 'til there ain't no further mistakin'
And bustin' everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shuttin' everything up, 'specially the ones who be hatin'
They lovin' everything until I got 'em stutterin' stupid

P-P-P-Please? Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us?
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest!""
And now I'ma come and kill 'em, get 'em, hit 'em, and finish 'em
And bang 'em in the head and diminish 'em, and then I'll
Hit 'em again at a minimum, repeat comin' to kill 'em
Then he be gotta be drillin' 'em, thinkin' ""They gotta be feelin' 'I'm!""
Spittin' lithium, see the way a nigga be spillin' 'em?
And gettin' 'em stupid to the point where there's no forgivin' 'I'm?
Hopin' you're listenin' and you're payin' attention
And you're witnessin' the way that I be crushin' on the mic
And gettin' in the zone, I be flattenin' and packin' in

All for the dibs, but I'm boss
It's don't matter what the cost
When I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mids
Doin' nothin' but mothers stackin' pussy coffin again

Further, guess what I'ma go do with' this women when we're eatin' Gerber?
Mama said to kill 'em all, and I heard her
Thank you, baby, for what became Lil Wayne
It's good that all the people know when Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shot at my nig was when it changed in my lane
I'm accustomed, fucking lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick
To bust a nut and take a nigga's dame with' no shame
When they be bussin' 'nough, they thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up, you in the game, you bang
You druggin', touchin' everything, you lame?
Sucka, you cannot sustain the rain
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Balla nigga, Strange Music, coupe through swishas
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, soo woo bidness

Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga all those flows are borrowed, it's the phar-oh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cai-ro,
Lookin' at stars so bright in the sky I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those? A whole carload of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender, please remember, don't feed the Simba
Three's a symbol like nobody, he's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body,
She's the only girl that was smart enough
To call me Mr. Benjamin in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon, I pound it harder,
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones?
Well, tonight, then, we gon' do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It's important that you are more than welcome to the Carter IV and

Tech N9ne,"(You know that there are billions of stars in the universe)
But the star had quite a difficult time shining amongst all the other stars
The year was 1994 when the star began his descent
And continued falling.. And falling...
Landing in an unknown place
The star creates followers from underground rap
On the quest to shoot beyond the stars once again
The star begins in.. Strangeland

Ground zero, crowned hero
But ain't nobody ever heard the sound before
I found me so
Competitive, I never get the credit back at it when it was clown and LeJo
Now we pro, the brown people
Was on it for the moment but they frowned at me fo'
Layin' what I sayin' didn't sound negro
Now people 'round me low down when the beat go
Never will I ever stop or quit what I'm doing
I'm getting better, even clever, rockin' it then I ruin every competitor
We at 'em poppin' shit, I be chewin' 'em up ahead of ya, etcetera the
Speed bandits coming for ya, now he's making an industry sandwich
Come enjoy the flow, we're takin' the minasee damage

We've landed! The stars have fallen from the heavens!
The thoughts will reign on this planet!
The arts been painted on the canvas, your helpless!
We've landed! The arms of fans have been branded!
The dawn of 6's and 7's! Is the start of musical madness!
We've landed!

Shootin' for the stars, lootin' for the cause
Who's inducin' puke and hootin' for the bars?
You get stupid groups of loose and juicin'
You for true, but you recruit the youth ignore bizarre niggas
But ain't nobody fuckin' with any of our niggas
And if you trippin' under the Tecca there are millas
You don't wanna fuck with a murderous gorilla
War 'till the lord hit a scar, nigga, what?
Bitch I'm at the bottom and I'm comin' to get at ya
Better get up in ya column
And I'm gonna diminish you, when I spit I really got 'em
Right in front of me timid, and I want a percentage
Cause I fought for everything I got, it was not handed
And nobody fed a nigga nothin' when I was famished
I'm bussin' for life and not for Nathan, but God damnit!
Notice something beautiful just landed

[Chorus]

I've landed six feet under six feet
But every other ordinary people can't sleep
The badness, we had this backin high school classes
You're dealing with three faces of madness
Never been average with the image of a savage
At the very bottom I'm livin' under the maggots
But I'm 'bout to shoot up and really wake up the masses
Gas it and blast and have the upper class rackin' ashes
Upper class rappers, sucker ass packers
A rougher tougher motherfucker spaz backwards
Kcuf Natas, gutter mad slacker
Tecca Nina's what their lads after
Everybody I wanna say, ""What goes up?""
Vertically movin', I know it's 'bout to blow up
Thinkin' when I hit the stars I'mma slow up? Hold up

I'm a predator and you're awesome food
It's better than when I was offin you
From up here there's a pretty damn awesome view
And a moment of silence, we just lost a few
Ah uh, bring that back now

[Chorus]
You already know the outcome
How 'bout turnin up the volume
And watch me kill shit
You already know what I'm talking 'bout
If you don't understand the words that's coming out my mouth
Then watch me kill shit

Twista! They call me Mr. Malevolent
With a style to show that I'm another pistol that's elegant
Kaliko to cut the throat of me no patrollin me
Nickin every syllable that's strong enough to lift up an elephant
I consist that you're as soft as a moccasin
I can send niggas at you and have em take away your oxygen
I could then murder you in another dimension
Of diabolical proportions as I find a portal and lock them in
Eat the key up then re-up I'm gone
See the way that I re-up a G up, I'm on
Now I'mma hang my feet up from reeboks, it's on
Niggas this ain't a game put your wii up, I'm grown
I'm general militia and you be feelin every person
Though everybody can spit it but we still a very
Packin so much artillery we are like a military
And no tellin how many bodies we bout kill and bury
Gimme the block then I'mma ball
Because I be tippin
Spending the money when I'm in the mall like tryna be different
Different kinda clothes
Other kinda shoes
When the hoes see the swag they be askin if they can come and kick it
Shorty what you talkin bout just get your homies and come with it I'm over here Gettin drunk up the limousine
Now I got a drunken fast flow
But it don't matter I can still blow the whole party to smithereens
Splittin' words in the middle like kali-
Ko we Killin em cause you put together a team
As if you were Pat Riley
Cus ain't nobody compara-
Ble to us if you want it then you know what it means
Twista!

Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay A. Yates
You don’t know the handle then you’re a day late
Death and destruction it is they fate
Because when I get up on a track, it'll be like wait
Sick em deliver, get to flipping
You be the victim and I’mma pick em off
Fix em with a quick, and I’mma knock division off of niggas
No living giving or igging on the rigorous
Look at this, will somebody look at this
I be killing em
Put up or shut up, get up be cut up
It's animosity
Foot in ya gut up, bullet for colors
I’m an atrocity, wicked
I went around, arrange one off, I rip it
I’d rather be red and ready then running with the rigits
Don’t be stupid, if you got a minute better run away
You better jump im slumping you cause
Never gonna put the gun away
You better back up off of me or get it
Admit it, I’m killing off everybody and then it
Acquitted
And we knocking, he stopping
Never can beat the cleverness
She joshing, me cocking
Coming to get the head of the Chula
I shoot her because lots a Gouda
That dude'll be foolery, because I socked the ruler
Ay yay yay yay yay yay
Yank em, when he thinking he better then Nina
I gotta spank em, shank em with the thang
For thinking that we'll come & give up the game
We hang the really bane in my sanctum
They don’t really wanna see me
Tecca Nina eating your whole supper like Ziti
When I get to going, I smoke a nigga like a beady
I’m leaving em all dead lips blacker than Miss Sealy

Tech N9ne,"I'm humble because I know what it feels like
To be at the bottom and have nobody
No fans, no nothing, nobody believing in you
Now look at me

I was down on the ground with nobody
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and oddly
They try and come around now I'm somebody

Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer, I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit
That was a get-up-and-hustle-nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get, at stars when it's, not marketed
You're far from it, dark and your partner quit
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get heart in your art a bit
But they doubted me cause I'm nothing like 'em, never knew how to be
Stylistically foul, and he’s proud to be wild and he's
Thinking now is time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found him, it's, ""Wow, peep his salary""
Way back when I was feeling defeated
When inspiration, motivation was needed
At the pace to be great, I've exceeded
All of your expectations, you fakers can eat it!
This my world, this my game
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain
This is my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it I'ma keep it P.I., mane
Why not share the pie? Scared that I
Would get the people liking me and wouldn't dare to buy your shit
Try to told ya before that my flow sick
Milli sold on the road with my whole clique
Everybody listen in to witness, Tech's whirlwind
In the club with MGK, thick sex twirlin'
Fought to the top, never did stop, now we got it, it's ""Fuck the world"" then
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends

(Oh!), for the block I (Go)
For that spot I (Go), to the top I (Go)
Screamin' ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")

Doing whatever we gotta do to survive, head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)

""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")

I remember thinking I would rather die
Than go through what I was going through when I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I’m ready to ride
No tragedy over triumph and I am a Lion I gotta try
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure
Fiending for the industry again, I was living in disgust
Doing odd jobs
Everybody seeing me
Traveling to work, back in forth, on the bus
Yeah, I was fucked up
But I got it together for y’all
Spit venomous lyrics cause I was ready to ball
Started Po Pimpin’ on everybody and certain motherfuckers 
That want to get in my circle I tell 'em naw
Cause I got to get money up in my anatomy
Naturally, and I gotta be gradually happy to holla
At somebody when they speak and they might be on that bullshit
So sometimes it’s, fuck ‘em I don’t even botha
And who knows what’s next for three angels chasing dreams
Hailing from the Mid-West, as we spread our wings
All of us striving to surf over the summit
Creating us a vision that would be stunning
When we come to Earth and your city and do a show
You would get to see everybody from miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in better bring something smelly
We could take it to another level
Wherever you wanna go, everybody put they hands up I’m ready
Come on and get wild let loose
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck
You done been through some shit
But you did it cause you had the heart to throw the middle finger up

From the back streets
To the packed seats
On the block, running from the cops, like athletes
Whoever would've imagined lace up
Could've got me to the finish like track meets
And when everybody’s hot, I’m past heat
And if I don’t need the fuel, don’t gas me
It’s been a long time coming
Since 100 words and running
Mother fucker come catch me
And while these other rappers pen and pad it
I was 13, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted then u know we gotta have it
Don’t nobody ever snitch, get pinched? You forget like magic
Kids carry tools like go-go gadget
Leaving high school to an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of his baby’s mother 
Never’s gonna know his daddy
Tragic

Why’s the government gotta lie to get money?
Why’s the federal reserve gotta take from me?
Why we even fighting for another country?
Have u seen my city mother fucker we hungry!
Representing for the middle of the map 
Even though me and mine are coming from the bottom
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody would've shot him?
Do u really think the Notorious Big would believe these guys?
All these internet thugs that the the media finds
You wanna talk about grind
Look in encyclopedia what name is in it I bet u see mine
Mother fucker this Kells
Skinny boy six foot three
Heart bigger than an SUV
Lord knows I been through hell and back
Ducking jail and crack
And still I came out on t-o-p
This is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody
Because the only thing he ever had on him was his headphones
So he picks a song
And he turns them on
Every morning just to get him through the day
Looking for an escape
In the kick in the bass

I found the nigga that made a top 50 hot MC list
And my Glock committed sodomy and shot him in the ass
Standin' over his body I probably shoulda asked
Why the greatest rappers gotta be somebody from the past
Compared to Slaughterhouse, a lot of niggas trash
Followin' a fad, what would I do if they follow the Slaughter
They prolly swallow this hollow and a mag
Tongue full of dung, it's shit talkin'
Niggas want me dead, fuck it I'm still walkin'
Enemies in the club, fuck it I'm still parkin' the coupe
First put the roof on a milk carton
Walked in, they hand me the mic
Told baby girl it gotta be tonight
My bed or your bed?
Yeah I'm thinking with both heads
You know, great minds think alike

[Chorus]
What you got under that skirt? (let me get it)
Vodka, Henny and that purp (let me get it)
Cribs, cars and net worth (let me get it)
Slaughterhouse gang, Tech N9ne go and get it

Lot of molly, an out of body experience
I'm feeling kind of Gotti and all ya'll into weird events
A party prolly jolly counsel me when I'm on heroine
With the shotty ridin' when I party it's Abu Dhabi
Who can I pick it up, wick it up I'm a rip it up
And I'm gonna get up in my zone now
Fuckin' the women I'm up and I'm winnin' I'm [?] now
Pussy poundin' I'm pushin' polygamy procedures
Packin' and poppin' pretty penis pockets I please her
These I ease, Techa Neez got the bees of an evil deed
But I'mma G, never see us
With a telescope nigga cause it's hella dope
I got so many worshipers with me, I could sell a quotes
I yell the most, I tell the goat
I'm gonna take it even if they hate it and fill the boat
Fellas, you tell us to gel it, we're gonna quell his hope
Embellish a [?]
When I rhyme I'm conniving cause I bring
Live wickedness brightening your high beams
Frightening life like some lye in your Visine
Psyche swiped clean, high as the hygiene
Let me get it
Pussy, weed, a licker yo, let me get it
I don't kick it if you be messy with it
Tecca Nina keep KCMO on the fitted
Any Slaughterhouse gang affiliation I'm fuckin' with it

[Chorus]

Nobody seconding what I be spitting, we misfits
Gonorrhea mixed with diarrhea, that sick shit
You fuckers wack, need them Puffy plaques, them big hits
Them R. Kelly, I'm so rich I piss on a bitch hits
And bitches get the business
In a convertible eatin' big dick
While I'm parked like a picnic
Wrapping they big lips around my stick shift rockin' French tips
Suckin' me hollow after they swallow my kids
I'm askin'

[Chorus]",Let Me Get It,2013
Tech N9ne,"Nigga, I been dope since Raigonomics
Son of a crack fiend holla at me
Robbin niggas for them starter jackets
When James West had all the swagger
We had that Venice to the mall cracking
YT2 extort staff
Rock Porsche, Box Chevy's
With Tech N9ne let them all have it

I been dope, cleaner than soap, with my kinfolk, Big Kutty Cal
Let the sin soak and begin tokin' with a friend, smoke really nutty wild
That indo seepin' slow, them hoes wanna love me now
I been gold, deep within those silly bimbos, hella slutty, wow

Uh, now that’s the N9na I know from back in them days
Nigga, we played questions, we ate X’s,
Played truth or dare when we layed bitches
Wrote about it then made riches, planet rocked and we stayed grittin'

Then sprayed kittens with Glade, spittin', display given, these babes diggin'
Off of that I been boss of rap, I been called the gat and that’s N9ne, nigga
Been all of that since I caught the mack and put ‘iancs and racks in my mind, nigga
Even when I shot them at the window, I was a grim nigga take 'em to the end, no men woke
After gettin’ their chin broke, but when the pen stroke, N9na been dope

Before I started claimin' my set (I been dope, nig)
Even before I hooked up with Tech (I been dope, nig)
Back when y'all was hatin' my crew (I been dope, nig)
Don’t gotta tell me cause I already knew (I been dope, nig)

Even when my first lines came out (I been dope, nig)
Since Lincoln let N9ne raid out (I been dope, nig)
Since massacre and Nnutthowze days (I been dope, nig)
Since Calhoun, A. Yates was made (I been dope, nig)

Ey, let me let these niggas know how far it go back with dopeness man
Yeah, like a bean to a pinto, dope fiend to a rental
Hung like a trench coat like McSpears
With the children before her 5% of it always been post
So I been dope, nigga, purest form of that Montana
Throwback, nigga, put a bitch in check like back when Ike put his hands to Anna

Just eat the cake animate, please, then take a drink of this Bay Breeze
When I create these they really hate me
Face be shaky, cause it's dope shit they see
I been dope and I hope that you listen
Fixed ya like you did soap in the kitchen
I open, I'm rippin' you, hopin' I'm glitching
But ain't no motherfuckin' hope in your dissing

You lookin' ass nigga soft in the middle
‘Ol pussy nigga trying to be me
Wish you could be ass nigga and you niggets
Just ain't cut from my fabric,
'Cause I style on ya with a crooked nigga ripping I be foul on you
Short term niggas I’m a milestone and your style slow down
The Kutty Cal with set the clown on you

Yes, I’m that nigga with the clown persona
Bound to beat a nigga down to a coma
I was on a 56 corner, Then I made it, now i go where I wanna
And I for sho' can gathering more fans
Even if they rep another color, I think 'cause I been dope, man

Since Calhoun, A. Yates was made (I been dope, nig)

Somebody said I wasen’t dope so I dismiss ‘em
They probably listen to faulty shit and I ain’t gonna list 'em
My crew not new to this, been fortune and fame a while
From dancin’ all over the track like Oppa Gangnam Style

To be walkin' on stages, came from the IcyRoc’s basement
Now I feed off of my paper, makin' cream off of you haters
I’m worldwide with this business, screamin' “Fuck y'all,” independent
Did for Kutt dog with this industry, we’re not sorry and shit, Tecca Nina'

Been in rap long, you can take a look, my stats' grown
Cause Strange Music and Tech N9na is this nation’s backbone
I was dope in this song and that song way back home
Not a nare nutta trace of the hatin' cause ain’t a fuckin' piece of wack shown

Yeah, now it’s back on, preview into the sequel
Kansas City’s the pipe, but now I’m the Cavy you needin'
Cop me over the counter, I’m easily your addiction

Tech N9ne,"Another day in the life, no time for play I'm tryin' to cake,
High stakes survival, increasing my fire rate
Eyes dilated, aim my sight fly straight
If I ever want my record to see the light of day
I'mma find a way, weight of the world need a lift
If we carry bags I know we gon' need a tip,
You're free to give my man but I don't need a disk,
With the grip of tracks, it's really nothing for me to skip,
We the creed of a better breed and you never read and
Since you never see it son that's, if'n you ever see us,

I’ll be seein' sights sippin on somethin' with señoritas,
Pro-political peace, let 'em read
With a Palestinian, Israeli or Lebanese,
Behold the horse I'm paler to ever be
I'm tryin' to catch some while I'm sailing the seven seas
I float my friends, scuttle my enemies and we
Constantly in the struggle for energy,
I rock steadily in the spot ready or not
Pushin' my pronouns for plenty plenty a pop,
I'm getting guap my man I got plans
To cop land away and lay in in the hot sand,
I 'Know the Ledge' and I'm, playin' my Roxanne,
Another dollar another day in the rock band,
It's juice!

Give me, give me, give me the juice
Give me, give me, give me the juice

Crawling out of a casket, I woke from madness,
I've been in the media feeding off the sadness,
If any an enemy coming rattling as if,
He ready for Armageddon now wet him in acid
I've been in the back bitch, playing the sidekick
Surprised they realize the size of my dick,
They blog and criticize the lines of my shit,
Straddle up on a iron alone and you ride dick,
Better get him a stretcher, an oxygen mask,
Socks and gym bags, box of Slim Fast,
I lose dead weight, got a lot to get past,
For all that hate, I'm about to get cash,
I ain't got a chain yet, you're hearing the same vet,
Could say that I'm lucky I made it out of a train wreck,
Want me to speed it up motherfucker it ain't Tech
It's Godemis idiots study up on on the name check
I zone in the canvas, I'm in the paint, they ain't ready
I spray seven or eight I'm alive to aim steady
It's like me and Jason using the same 'chete
So 'Raw' I'm 'Delirious' nigger it ain't Eddie!
It don't matter I don't chatter at all to y'all,
The new data is out of an old catalog,
The instinct is that of an old rabid dog,
Who might have been good on that day, but he got it all
That's juice!

Give me, give me, give me the juice
Give me, give me, give me the juice

Outta Pagans that are mating fornicatin'
With hate and sick lust,
Eatin' bloody steak and bacon with Satan
They can abrup-tly be taken by Yates
And I'm placin' this blade in his guts,
Amazing to us sleknov raisin' a cup here's to,
Layin' the blade today who bathin' in blood Bedlam,
Might behead ya psyches dead for life he bled
But Ike said to knife these Negras!
Bright ran away for the night I'm a sinner
Hate my inner light when I stray see the fright,
I generate, I innovate in the fight I'mma incinerate a mic!
Men obey when I write they disintegrate
It's over, soul of a soldier
Chose to be cold and overload ya with vulgar
S'posed to be old but the flows gettin' bolder

Yeah, it's like pulling a bad one
Get her off at the pad, then get the jimmy to stab some
But you can't and puddy is right there

But the fame it fools the brain
But you regain it through Strange

To the ground and get applause sound

Got a cold mic, they got me a million sold twice
Not a low-life anymore it’s always sold-out show nights
After K.O.D. you scared me, so I ran from you
Then accepted you on Seepage, then saw the fans come through
Just when I thought I took everything I can stand from you
I kept writing and then we watched the Strangeland come true

I was meant to share my darkness within my light
People say it helps them to see me fly
From the bottom, that’s motivation for them all, now I see exactly why

Touching beautiful kiddies
Really gonna die

I think the world needs more light
'Cause what they do in the dark too heinous for your sight
And mine is dark all the time
A sign to design true crime
But I'm blessed to have the platform for this rhyme

Damn, why wasn't the light on baby girl
Grown men touch her, she 4, livin' in this crazy world
That's gonna affect her way longer than the lightest life span
If I was there, I'd be sparking way more than a light, man
But if we shine em' all, together we can run them off
Gonna hardslide on everyone he come across
Molotovs go to slavery in the Holocaust
Lotta chalk, you ain't lit up, then you not a boss
Light the darker alleys, it might just spark a rally
For right these hearts are rowdy, tonight we spark the valleys
In flatlands stoppin' the bad man, with grab hands
Girl he groping, go in the trash can
Nowhere to hide I must say places ain't light enough
You try to cut the bright of us an idol might just erupt
The fine of dusk would light as the night adjust
If you got em' then light them up

If there was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world

Hey
Why did Adam shoot the school up?
Maybe cause the way he grew up
Maybe cause of loose screws
Scratch all that, cause mama loved to pick the tool up
Now a marathon blew up
And it's by the hands of two nuts
When Castro took the kids for about ten years and what he'd done, I almost threw up

If them was my youngins I'd try to bring the sun in
Closer to 'em, turn it up a hundred and hold it to 'em
Take a bite and chew 'em
Some of they baby life they ruined
I'd be going crazy on the daily
Daily I'd pursue them
Don't need more reasons to turn this to a fire pit
Barbecue, I would do, right find without all of it
It's awful and off to no resolving it
Molotovs make the night brighter

Minors in the stretcher, so what you gonna do with them 25 lighters on your dresser
Yessir, shine them bright so they see us off in Mecca
Lessen the threats of them steppin' with death impress us
To mess a good will, divide up a fight
Being right and polite, come and help me light up the night
Shine your light bright, but I finally can't rape her
People stand together, make the place safer
No time to play when I weigh the straight haters
Cause they fakers and doing evil is they nature

Its up to me as the guardian to go and solve em'
Make my life and involve em
Late at night when I call em
I like to hear em' say daddy your song is awesome
Instead of gang bangers in school won't let up
I'm fed up I'm wondering if you can come up an red up
You shut up, negativity can be found inside my angels
Even though I was stupid but I put it down
Set trippin' but I let it go headed for energetic flow
When I'm up to know that I was down and out
But now I'm breaded though
I know you saw me rep colors when I was young, dumb and malicious
I'm thankful, that all my blemishes never made you suspicious
Latched on to light
That's known to hype apparent you coherent knowing I rapped wrong to right
Love and positivity instilled in my kid
Their family my family their mother and I did
Discipline starts at home even if they can't stand you
Watch em' fights land, you clock em' right hand
To stop em' that a man to stand up even add a camera
They won't be James Holmes, and they won't be Adam Lanza
A John Malvo, I'll flow loud for my child though
Ain't raising no groucho evil out my house yo
Instead a me watching em' disappear in the night
Air em' at graduation saying that's my kid right there

I proudly proclaim my love
The futures born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters, this time
So my prayers that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

To my unborn I give my all so you could ball like I could'nt
Stay in school and play it smooth and do those things that I wouldn't
Pay attention and keep your distance from ignorant instances
Play a instrument anything that you want just envision it
Follow your dreams, no matter what may come or what may fall
'Cause ain't no shame in failing as long as you know you gave your all
Stand up, man up, get a handle on yourself tighten your belt
Do what you can to do for you and ya'll just don't, do it for the wealth that they offer
It sounds awful but if me and your mama' ain't talking
And she said that I ain't offering a call just as often as I should
I pray that you get older and you understand that I was just, doing what I could
If she let me, if you have a second I could explain
Like so many transitions in life that people change
Whether I'm on top soil, or dead in a box
I love you dearly sincerely and that'll never stop
For my kid
For my kid

I proudly proclaim my love
The futures born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters, this time
So my prayers that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

And one on the way in a matter of weeks
But it's a shame 'cause I think that my other daughter ain't mine
Andria baby I love you I guess your father was blind
In due time you'll understand it, how your mama' was scandalous
(Wait this don't seem right man, I don't think I can handle it)
When I all I ever did was show love for you
Sweated blood for you, any moment take a slug for you
But its cool, the baby mama drama is expected
And that karma is going to be what I been blessed with
Sit back and learn your lessons as our seeds grow from kids to adolescence
Then present you for yourself as misdirection
The first to heed the message is Malik
Abandoned by his mama' on thanksgiving evening
Bout' three years ago was up to me to feed to em morals
Values manhood, knowledge a week ago he graduated
You ask me, then I'mma say

Hit the stage and show these people how I do this shit so often
Got em yelling like they're Paul Revere on horseback outta Boston
You critics can't deny it, shut your mouth and keep it quiet
Now I'm out here getting bread, you'd think I'm on a Subway diet
I do this shit the livest, so yo please don't kill my vibe, bitch
Or I'm setting off a riot in this bitch, don't even try it
I've been working everyday, I think I need a vacation
And your girl been feeling me just like a TSA agent
So even if you haven't heard of me, at least she did
And even though that pisses you off, don't blame me kid!
Some people hate the fact that now I'm on my way

Genius in the laboratory cooking blue meth, yo
Call me Heisenberg, cause when I rhyme with words
These motherfuckers are behind the curve
I drive and swerve, turn and I ride the curve
And hit every pedestrian that doesn’t find the nerve…

Yeah maybe you should drive, cause the weed I hit
Got me feeling so loco, la vida, bitch
Why you even pass me that shit?
But fuck it man I’m an animal, but you never seen my species
Brand new breed they discovered in CT
Homegrown bitch, yelling “feed me, feed me!”
And every listener is pressing repeat

Met this chick in an altered state

She's a model, fuck that's great
Gave me a touch
Said what's up
I said fucking, nothing much
Ask me what I'm wearing

I can see that you're always on the move
And I can see that your always on go
I can feel that your minds always running
Got the feeling that you wanna burn
Wanna burn slow

Hold it in, ghost toke
When our lips touch we both smoke
If the feeling is right we both know
If the hit's too big we both choke
Man I love this feeling
Got my head above the ceiling
Burn it slow 'cause we just chilling
Got nowhere to go but here
And I just love the way that you vibe
I'm on your level and I
I care not what they say and I'mma do whatever feels right
So I lose it, no control
Light me up and just watch me go

I get stoned, yeah I go ruthless

I take my time cause I know that you wanna burn slow

Sit at home when I'm killing the pages
I do it cause I love it, got incredible wages
I wanna kick it like a horny devil in Vegas
I call up a couple ladies with the medical haze
Very super sick and ready to roll
Got the grinder out and shredded the dough
Now it's time to get kinetic, we headed
For vertical travel you like never before
Me and the woman we pumping in the garage
What I'm thinking, I'm thinking a Ménage
Loving the feeling, I got to end a massage
I gotta sit I'm thinking I'm having dinner with God
Super silver haze, taking me up
Super killer babes, shaking they butts
All the beauty steady making me puff
And the central making me lust
That's what I yearn for
Something so beautiful when we cipher, I'm not thinking about no germ so
My turn you all
What about some love and I'm concerned though
We learn though
Really make you make my worm grow
Adjourned
Then after we burn slow

I can see you through the flames of your lighter
I can see you with the lights down low
I can feel it when I'm standing beside you
Got the feeling that you want to burn slow

I can see that you're always on the move
And I can see that your always on go
I can feel that your minds always running
Got the feeling that you wanna burn
Wanna burn slow

I take my time cause I know that you wanna burn slow

It’s a murder probably, if not then I bet you we cause a verbal lobotomy
Tell them niggas to make a move that when they move I will abuse
I’ll show em they finna lose and I refuse to be a fool
I kill em, I keep em cool but I'mma do what I'mma do

Bust you under lyrics, that’s how I shoot this

I’m mythical, difficult when I don’t know if it'll be
A wise thing for you to do as far as playing with the unusual
Orien, and I am a scientifical
Indivisibility within the infrastructure of the family that I created is inevitable
Especially if we committed to getting money
So fuck the haters because it’s the paper that you better get you
Take a mental with the spatial, leave it alone

Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em melt
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turning up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flipping niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
We bleed ‘em, beat 'em 'til they be gone feed 'em

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstasy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy's wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity

That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the.

I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, don't wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em, and we killing 'em in this bitch

Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills

Tears are so serious
Come, Holy Spirit
Stay with me always
Somehow my true love
The tears on my face

Now-now-now-now people cussing and bussing
They get nothing but in the ground when they blown out
Oh wow, tell me how he got the stubborn, he tough and
He was young with a grown mouth
Zoned out cause my mother is gone, how
Simply would he send me with the alone route
Going out, to the studio hitting the Don Julio
My duty go if I'm moody yo, get up and get the song out
My angel fades, then came more rage
And even though Strange still pays
something inside of me saying it ain't yo days
My religion, walking away
My prediction, lost in the gray
I'm thinkin' the holy spirit don't really wanna hear it
So people who givin' me evil, they all finna pay
Anybody really want it, I'mma get dirty when a demon is my opponent
Feeling froggy any moment, know you will never be the owner because I'm on it
Losing mama, really did it, demons really gonna get it
I'm looking for the light, I'm asking you open
And losing all of my inner good and the hope with it

Tears are so serious (Constantly seeking)

I don't wanna hear no punk say ""weirdo""
If you ain't in my circle, then you're not even near, bro
Here go the fear though getting the zilla
and my killas in the villa to make a racket in your ear go (BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM)
That is severe mode, bodies I'm not even with the jolly
My tears go down-my-face, yeah
But I'm switching the gears, yo
Got on the plane to Colorado, I go to hit the Summer Jam, then momma tomorrow
I'm thinking the Lord will give me time while im in 'Vado
To say I love her before the Bible go hollow
(GONE-GONE-GONE-GONE)
My show was sorrow, needed a little bit of mo' time to borrow
(MY-TIME'S- UP)
Man, steady talking to God, so I don't - get it
Thought I was special enough for God to be with it
By giving me another day with my mother, but I missed it
But rocking with Denver said in her name, I'ma rip this
(DONE-DONE-DONE-DONE)
This ain't no way to be, hella jaded, see, but I'm created
My mother left me, but her death ain't okay with me
Still I'm praying for her spirit to stay with me

Pitch black, star bright, yeah that's my life
A bit of fire and ice
Watch friends, plot foes, stock ends and pot holes
'Cause when the tank hit the bank, it just got closed
Don't be stank in the paint cause the yak froze

Wish I knew back when I was strugglin'
If I plugged in and kept bustin'
I'd be buzzin', that'd make me super rich
Never knew my sufferin' over but
Cousin, I keep it up and gushin'
And tell all of my family, aunts and uncles, cousins to do the shit
Just gain power through all of the rain showers
No different, remain sour cause someone else's lame hours
Wish I woulda known to tell 'em all to start they own business
Make long digits instead of havin' a boss who talk at the wrong pitches
To fake friends, cause it's never enough
At hostile situations with folks, I learned it's better to bust
First, and you still a nigga no matter how much ya stuff's worth
You love who love you, do hug who does true
Connect the true blood to cuzz blue
So keep hopin' the Lord does show up
'Cause it'll never be no peace on earth for all of us
'Till this mug blow up

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Ponderin' these thoughts while sittin' idle in this mezzanine
Feel my feelin's boilin' up, I'm simmerin' on everything
Goin' for the gold because it's shimmerin', but everything
That you encounter seems to be devoured, need a better team
Every thought and every dream, every plot and every scheme
Lurkin' around the corner is a hater waiting like a fiend
And choice of drug is negative, and they use it like a sedative
Success becomes the cause of this effect, abuse the medicine
You thinkin' you can let 'em in, partake in buildin' excellence
The serpents come in twos and they meticulous with they meddlin'
The feathers flock together, see the relationships we settle in
Got consequences so it's best to let 'em go, we blessed again
Disloyalty unfoiled, trynna justify they pestilence
I don't understand why they so demanding manic pessimists
I guess if I had to guess, I'd make an estimate, I guess that they
Was just afraid so watch us levitate 'till I'm at heaven's gate

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Mmm, life sentence for fallin' out ya physical body
Illuminate my soul, officially became godly
I be the one, all of these demons runnin' from
Dumped a gun, lifted spirits, niggas deem me the chosen one
Phony family in my crowd, rappin' gap and loud
Facin' twelve in the pen, none of them niggas made a sound
None of them niggas round
Now the fame close and the name boasts
I'm 'posed to break bread bitch, taste toast
I should smoke them ungrateful bitches
They doin' the most to see what make you choke
It actually leave ya throat missin'
I'm on a mission to revisit kin and
My prime been hidden, trynna dine with women
Dipped and find this linen, try and find a business
I love who love Gee, fuck you if it's fuck me
That's just how it gotta be, cause I'm paper routin'
Tame nuisance, insane view and check on my lawn
Strange recruit me, guess when the god speakin' Strange Music

If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstasy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy's wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity

That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the.

I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, don't wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em, and we killing 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
'Cause me and my nigga Twista ruler, and that's it

Tech N9ne,"I don't care, they say my angel glow is subsiding
I'm sliding outside of these high beams and I won't dare
Try to mend this tear, I love I'm fading
The good once there is just dying
So I'm withering away and I'ma trigger when I spray
And I'm attacking everybody till the feeling's gone!

All my life I loved with people, so passive back then
I thought I'd be above this evil, my tolerance level
Then was up with doves and eagles
Currently I've hit ground zero under bugs and beetles
I'm tilted, inside my head's a lettuce but wilted
Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine I spilt it
Could it be how many times I've been ran over and jilted?
That makes me wanna totally detach from light and just kill shit

I'll know when the pain is gone
It's just a matter of time before my bosses win
And I can feel the wrong
Coming up through the cracks of my heart again
I'm holding on, I'm going
Straight into the mouths of makers
Everything that keeps me calm was taken
I'm letting go, I'm burning through, reserves are low
Just pushing on these old restraints
My time is up cause it's too late

I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up, at any time today
I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up, at any time today

I am lookin' for some fire, yeah, putting on my gang attire
Drooling and blood I can taste, so get the fuck outta my face
I'm a killer with a quick switch, yeah, all I ever really wanted was bliss
Look at me wither to waste, so get the fuck outta my face
Find another one to get bent, yeah, and it ain't no stoppin' this
Lovin' the thrill of the chase, so get the fuck outta my face
N9ne's a nigga with the sick-ness, yeah, and it ain't no blockin' this
It doesn't matter the race, just get the fuck out my face

Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Going, withering away

I gotta say, when my mother died, I really did inside
And that's the other thing that did it
Turning my crazy on a hundred babies gonna plummet
Maybe I should be committed

What am I supposed to do?
Do I just keep faking? Fucking forsaking everything I am?
Another pissed mother fucker with a fist and a plan
Oh but you're making me do this
I can scream while you stand there clueless
If you're listening I've made up my mind
Take another step and I'll snap this time!

Something please save me, I'm losing myself

I don't think I wanna stop it, but the feeling inside is nauseous
I get really exhausted off it, gotta find a way to wash it lock it
Profit nada so I got to drop it, ain't nobody in the cockpit
Toss this lostness, people from the office boxes
If you cross this boss live cautious
Don't make me, don't make me repeat myself
For your safety, because a pilly is beneath my belt
But I don't wanna do anything bad to anybody
But I'll never be perfect
So I'mma say to the people that got a little evil
comin' at you from me I think they deserve it

Going, withering away
Going, withering away
Going, withering away
(GONE)

Straight, literally snappin' out
My lady backin' out cause I'm becoming really mean and vicious
Watching me wither, how can I give her
Blood when I been so tainted by these bitches

We are the arsenal
Chemically imbalanced, completely disposable
So butter my knuckles and taste it
Another sick delinquent is wasted
I don't forgive, I don't forget
I haven't got time to regret
Everybody else in the world can hate me
Nobody but me can save me!

Shit, Yates, hates, this, place
If you're close enough to me to hit the switch
You better never turn it on
I get the feelin' I'm gonna be craving a
Killin I gotta be real and the evil'll
Fill up and sucker the middle man 'till he be

Tech N9ne,"Mama told me I was her angel sent down from heaven
When I was a little one enthusiasm caught my dome and lessons
Teachin' me 'bout the Seven and how I should be a reverend
She really gave me a ""this world is not my home"" impression
Sent down to help lost souls and fight their foes
Angels chose to toss woes when the night air's cold
But it got to me when she looked up and said (I'll soon be gone)
Then I was right there, froze
'Cause that meant, I'd be alone
The second, that she was gone
I was beckoned by my brethren
Then my head spinned like (buzz)
Tech went to be a grown
A complex gent, that see the wrong
And blessed it with the best scripts
I invested my whole life, chose light
But the people down here don't know what to do with it
When I fly away cause I really don't know too many that's true with it, ya know?

Ya know?

Man

This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away

They don't understand me, when I say everybody's family
With the evil deeds they proved me wrong, I failed
To the heavens you can hand me
'Cause my guy will never just land me
Down deep with Satan, that is not my home in hell
But where I'm living now, people are living foul
They keep they heaters on the key to stone
I'm mentally stiffened, wow
A lot of love is missing now, so (I'll soon be gone)
'Cause they don't wanna listen to what I'm giving thou
Love, but who gets it usually disperse
B-b-but wait, it gets worse, I found out it never helped it hurts
I thought my job was to give it all the works
To many it's worldly, when you can't control your thirst
So if I can't bring happy, I'll go
Flings that this queen catch me really seems tacky, ya know?

(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Man

This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away

Fear not, cause this ain't the point when you hear shots
Me, and my peers got, by God's will dropped in the weird pot
I wanna ascend cause I'm feelin' like I'm near shock
Mama gone I'm feelin' like I want the rest of my years blocked
You got your ears locked?
I wanna fly away cause inside I have eternal tear drops

This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away

I was blessed with the gift to disable hate
With fatal takes on the mic is makin' my halo break
And smash every lady workin' at Strange, call them my label-mates
I throw the squad up, them I'ma pour ya broad up
Genital, so plentiful, ya chemical's low but shot up
Wishin' they'd slow the god up

I'ma let you be great though
But it ain't no stoppin' a Yates

Lately I've been like fuck rap
What? Did he say ""fuck rap""?
Oh no no, I'mma write in bold and plus caps
FUCK RAP
Cuz all these tough cats really don't have no nut sack
Trust that 'nuff scratch does back much wackness
Flush that shit
Down with the gowns with the sounds for the clowns
And not in a good way
You can drown underground with the pounds
When they gust that shit
Oh so, low we stojo, hoes and dough negro we flow though
Let the soul glow, mojo, nigga
Pillowcase, over the head of the industry
Illustrate, with my mouth and murders my ministry
Seal the fate of my enemy, feel the weight of my energy
I heal the hate. Facilitate. Disc jockey's will scrilla make
Then play your records until you break radio
Ain't nothing but real estate
It's still a fake deal of mates who ain't real awake
But the mill is great, ain't no iller ape that can kill a Yates

It's no challenge, It's no challenge at all
When you up the ball against the low average

But it ain't no stoppin' a Yates

I can keep my head, while everybody losin' theirs
No Marcus, I told you, don't start this debate
I'm all arsenal friend, we the median like, you feedin' me in
Tired of bein' with the intermediate
Faded on bullshit, control the whole medium
I done ran inside my meniscus
I done out-rapped everybody Christmas
So why in the hell would I fail?
If I do, I'm just being Ezale
Front line level, untamed, unchained
After all this shit, I remain on lane, loser
And that's what yo ass get for hittin' that snoozer
My brain is worth the future, and yes, I don't get worked
So my verses hurts when they send me to kill 'em
I'm like Biblin' niggas, keepin' it blacker than Power Rangers
But why the name Zachary? No leashes, I'm free sucker

I am like Iron Mike, back in the day
My rhyming's iron height, defiant flight
Try and bite, like a razor in a candy apple
A taser and a jammy tackle
By a neighbor with the family shackles
Laboring a man he's gaffled
I get angry, I sip bombs (chea!) on your rich lawn
I was brought up Muslim and Christian
I been studying Chrislam (Chea!)
That's not a thing so I place this John
In your chicks palm
Give her something beautiful to kiss on
'Till I spit one to her lip balm (Chea!)
I've been rhyming since Reagan in politics
Polished it then got a big wallet where all of my dollars sit
To the wall is split, then I gotta sick the casa, your god exists
'Cause a lot of chicks holler ""Mr. Chopper you're hot as shit""

They say I'm the best at what I do
After me it's 5, 4, 3, and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin'
So I tell them all to put that on somethin'
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything

Yeah, I guess I'm supposed to come with that fast flow
Woo! I guess I'm supposed to come with that gas flow
But no, I'mma just spit it, I'mma get it good
Wish you would tell me what I should do
I don't know, hit the door
Uh, yeah, feel like I been here before
Maybe I have but I can't fuck with it
Hit 'em with a semiautomatic, watch 'em duck with it
Speaking on lyrical ability
Everybody in my vicinity blowing they mind like Kennedy
I got no love for the enemy, somebody tell me the remedy
I'm like what's good, been fine
Tell me what's on your mind, rewind this shit
My message is beyond this shit
I put that on everything, I'm just being honest, shit
So what's up, hold up
Tech I'm sorry for the hold up but I been on the road
Should have had this verse to your ass a long time ago
When I put that on everything, I ain't had a minute to myself
But I been living like I ain't finna see tomorrow
I ain't focused on no wealth
I been living good, I been feeling fine
Pass the Sriracha, I put that shit on all of mine
Busting like Columbine combined with a terrorist's mind
That's been confined in four walls for some time

We gotcha, even haters jock us
These choppers invade the knockers then blocker
Disintegrating every chakra eager to off ya
You can bet that we doin' it proper
When I put the bullets in a fully with a hoodie
Ain't nobody gonna stop us, nobody gon' top us
We leave 'em with no option, leave 'em with no conscience
Leave 'em with no oxygen, leave 'em with no problem
And even though I could see what they watchin'
TV with a DVD, I can repeat
When I see these street shockin'
Easy if it need be then I just eat beats
And I'm Eazy-E, Compton
I eat meat like I'm EBT shopping
Credit Card Max, bend the bars back
Fuck your hoe, get brain and all that
Run in your house and bring your whore back
Sever your face and dead the doormat
Who got the keys to the rented Corvette
Can't catch me, I'm the man in all black
I been a nice chap since Catman on crack
Fuck that, I been nice way before that
Can't ignore that, you can try though
But you gon' end up next to Dido
I'm that pen that wrote the Bible
I'm on your skin like vitiligo
Sing for the moment, I hit the high note
Someone please let Elton John know
Tell the lieutenant I'm Hect Camacho
With a Catholic priest and the Pentecostal
Why you niggas wiggidy wiggidy wack, gettidy get in the back
With a umbilical patch, jump in the middle of the track
None of y'all niggas can act so y'all niggas are packed
Come and get it again, fuckin' a bitch in the whip
Give me your moment to fall, I'm gonna fit in the car
I can do better than yours, I can be ready to brawl
I can be shattered and all, nobody want to be hard
Better be ready for war, tell me who ready for more

Winners are not people who never fail
But people who never quit
All I ever wanted was to sell
Records to the people make a lot of mil', yessir
Rap to me, it was the holy grail
I'm gonna go and do it, I'm never gonna fail
Yeah, but first I gotta make it out of Hell

Wake up and I see crime
All of us we on it's eat time
My homies love me yelling ""Peace N9ne""
At the same time, throwing B signs
Throwing 'em back and repping the street, I'm
Doing music and I'm writing beast rhymes
But my V-Slimes, had no weak minds
Got with the music, started a group and we shine
Music gave us hella hope
Made it up out of the bangin' and sellin' dope
We were stronger than a bottle of Yoke
'Till one of our members found a kid to grope
Then your honor gave the peddy the rope
Losing a man, the band began to slope
Never did think a plan was damned to croak
So doing it solo-dolo stands the G.O.A.T
Started making hella LP's
2000, all the way to five, felt free
Because of the hand the label dealt me
But in ‘06 Fontana helped us melt cheese
Number one independent gonna be spending a ton of funds, in a minute
That's when the government want the sums, then I send it
In a couple of months I'm done and replenished

Everywhere I go, I'm selling out the show
Around the world I kill 'em and everybody know
Whenever we hit the studio and Tecca Nina drop, hot
Even though I will go toe to toe if somebody bang on me

Chances of me getting shot, not

Everyone loving the Tech
Publishin', I get a check
Loving the cities that with me, the people that call me the best
I don't have any regret, but it's a bit of neglect
Missing my babies I love 'em and none of 'em leaving me yet
Feeling good like a villain should
In a mansion, but I'm still in hoods
Not like Trayvon, J's on
Khaki shorts with a red tee like I will and could
I can conceal it my permits say
If evil happens to swerve this way
Hope nobody deserves quick spray
I feel an angelic surge this day
They feeling my songs
Been doing it long
They want me to sell 'em my CD right outta my home
'Cause I'm in the zone
I'm putting 'em on in front of the store when a couple of police won't leave me alone
Why they tripping?
I fit the description
It's two of them rushing me I'm on a solo mission
To get people to listen, but they pushing and kicking me
I'm on the ground when they telling me, ""Cause of a gun suspicion""
It was in my pocket, ain't trying pop it
When they scared of a brother with a gun no one can stop it
Then one of 'em lost it, and then I was shot quick
Officers took me to heaven, I'm dead and with multiple rockets
Didn't matter I was good and living inside a mansion next to ball players
'Cause of the move he made was drastic now I lay in a casket carried by my pallbearers
Fears what I see, making 'em kill a G
Rotten apple in the batch; don't tell the rest to flee
This happened in Baton, R-O-U-G-E, even I fit the description

What if it was me
What if I never got the one chance to be
Everything and everywhere I go, I wouldn't see
If by your hand you took that from me
But what if it were me?
Laying right there
I'll never get up again, it's so unfair
My babies cry out
You never cared
Things that we do make each other so scared
So what if it was you there?

(Should I bust) Make your wife widowed, withered, hugging the pillow
The scent of you still on her
Spirit she feels on her

That when we checked in our room it was so small that 
You open the front door to our room and you could see, hold up
God damn You could see 
The nigga at the front desk he was like, you just open the door and he was right there 
So Krizz Kaliko goes and asks the nigga like, uh, ey man, y'all got the WiFi? 
And the dude was like ""wh- WiFi? Wifi? I dunno, WiFi?"" He's like
""You know, WiFi man, you got WiFi? Wifi code?""

Since then my pen been at war like Montagues and Capulets
A menacing strap you get, been winning in rap, who's next
To get permanent power polluted, paper protruded
Punani praise on its pubics and they're prepared to pursue it
Get us then we drills 'em
Having plenty thrills, I'm Wellington New Zealand banging her with a chest like Wendy Williams
Everybody know with the kinda money I bring to the table I can put 'em off
Take 'em all around the world, get the dough and get the girl touching other people and I brought the hood along
Teams why, wings fly, things die but the king's eye people I never seen cry
If you wanna see the mean side just go stream what I seen on steam, put your hand in my bean pie
Salam Baseem, Hakim and Keuh Rameen
I'm something fierce, I bring player haters to tears with my schemes

When they freaking out I'm Jim Morrison
But I go without hair Billy Corgan
Releasing a lot more of them endorphins
Weefee wins the war again the gore's been like a horror film
'Cause we kill, everything so be still
When we move in, not a cheap thrill
When the beat feels like E pills
Steadily repping B till, my B-L-double O-D spills

Tech is highly respected
Been with a few major labels and left it
I rated my records intrepid

I really had to keep it simple
I had to run up and down the court watching y'all like the league official
I never had to keep a pistol
If I did shoot, I'd shoot to kill
Talk is talk and that's cheap to me
But nobody really know what I do for real
I am what I always been, white kid with the rapping skill
Maintain that I'm self-sustained
Still CES came as a package deal
Run shit like in track and field
I'll pass baton in decathlon
Search around and go find a verse where I came soft and I was slackin' on
Puff puff and I'll pass it on

By design to find your prime time if their eyes open
Sign of the times ain't dependent on the rhymes

Only hurt ya if the shoe fits ya

Will I last
Will they attack with a blast?

I was the only child till I was 13
Rather be lonely while dealing with earthlings
Still I am reclusive with drug and liquor abuses
Having a solitary time was never the worst thing
Dedicating time to the craft
Levitating lines in the lab
Never hesitating rhymes hit the pad
When they resonate N9ne get the bag
Then I medicate the mind is the first thing
Yes I live in my encephalon
I don't need all the rest of them
To stress the one blessing them
They're what you insert a speculum
Open it and hope you don't choke on something is gross in it

Why they pissed today 'cause whatever they say to me ricochet
They don't dig the way that I laugh after a big delay
I don't need a shrink I need a sedative
I just need a drink to be repetitive
Lotta people I need some etiquette
In payin' attention I get them red a bit
And that will get you nothin' but cussin' at somebody breaded bitch
Sick and twisted I can kick it
We're just licking, spliff just get lifted
Some say I'ma misfit by the way that I'm drifting

To twirl top of the world like Obama do
And I might need a triple X video
In case wanna see her playin with her kitty though
I know the ladies can't relate
You don't need nobody to bait
Gotta pretty ho's do it in my city tho
Why am I alone?
Cause people stated rushing me the day after I grabbed a microphone
Ink a needle, drinking my patron
You say you can't handle this, you should probably play the xylophone

The thugs and college kids they boost records

All in together no matter who's net worth
So many years with Whoop Whoop experts

Hot 97 compared the two vet's work
Pretty much how they one in the same ooh that hurt

And the ladies are already laid it, not sedated like Bill Cosby's
They just waiting for the ooh Areola near the end of the show
Then we do Areola but we didn't see anything but few Areolas 
Out of so many women so that was boo Areola
Only saw 4 from the stage when they up on the shoulders you can never tell they underage
Next day when the parent was creeping on her daughter's page
Saw the bit of her daughter flashing and now she in a rage
She made her tell authorities we made her do it
Yeah right more like the guy that raised her to it
My partner O' apostrophe called me hostily
Saying the cameras got em yellin' child pornography
We been doing Areola for 8 years
Now we gotta stay clear cause some fake tears

They said my music will never fit in the pro slot
Probably why it sell it to cities when I globe trot
No more wall the records and the Platinum and gold box

In the beginning we did a show in a gazebo
Now we got hits and takin' pics with the people
But they won't play me if I don't mix with the Migos
If you tell me my music didn't fit they program
Said that the music I make wasn't fit for the broham

But some people wanna delay the bag 
Even though you kill everything when you display the gas spray the mag
Nina blast like in laser tag to who paid the cash thinkin' I'ma stray the path

You consider suburban black on white cop who never been to the hood, to the hood
'Cause the perception they get from all the killings on the TV ain't never good, in the hood
So it's nervous when they give service
No courage can lead to murders
The squirters make them assertive
And I heard it can't be refurbished
When the word is ""We deserve it""
'Cause someone alerted, we flirted with purges
Leaving us dead and deserted
Permanently dirted inserted
In a pine box I'm not dine shot
Tryna make my time stop
Nine got them slimes that mind bop
And it never do dime drop
Born on Nine' block to crime dot
Then the rhymes locked where they find bop
I can still walk on Highland, walk on Wayne
Claiming what I aught to claim
Soft and sensitive simple suckers, they take the walk of shame
Heads wire, like that they bled, ours
The dead flyers
Because we say something, do something

And if I ever started to fall
I lift with both feet on the ground
Making me ten feet tall
Looking like, ""Wassup now?""
Say something, do something
""Wassup now?""
Say something, do something
Ah me?
Say something, do something
Little ol' me?
Say something, do something

All I got is my name
'Long as my name's is good, I'm good

Feel evil, really though
Sinister shit for illy blokes
Who milly tote for silly folks
Busting till they chilly most
Kill these broke enemies finna be until he croke
Leaving 'em wrapped in a drilly coat
Crossing him with a chin like a billy goat
We talk this way cause we been through so much
Impossible to have no guts
Anybody faking we say hold up
We got our street and city showed up
That's from all the fighting and bumping
We found the light in the sunken hole
Down is plight and disfunction
Plowed us right into something
Hours frighting and then funking
But the cowards prying and punching
And the pal is trying to trump him
Now we flying and bumping
Flying higher than med tryers
We bred sires and they bed lie-ers

Tech N9ne,"I got a story to tell
'Bout when I ginormously fell
Won't say no names though
'Cause it ain't no game bro
And it ain't no angle making no woof tickets for me to sell
It's about to, buddies in the middle of a bout too
A lady on the daily putting out two
One of the buddies she told him never let his mouth spew
Don't let your bro know what's happening
'Cause we were together, plus shacking in
That's what you call gettin' back at friends
Shoulda told him I was tapping in

I was 21
She was 40-something, say she wanna give me some
So I started putting Tecca Nina in the lungs
Of the photographer that my homie, then he brung
But it was a catch, he didn't want a nigga to rack
'Cause her and my homie were together, he'd give her the scratch
After every photo-shoot but he'd have a bitter attack
If he knew his colleague would shoot me then deliver the snatch
So I kept her secret like a dummy keeping it professional
I didn't tell my homie but I was full of regret you know?
Riding out with my homie, out my mouth ain't no decibels
But when she finished flicking me, we bang out on the sectional
I used to throw him hints saying ""I really wanna smash her""
Then he would look at me like I was doing it with laughter saying
""She would never do it, I don't know what you after
Out of your league, man you young, broke and plus you a rapper""
Damn

Bros become foes yeah (bros become foes)
Lord knows the lovin' was fly though
It ain't worth livin' these lies though
On my dog (On my dog, on my dog)
Yeah
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
(That I was tappin' in)
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
('Cause he was a best friend)
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends

She would pick me up for photo sessions
But I didn't tell my homie we were low-low sexin'
Man this lady had a body like she was SoloFlex'n
So right after work, she let me give her a pogo lesson
No confession never told him, I was grindin'
On his workin' roommate, I was slimin'
But I messed up and told my other homie
But when me and him fell out he told my best friend that I was lyin' all this time
And then my homie said
Why is you playin' me, I'm hearing too many rumors
Yo you got something to say to me, man?
You know about my affection for that woman that stay with me
You supposed to be my homie, why you fuckin' and fakin'?
And then I gotta hear from someone else
You selfish man all you think about is your fuckin' self
You and her be together, I don't need no one's help
I'm feel like I'm finna lose it, I don't know what I'ma do
But I swear to
Hold on my nigga, you can't be callin' me trippin
I'm with my family and I don't know what the hell you talkin' 'bout that's fuckin' insanity man
Why you lyin' to me bro, you know these people be talkin'
And their stories sound the same and you makin' it awkward
And I ain't finna be the type to act like this don't really hurts
What am I supposed to do 'bout it when I'm at work?
You and her, we supposed to be brothers that make it worse
And he told me everything y'all be doin' don't do me dirt
Don't deny it homie, really you oversteppin' your turf
Told me y'all was snappin' photos and you removin' her skirt
Even said you shoulda known this fuckin' chick was a flirt
Well how you gonna believe every damn thing he say?
Dog you for real? You shoulda told me without delay
We was like fam, now you got me dealin' with hearsay
And everything that he say, she say
Oh, I gotta go

Bros become foes yeah (bros become foes)
Lord knows the lovin' was fly though
It ain't worth livin' these lies though

I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him

I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him

Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends

So that is how me and my best friend fell out
'Cause I told another homie something he had to yell out
All of our business ventures and dreams was the hell out
And I'm left with underhanded things that I can tell 'bout
Lost my best friend, 'cause I was young and dumb
He lost his life to another brother with a gun
I never got to tell him that I was sorry, I was sprung
My other homie just died of cancer, I'm numb
So the moral of the story is
Don't lie to get something that you really want
Always keep it real, though a lot of people don't
That's why they always in funk

Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in

People rather have separation than to come together living freely
All the tragedies we see in the dark streets on the TV
Make it difficult to grow a glee tree when the love level back in B.C
We will never see racism done away within our lifetime
When the parents hearts filled of hate, reproduce, then it's sending down the pipeline
If their kids want to fight crime, and they talk to others of the right kind
That'd be terrifying facing nighttime and it's still the only light shined
Jesus not present when things seem so egregious
But if we just set aside all our differences and try to ease up
Off of war with each other please trust we can be just
When the hating, killings', enough and the anthem will have everybody taking knees up

No, we won't go quietly
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We said ""Turn this message louder 'till the speakers bleed""
But we won't go quietly

We said ""Turn this message louder 'till the speakers bleed""

'Cause they don't want consumers to stop their pay streams
If they don't agree with your way of thinking they taking
Your cake cream, no love no life is all that hate brings
I stand by love so if this don't enhance my buzz
And the fans die and my blood, the world is ran by thugs
That just want to bend my blood that runs with an angel flow
What they bleed ought to be equality, never been the angle though
But one day soon I want to see the people loving then say ""Bravo""
'Cause now I see a lot of killing and fighting like Rocky and Ivan Drago
All good to be in Cabo, I'm rolling in your Murcielago

Wishing we could be rid of all terrorism
Like it's theorism, for the good I'd say heroism
We are the dauntless and miss the demons we see in swarms
So mind your business unless you see somebody being harmed
I learned to love from my mother
I feel an angel around me, I know she hovers
Impatiently waiting for you to discover that people all need each other
When you see me, I'll call you brother
Never mattered whatever color

Hey, now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up!
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit - get the fuck out!
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit - get the fuck out!
For those who love raw shit - welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is - Tech N9ne!

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
This is style I use pitch, to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick, mellow tone is what you spit
Switchin the pattern, bust out that quick midwest chatter
Some people hate but it ain't matterin, but the people gather, it's flatterin
Switchin the pitch, mixin, there's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin full clips on a mission for bliss when I be rippin this shit
Make it excitin, got to be invitin when you're writin your piece
Never be dick ridin, if you're goin to be bitin, you're ignitin the beast
This is melodic, melodies, if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales, you singin off-key is garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction, don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin motherfuckers in music, that's how we do it!

[Chorus]
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
Such an oddity with it, this is Sickology
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)

From our west coast instructor - Crooked I (Crooked I ...)

[Verse 2 - Crooked I]
My killer Daytons can keep me crushin the competition
Comin correct when creatin the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier, got a crooked copper missin
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty - if I'm thirst-ay!
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm puttin swag in my style (in my style)
It's a emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, this song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire

[Chorus]

From our east coast instructor - Chino XL

[Verse 3 - Chino XL]
Everybody start lockin their windows and doors, Chino might get in
It's like light-ning, how I'm strikin a triflin rifleman
Bullets flyin up and I'm numbin the bum, like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine, he could get rich from the recycling! (yeah!)
Chino be curdlin blood, don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction, like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me yo
I'd rather hear Hannah Montana, than half of you rappers on the radio!
Startin drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
With a sick delivery, like I drive a coroner van (damn)
I'm demented, spittin writtens as sick as I can
Grenade grippin, fittin to detonate Disneyland
I am teachin Sickology, try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

[Chorus]

Yes I got to be vicious, this is Sickology

Because Aaron is scaring these glitz spitting pricks in the game
Hit with this gift, everybody get a whiff of this script and it's pain
Gotta talk about the people with a attitude
Hiss me and slipped in my lane
I've been wrecking crowds for a long second now
Got 'em guessing how tech is blessed
And yes, the best in-town rep
On the real, I keep it trill
And when I spit, I ain't spilling about my million
It's the feeling that you get with this underground headliner
Mainstream ignored a bro
And they be petty, so jealousy is sure to show
But they rich and got more to blow
And everything's affordable

I just wanted to have a bite with her, or something
Didn't go get up on that show to fight with her, or nothing
It was Keyshia Cole, Eric Benã, Gorilla Zoe, Tech N9ne and T.I.
But Keyshia was acting bia-bia
Why she acting like a (what?), like a (what?)
She ain't know I grab the mic and light it (up), light it (up)
She say, ""she don't know me""
But I'm the number one independent in the country
Man, she the only one acting funky
And the people at the summer jam, they want me
She say, ""she ain't goin on before somebody that's local""
And she went postal and loco
Saying, ""her not closing, is a no-go""
Down talked me real low though
About how she got more doe and just did a tv promo
No show better than the mo. bro with the s & m logo
Damn baby, much success is sitting in your favor
Slam the n9na tech before considering the data
Fans waited, so we went, so she'd get it for later
But frankie said, ""excuse my daughter, she's a bit of a hater""
Damn!

Hey, hey, check it
I understand senor already
But in this case, on this show, I'm a top priority
In Lawrence, your minority and I'm the majority
Check it, I was young and broke
But I'd fetch it, if it was freshest
Shelf the store for the Eric B. and Rakim record
Promoters called us and said,
""We got this show and want you to close us""
Ghostface and brother Ali rocking with a band in 'sota
We couldn't wait to see Rakim rock
But he never ever showed up
He swole up cause he didn't wanna go up before us
Man, what's wrong with these people?
Think that the world gotta kiss their asses
Five hundred capacity but you wanna get two hundred passes
Thought it was about gouda
Forty water told me,
""N9na, get ya cabbage, stay savage and ravage the average""
Y'all better hope radio and video
Keep me from slithering, into they circle
I'll change it, that's why they shivering
Rakim the god? he just miss the king's delivering
'Cause they know they'll fall
And I'll blow them all to smithereens

Got my big dick in her cavities then it's spit spit I'm in anatomy
And ya can't come badgin' me 'cause sick wanna insert half of me

Yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack
I'm a beast, better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
Me wanna get dollars
Don't wanna holler but you makin' me
I'm a little dysfunctional
You're the problem, please don't awaken me
And I'm that way cause back in
The day most have forsaken me
La-di-da-di, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk, might dude
Wanna pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be, cause he
Sloppy, not me, costly rocks be spot free
But he don't know I'm roguish
Surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded
Will explode if you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo
Listen, they call me genius, I run the show
Woman be on my penis, it's wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the floor
Little bit sick, don't you know?

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
You could fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

Born to hustle, I'm a product of environment
The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose, then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but can’t get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push to play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
You could fool around and make me mad

I ain't no killer but don't push me
Goody-goody choir boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoody
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me
Tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses, probably be fine
But if you get too close you'll find out that I

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?

Your first lesson given to you by (Mr. Smith!)
KC MO stand up, young niggas represent

Ey, ask me what I wanna be when I grow up, I ain't just gonna blow up
I'm a star I got astronomers tryin' to get a close up
Telescopes and cameras, rappers wanna use glamors
But I'm gleamin' from the planets, homie, mine is called Kansas City
The cloud in my pocket's gotta rain on 'em
Such a star I saw Heaven's walls and wrote my name on 'em
So comfortable at the top I hopped on a plane and claimed Everest
You might as well say the boy is Himalayan
I rent my rooms on the moon, Mr. Smith is comin' soon
The angels feedin' me cereal with a silver spoon
My hair line is Craig Smith Airlines
A ride from Kansas City to LA is as long as a fan line
I'm high as '08 gas prices, my votes are
Twice as high as Obama's and I ain't gotta ask nice
I'm high as Tech's tour bus, the light skinned one
So if you're lookin' for me dog look up and try to find the sun

[Chorus: x2]
I'm in the air
High in the air

KC, Nesto!

Yeah, don't mean to brag but I froze my piece
And I'm gettin' higher then a nose bleed seat
Don't bring her to my session, if your ho sees me
She'll drop dead in the studio like ODB
Yeah, it's the owner and I'm very cool
Plus this weed keep me higher than an air balloon
Copy cat, like what I'm wearing dude?
I'm so fly, I walk around with a parachute
And even rappers lie too
But I'm the only human with an astronaut suit
See yo entire verse? Say that your iron squirt
When you only shootin' in the air like fireworks (Pussy)
If suckers still on that hatin' shit
I'll stuff 'em in a bag like potato chips
I'll bend they ass up like a paper clip
Tech, sign me and see how quick your paper flip

[Chorus: x2]

I ain't gotta introduce myself, y'all know what it is

Why call me underground when I rock the stars?
And even they can't see me with a pair of binoculars
My hip-hoppin' gave a good side swipe to Mars
One-Third an extinction hit, which left the limelight Ajar
You want your scripts to fly, not in my solar system
Cause I'll dismiss 'em like they wished to die
Mack mother-nature and I ripped her, why?
Civilian ladies love me, so bro, excuse her while she kiss the sky
Call me master more exalted than a priest, a pastor
Blasphemy have me blast fags fast with Magma
In the air like Dancer and Dasher
High in the sky, above all mountains off in Alaska
Higher than a million heroin hits if it'll last ya
Super-Celestial when everyone's stuck off in the pasture
The wack, I will cast ya down, below those who get caught up in my Rapture
Don't be callin' me ""dog"" cause I want you to say it backwards

[Chorus: x4]

Your first lesson for today man
That was it, Sickology 101

Let me in the door
You keep sayin' you hear me knockin'
What you standin' there for?
Who I gotta kill or sleep with?
Cause I'm the worlds best secret
Let me in the door
You keep sayin' you hear me knockin'
What you standin' there for?
Cause I'm the one that do that music you feel
But you still review this
Let me in the door

Right now before my goons have to tear it town
We don't wait in line and we don't stand around
We at Club Zen and drinkin', actin' brand new
Actin' like he never seen my face and I ain't got loot
They know I'm Cash Image and I'm with Tech N9ne
And before the club close, The owner gon' respect mine
Spend a lot of money and that's the bottom line
Ten cars on chrome, Plus the neck shine
Baggy jeans on and J's with a lot of bucks
And you ain't gotta know me
You could tell my dollars' up
Poppin' collars in the club, turnin' bottles up
And all the models in the club wanna follow us
It's Mr. Chevy Man, You hear my song playin'
And every time we in the club
We be spending grand's
First deny Tech then deny me
And I was number one on 103 for forty weeks

[Chorus]

You say you hear me knockin'
So why you don't wanna let me in?
But I ain't buggin', So tell the cops to come and get me then
Complain about my shoes, ain't really talkin' 'bout shit
Dude, I spent like three hundred and fifty on this outfit
NV ain't gon' let me in, zen actin' funny with me
What it's gon' cost me, homie?
I brought a little money with me
I don't wear tight shirts, my pants kinda baggy
KC hat tilted, so now they wanna red flag me
I'm by the bar every time, point blank, Period
The door man hatin', takin' his job too serious
Me, Cash Image, Tech and Kaliko about big business
So what I'm talkin to a bouncer for?
The woman see me, Scream my name like announcers, bro
They actin' brand new this week
So I'm about to go to the block and bubble and get plenty cake
I just wanted woman and I don't like this club anyway
So fuck y'all!

[Chorus]

I get money from music, Kinda like to spend-spend
When I hit the town, I know they gonna let me ends in
But these other clubs be trippin' like I begin sin
You hear me knockin'? (Oh yeah)
Well let me in then
Cause NV ain't so friendly
They got a gay assembly of femmes
Who think the blacks be packin' Semi's
(That's why they don't sell no Henny)
Stink butts who think bucks
But they don't know my bank account is like a Brinks truck
Could buy it any day
Two poin one on a new building and lease 'em and the N9ne has plenty say
The rhyme, it give me pay
So I resign cause NV gay
And plus NV stands for no vagina's anyway
That place, Me and Lil' Weezy-Wee get no love
That's why when I brought Chingy in there
He peed in your club, not in the toilet either
You don't enjoy the beaver
You'd rather plot on how to get below your boy, The Peter
America's Club and Fase 2, I erase you
My pants are too baggy even though I'm clean and I'm paid too
Orlando South's racist, they treated me cold
And Lucky Strike and Power & Light won't let the N9ne in to bowl
Whoa, guess my Dickies the wrong clothes
Play my music but won't let me and my homies through the doors
Over a million records sold, Lot's of money to fold
They should let me in any club in KC, MO!
And I'm the biggest tipper, bartenders know me well
And waitress's love me, so club owners go to hell!
You got that blow to sell but you want this bro to fail
But it really ain't me 'cause it is your destiny to go to jail
And when you're though servin
You might see work on Club N9ne
When you walk up, you might be hurt
You might skeet-skirt cause you ain't gettin' in
If you ain't got KC hat and a white t-shirt, aye!

Sold pieces for my reli, chasing peso
Now they want me with nothing cause I let my pay show
So I hop inside of my Mercedes and let the bass go
On you hating ass niggas
I deserve everything I get, A creating cash getter
I ain't putting the 2 on the 10
I'm making vast figures
You fags bitter, mad
Wanna be faking class with us
How they thinking they gonna come and conquer us?

Ponder such, I'll have you up in yonder, stuck
Not a nare nutta brother stutter that conjure a,
Nothing, nothing, The Ruger's penetration
Inside of ya head is what's sounding like it's bassing
Boom, Bing, Bang

Ain't a damn thing sane, I get it in
Want some drama? Well I can fit it in
We can make it so you're no longer a citizen
Suction from beneath you

All because I'm bringing the bucks in

Then one night, We came up with Vill

Young thugs jumped blood
Nigga itching for kills

This shit was too real
Lost my homies to this shit, man
This shit is for real

They go hard on the hustler
All these pussy niggas lacking
So us real niggaz suffer
Not plentiful for me no more

Pour some whiskey, Party with me
Tell the Feds if they miss me

Talk with bananas and talk clips
Ride around and smoke kush with the yurner on me
Drink them champagne bottles with the flower on 'em
All that talking loud will get a nigga a hit
You see them cherry red chucks?
Yeah, I'm with the shit
Anyway I bounce out, man
I hit 'em up and I'll lock up with you

Already popping I'm running late, but just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at Wal-Mart and bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter, my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy's about to get cooked, rather chicken filleted
Found me a victim, we made our way through the kitchen escape
Into the garage and the lip massages was about to began
Lethargically sucking, hardly fucking with Pinky to me
So I told the slut to hike up her butt and let Kutt intervene
All in her guts in between, the Benz and the bucket and screamed
""Nigga you're fucking my whole lining up with my husband to be
Drowning too much and if he-"" shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout on her butt with relief

Man fire up the weed, whenever you please, best believe
That you got the green light, the special guest is me
And we've, been drinking and smoking all night
It's time to find a ho to be stroking my pipe
A bitch quickly grabbed my dick and asked why it was so soft
I said that it wouldn't go off, she gave it a quick blow off
And she did and me dick start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise and
Her thighs was moist, it was my choice to go up in it
For a minute put my dick up in it, she said it was splendid
She usually charge niggas, they like to rent it

Back in the day I had to pay but now everybody say hey!
You lookin good bro, you makin good dough
I be like yo you didn't know? they say

Oh
And 3 more didn't know saying

Oh oh oh there they go there go they like oh
Now 3 hoes want to go like

Oh your girl be like oh oh oh
Now I got it for the night screaming oh

They didn't know I sell out shows in Amsterdam
And in Switzerland
Tecca Ninna spits for grands
She really dont know she about to ditch her man
And give her pants to me cuz this her jam
Damn
Tecca Ninas everywhere keep it necessary to
Steer very clear
If he dare to stare and glare that's very fair
Be drinking, Be merry
Where the ladies with the dairy air?
More black women pooping up at my shows
Like Tyler Perry there
Oh
And they didn't know I won an MTV award?
New York yelling for me like they've seen me before
They know that underground clown come so sick and dark
But they didn't know they'd see the N9ne on 106 & Park
I'm kixin it and the foes can not stop
No hoes can cock block it
My clothes in Hot Topic
They froze when I pop it
I glow in the MO
Throwing the dough
Oh you didn't know?
They say

[Chorus]

Hey yo we kixin it like a Friday night
Even though it's a Thursday
Eyes on us when we stepping out on the curb free
Chickens want the business giggling
Acting flirty
Little momma swallowed all of her vodka
She still thirsty
Probably because shes got something that's mixed in her hand
Straight to the sipper
Or maybe
It's because the reason I got my hands on you
Dancing like a stripper
We super cold head to toe
We sharp as a machete
We the hottest show in KCMO
The new Malcom & Eddie yeah
It's me and Big Yates
He know my spits ate
Shit so sick he got me spitting on The Mixed Plate
Like a disgruntled employee who just quick Gates
You read the front of the fitted homie and it's
KC
Ask who the president and they are going to
Say
Me
And now I'm rocking with the king (TECH N9NE!)
So every time we hit the clubs like a movie scene
Filling them women with their cups with Kansas City Tea
PHENOM!

[Chorus]

That's the noise you make you lady do
Fresh hypemen had me on the turn tables in 82'
Sleeping with women and popping bottles
While he was eating baby food
Murdering raps and spitting facts
Something I was made to do
See I raised a few eyebrows when I started up
Veteran Click gave me worldwide we was hard to touch
Ya'll can start the fuss
And I'm going to close you down
Popping you dick licker
Only when there is hoes around
Oh
That's what your girl be like
Killer city will show what that world be like
My world be tight
But my flows be sicker
Behind the counter and cut you
At that Paul's Liquor
I'm a show me nigga
I rep for the land
I got kool aid pumping through your man's heart
I've been marked
And respect the niggas who've been whacked
Fuck with Tech and Irv at the club and spin racks

Tech: Shut up nigga you ain't Tony G
Craig: Hahahaha, check it out, uh

Its a hard knock jaw drop life for me
Last year I was in front of mic's for free
Now I'm winning its nice to see
Because if you ever tried to make it out of here, you would know its all bull
And I'mma show them how to steer with it
Had a clear vision head light deer sittin'
Thought it would be easy because Craig's got a clear image
Gotta shift out of gear LeBron James
They know that I'm a king but I remain in the cavalier
I was a rolling stone and now I'm sky-scrapping
I'm hella dope they high from songs im making
Like a Jamaican and I can BUCK BUCK
What was y'all thinking I'm hot for no reason
Summer summer time James lemonade
I'm in season and springing into the rain
You don't wanna get wet in it
I stepped in it
And got respect
And now I ask Tech what's next

I got my duffel bag, my swag and my A.M.X
I got my girlie all done up for some S.E.X
I got my heat under the seat in case them fools they flex
I'm taking trips over seas, tell me what is next

Ay yo whats next up on the menu
What show? A different venue
When you thought that it was over no sir its to be continued
Too many people know you
Too many bitches on you
So you ditching on the exact same thing you want to go to
From the outside looking in
They don't be understanding
Because from every fan that loves you thats an inch away from family
My name is Obergeek but you refer to me as Grammy
It's just pre-mental planning maybe you will understand me
Started as a local, haha
Now I'm on the vocals lala
The time it took to do this shit was kinda loco
I know
Put me on the beat then I flow
I'm fuckin' with green because I go
Seems like I speed through obstacles like my life's on nitro
I see the light posts I'm speeding through the night glow
My miles per hour says I should be insured for Geico
I took a stop at Ollie Gate
As as soon as I stepped up in the place
He asked me what is on my plate
I said I got

[Chorus]

I'm tryin' to make it so the whole world can hear that
Real raw and severe rap
Television showing how humongous my career's at
Me popping bottles when the enemies watching poppin' beer caps
They feel severe slaps from here clear to Iraq
I'll near trap but this here's cracked
And I get them chicks with their boobies lifted and rears fat
What me and Travis doing every year after year stacked
Then we off in the Bahamas where the peers at cheers cat
And we don't fear packs cause we standing near straps
Come to me with that queer crap you'll get your vaneers cracked
Yeah I might be a weird brat
But I get them tears from your dear 
That'll have her speared in the lair when her brazier snaps
Watch who you sneer at
Because if we see a rat he's smeared flat
He's about to feel snakes and hear bats
So whats next is a mere splat
On her face because the P was shear wack, haha

I'm living like a rockstar (Living like a rockstar)
I'm going to places everywhere you are (Where you are)
I do it just like what you wish that you could truly be (Truly be)

Tech N9ne Collabos,"(You know that there are billions of stars in the universe)
But the star had quite a difficult time shining amongst all the other stars
The year was 1994 when the star began his descent, 
And continued falling, and falling
Landing in an unknown place the star creates followers from underground
On the quest to shoot beyond the stars once again
The star begins in, Strangeland

Ground zero, ground hero
But ain't nobody ever heard the sound before, I found me so
Competitive I never get the credit beginning when it was clown and Lejo
Now we pro, the brown people
Was on it for the moment but they frowned at me fo'
Layin' what I sayin' didn't sound negro
Now people 'round me low down when the beat go
Never will I ever stop or quit what I'm doing
I'm getting better even cleverer
Rockin it then I ruin every competitor
We at em poppin' shit, I be chewing up

Speed bandits coming for ya

We've landed, the stars have fallen from the heavens
Their thoughts will reign on this planet
The arts been painted on the canvas, your helpless
We've landed, the hearts of fans have been branded
The dawn of 6's and 7's, is the start of musical madness
We've landed

Shootin' for the stars, rootin' for the cause
Whos inducing puke and hooting for the bars
You get stupid groups of loose and juicin'
You for true but you recruit the youth ignore bizarre niggas

You dont wanna fuck with the murderous gorilla
War till the lord hit a scar nigga what
Bitch I'm at the bottom and I'm comin' to get at ya
Better get up in ya column
And I'm gonna diminish you, when I spit I really got em
Right in front of me timid, and I want a percentage
Cause I fought for everything I got it was not handed
And nobody fed a nigga nothin when I was famished
I'm bussin for life but not for nathin but god damnit
Notice something beautiful just landed

[Chorus]

I've landed six feet under six feet
Where every other ordinary people can't sleep
The badness, we had this back back in high school classes
Ya dealing with three faces of madness
Never been average with the image of a savage
At the very bottom I'm living under the maggots
But I'm bout to shoot em and really wake up the masses
Gas it an blast it have the upper class raking ashes
Upper class rappers, sucker ass packers
A rougher tougher mothafucker spaz backwards
Kcuf Natas gutter mad slacker

And they say everybody, nigga, even Tech do
Now we gotta explain our journey to the Ces Cru

I'm on a pilgrimage to the rhyme Mecca, because I'm Tecca
And this mind left ya, down at the bottom because N9ne's better
And if swines ever find the quest to try and test the cleverness
They in a mess bind and yes I sever decay 'em and define pressure

Turn out we the perfect strangers, Larry Appleton and Balki
I was out east, when the text came in
With Tech sayin' what is 'bout to be
Before you fuck me on the dough, know that everybody 'round lookin' out for me
Now that we got that in the air, I can feel the change in the atmosphere

I can still remember, it was January twenty-third, 1994
And a group of us was chilling at the table
We was drinking with our fingers on the ouija board
Tryna summon spirits asking ""ouija, can you hear us?""
Never thinking what was in store
Then the dogs started barking, in the darkness
All of a sudden it was knocking at the front door
Then we started approaching, cautious as hell as we pulled the door open
Nervous adrenaline, seeming slow motion
No one was there, we went back to the board hoping
That we finally made contact, with the deity
Apparition on the other side
Then it started moving out and soon it was
Spelling out the warning in the morning one of us would die
We decided to stop it, said our goodbyes, and left the apartment
On the way home sarah hit a patch of ice
Lost control of her car, hit the ditch and lost her life

And got the foreplay feeling fengshui
All gas baby tell 'em over haul that
And I be digging real good in the morning
Text to your girls that booty fire
She'll be reminiscing thinking that she love me
Forgetting every nigga that she been with prior
What is it? Make her feel this way
What is it? Tell her climb on me
What is it? Let her ride that weed
Baby had a very long D
I told her she could get it in time if she ready
She wanted stimulation and I'm trying to break the levy

Heaven opened on June 6th mama's on the first day smoking
So many emotions
Sipping on my potion, choking, black slime's taken over my body
So much it will contaminate the ocean (I'm not joking)
Get 'em up, wanna bust, with enough of anguish
I'ma clutch and he trust when he touch, my name is so famous
I'm adjusting a bunch of stuff, my brain it grows heinous
And I'm loving that rough and tough and tainted, so dangerous
People piling in to peep it
So many step inside to see the secrets
Really I'm a rabble-rousing reverend
Writing in reefer, risen and rippin' a wretched rhyme, release it
Blood in my mucus, turn it into mud I should've gotten the lupus
That bug is intrusive, what the government uses
To turn love into nooses, and shoving a big drug in your juices
Wondering if I'ma bust and light this llama up
If I'm the number synonymous with anonymous
The drama just equal Osama nuts
You crazy, that's why they honor us, listen to it
I am not professin' to be the highest in heaven
So I say with no discretion, this is a K-O-D session
So if any wanna question, you pro'lly should get to steppin'

I'm taking out the pain and times the Nina grieves
And putting it to music, now you heard to leave
For your spirits I covet, that doesn't say ""Devil worshipper"", does it?
Good and evil, I got ooze and oodles of it
And I got so many more followers comin' and I love it

Sick emcees presented by tecca neez
Check it out

Ain't nobody busting like the nigga with a gun up in the middle of the west
I be the killa with a tec and I'ma villain with a vest
I gotta fill 'em with effects then I get it out the way
So I can say what I wanna say
Right over the track singing like the father of nona gaye
Let's get it on they love it when tech spit a song way rugged
And check niggas on they grudges then death
Shitted on they buzzes
That was just the intros for the family with sin souls
But the gandys with the fem flows
Can't stand me like ten toes
I rock it, making my female fans freaking faucets
Putting me up against hop is thoughtless
Not supposed to press partners, stop it
Can't compete compare crotches, cockless
Taking tech is too toxic, toss it
Never will the bosses take losses
Study cautiousness off this shit
'Cause some fans are antagonistic, naggin' bitches
Raggin' like a stabbin' happened
When I'm havin' hits, get vast than sick shit
Like I ain't vlad and vicious bad and twisted
Keep it jabbing fisted, trav insisted
So I frown scarier when the clown buries a nigga down to the ground
But the crown carrier get the hound out the mound and they’re bound
Marry 'em all together is how we breaking the sound barrier
I'm three-dimensional, we invincible
You saying I'm over, you never see the principle
My seed is meant to grow rapid, I'm the classical rap shit on acid
Bastards! (hurl bars)
Never will niggas be able to gimme the trash it, jack it

How in the fuck am I ripping and reaching the masses?
Asses, faggots, too many back splashes
Then a wack black chat hatches cause you napped at rap classes
They making a mockery of my painted face
But me, I resemble our ancestors
And these niggas talking stuck at a fainted pace
Still not realizing this man blessed ya
I am so clever, my friends adore me they banging yates
Your rhyme is no measure to him, you bore me, gay flaming fakes
Find him more cheddar, my end's for me stay gaining great
'Cause I am forever like em, forty, jay, wayne and drake
Pure art, I'm the shit and nigga, you're farts
How they gonna challenge the tecca nina
When your flow's softer than a velour scarf
Blowing this track into pieces, I'm leaving you fewer parts
At this moment I am laying as dead as before my 2.0 tour starts
Ain't packed shit yet, this how your taint rap hits best
Tecca nina ain't plastic, my bank's drastic, you can't match his checks
Lot of gore in the flow, and i’m born to go
Got your whore in the door, taking your chick
'Cause a nigga been up in the forbes list now four in a row
My religion is followed by little kids, college kids
Metalheads, hip hop heads, the rips and soo-woos
Your religion is tainted by money grubbing
Funny hugging, chummy loving grown men that like to do youths
So I stick with my technicians, no f's given, yeah

Guess time'll tell (guess time'll tell, guess time'll tell)

Right hand over my heart of hearts I'm pledging allegiance
To ces, for whatever the reasons I have withered the seasons
They're dead in the breeze, I'm ready to feed 'em
I never believed 'em, you son of a bitch, son of a preacher, word of
Heaven and jesus, two seven and greaser, separation is still
And spreading diseases, my recommendation is cheddar your cheeses
Maybe you better get business, like I didn't know that I carried the load
I know your boy is heavy and heaving
That's word to strange and tech the n9ne, I mean, who better to lead us
Since I been with that team I been spinning them g's
Bitch, yeah, you better believe it, cash come in a bulk amount now
I'm staying ahead of my dreams so the fuck could I sulk about
For real, I'll never be satisfied still, I don't be vocal out loud
Respect is due, I show it, don't blow it, my records are outbound
Chill, I'm choosing my weapons wisely, we never will lose direction
Guide 'em through the recession proof, should include a confession, truth
Started from the bikini bottom, we're here but it's something fishy
Twenty sixteen, strange music, making some fucking history

I know they want me to put up the pen
And just quit with the rapping, it won't never happen, no
For the minutes that I been in it
I'm a killer still in the back but I'm clapping though
In a matter of fact I been acting, so
Out of wack and my brain is on overload
I don't call anybody, ain't nobody calling me
Maybe I don't need a phone no mo'
Guess I won’t pay the bill and the villain is
spillin' venom in him till i’m a goner
And haters are catering to me with
Wishes that I wouldn't win any longer
Idiot, you're just making me stronger
Wanna kill me, then pay me no mind
Get a record to spot a bit longer
If you don't feel me then get on your grind
I don't mean to be mean but the measure
Is simple when you try to weather the outcome
Now I don't need a reason, killing any season
In fact I am better without one
You don't know anything about heat or the
Temp of the weather that I'm coming out from
And I wouldn't consider you equal like other people
Where the fuck is your album?
Shit to you is a hobby and obviously y'all
Ain't knowing to measure at all
Murdering it for pleasure, ain't fucking with godi
I'm sick with a medicine ball

But you're feeling like a fucking millionaire
And can I get a hell yea?

Keep your eyes on the prize, don't share
Cuz we bout to take the crown this year

Second batter up, I never had a fuck
To give, if I did, shit, you was out of luck
I'm laser focused with mine like Scott Summers is
The Cyclops, X-Men, for you dumber kids
I read them funny books, they got the pictures in them
Still pull the thickest chick in the sickest denim
Then I spit this venom, like Eddie Brock does
Had the crowd raising eyebrows like The Rock does
Blood, Cuhs, it's all in the same gang
Just brothers in different colors, we need to change things
And this is Strange gang, talking 'bout my chain again
Mine's fine, I got it shined by my Asian friend
At the swap meet in the wrong hood
I'm the bad member but still make the song good
Good enough they had to sign me, better ask Trav
I'm fucking with these strong genetics like I'm in the lab

Gun is out, everybody running out
Hearing people scream and shout (""OH MY GOD HE'S GOT A GUN!!"")
'Cause they run their mouth, 
they throwing this tongue about like having some candy clout (It's negros, we better run)
He'on't want (he'ont want it)
He'on't need it (he'on't need it)
If they try to put a case on this, we gon' beat it (we gon' beat it)
Interrupted a groovy movie, so we said fuck it left it and ate at Ruby Tuesday's
Snotty white waitress said sorry, I'm so blunt
One of the homies singing YG's ""Fuck Donald Trump""
And she said ""Fuck Obama""
And we said ""Fuck yo mama""
And your granny too, 'cause we would never touch your nana, bitch
Manager say we gotta leave
Not before I get a shot, I get it then I appease
And he said ""No""
So I got somebody shot off the bar quick, lifted it up and said 
""Here's to you sucking my dick""

Walk up in the party with our guns drawn

Techneic,"And now, our national anthem!
It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uh

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets

You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin rich

What?

You ever fuck around on me?

Why would I do that?

Yo don't lie to me motherfucker

Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me

One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin die together

Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your ass fuckin around

I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes

Yo, don't don't play with my dick

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger (yeah)
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major (yeah)
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me 
(uh, yeah)
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch

Dayton off the ground laying, like ""Whoa!""
I coast through your blocks slow
I`m H20, boy I got that wet flow
To douse your flame, I`ll get that up out ya man
You plot, I`m sorry I shot ya man
See me whippin on the freeway, the LBC way
On the three-way with ?J-Wide? and pack
Hell yea, I`m riding with Mack",Tha Weekend,2000
Techniec,"And now, our national anthem!
It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uh

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman

Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it
It's like magic, it's so tragic
The West Coast, Hoo-Banging, Westside Connection, L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, and you know about the infamous D.P.G.s
We make them freeze to their knees, real Gs

Technotronic,"Fellas, I'm ready to get up and do my thing
I wanta get into it, man, you know...
Like a, like a sex machine, man,
Movin'... doin' it, you know
Can I count it off? (Go anead)

One,two, three, four!!

Get up, get on up
Get up, get on up
Stay on the scene, like a sex machine

Wait a minute!
Shake your arm, then use your form
Stay on the scene like a sex machine
You got to have the feeling sure as you're born
Get it together right on, right on

Get up. get on up

I said the feeling you got to get
Give me the fever in a cold sweat
The way I like it is the way it is
I got mine and don't worry 'bout his

Get on up and then shake your money maker
Shake your money maker...",Megamix,2012
