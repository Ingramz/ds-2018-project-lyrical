Earl Scruggs,"Well I have stood upon the mountain
I have seen the other side
Wrestled with the devil
I have wrestled with my pride

Been down in the valley
I have stood out in the rain
Seen my love forsaken
Felt the pleasure and the pain

There's one thing that's for certain
One chord that rings true
Well it's a mighty world we live in
But the truth is we're only passin' thru

I have cried in tears of sadness
I have cried in tears of joy
I have found a life worth livin'
From the peace within the noise

I have turned my back on hatred
Lyin', prejudice, and greed
Found the future in the present
Found hope within a seed

One thing that's for certain
One chord that rings true
It's a mighty world we live in
But the truth is we're only passin' thru

Passin' thru, passin' thru
It's a mighty world we live in but the truth is
We're only passin' thru

I have seen my bucket empty
Seen my well run dry
But there's water down the road
And I'm only goin' by

If I'm settin' on dead-ready
When my chances come to knock
I'll make it where I'm goin'
I'll be tall just like a rock

But there's one thing that's for certain
One chord that rings true
It's a wicked world we live in
But the truth is we're only passin' thru

Passin' thru, passin' thru
It's a mighty world we live in but the truth is
We're only passin' thru

Yeah, it's a mighty world we live in but the truth is
We're only passin' thru",Passin' Thru,2001
Earl Scruggs,"The last time I thought about leavin'
Was the last time I made her cry
I talked myself out of believin'
That true, true love never dies

The first time I
Thought of returnin'
Was just ten lonesome
Miles out of town

But my foolish pride
Kept these wheels a-turnin'
Yeah, there was nothin'
On this earth gonna shut me down

But if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies

Well, the fires of anger turn to ashes
Your pride will forsake you, by and by
The lonesome is not surely passin'
That ol' true, true love never dies

Well, if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
No, it never does

Well, if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
Well, I'd sail back to her
On an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies

Well, I'd sail back to her
On an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
Oh, it never dies, no, it never does
No, no, no

True, true love
True, true love
True, true love",True Love Never Dies,2001
Earl Scruggs,"Standin' on the corner with the low down blues
Is a great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
Honey, let me be your Salty Dog

Let me be your Salty Dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey, let me be your Salty Dog

Looking here Sal, I know you
Run down stockin' and a worn out shoe
Honey, let me be your Salty Dog

Let me be your Salty Dog
Or I won't be your man at all

",When the Saints Go Marching In,2002
Earl Scruggs,"We saw houses falling from the sky 
Where the mountains lean down to the sand 
We saw blackbirds circling 'round an old castle keep 
And I stood on the cliff and held your hand

We walked troubles brooding wind swept hills 
And we loved and we laughed the pain away 
At the end of the journey, when our last song is sung 
Will you meet me in Heaven someday

Can't be sure of how's it's going to be 
When we walk into the light across the bar 
But I'll know you and you'll know me 
Out there beyond the stars

We've seen the secret things revealed by God 
And we heard what the angels had to say 
Should you go first, or if you follow me 
Will you meet me in Heaven someday
 
Living in a mansion on the streets of gold 
At the corner of Grace and Rapture Way 
And sweet ecstasy while the ages roll 
Will you meet me in Heaven someday

In sweet ecstasy while the ages roll 
Will you meet in Heaven someday",Meet Me in Heaven,2002

I've tried and tried so many times
I'm leavin' you now, goodbye.

I'm ridin' on that midnight train
My head's a-hangin' low

In love with another man.

The rain a-pourin' down,
Heard my mammy say to my pappy,
""Let's call him John Henry Brown.""

Walk on, boy; walk on down the road;
Ain't nobody in this whole wide world
A-gonna help you carry your load.

Just about the age of ten;
Lord, I got me a job a-workin' on the levee
Totin' water for the hard workin' men.

""Some advice I wanna give to you 
Son, find a good woman, be good to her,
An' she's gonna be good to you.""

Where he beat that steam drill down.

Shake their shoulders bold.

We load our music up on the run

Heavy traffic ahead, heavy traffic ahead
We got to ramble ramble there's heavy traffic ahead

We pull out of Nashville right on time
The Blue Grass special heads down the line

As long as the sun goes up and comes down

I tried to sail the sea of life, I rowed my boat alone
Your love meant nothing to me dear my heart was made of stone
To a harbor filled with loneliness my little boat was moored

For the way that you've were treating me
So I rambled all around and nothing could be found
To take the place of her in Tennessee

Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee

Oh, someday I'll wander back to that little cabin shack
Little girl that's waiting there for me
I can see her smiling face waiting for me at the gate
Oh, the little girl of mine in Tennessee

Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee

Summer journeys to Niag'ra
And to other places aggra-
vate all our cares.
We'll save our fares;

I've a cozy little flat in
What is known as old Manhattan,
We'll settle down
Right here in town.

CHORUS 1

We'll have Manhattan,
The Bronx and Staten
Island too.
It's lovely going through the Zoo.

It's very fancy
On old Delancey
Street you know.
The subway charms us so,
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro.

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by.

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 2

We'll go to Greenwich,
Where modern men itch
To be free,
And Bowling Green you'll see with me.

We'll bathe at Brighton,
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in,
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin,

Fin to fin.

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica
Bay with you,
And fair Canarsie's Lakes we'll view.

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 3

We'll go to Yonkers,
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear, in Childs'.

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny
On a roll,
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole,
Soul to soul.

And South Pacific
Is a terrific
Show they say,
We both may see it close some day.

The city's clamour can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

Will be a great success,
More or less.

Point we'll spend,
And in the station house we'll end.

Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw, that it hurt you, more than it hurt me
I thought how bad could this hurt be? I know now
That's why it's only done out of love

But that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother, makin a lot of trips out of town
But that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing
Once more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)

You left behind a mother (and) eleven kids (and) eleven grandkids
And since then, two of yo' grandkids done had kids
They had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother, that's right
Xavier's made you a great grandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her, accepted and lovin' my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my life, I thank you for the bible
I thank you for the songs that you sing in the mornin'
(Amazing Grace) while I'm yawnin'
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
Cause I know somewhere along the line
The lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life like everything comes to an end
I pray I go to heaven to see you again - amen

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')

That saved a wretch like me

Was blind, but now I see, yeah",I Miss You,2001

You never give us more than we can handle But it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual But I need you, God

I know I'm gonna speak the word for you one day

And for my life the blessings that you have saved me
And for my wife
You have carried me enough times and that's the truth
Carried me through the rough times throughout my youth
And through it that I saw you was still wit me
I was that one lost sheep and you was comin' to get me

And I always loved my people but now they love me
Thank you for the love, Lord, we praise ya
Jacob, ascendants, from Africa to Asia
Bleeding the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout your name in times of need
And times of joy and when we bleed
And when we are overcome with grief
You don't have to tell me twice; I'm a take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I never knew I had 
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad, 
All praise is due to ya, that's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya,

Uh I never knew a love like this before
Messin' with the Thug Life, I missed it all
Open up the doors and let me in 
I'm done wit the cards so let's begin
Prayers that you give to me, I give to them
Same way you live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now you got me smiling
From inside of my heart when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain any more only sunshine
No pain anymore.... I really love mine
You wash away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, in thirty years
You know that
One day I'll speak the word
You know that!
When I do, I will be hear
You know that!
You have me a permanent smile

Let us pray
Father God I am just learning how to pray, so bear with me
First I thank you for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank you for the love you give me, why?
I don't know; I don't deserve it, and it hurts inside
Many a nights I cried, and called your name out loud
But didn't call you when I was doin good, I was too proud
And STILL you gave me love, I wasn't used to that
Most of the people that gave me love, they ended up takin it back
That's somethin new to me, so I'm askin you for time to adjust
Let me make it there, I will be one you can trust
What I stand for, I put my life on, I DO!
I guess what I'm askin is - show me how to stand for you
And I will RAP for you, SING for you, PREACH for you, TEACH for you
REACH for you - I will love you like you love me, unconditionally
And I will ALWAYS be prepared, for whatever the mission'll be
GIVE THE NUTRITION TO ME, and I'll properly digest it
And when I give it back, I'll show you word well invested
And whenever I go, BEFORE I GO, let me give
Thanks to you Lord, my birth, for every day that I've lived
You gave me a love most of my life I didn't know was there
IN THE NAME OF JESUS! I give you my life, cause you care",The Prayer IV,2001

Problems and differences
I still fuck
With you

I still fuck
With you

I was never a motherfucker to want beef
Until you went and put my shit out in the front streets
Yeah, I sold drugs. Nigga, what heat?
Yeah, I stole shit, sold it in the streets, I’m a go-getter
Never jealous of a nigga, gotta stack my money
Steal another nigga figures
I don’t need a fucking chain, bitch I’m here to gain that
Bitch, I need fucking ring, but not for no dame
We all call this here a game cause we in it for the same
In it for the funds, throw a little ones
Listen to the drums smoke inside your lungs
Get a little drunk, got your bitch speaking tounges
Have a little offspring and be able to support it
Known if we was broke, clinic woulda got aborted
Work now play now a nigga runnin’ offense
Bitch, I’m in Miami and I’m swimming with the Dolphins

I don't like going sober to the hospital
Shit only make me nauseous, I'm not with it
So I'm out front parked in a car with a
Few of my niggas hard getting foggy, yeah
Last year, I ain't know what the cost of a coffin was
So now I'm often buzzed in the apartment bummin'
Looking for new chords and a larger Nugget
I’m the stars above me when I spark and tug this
Far from hard, but I’m a snarl in public
'Cause we large in numbers, Trash Wang
Wolf Gang, we the clique, not a stain on me, ho
Not a fray in a knit, in the car with the work
Now, real nigga quiet while the talking occurs
Feel like I’m flying when I’m off from the herb
Fuck ‘em all, let the army disperse
Know the swamp lay ‘em all in the dirt
Had to stop, re-assess some agendas
Tad bit sicker than the rest of the clinic
Maybe head up, sending threats to your henchmen
We the best, period, the end of the sentence
Roughneck putting paws to the pavement
Lane switch, I’m a blow haze ‘till I can’t think
Shrink told me I should learn how to pace this
Big homie told me, “Nah, nigga, take this.”

Lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world end, doing eighty-five in my ride
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking ""This is what I did it for""
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trife and Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

Doms, while they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns patty-caking with mannequins
Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs and that's
Prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook
Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running 'till my foot aching
Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans

Grandma's passing
But I'm too busy tryna get this fuckin' album cracking to see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen
And my priorities fucked up, I know it, I'm afraid I'm going to blow it
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?
Talk all you want I'm taking no advice
Nigga, I'm 'bout to relish in this anguish
And I'm stressing over payment, so don't tell me that I made it
Only relatively famous in the midst of a tornado
Misfitted, I'm Clark Gable, I'm not stable, abrasive as fuck
And they all pay me, I'm chuckling, cross-faded in public
Heart racing 'til blunt is lit like, ""He don't give a fuck again, right?""

""Hey Thebe, nigga, what's up nigga?
I heard you back, I need them raps, nigga
I need the verse, I don't care about what you going through
Or what you gotta do nigga, I need bars, sixteen of 'em""

I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judging by the pants and the mall grip
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga, night life living
Riding in the Jeep, I'mma side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? That's aight nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isn't
Right got the whip and I ain't got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it
The nicest doin' it, what the fuck you staring at?
Acting like you've never seen a tooth that's carat-capped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin' these niggas gon' flop like Divac

Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
North north is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait
Until the money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend

Kept the sticky in the Stussy pouch
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles, sold sniff, Momma knew
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at 2, plotting, trying to garner loot
Split it with his big roll dog, call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amok
Road to Hell paved with cement, covered trussled drugs, toughen up

Alright, okay, if that's how you truly feel about it, then""

Hear in full-effect, eat a dick and cut a check, bitch
Few niggas I'm on a first-name basis with
Address me by the alias, that trunk weighted like he
'Bout to catch a case again, eighths louder than the voice of
Satan that be plaguing him, bruh, I'm caking

Get up off the pavement brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

It's probably been twelve years since my father left, left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened, it's evident
And them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at?

Uh time lapse, bars rot in heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome, trying to make it from the bottom
His sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex-fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, ""I like attention""
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, ""Thanks so much, you made my life
Harder, and the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit""
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

I hit her up when my jet land

Front page news, I'm young Jesus
Eating bagels with no cable on
Been fucking hoes since when Mase was on
I hope that Basedgod hears my prayers
One day you're here, the next day you're gone
So me and Earl smoking weed on Jay-Z's lawn
Some dope rap on your ho ass, Tony Womack
Don't hold back, no, feed your girl Cognac
Meet a bitch, sleeping wit her, feverish, diva chick
Met her off Twitter even Schindler keeps a list
Pittsburgh, broke down somewhere in a Fisker
I could pull your bitch with a whisper and diss her
Dumbass ho
She only dumb cause she love that though
Somewhere getting high reading Juxtapoz
I hit her up she come through and watch Adjustment Bureau
(""That's a good movie!"")
Moms love me cause I'm so commercial
I fuck 'em raw cause I know they fertile
In Myrtle Beach with a purple fleece
Hotel lobbies playing Für Elise
I'm Ron Burgundy mixed with Hercules
Slap a bitch in the mouth if she curse at me
I said Josh's beard is like Paul Revere
When he walk in the room it's like God is here
I'm at a prop shop in Montauk throwing tomohawks
At civilians I'm chilling

I'm on the monitor nigga
She taking it like a champ
And I'm proud of her nigga
I'm on the couch where that loud is burning
I'm shouting, ""I don't fuck with you""
Cause I don't, never love a ho
But we could play doctor, ma
Open wide for thermometer
Your cowgirl's crotch riding
With a clean, faded fro, lopsided
Tell the label that I want a white driver
And tell him give me space, I don't know that nigga
Bold ass little fuckin' low class villian
Whole van tinted, nope can't kill him
It's the Trashwang nigga, that's what's up
Half pint of hope in that plastic cup
Real nigga from the start 'til the casket shut
Present his own case as a basket one
Present-day based nigga, smack the judge
Riding with them same niggas ashin' blunts
While that bass make his face like he mad or somethin'
Slide in the safe, take the cash and run
Know that if he fake I'm harrassin' him

Blowing more smoke than a broke exhaust
Pipe only spirit that I hold menthol

Living like it's '62
Spit and grip my genitals
My bitch to split the swisher

It just burn like six furnaces writ it
It affixed learning them digits, and simultaneously

So shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the foxholes
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home
Shit, it's like 6 p.m. and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented stupid as the group is
Only slightly, write precise to get a pussy nigga two chins
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth
And teeing off, believe it's Golf Wang, nigga",Sasquatch,2013
Earl Sweatshirt,"I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate
About half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult
To admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue
And I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry
The music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just driftin'
I'm not complainin'
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving
I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit
On cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the laundry
State to state for the profit
it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet
I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded
and half-retarded I stumble
To where she park when she visit
I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance
I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
She, she seems that

All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different
I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like

I’m coming back I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat
left you at terminal three
I’ll meet you down at baggage claim
in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, don’t cry
You know I can’t live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I’d be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly please
Palm, no marijuana trees
Yo hickeys on my aorta and tattoos you could only see
When I’m playing surfboarder, put whisky in that salt water
I emptied every canteen, just to wear
that straight edge varsity you think’s cool
They thought me soft in High School
thank God I’m jagged
Forgot you don’t like it rough
I mean he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean how anal am I gon' be when I’m aiming my gun
And why’s his mug all bloody, that was a three on one?
Standing ovation at Staples
I got my Grammy’s and gold
Polka dots on my brit
I’m not supposed to be stunting
It’s all melodic this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep
But I’m just jet-lagged is all, and restless

All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different
I don't like you a lot
I  mean, fuck

I don’t know what we’re about
What good is West Coast weather if you’re bi-polar?
If I’ma need this sweater
I’d rather be where it’s cold
Where it snows
I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls
I know they’re coming in droves
You’ll only miss when it goes
(Yeah, I think that’s it)
When it goes",Sunday,2013
Earl Sweatshirt,"Salmon skin Band-Aid help with recovery
Diction buttery, grass depending
Your nigga was switching passed depending on where the rudder swings
Snapping like the shutter speed, pucker up, kiss of death
Tell your men to hit the deck or hit the dirt
Killing who you sinning first, verse wintergreen spit it, show 'em that I meant it
Ho, I'm rolling with my niggas, find a gold and call the chemist
Show up solo to the scrimmage, throw a brick and pour the Henny
Don't defend it, it's useless nigga
Up to my wrist in the cooler gripping the brew in this music shit
For Versace suicidal, I hit the Jake through the rifle
And tell her open that mouth for deposit, leave the bank broke
Sliding in, she smiling and fidgeting, pull my face close

Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan
She keep on asking for a rack so I ran
Looking back, like you can't see who I am

Cause every time she's sad I can't console her no more
If money buy you love, then love's not enough
So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor
If you had the chance, would you take the time you need to make it right?
The clouds are gray but would you pay the price to paint them white?
Might have a baby on the way, cause I been going in raw
It feels better, that real pleasure
I'm not real, I think I never was

Point me to the road, and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money

Getting duckets 'til I die

Few new rules in effect, bitch

See this a rather spooky action movie
Roll it up and pass it to me
Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting bougie
See a creature, ass beauty
Need a feature, rather shoot me
Truly bitches must have them bad jeans and the back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you in fact assuming
Back to doing cash pursuing
Posted up like Patrick Ewing
Rapper fuser, sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These eloquent, irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries, show you the end of it

Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly

Spraying that hotter wind in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs

Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms

Toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint

In a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather
Sitting on tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was a drama club kid, I'd run with a fun dip, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, ""fuck shit""
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassin' in my buzz like some bees in a shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists, it's cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy posers looking silly boy
I'm in that past season 'preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is (diddy riese)
Na'kel smith transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil, ollies, and fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
I'm 'bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hate dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but loves kittens
See y'all niggas trippin' man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, ""hi,"" I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd, that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for their fucking ratings
""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the Tron Cat fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Over and over, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't think turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (why don't you jump you fucking pussy?)
I'm seeing it's a drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and

We was jumping, oh fuck, I'm like quicksand in my ways
Was always stuck and I'm stuck until an ambulance came
The first time I changed fast through Los Angeles lanes
And my bitch say the spliff take the soul from me
And the clique tight-knit, it's like the 'lo rugby
Beat the fuckin beat up like it stole from me
You can talk to Clancy you need a feature, or quote from me
I'm off the lancy, I reek of reefer and show money
It's Early running with niggas, who cold running shit
The wins like lotion, he get it he go rub 'em in
Critics pretend to get it and bitches just don't fuck with him
I spent the day drinking and missing my grandmother
Just grab a glass and pour up some cold white wine
And a Colt 45 in it, you know how I get it
I'm toasted myself and a toast to all my niggas
And there ain't no time limit, I'm toasted as hell

Really covered with roaches
Cause niggas was really smoking
Gotta say that as of late
I been busy with business mostly
Got a tape? Catch a wave
Now you in the industry ocean
And missing out on your boat
I been figuring out my own fish
Home gets distant
We working I'm on the road again
Cold and his spirits is
Bursting up out the Trojan, man
Fridge full of spirits
And the crib mirror mirror
Let me hear why the niggas
That's the peers see and hear us
Then mimmick the fucking motions man
Keep the circle closed
Let them niggas front in the cul-de-sacs
Friendly with the chosen
The rest is getting the poker hand
Face-drinking smoker
It help me duck when emotion jab
Fame is the culprit
Who give me drugs without owing cash
Sipping 'til I melt
Never trying me, I'm diving
Falling victim to myself
Middle finger to the help
When it's problems I don't holler
Rather fix 'em by myself
When it's looking like it's quiet for you
This the shit to yell

This the shit right
Keep your chin high up

Then her friend might

And despite all the facts that you got phony
You gonna tell them bout the night that you exposed me
For the bastard I was
And how I probably smashed every bitch that I passed in the club
And the last couple months was the worst
Cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months
That we had as a couple
My absence, a fuss
Was a problem that we ain't ever really get to solve
We just smashed and we scuffled
Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you

That apart from the fact that we fuck and it's bomb

Niggas pitches need to change, I separated from my main one
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck
I been like this since the Motorola Razr
What a bastard that baby was, little mad nigga missing dad
Never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga Da$h with me

Of broken eagles, they fly
Play it cool

Strumming the notes on the guitar
While I'm rocking my leather Mercedez coat like the R in the cut
Licking my wounds and soaking my scars
Crib full of empty bottles of liquor, broken cigars
On a table, going Ninja ? on the cable
When that dance make my stance unstable
Hem the bottom of my pants with staples
I split 'em with symmetry like a bagel
Play tic-tac-toe on your cheek with the razor cut up your facial
Sprinkle the magic dust on the reefer
Gutter creature, rap pornographic snuff double feature
I'm bubbling something up in the beaker
The night creeper, motivational mic speaker
Wallet ring like a Motorolla device beeper
Light sleeper, leave em shook with a light seizure

I got that shit for him, I'm finna flush it to you
It's nothing to you sending threats, I'm rushing to you
Have the little homie run it to you, then run into you
Like an intersection, and now you been intercepted
I end a session when the weed's all gone
Like a gardener, just working the hose on the lawn
But I'm a king to a pawn on the chess board
That stresses scores stuck in a square, just press 4
I'm sitting with the best, throwin' the game, picture the picture
In the the same frame of mind, Tarantino official
Couple cameras in the building, the body of work
Mentally a work out, your brain, your body will hurt
Niggas neck broken and bitches' bodies twerk
I swear I get jobs every corner looking for work
Black leather coat, let 'em know the boy is boss

And any cars, don't never cross
Don't never get involved
Be the next mystery that's unsolved

I got demons on my soul when I'm writing
The beat play the role of a seat on a bike how I ride it
My vices proposed to me nights when I'm trapped in this pain
Ain't my wife when the light drizzle tap on the pain
I'm inside with them
When the sky clear up, still inside tripping
You can see I ain't been sleeping in my eyes, nigga
In the mirror throwing hands, I don't toss fights
I'm heavyweight, get a load of these light niggas
Looking washed online like light linen drying
I'm through trying with niggas
I'm gifted cause my eyes work in different
And I be seeing straight through the skies as my nigga
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these bitches
And these guys what's the difference, I despise of 'em

She was having second thoughts about a man who was always gone
Said the only way to get to him was a telephone
So she held on to me when she couldn't hold her own
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle somewhere between right and wrong
She said you know I never was the kind to spread it around
But I'll let you get to me as long as you don't let me down
Said I got the kind of love it takes to make if feel slow
But don't care how you get me there just long as I go
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle somewhere between right and wrong

For she's got you thinking of something so different tonight
It's too late to worry what's right or what's wrong and you're a little too crazy to leave it alone
When you're looking at something that's too good to push it aside
Boy, she's got your head in the clouds and your heart in a bind
How come you're feeling so proud when your love's on the line?
You still think your first love's the best in your life when you know you should hurry
But you can't say goodbye 
And you know you can't go back and feel like you're where you belong
Now the sweet taste of freedom is hard to control when the touch of a woman's so tender to hold
She won't even let you remember how long you've been gone
Boy, you've got your head in the clouds and your heart in a bind
So how come you're feeling so proud when your love's on the line?

Earl Thomas Conley,"Those stormy years leave deep and endless trails across his face
He'll wander back when morning rolls around
For it's an old man's right to spend his life just searching for a place
Where he can sit and watch the sun go down

Time's run it's course and freed the horse that pulled him through his prime
And placed a different light above his brow
Now towering rows of buildings grow in fields he left behind
And life seems twice as heavy as a plow

With his golden chain the old man clings to the watch inside his vest
That tells him when it's time to move along
Just rambling through the avenues, he'll sometimes stop to rest
But it's hard to find a place where he belongs

So crowd around the corner, boys, and take your good old time
And pass along a piece of yesterday
A tender breeze of memories is blowing through your mind
Softer than those stands of silver-gray
And sweeter than the things we've seen today",Crowd Around the Corner,1986
Earl Thomas Conley,"In solemn response, to your wishes and wants
I stand with my heart in my hands
Though the courage it takes to live with mistakes
Makes me feel less than a man
Because girl you're the beat that robs me of sleep
By keeping my face in the rain
But how can I rest, when your love's the test
That leaves me with no one to blame
And proves I'm attracted to pain

Unintentional pain
Like a continual rain that's falling
Down on me

So with helpless consent I pay for the rent
On a room where we hide in the dark
From a woman and child whose love is on trial
By a man who once swore on his heart
That only in death would they part

But unintentional pain keeps calling
Like a continual rain that's falling
Down on me
Down on me

Earl Thomas Conley,"You were the heartbreak kind
Out for a one night stand
And me I'd been hurt
And I needed some help to forget
We didn't want any lasting thing
Just someone to hold till the morning came
We said there'd be no looking back

No ties that bind
No strings attached
But oh how we changed when the sun came up
Look at the two of us
All tangled up in love

You were the goodbye kind
Footloose and fancy free
And me I'd made up my mind
Love was too hard on me

We planned to stay just one night
Then walk away in the morning light
Oh we said there'd be no looking back

No ties that bind
No strings attached
But oh how we changed when the sun came up
Look at the two of us
All tangled up in love

Oh you and me didn't plan it this way
Something went wrong in the night
Now maybe we're not free anymore
But what can we do when it feels so right
We said there'd be no looking back

No ties that bind
No strings attached
But oh how we changed when the sun came up
Look at the two of us
All tangled up in love",All Tangled up in Love,1999
Earl Thomas Conley,"You were just another pretty face in the crowd
I was just hangin' out
I wasn't ready for love when I looked in your eyes
You took me by surprise
You weren't supposed to say that you loved me
You were just gonna stay for the night
I never held a hand that could touch me
And leave me with stars in my eyes

[Chorus]
Oh angel in disguise
You're just an angel in disguise

Almost made it too easy for me to believe
That love could happen to me
But you're not afraid to show me how much you care
And prove your heart is there
You weren't supposed to say that you loved me
You were just gonna spend the night
I never held a hand that could touch me
Andleave me with stars in my eyes

[Chorus: x 2]",Angel in Disguise [DVD],2004
Earl Van Dyke,"I've been crying
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby

Sometime's up
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keep on, keep on crying baby for you

The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

So I take out my guitar to pass some time

Hey!  It's gettin' late.  Where will you sleep?
You're gettin' kinda hungry, you forgot to bring something to eat.
Oh, lost with no money you start to cry,
But remember, you left home wantin' to be grown, so dry your weeping eyes.
 
Sirens screamin' down neon lighted streets. 
You want your mama.
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
Are they looking for you?
You're frightened and confused.
I want my mama.
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, 
but she's much too far away, she can't hear a word you say.
 
You've heard some frightening news on the radio, 
about little boys running away from home,
And the parents don't see them no more.
You wanna stop to hitch a ride, I know,
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go.
 
Streets are dark and deserted, not a sound nor sign of life.
How you long to hear your mother's voice, 'cause you're lost and alone.
But remember, you made the choice, Runaway Child Running Wild.
You better go back home where you belong,
Oh, Runaway Child Running Wild,
You better go back home where you belong.
You're lost in this great big city,
Go back home where you belong.
Not a familiar face, ain't it a pity,
Go back home where you belong.

You better go home where you belong.

And the country found them ready
At the stirring call for men.
Let no tears add to their hardships
As the soldiers pass along,
And although your heart is breaking
Make it sing this cheery song

While your hearts are yearning,
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.

Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out

Overseas there came a pleading, 
""Help a nation in distress.""
And we gave our glorious laddies
Honour bade us do no less,
For no gallant son of freedom
To a tyrant's yoke should bend,
And a noble heart must answer
To the sacred call of ""Friend.""

When we walk hand in hand, the world becomes a wonderland, it's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows when there is no rain? It's magic

Why do I tell me myself these things that happen are all really true
When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you?

Nigga's taking shots at me, I send em' back to their homeline
And I touchdown, goalline, y'all ain't, killing, shit
Shoot every nigga in your clique, I'm on one, let me jog your memory
Me and Nells on a milerun, uh, shawty gonna need her drawers done
Eat her pussy til' it's all gone, uh
And I still ain't ever been robbed, so nigga don't try me
Two niggas with guns, snatch yo wallet
That pickpocket want my I.D and I spray your zone
Treat niggas like strippers and put cash on em'
Got a new choppa, I need that bitch that want a tag on
If you shoot me, you famous, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
So I'm about to be, dumb as fuck, cause' I got blessed fools and babies

When you were fifteen you were yelling

Everyday that I wake I say grace
Hallelujah welcome back like Mase
Bitches only fuck niggas with the cream
A nigga this fresh ain't never gon' date
Ay, they say we can't maintain
Only real niggas remain
'Ye say that we the new slaves
I need to ball with a chain
I got a real bad bitch I haven't seen her in a month
With twins so big she can put 'em in the bunk
Oh I love it when she drop it and spread it like time
When I see her camel all I wanna do hump
Okay the Hall of Fame keep callin' my name
Got a mural on the wall I'mma legend
From the motor city and been have drive
I just need a little gas in my engine
Okay, we all in the game we ballin' the same

They become your life

Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly

Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun

So spread your wings and fly

I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be

"Earth, Wind & Fire","Searching in the sky one night, while looking for the moon
I viewed a mighty light approching in a zoom
Need was there to tell someone of my discovery
Fifteen seconds later, a light appeared in front of me
To my surprise, there stood a man with age and mystery
His name was Jupiter and came to visit me

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet, from where I come

Keep your eye on Jupiter, such beauty in the sky
We will wait for your return in the by and by
Keep your eye on Jupiter, memories we shall fulfill
Just to view a brighter day, and do a righteous will

Watching and considering my visual state of mind
The flower fragrance help reveal to me the sign
The sigh of love, I had confessed to live and really know
The sign of love which I had failed my fellowman to show

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet, from where I come

We've seen each other once and already we've spoken twice
So stay or at the most a moment longer to hear me say
I really did miss you the last time that you went away
I'm serious, I must have you, I won't waste your time
And have you wishin' that somehow you could replace the time
I don't do any magic tricks to try and make the mind
I just convinced that the reality is that you have to race the time
She said ""You a playa ain't you, could have what you want can't you""
I replied that I'm also an artist baby I could paint you
In the frame and I don't try hard to not be the same

A few short words, and whaddya know?
Oh, whaddya know? He comes

Down, like water, fresh out the clouds clown
Drown you like terrible weather
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon
Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin'

To all, rise and shine, give God the glory
I already give a percent of mine to Bert and Cory
And still got bills and employees to pay
So excuse me Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days

My ways of control is hard to swallow
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind
Sorry to disappoint, but dis joint's mine
Display your indie but say no

More or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo
To the dirt and edit the clip and lost Kano
My mens wear problems like Timbs
See it all in they face, ask Mase, he got wars to win

Scores to settle, crews to crush
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile
It's Long Isle y'all, longevity sustainin' my celebrity status
From AM to PM, you see him on file y'all

I was told to step righteous, so when it's done
Everyone will say I stepped right
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop
shinin' his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light

[Incomprehensible]
A few short words, and whaddya know?
Oh, whaddya know? He comes

Aiyyo, I'm up against these walls, here's my back stiff straight up
Dazzle and razzlin' broads like I'm little Juan Magic
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop
Top drama every time these commas don't drop

Pop spots like lint on your shirt, the net worth
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six
I circumcise the track, you just a dick

Overlapped and hooded
Skin repeated like Stutterin' John
I repeat like yesterday, it don't stop
George of this poor life pop, put to Scarlet
In a place she believes, much better than your lies

She say she lookin' better in my eyes, bullshit
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin' to fuck
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby
I tried to speak my piece in court but Judge Mills paused me

Bifocusedly die hopeless sometimes
Yo cry your poker face, you oughta try it one time
When God is an non pos', you stand to download
Demanded like slaves on trial, we want free

Man cock aim ready, it's time you MC
So you rappers bust bee-bee guns, graffiti runs
Through my veins since cable with the wired remote
Woodgrainin' like you wired his float

C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul
We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old
Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow
A group of kids so original, you heard?

C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul
We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old
Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow
A group of kids so original

Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners who got 'em
We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew, and his whack dancers
Bitin' is forbidden pah, pay that tax
And don't you ever look at us funny, boy, we'll bring rap back

And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in
For you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn
Hula hoop all bitches crew full with brand new Keds

Cutmaster kill 'em, make sure we cut classics
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the PA
And just lay whooptay, whooptay?

Use the ruse, sport beads and snatch a dude's toupee
Since tunin' into T-La Rock'n AJ
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed like a glass of OJ
Girls you can go cruising' in my OJ

Do what Simon says

Doing what you feel

Humpty-Dumpty when you fall
There be no one here to call
Life is still your mystery
You see, you see, you see

In hope, to feel safe and sound
We emphasize, to make it clear
Our stumbling nations atmosphere

While looking through the looking glass
Our vision show, a stormy past
When you gonna wake, and see the sun
Stop wasting time and having fun

"Earth, Wind & Fire","Every man has a place
In his heart there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship fantasies

Until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever as one

Rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to your kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship fantasies
All your dreams will come true miles away

Our voices will ring together
Until the twelfth of never
We all will love together as one

Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life a new degree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

As one
Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold to your soul is ecstasy
You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives have brought you to
Recognize it's your life now in review

As you stay for the play
Fantasy has in store for you
A glowing light will see you through
It's your day shining day
All your dreams come true

As you glide in your stride
With the wind as you fly away
Give a smile from your lips and say
Are you free yes I'm free
And I'm on my way",Fantasy [DVD][*],2008

We've come together on this special day
To sing our message loud and clear
Looking back we've touched on sorrowful days
Future pass, they disappear

If you look way down in your heart and soul
Don't hesitate 'cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart 'cause you're never (never, never) old at heart

Plant your flower and you grow a pearl
A child is born with a heart of gold
The way of the world makes his heart grow cold",That's the Way of the World [DVD][Live],2008

Of a heart that's always fled the merry-go-round
When I tell my little jokes

I'm not comin down

You always build me up
And you're not afraid to touch what's on my mind
You'll always find

Pushing me to mend

In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

Born is the King of Israel.

Three wise men came from the country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Live by the sword and die by the semi

Pressed, to confess lies over hot joints
To sell to all who wanna hear some

Eartha Kitt,"When a woman acquires a certain age
And the men who adored you no longer swoon
It pays to avoid the sunlit days
And live by the light of the kindly moon

But the moon grows old just like us all
And her beautiful years are done
So now she prays through endless days
To take her revenge on the sun

When I was a girl at my daddy's side
Papa, the royal mortician
Revealed to me in secret signs
The mark of the magician

And daddy was no dummy
Did outrageous things with a mummy
And often the stiffs that he would drive
Would look better dead than they did alive

I studied well I learnt the trade
I thought my looks would never fade
If I could find that recipe
To give eternal youth to me

It was always my ambition
To use papa's tuition
And gain some small remission
From the vagaries of time

Every little ray of sunshine robs me of my youth
Who to blame? Who the one? Who to curse?
You know the only on to blame
Would be my enemy the sun

Snuff out the light, claim your right
To a world of darkness
Snuff out the light, neophytes
Of a world of darkness

Supai baby, turn me on
Every wrinkle soon be gone
I could squeeze myself with glee
The promises you made to me

I've really stopped at nothing
Murder, treachery and lying
Whatever it takes to keep my looks
You really can't blame a girl for trying

Snuff out the light, claim your right
To a world of darkness
Snuff out the light, neophytes
Of a world of darkness

Snuff out the light, claim your right
To a world of darkness
Snuff out the light here tonight

Apparitions of eternal darkness
Spiraling in circles through the night
Creatures of beguiling blackness
No more squinting in the light

Bats and owls and coiled sea dragons
Crocodile and carrion beasts
Swirling in the growing darkness
Join us in the coming feast

Spectre wraith and apparition
Spirit demon phantom shade
Salamander serpents, dog-faced devils
Dance and watch the dying sunlight fade

When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Like my love

Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn’t that she, coming to me, nearly here

Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where’s my love

Where’s my love

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy
Isn’t that she, or am I just going crazy, dear

Eartha Kitt,"I've been through clouds and stormy skies
On different worlds, all filled with lives
I've traveled through the steams of lovers
And wiped my tears upon their covers
I've lived a life of rogue and queen
And died my hair to fit the scene
I've had my ups, I've had my downs
And sipped champagne with worldly crowns
I've been as honest as I could
And ashamed, the shame that knows I should
I've been loved and I've been lied to
And found a few shoulders I could cry to
And all those years I thought life naughty, ah-hah
Should make me beautiful at forty

For life's not been so bad to take
For now I've cut life's golden cake
Into a million tiny squares
And with each piece recall the years
The taste of life has not been so bad
Between the tears and joys I've had
But with some good and a little singing
She always allowed me to get a grin
And all those years I've spent on my youth
Thinking knowledge brought the truth
I know life has her games to play
And puzzles it, crackling play
So, graves are dug and wars are lost
But life goes on at any cost

I do think life has made me wiser
So there is no reason to disguise her
Even tried to rearrange her
She has been fair, I would not change her, hah-hum
She presents me life so simply
In a cup that's almost empty
With a little wine to tease me
But not enough to really please me
And if I drink, and let her take me
She is wise enough to wake me
But only after dreams and visions
Allowing me to see these decisions, ah-hah
All those years I thought life naughty
She made me beautiful at forty",Life Made Me Beautiful at Forty,1991

Tonight I'm melancholy mean!

Some dame to tell his troubles to,

And as I take it from the tin,
I slip a little powder in!

And cross his heart and hope to die!
And mumble ""I know how you feel,
But I've been on a business deal!"",

I know my plan will never work!
But when he starts to drink it up,
I'll grab his hand and break the cup!

Why must I wait for him and grieve?
Why don't I just pack up and leave
The heel?!

But no he's really on the stair,
I'll try to act like I don't care!

I find it takes two heels to click!

Where it will end is up to fate!
I'll let him have his little fling;
I'll be the chewing gum that clings

Eartha Kitt,"I lost myself on a cool damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Like my love

Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn’t that she, coming to me, nearly here

Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where’s my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Where’s my love

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy
Isn’t that she, or am I just going crazy, dear

Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready, for my love

Eartha Kitt,"When a woman acquires a certain age
And the men who adored you no longer swoon
It pays to avoid the sunlit days
And live by the light of the kindly moon

But the moon grows old just like us all
And her beautiful years are done
So now she prays through endless days
To take her revenge on the sun

When I was a girl at my daddy's side
Papa, the royal mortician
Revealed to me in secret signs
The mark of the magician

And daddy was no dummy
Did outrageous things with a mummy
And often the stiffs that he would drive
Would look better dead than they did alive

I studied well I learnt the trade
I thought my looks would never fade
If I could find that recipe
To give eternal youth to me

It was always my ambition
To use papa's tuition
And gain some small remission
From the vagaries of time

Every little ray of sunshine robs me of my youth
Who to blame? Who the one? Who to curse?
You know the only on to blame
Would be my enemy the sun

Snuff out the light, claim your right
To a world of darkness
Snuff out the light, neophytes
Of a world of darkness

Supai baby, turn me on
Every wrinkle soon be gone
I could squeeze myself with glee
The promises you made to me

I've really stopped at nothing
Murder, treachery and lying
Whatever it takes to keep my looks
You really can't blame a girl for trying

Snuff out the light, claim your right
To a world of darkness
Snuff out the light, neophytes
Of a world of darkness

Snuff out the light, claim your right
To a world of darkness
Snuff out the light here tonight

Apparitions of eternal darkness
Spiraling in circles through the night
Creatures of beguiling blackness
No more squinting in the light

Bats and owls and coiled sea dragons
Crocodile and carrion beasts
Swirling in the growing darkness
Join us in the coming feast

Spectre wraith and apparition
Spirit demon phantom shade
Salamander serpents, dog-faced devils
Dance and watch the dying sunlight fade

EarthGang,"I got a friend who little brother infatuated with guns
I tell him ""watch yourself, for that you know what comes""
Two shots to the lungs 'cause some young nigga thought you had it coming
And I know you not the type for running
AK sound off like the band drumming
Quick to check a nigga if he sayin' something
Under his breath, two shells is left
Everyday niggas dance with death
I got a tone that make you one-two step
You see, life's too short to be so reckless
Which one? Your life or that gold necklace
Could niggas soul check it?
And all my life I been so patient
They say ""life is what you make"" so it's all for the takin'
Seen a family get evicted, had me reminiscing
Yet I'm bitching about life, I should be happy I'm alive
But shit, we tired of flipping fries
Niggas trapping on the side
Don't need no blue check, bye, to be verified
I'm so solidified, they don't question my qualifications
Young legend in the making, I'm tryna be patient
But no time to be waiting, I'm just feeding my baby
Unemployed, no diploma, what nigga, this crazy

Gotta be another way, aye
Gotta be another way, aye
Gotta be another way, aye
Gotta be another way

All around, she gon' hold me down
Y'know, 'cause I can make her hurl many sounds like coyote howls
When I'm in the center, outer limits, nonexistent
Is you riding, is you with it?
Ain't to hard to figure out, ain't to hard to live for now
Is you artificial or your art official?
Only clean my messes with official tissue, I'm a picky nigga
Picking up on signals, crystal clear, I get the picture
Pissing off whoever watching, watch the minutes and the seconds keep on ticking
Got a cousin in Kuwait
He can't wait to see his daughter
When he left she wasn't talking, heard he sing the other day

Craters on my thumbs from the lighters I spun
I just stopped by today to work on my lil' cash flow
Spit all your spills in they lanes, I'm more revealings than saints
And fucking willingness is the phrase that pays, my nigga
The free money, kitty, you get it all day, my daily
They heard of my city, can't tell me 'bout labor wailings
The freakiest babies with labias, only debating
Microwave pregnancies, we've no sense of time waiting
Attention span to whatever get my dick rocked
Not to mention my nigga just got slammed after fifth block
So we gon' have to handle all of that when all of the tick stops and the bell rings
No hiding at the neighborhood pit stop, shit
I'm on my own, so if I make it home, know I ain't have to use my chrome
I ain't have one to own, let alone two to rub together, just to fuel the growth
So when Judas ran up on me, gave him two boost to the throat, 'cause there's, 'cause there's

First time did this verse, spit it half assed
I wasn't in the mood, goons get emotional too
You angelic, getting high got me closer to you
Summer nights, star gazing, Frank Ocean and shrooms
Girl you drive me boo-coo-coo-coo
Fucked around with you even though you down to fuck bitches too
There's nothing that you won't do
Mama ain't raise no fool, well now I guess that ain't true
I'm in and out of symbiotic situation shit too often
Never finish how they started, used to fuck you on the carpet
The floor is hot lava, hoe I hate to guess we always talked about
I guess I'm finna go without ya like Forgetting Sarah Marshall
Marshall ain't came in here for a minute
Depending who you asking, you ask who you depend in
But what we been through ain't nobody business
My love for you is infinite

Take me in a circle
Fuck that if I say so
Worst part is she came close (love, love)

First thing that we came for
Everything, yeah we made for
Everything that we paid for
Why is it breaking us down?

Hannibal Lector lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum

Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step stupid or you get slapped stupid
East side little Ru, Zone Six vet
Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to you
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator where the steps at
James Bond, nah, James Harden with the stepback
No D, Niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack they shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your Jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pepé Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe, I go where the check at
Margiella gorilla, they kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool
Keep it movin', I won't be the nigga they taking out
Breaking down, face down
As far as this rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger

I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm a stallion, stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear, my sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here
Okay, let's really make some noise in here

I'm under pressure smoking pressure
Walking in no direction
Chalk it up to the devil for fucking with my perspective
Too young to be a witness but old enough for the lessons
Soo young, got a tucker to fuck with the chief inspector
I bleed just like your favorites, I shit just like the angels
Oh shit I feel a change and a shift in niggas' thinkin' like Luke
I got the jugg, I'ma say it's quite the finagle, get rich 
And make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's
But lately I've been blocked up
Lately I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck
Niggas make art and act hard for no Oscar
Boy you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck (shit)

Niggas ain't seein' you Venus, and I ain't seeing me (shit)
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills, my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off off the deep beat
That a lil nigga like me got to keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain, I let the strain do what you can't
I know it's hard out tryna reach me
I'm battling addiction, I'm deep in premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second guessing my delivery
Lord, Ezekiel take the wheel, I'm flying in the young
Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up, so
Motherfuck a time limit, I'ma take what's mine nigga

Les voix de la souffrance durent
Ma rime originale marque déposée assure mon revenu
Je mets mon cerveau à l'épreuve et nous sommes entendus
De par le globe, ma verbalistique flotte dans l'air du temps
Réfléchir avant d'écrire, le principal élément
Ça paraît si simple à faire, pourtant mon écoute est claire
À part quelques groupes qui carburent nous kiffons peu les concerts

Prennent-ils plaisir à tchatcher? Est-ce la crème, le billet vert?
J'opère dans les bas fonds, cerbère du dernier bastion
Mes vers pour le Double H expression de l'opinion
Une partie de la jeunesse n'a presque rien ou si peu
Quand tu retournes tes poches la poussière te pique les yeux

Il est déjà à la fenêtre quand le réveil sonne
Il regarde la cour mais il n'y a encore personne
Pourtant dans quelques heures, le silence ne règnera plus
Beaucoup de jeunes y viendront passer une journée de plus
Vaincus par l'oisiveté ou las d'aller pointer
Pour rien certains iront dealer
Devant les plus jeunes émerveillés par tant de billets
Le genre de gâteaux qu'ils se languissent de goûter
Déjà résignés à suivre le chemin qui leur est tracé
Ils ne pensent même pas à lutter
La vie est un film où tout le monde a un rôle à jouer
Le problème, c'est qu'il y a trop de séries B
Trop de seconds rôles croulant sous le poids du premier
Trop de modèles sur lequel ils vont calquer
De leur démarche jusqu'à leur manière d'être
Ainsi ils ont l'impression d'ouvrir une fenêtre
Quelle est leur motivation première, je n'en sais rien
Peut-être aiment-ils vivre le purgatoire au quotidien
D'un regard extérieur, il se dit, c'est pas de leur faute
Cette fois il a raison, l'Enfer, c'est les autres",L' Enfer,1997

",Right Here with You,1996
East 17,"When the thunder calls you
From a mountain high
It's time to spread your wings and fly
When the thunder calls you
Under purple sun
To the place where horses run 

When I saw your face
I knew you were the one
In a sky that's filled with rain
A ray of sun
I called you on the phone
Said ""You're happy on your own""
When I heard your body cry
For my love
Your body's calling me
Your body's calling
I think I'm falling
Whoa

A picture in my mind
A vision in a dream
When the storm destroyed
The bridge I walked across
Have you ever felt alone
When you stood within a crowd
On a path you thought you knew
But feel alone 

I'm all confused, like a child with a choice of toy
So much to gain, so much to lose
Like a pain you endure more than enjoy
I guess I'm going crazy, everyone's telling me so
Do you feel the same?
Well that's all I need to know",Thunder,1996
East 17,"Have you heard of the saying
For those who were playing
You don't know what you got till its gone

Well that was my calling
I knew what I was falling into
Something that would be so wrong

But I got hold of myself
And changed for the better
I can't get you out of my mind
Cause something inside
Made me realize you were fine

Each time we we're alone
I guess I didn't know
How far we were apart
Should have spoken from heart
I guess I didn't know
That each time you go away,I cry
I can't take all these goodbyes

I know from this feeling
Deep inside there's a healing
I know that I'm in control

Everyday I am yearning
This love I feel burning
Burning right through my soul

So let's make a start
Of something that cannot be broken
The mold its so strong

Treat this love as a child
That grows into something worth while

Each time we we're alone
I guess I didn't know
How far we were apart
Should have spoken from heart
I guess I didn't know
That each time you go away,I cry
I can't take all these goodbyes

Deep love's so deep
Deep love's so deep, yea
I can't take all these goodbyes

Faithfully, I will be
You will see, please believe me
I can't take all these goodbyes

Each time we we're alone
I guess I didn't know
How far we were apart
Should have spoken from heart
I guess I didn't know
That each time you go away,I cry
I can't take all these goodbyes

All the time we were alone
Guess I should have really known
Baby you have always been mine
All the time we were alone
Guess I should have really known
Baby you have always been mine",Each Time,1998
East 17,"We used to talk, laugh a lot girl
What happened to those days
Did they all just fade away
Holding you in my arms
Made me feel so happy
Then you said you had to go
what's wrong? Baby I need to know
But now is the day I wish you could come back to make us true
But you're long gone away, now I'm missing you
I'm missing you baby, I miss you
I'm talking to you baby, I miss you
I thought you'd be with me forever
But I guess someone took my place
Took the place of me loving you
Making love to you all through the night
I wish you were still here
So I could see your pretty face again
Please come back and rescue me
From all this pain and misery
there's nothing I wouldn't do to get back next to you
I'm missing you every day (I?m missing you every day)
I just can't go on this way (I just can't go on this way)
Come back to me, I'm begging you please
I'm down on my knees, I'm begging you please
I miss you",I Miss You,1999

Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
One love - one god
Everybody in the house of love

We've got to stop the pain
And put the the wars on hold
Let the power of love inside the soul unfold
Free the mind
let it rise above
We've gotta change this world
To a world of love
Mother Earth she's on overload
One more war and she might explode
We've got to look back
And see a love from the past
We've got time to change it
But it's running out fast (out fast)

Not bothered about your colour
Concerned about your creed
in the house of love - elverybody's free

Everybody in the house of love ...

How many more tears must she cry
How many more fears must be felt inside
Before we realise we've gone too far
The creator created
We tone it apart
But love can guide us
Back on the right road
We've gotta save the planet before she explodes
We've gotta love our mother

Gotta let her know
Boom boom - before she blows
Not bothered about religion
Not bothered about belief
in the house of love - everybody's free

Everybody in the house of love ...

Born to live - we live to die
Our eyes can't see they can only cry
But our mother's tired of crying she's had enough
She's gotta surely blow 'cos we're giving up
Build the house oflove while we've got the time
Too many bombs in the world it's like a living mine
The house of love is what we must build
The past won't last
If the present is killed

East 17,"As we walk through the
Corridor of creation
We see lands divide
Nation against nation
Like comets they collide
And we pray
We pray for the unseen
To be seen by the eyes of man
When heaven and earth are hand in hand
Thy will be done
Damn, get set for damage
Prepare the soul
To control and manage
Cut the groove
Make it rough like a chainsaw
Inject a beat eat meat like carnivore
Trumpets sound
And wrath pours down
Angels dance to the new groove in town
Clouds part
Sky opens wide
No place to run, no place to hide
Love rain down on me
Dont want to see it
Just wanna feel it
Love knows no boundary
Gotta believe it
And youll receive it

Love - let it rain 
Love

Tribes 144 on the mount
Like an exodus to the final count
Music is blasting, silence everlasting
The call of the cosmos got the
Planets dancing, 2 send a new wibe
New ray new day
A spiritual experience
Is gonna come you way
A vision a vibe with a touch too tender
Your love to the lord
Now its time to surrender

Just wanna feel it

Gotta believe it

You can say what you wanna say just say it all to me

A change of heart or a change of mind,
Would you change to me

And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name

I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
