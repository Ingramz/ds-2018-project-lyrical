Jon Secada,"What did I see? What made me believe?
How could I believe that you really loved me?
What did I feel that moment?
I handed my world to you

And I, I was captured by your lies
Lost in all your promises of love
Blind, I was blinded by your smile
With all you said I thought I was the one

But the eyes of a fool
Never can see, never can see
I looked at you
Through the eyes of a fool
The eyes of a fool

How could I know, you didn't care?
How did I see? What just wasn't there?
So precious the dreams, I thought we shared
Dreams that will never be

And time, only time will show the truth
The truth I couldn't see behind your lies
And you, you showed me love can be so cruel
I thought I saw forever in your eyes

But the eyes of a fool
Never can see, never can see
I looked at you
Through the eyes of a fool
Eyes of a fool

Taken by you, yeah
Baby, you know, you know
You know you love me baby

But the eyes of a fool
Never can see, never can see
And I looked at you
Through the eyes of a fool
Through the eyes of a fool, yeah
",Eyes of a Fool,1994
Jon Secada,"How ordinary the cat that ate the canary
He just couldn't get it last night
Well, isn't that special, the eye on the cradle
Just wasn't all settled but it's alright

Well, some operator, you say you'll give it to me later
You say you'll give it to me later
When your done with your things
So that's what it takes, what a difference a day makes
When all that you say is not all that you mean

It's alright, it's alright
I ain't looking for it but it's alright
Woe, woe, fat chance
That I'd been seen together with you

Now don't be waiting
Woe, woe, fat chance
That I'd get caught making love to you
Say we don't need it

Pennies from Heaven and so I'm forgiven
For doing what you knew I would try anyway
That's why you don't know me, you won't get to know me
So let it loose, let it ride

Love is pure and pure is the truth
Then you find the cure of what you're scared to do
Right smack in the middle, gotta take it to heart
So don't get me started before we get started

It's alright, it's alright
I ain't looking for it so it's alright
Woe, woe, fat chance
That I'd been seen together with you

Now don't be waiting

And what is could be a love so sweet

And tenderly together without question

Then one thing that you said
Did it again
Turned our world upside down again
I surprised you, I surprised myself
Is this what we need?

I don't really wanna stop this
(I can love you like no other, I can)
Ready for love, I feel fine
I feel just fine, ready for love

Rebounded, founded
What I hope is missing in me
I'll admit this is new to me

There's no sunshine, just the rain
Till you take me back again
But if I have to, I'll wait for you forever
Oh, I'll wait for forever

I lay in the dark wondering where you are
Can't help imagining, baby, what you're doing
Tell me what you need and I will give it gladly
Just to see your face again, face again
Just to know it's not the end, oh, it's not the end

And I can't go on if we can't be together

Till you take me back again
But if I have to I'll wait for you forever
Oh, I'll wait for forever

Baby, I know you told me
The seasons have to change
Oh, but you know they always
Will come back again

But baby, if that's what it takes
For our love to grow
Ooh, I will wait for you, baby, yes I will
Just don't leave me here alone

There's no sunshine anymore
Now that you walked out my door
And I can't go on if we can't be together

I will stand down in the rain
Till you take me back again
And if I have to I'll wait for you forever

Now that you walked out my door
And I can't go on if we can't be together

Jon Secada,"What will I do when you're gone
When my word has been you for so long
How can I lie to my heart and go on pretending
Nothing has changed
I'm alone again without understanding
Why all my life waiting for the day

That a dream would come true just to slip away
The sun won't shine again and time could never mend
A heart that's been loved and then
Broken in two
Has nothing to live for 'cause nothing will do
So what will I do when you're gone

When my world has been you for so long
You're the Island I swim to when
Drowning in hope
You're the last thing I reach for at the end of my hope
So what will I do when you're gone

Jon Secada,"It was only last night
That I noticed something wasn't right
But then she looked into my eyes
And left me wondering and feeling like such a fool, this can't be true

Why is this happening to me?
I really want you like you can't believe
But I guess I'm gonna play the game
So before you go there's something that you should've known

I've been thinking that you should be mine
Even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye
I've been thinking that you should be mine
'Cause even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye

I keep on trying to forget
Sometimes I wish that we had never met
I wouldn't know how to explain
'Cause there's no excuse for loving you there's so much I could lose

'Cause there's no easy way
It's not my place to make you wanna say
And I know you want me to
Are you ready now, it's up to you, what do you wanna do?

I've been thinking that you should be mine
Even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye
I've been thinking that you should be mine
'Cause even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye Yeah

So now that we both understand
What's really going on
Make no mistake, girl, yeah
Say what you really want, what you really want

Don't be afraid of what you feel
'Cause I'll be here for you
But you gotta let him know, it's time that he should go
If you want me girl, you gotta show me

I've been thinking that you should be mine
Even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye
I've been thinking that you should be mine
'Cause even though you got a man, I'm sure you can tell him goodbye

Jon Secada,"It's a different silence, things are not the same way anymore
My eyes could not believe it when the sky came tumbling down to the floor
There's so many feelings, so many fears we haven't felt before
Tell me what went wrong, tell me where's the love

It's so hard to have this pain without an answer
How do we begin to heal so many broken hearts? How do we begin
To face the anger? How do we face the morning after
Without the faces that won't come home again?

Faith is the only thing we've got to hold on
Love's the only reason that I know we can go on
No one's gonna change what we believe in
Who would've ever realized that morning was the last goodbye?

Freedom makes us stronger, the stars and stripes
Will never be the same, step by step we'll make it, it's our pride
That they can't take away, one and all together, see the dawn
Of a brand new day, America united, we will find a way

It's so hard to have this pain without an answer
How do we begin to heal so many broken hearts?
How do we begin to face the anger?
How do we face the morning after?

It's so hard to have this pain without an answer

My girl's a naughty girl but she ain't cheap
And we both get nervous around each others heat
We like gettin' our party started
We like tryin' new things
But when it comes to making love
My girl and I don't swing, no, no

One on one
We share the ride we both provide
All night long
We take our time we do it right
We don't need nobody else besides ourselves
All we need
Is our favorite privacy

CHORUS OUT
My baby don't rock like that
We don't want nobody else sharin' our sack
My baby don't rock like that
We don't want nobody else sharing our secrets
My baby don't rock like that
She don't want nobody else seein' her tat
My baby don't rock like that
No, no, no

Jon Secada,"There's a reason
For daylight
There's a star that shines
For the world in you, the one
Who wants to believe?

In a new day
What do you say?
There's no room no need to compromise
There's an open ended dream ready and waiting on the inside

CHORUS
When the heart is strong
And the morning comes and your spirits free
To take on tomorrow
Do you see yourself, beyond that place
Where you know you started from 
Bring on the sun
Bring on the sun

Take a lifetime to remember
Take a minute to forget
Like the eyes of a child rejoices, love lifts them away

In the presence
Of our innocence
Was the truth or who do you follow
Where's the shelter when you feel
Scared and alone in your sorrow

CHORUS

Find your voice to say
It's all in what you got inside
Leave nothing to hide
Everything will be alright

Jon Secada,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

And did it my way",My Way,2010

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

And watch her as she grows in my garden

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

A hotter touch a better fuck

Sweetie, you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat
A better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

Little deaths in musical beds.
So it seems I'm someone I've never met.

You will only hear these elegant crimes,
Fall on your ears from criminal dimes.
They spill un-found from a pretty mouth.

Everybody gets there and everybody gets their way.
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her,
Now I'm the only one to blame.

Things have changed for me, and that's OK.
I feel the same, I'm on my way, and I say.

I want to go where everyone goes,
I want to know what everyone knows
I want to go where everyone feels the same

I never said I'd leave the city,
I never said I'd leave this town.

Por más que estes con el, nunca vas a olvidarme a mi
Por mas que estes con el, siempre vas a pensar en mi
Cuando chingues con el y el no te haga venir
Vas a querer volver, vas a querer volver, donde mi

Besito mojado para ti
Llega mojada donde mi
Para darte la clase en mi carcel
Secreta es la base vamonos de aquí

Enrolla que quiero encenderte
Las nalgas hot pant quieroverte
Cogerte ese booty y romperte los palos
Como los timbales del gran tito fuente

Dile que no invente, si no conoce la muerte
Que ando con par de hijuepu
Que pueden salir a cazarlo de frente
Por que eres mía y lo sabes
No pares hijuepu qu me tienes grave

Toma para que laves
Grita mi nombre cuando yo te clave
Yo te jodila mente desde que toque
Eso allá abajo baby, tu mente bloquee

Piquete de diva las balas esquiva
Intercambia su toto y leche por saliva
Las patas para arriba, yo le voy para encima
Siempre tumba la cama cuando le cambio el clima

Por mas que estés con el, siempre vas a pensar en mi
Cuando chingues con el y el no te haga venir
Vas a querer volver, vas a querer volver, donde mi

Va a querer volver a estar conmigo
Nadie va a ser como fui contigo
Nadie como yo te chupa ese clito
El con las mismas poses, yo nunca repito

Soy tu favorito, por eso regresas
Ninguno de ellos como yo te besa
Conmigo jodiste, fumaste, chingaste
Bebiste codeina de la espesa

Todo lo que el te hace, yo ya te lo hice
14 de febrero, peluches y kisses
Nadie va a quererte como yo te quise
Yo estuve contigo hasta los días grises

No puede olvidarme y ahora me llama
Chinga con el y el no te la mama
Pensando en mi todo el día en tu cama
Yo yo te olvide con las put y la fama

Quién te hizo venir
Bien rico por primera vez
Quien te hizo sentir
Bien rico y quieres otra vez

El tiempo te dirá, no me vas a olvidar
Sentimientos profundos que del corazón no se puede borrar
El tiempo te dirá, no me vas a olvidar
Dicen que un clavo saca a otro, baby y eso solo rima

Por más que estés con el, nunca vas a olvidarme a mi
Por mas que estés con el, siempre vas a pensar en mi

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Jon-Erik Kellso,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

Transforming the breed as it strains to erase

Evolution axis bent. Manipulation results
Contrast condemns and the answer insults

Bows down in unity when paradise is lost

Enough to drive a man to drink, I don't do no washing up

She must have found somebody new and now I'm all alone
Living on my own, what am I supposed to do?

That's why you'll always find him in the kitchen at parties
You will always find him in the kitchen at parties

She was into French cuisine but I ain't no Cordon Bleu
This was at some do in palmer's green, I had no luck with her

You will still find him in the kitchen at parties
You will still find him in the kitchen at parties

At last I met a pretty girl, she laughed and talked with me
We both walked out of the kitchen and danced in a new way

And even the palms seem to be swaying

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Jonah Matranga,"I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight that his whole life just changed
I know when his mom and his dad broke up it didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk and he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon Vic was seeing red, pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
Then he'd do it all again
The whole time smiling on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside all he was trying to do was get away

Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade, when you had it made
It was all good, but now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one, two, three
Lights out, which way to turn
Can't get a grip, all alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse and you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left, now you suffer
Should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids, can't accept what you did, now you wanna
Run away but you can't cause the past comes back again

Slippin' through the cracks, sip a little Jack
Go to bed half dead
What about a rent? Why does every cent gotta be a bet
When's it gonna end
Oh my God, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Outta debt, outta dodge, out of breath, out of this big problem
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick if he's gonna think the good Lord would come to take him
I'm shaking him
Wake up you son of a bitch

He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade away

I put it in my wallet

She's looking bored and now I'm running out of time
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine

Two minutes and my hearts begins to break

That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's that were I wanna be

S Club 7 and all those boy bands

I am unaware that I'm a nuisance
With her it's never wasted time
Mandy always knows exactly what I'm
Thinking and she's always on my mind
And now, I'm never gonna let her go
Cause Mandy always knows

Mandy always tells the truth
Even when it's hard to do
And she always understands
Even when it don't make sense
Even though she is a blond
I'm the one that feels so dumb

I'm sure that Mandy knows

When everything's crazy

Turn this park into a club, the stars are lights
And the moon is so bright from above
Skateboard here's all right
So pull on up, everyone is waiting for us

Anywhere we are, anywhere we go
Everybody knows, we got the party with us

But do you, honestly
Expect me to believe

I was scattered in the dust
Like the way you feel sometimes
when you feel too much
You put your hands around my face
like a circle 'round the sun
When I thought that it was finished
it had only just begun

So lie with me and be my love just for now

things never meant to keep

that breaks right over me

but will never stop the sea

Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

Your skin it looks so golden
standing naked in the sun
Your soul it feels so holy
as close as the earth can come

and the wind can break your bones

Deeper than the ocean
Wider than the sea
The loneliness you harbored from
A love that was deceived
How did you ever know
What the answer couldn't be

Than trying to believe again

A fascination for penance, so please won't you modify me
With plastic knives and plastic spoons and other types of cutlery

Take what signifies
And make it leave this room
My sweet desire that wanna come in full bloom

Held captive our culture molds our bodies hold
Held captive target the role, we have no control

I mutilate myself to make it real
A heart beating in the wrong kind of chest
Of hair and sweat and a manly mess

Sometimes to fly you gotta dare to try without permission

Jonatha Brooke,"Amelisa, it's May and blossoms 1957, single, but bold
I see you, belle of the ball and
hometown sweetheart, gifted
I want to tell you seize this day,
Let someone else go tend tradition,
Take what's yours
No one else can tell your fire, paint with your words,
sing with your voice,
Take what's yours
Amelia, I see you all in white and lovely, blinded, by love
And he too, is beautiful, and young, and blind
I want to tell you he's the wrong man, you'll look
Back
You were told that this is what you want, but it will hurt you
(You can't live for someone else)
But you live
For me
For me
For me
He would do things to make your life easier
but never talk to you - know you at all
You were his showpiece,
charming as you entertained all his fancies
I wish I could have seized that day and torn it
from your history
(For me)
Now it comes down to a life that might have soared
(for me)
But I can tell your fire, paint with your words,
sing with your voice
Nobody can take what's mine
From me
From me
From me
From me ",Amelia,1993
Jonatha Brooke,"My mother moved the furniture when
she no longer moved the man
We thought nothing of it at the time
She painted walls, painted smiles,
Checked herself in the mirror one more time,
Then yoked her heart to a whim
But the history of desire is such that just one word -
just one touch could send it reeling
She passed go again and again
never collected her two hundred
Or landed on the purple with the Jones'
She wanted to be a different person
She sat down, finally, and he walked away
He walked away
She listened to the angel - she said to flatter
She said to coo - she said it won't matter
I thought I was by myself, but I cannot kill
the angel in the house
Even in my wildest heart, I cannot kill
the angel in the house
the angel in the house
the angel in the house
You hang on to the pieces of the game that don't talk back
Don't sneak around
Movable objects, but, where were we?
Don't let anything happen
We're back to the wheel, back to fire, onto the high wire
'Cause she listened to the angel - she said to flatter
She said to coo - she said it won't matter
I thought I was by myself, but I cannot kill
the angel in the house
Even in my wildest heart,
I cannot kill the angel in the house

Jonatha Brooke,"Sometimes I'm happy, mostly I'm not,
I like to be alone a lot
And I don't know how I got this way,
Everything around me seems so crazy
My life is a rented hotel for the poor
The rooms are bare, and I'm afraid to close the door
But I keep the light on in the hall
And the perfume of the lover on my hands
And in a twinkling we will all be changed
And I'll wait for you, and I'll wait for you
In a twinkling we will all be changed
And I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you

Wearing her love like a costume
She takes it off, she's barefoot,
Sometimes I remember this dance,
Mostly not

And I'll wait for you, and I'll wait for you
In a twinkling we will all be changed

It took a long time to gain this weight,
It will take a long time to lose it again
I will have only water for a week, then maybe carrots,
and celery, and if I lose then Sunday I'll have brown rice
Because someone will adore me when my ribs show clearly
and I'm thin even when I sit down
Someone will admire my gorgeous arms and legs
when I'm only one hundred pounds
I bought a doctor's scale on sale today
It takes up half the bathroom, and it's really ugly,
but I know it's going to help me reach my goal
I get so dizzy when I stand up fast, and I don't feel like
dancing but I know I'm gonna do it this time, for sure
Now I walk past the fatsos eating doughnuts,
with cream filling, icing, jimmies, and I am so glad I am not
like them

and I'm thin even when I sit down
Someone will admire my gorgeous arms and legs

No one could tell me why, no one convinced me,
Through the cathedral,
The high windows spilling crimson light
Cross the deceived ones, no evidence of grace in their eyes
But when I saw the father, shaken, spent like spare change,
On his knees and under the gun
Then I wondered what would become of me
You might have told me that love is not enough
You might have lied and told me that it was,
The gilded cage and the holy three
Don't tell the truth as far as I can see
And in the end you choose someone, something, and
Others fade from view
And the world outside your lives exhausts you
Therein lies the ritual, you harbor no curiosity for the
High windows, the crimson light, or the deceived ones -
Dying randomly
But when I saw the father, shaken, spent like spare change,
On his knees and under the gun
Then I wondered what would become of me

Think not bitterly of me
Though I passed away in silence
Left you lonely, set you free
For my heart was tossed with longing
What had been could never be
It was best to leave you thus, dear,
Best for you, and best for me
In the gloaming, oh my darling
When the lights are soft and low
Will you think of me, and love me
As you did once long ago 
",In the Gloaming,1999
Jonatha Brooke,"All things being equal, her beauty was not her fault,
And it was not her only advantage
Midst the feast and the novelty-the manliness of his charms
So was it really such a shock, so much history in a kiss,
Besides they both knew it was over.
And what do they have to worry about, just privacy and pain
And the damage they've done

Is this all, can I go now, is this all
Is this all, can I go now, is this all?

So when you sleep do not dream, the dreams they weigh you down
When you carry them along with you
They will wrack your lovely body, report back to your soul
With all the sickening sweets of the afternoon
As we lose the last of innocence-like some romantic notion
Buried by the fashion of disdain.
You can make the world your apple-but take a bite before it sours-
Or you can make the world your charm or your chain

Is this all, can I go now, is this all
Is this all, can I go now, is this all?",Is This All?,1999
Jonatha Brooke,"I'm re-travelling this lifeline that's so close to home
We are on our way to West Point
Where your perfect, blond cousin will throw his hat up
In the air
And we will watch it fall
And I'm still the girl that loved you
When your eyes were open wide
And I'm still the girl that wandered on and I'm still the girl
That lied
'Cause when I'd tell the truth, you would run and hide

But my hands get shaky and I think of all the reasons
And I start to drink
I get lonely, get depressed, don't sleep well nights, can't
Get dressed
I can't help myself

You'll order beer and a sandwich, at the bar at the hotel
And you'll want to tell me something
Just like every other time
And our hopes will rise,
And we will watch them fall
You're still written in my days, all the pages coming
Back to me
I will carry you along, singing discreetly
Old raincoat, two lives, no boyfriend, no wife
Don't want to die here and nobody know
Don't want to die here and nobody know

But my hands get shaky and I think of all the reasons
And I start to drink

Jonatha Brooke,"You know the tricks of the trade
You can hit the soft spots at the center
Dish it out and take it back
Riding on the wave of your pompous ways
But I know that sooner or later
You'll have to wring your lovely hands in dismay
You'll go back to the board room
Add the numbers up and turn the page at the end of the day
Where were you at the bleakest of moments?
Where were you at the hint of success?
When through the window of opportunity came
The glimmer of a day in the sun
Glimmer of a day in the sun
You took the canvas of a life
Torn with the wind and the loss could still pull you along
Pocketing images one by one
Of the past, toward your future,
""A penny for your song""
Position memories carefully
You dust them off at holidays
Then you'll go back to the board room
And declare your passion for the new day
But where were you at the bleakest of moments?
Where were you at the hint of success?
When through the window of opportunity came
The glimmer of a day in the sun
Glimmer of a day in the sun
I don't think that it's me you've got in mind
Looks like the blind still bluffing the blind
Lead me on and lay me down
'Cause where were you?
Where were you at the bleakest of moments?
Where were you at the hint of success?
When through the window of opportunity came
The glimmer of a day in the sun
Glimmer of a day in the sun

Come down in pieces
Come down in tears

Nights I feel your cigarette burn

If the sun's too hot, well then sit in the shade
Jury's still out so we make lemonade and say
Why'd it come to this

Though I prayed, it did not stay, did not stay

Should the earth and all its glory fade away
Fear not the terror of night or the arrows that fly by day
Though the enemy comes in like a flood
You're my faithfulness, my shield and rampart

Love you Lord, no matter what

Hear my cry, oh Lord, my heart says seek his face
You are my stronghold of whom shall I be afraid
Though I walk through the valley of uncertainty
I never fear no evil 'cause You were there with me
Oh Lord, I bless You

Hear me say, praise Your name
I will honor You, I will glorify, magnify
Your name, Your holy name

Jonathan Butler,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

You get on a boat and sail to Rio

I had a scone and a large house blend 
And then a little conversation with my squirrel and chipmunk friends 
I said I'm sick and tired of winter 
And I wish that it was spring 
And then a little fellow named Robin Redbreast 
Began to sing 

And he sang 
Oh oh child, what'd you think the cold winter's gonna last forever? 
Oh oh child, now's the time for all the people to get together 
Outside 

'Cause it's the first of May, first of May 
Outdoor fucking starts today 
So bring your favorite lady 
Or at least your favorite lay 
The water's not cold baby dip in your big toe 
Maybe I'll see you in flagrante delicto 
Grass below you, sky above 
Celebrate spring with a crazy little thing called fucking outside 

I thanked him for the information 
I cried a little when he flew away 
I watched an episode of The People's Court 
And I tried to plan my day 
I called up my old lady 
She wasn't home so I called my girl 
I asked her if she'd like to join me as I 
Entertain the world 

And I said 
Oh oh child, I'll bring a blanket and I promise I will brush the ants off 
Oh oh child, you're gonna like it when we're taking each other's pants off

We were walking in the midday sun 
We met all kinds of people and we 
We fucked everyone 
We fucked a lady who sells ice cream 
We fucked a man with a tan Shar Pei 
Everyone who needed fucking well they 
They got fucked today 

So come on 
Oh oh child, open your mind and your heart, feel the spirit moving through you 
Oh oh child, you'll feel the warmth of the love when I stick it to you 
Outside 

'Cause it's the first of May, first of May 
Outdoor fucking starts today 
So bring your favorite lady 
Or at least your favorite lay 
The water's not cold baby dip in your big toe 
Maybe I'll see you in flagrante delicto 
Grass below you, sky above 
Celebrate spring with a crazy little thing called fucking outside",First of May,2003

Go to London, go to Spain 
Take a train from Amsterdam to Monaco 
Take a loved one if you think 
They enjoy things that stink 
Cause everything is different over there 

When you're in Belgium you can eat 
A lot of mayonnaise with your frites 
And no one will say hey that's too much mayonnaise 
Enjoy a German sausage hall 
Eat an Italian meatball 
But I hope you don't want a Twinkie 
Because they don't have Hostess Twinkies over there 

Over there you'll never feel at ease 
Cause there's not much soap and there's too much cheese 
And everyone wears clogs and rides on trains 
Over there they'll make you regret that you ever 
Saved their asses in World War II 
Don't make me go over there 

Cause I enjoy my freedom here 
And I enjoy light-colored beer 
I like to take showers 
And I like to brush my teeth every day

They say that there's a place in France 
Where the naked ladies dance 
You can find it if you ask around 
And there's a hole there in the wall 
Where the men can see it all

Because they chew their underwear 
And the underwear they chew costs a dollar ninety-two

I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song

But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role 
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

Dad found me on the steps of the video arcade
Oprhan baby in a basket, seven pounds is all I weighed
And before I learned to walk well I'd mastered Donkey Kong
Q'bert, Final Fight, Master Blaster and Pong

Blindfolded, okay, yeah, I know it sounds adorable
But dollars signs in pop's eyes grew creepy and deplorable

He said, ""Play by the noises, follow the ding boing""
But can I walk the dog and do my homework?
First, collect coins

Kid, didn't I find you with a controller in hand?
Now why do you got to go and bring shame to your old man?
Same to your old fans, you were a child prodigy
Up on a milk crate at the cabinet, making cottage cheese

Out of anybody'd put a quarter on screen
My pride in you, extended like the limbs of Dhalsim
All green money motives must a back seat take
Put the textbooks down, I'm trying to make you great

Locked in the attic I was trained from my crib to the stroller
While dad beat me senseless with the NES controller
Kid, listen, I promise, it's for your own good
Wits that you've shown, should you level up? It's understood

I hadn't been out since '98 like Sega Saturn
I've been learning ten-hit combos and the speed run patterns
More play, less chatter, you're a champion, kid
Under your mattress there had better be some cartridges hid

Up up down down left right left right B A, mad scary
It's like Clockwork Orange meets Ray Bradbury
It's unnecessary to struggle, you're fated to win
But till you beat Bowser you stay strapped in

I wanna live a fun life, I've only seen the sun twice
I want real friends, dad, Nintendogs won't suffice
Why do you ask for nothing when the world could be yours?
Flesh and blood, fun's fleeting seek eternal high scores

I wanna go to school and clean my room
I don't wanna sit here playing Doom
Three, can't you see I need to go out and play, yo
Real sports like baseball, I'm sick of Halo

Then you're sick of the meaning of life at your age
Better try a little harder, you want to clear that stage
And step into the middle of an existence examined
Do it or you're grounded, make you play backgammon

Here's a list of things that I'd rather do
Than sitting home playing Super Smash Brothers with you
Eat peas, do the dishes, walk the dog, mow the lawn
Take your wii and shove it, I'm off pops, I'm gone, peace

Don't Joust with me, kid, I'll go Berzerk
After all of your talent, all of my hard work
All the winnings that you earn, you're celebrity too
You wanna put us on the streets like the TV movies do

It’ll never run dry

Were the notes of a symphony 
Than every season would bring
New songs the wind would sing

All the way back, all the way back, all the way back

I am falling into my first love 

I thought I had to be strong
To somehow earn this love
But the truth has been all along
I only have to fall 
I wanna fall 

Face to face, there’s nothing separating us
There’s no sin, there’s no shame, all the way back to the Father
Face to face, falling in
I surrender all again
I fall back into Your arms
I feel Your heart beating against me
Face to face, there’s no space between us
Through the blood, through the water, through the grace
I come back to the Father

It's a very thin line between the boss
And the muscle

Face first in the trenches
Only time I'm on my back is fucking these

Never crying and bitching and settling
For less

Carry a .44 desert eagle
Feeding the people even if it ain't legal
Low-riding in the regal or the cadillac
Money stacked probably give yo ass a

Survival of the first to draw the heaters
And the cannons
I'm guaranteed to be the last man standing

I hear it all the time

Graduate to radioplay
I still ain't satisfied
Bout to blast off worldwide
Get in line check the politics
Ever wonder why only certain
Motherfuckers get rich
Ain't this a bitch
Barely can eat, barely can pee
I dedicate my life to the street
It's not for you if your stomach is weak
Relax with dead bodies covered with sheets
That's the only time I really find peace
Having violent stand-offs with the police
North hollywood beef
Grinding my teeth
Have you stuck and stunned in disbelief
New breed I'm the bad seed
Smoke your weed til my mothafucking eyes

Dedicated to the niggas that despise us
So ain't nobody s'posed to be here
Besides us
Catch a flatline

If the x-fives make you believe
You check the sound scan I do the math

I found bliss in ignorance

My flesh, it peels during this ride we can cut upwhat we like

It's just for now doesn't sound funny (nyaah...nyaah)
Your wife, your kids your family, your life (nyaah)
It's just for now it's just not right
Open your eyes and you'll see the light 
Stop living in a fairytale life 
There's more to life than just living 
Find it in yourself and start giving 
It'll come back to ya (nyaah) no one's out to sue ya (nyaah)
I lost everything I had I'm not even mad (nyaah...nyaah)
Losing everyone I love will make me sad (nyaah)
If you dwell on the past you simply gonna last

You will not take what's mine 
You think you can hurt me by stealing from me (oh why) (Fieldy: nyaah)
You think I owe it to you (Fieldy: nyaah)
This is everything I do (Fieldy: nyaah...nyaah)
You can't rape me take from me (Fieldy: nyaah)
But you ain't got me

This pain and misfortune is pure fucking hell
Take it away nothing will change
I will still feel the same this is too much pain 
Am I being tortured time will only tell 
Am I insane (nyaah) or am I in hell 
Gotta have faith (nyaah) not someone to scorch it (nyaah...nyaah)
Live your own life no reason to rebel (nyaah)
All of this hatred this has to be hell 
Feeling down on yourself try living my life
More money more problems that ain't no lie 
If you take it all away I rather scream bye 
Day by day one day at a time 
Doesn't make me gay (nyaah) It takes a man to cry (nyaah)
Your not alone wipe that tear from your eye (nyaah...nyaah)
Life is a gift you should put it on a throne 
Not materialistic (nyaah) shit appreciate your life

[Jonathan Davis - Chorus]

[Fieldy]
I can't wait to die (die) if it's up to me 
I wouldn't be alive (alive) not suicidal
But I've had a rough life drugs will make 
You dumb but they won't kill your pain
Look at the bright side I'm trying to stay (nyaah)
Sane I would never take my life over (nyaah) 
Depression and pain that's just part of life (nyaah...nyaah) 
Life, life it's just a test treat it with respect (nyaah)

And streaked with tears of rage

By sickness and indecision

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine

Make it as long as the day's work before us;
Tell me the tune to teach the people just in time.

I traveled here, and I ended up out there;
