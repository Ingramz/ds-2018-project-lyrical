Megadeth,"People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads
And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall
Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall

Melting down all metals, turning plows and shears to swords
Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war
Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain
Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy

Now we've rewritten history
The one thing we've found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy

If you're fighting to live
It's okay to die
The answer to your question is
Welcome to tomorrow

Where do we go from here?
God have mercy

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy",Ashes in Your Mouth,1992
Megadeth,"Madness comes, and madness goes
An insane place, with insane moves
Battles without, for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Breaking them up, just breaking them in
Quickest way out, quickest relief wins
Never disclose, never betray
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man, you're a murderer
Kill many, and you're a conqueror
Kill them all, oh you're a god

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
Yes, we have you honor
We find the defendant guilty on all counts for crimes
Against all humanity
By virtue of the jury's decision and the power vested in me by the state,
I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated with no possibility of parole,
for life
Life? whale' ya' mean life? I ain't got a life!
Boy, your soul better belong to Jesus,'cause your ass belongs to me

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

No time for questions
No time for games
Start kicking ass
And taking down the names
A long shit list
A shorter fuse
He is untouchable
And guarantees you'll lose
Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Inside the bighouse
His nightmare unfolds
Before he got there
His manpussy was sold
Black blanket welcome
This tough guy's now a bitch

It can't be worse than this

Megadeth,"Do it if you dare
Leaping form the sky
Hurling through the air
Exhilarating high
See the earth below
Soon to make a crater
Blue sky, black death
I'm off to meet my maker

Energy of the gods, adrenaline surge
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high speed dirt

Paralyzed with fear
Feel velocity gain
Entering a near
Catatonic state
Pressure of the sound
Roaring through my head
Crash into the ground
Damned if I'll be dead

Energy of the gods, adrenaline surge
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high speed dirt

Dropping all my weight
Going down full throttle
The pale horse awaits
Like a genie in a bottle
Fire in my veins

And my misfit's way of life

It gives me a migraine headache

His limitations

I'm sharpening the axe and my
Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets

Well, me, it's nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Some day you too will know my pain
And smile its blacktooth grin
If the war inside my head
Won't take a day off I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back

Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip

This is no hoax, no one pushed out
Recieve a preieve and bea pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier

It appears that Air Force One was shot down
Somewhere over the Middle East this morning
By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists, firing a Stinger Missile
The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for
The President's whereabouts are presently unknown
And he is presumed missing

The Vice President, Secretary of State,
And principals of the military are assembling
Our nation stands at Defcon 3
The greatest crisis, will someone come for me?
I ""red, white and blew it""
Unleashed revenge, my body is detained
How could anybody do this?

Betrayal, I peel away the days
Medals are useless, Uncle Sam's forgotten me
I'm not important, no one will ever come
I'll never be found, God get me out of this hell

Cold wars are heating up again
The tensions mounting

People lift up your fists in revenge
The stage is set
Who will be the first to blink?
We can't go to war
Remember that ""Vietnam thing""
Peace at any price
With a gun to your head, bang, bang

Weakness runs in your family
What runs in mine is death
This is your 5 minute warning
Burn all your classified documents
And if cooler heads don't prevail
First strike from a political dead man
Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive
He understands only one language, action!
And he respects only one word, force!
No sign of them stopping,
No time for back channel communiques
We need all the help we can get, air strikes and invasions!
Retaliate, I say!

The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war
Blackmail the Universe with the greatest of calamities
Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground
With their skin destroyed, unjust to innocence
Lawful possessor of the world's last 24 hours

And in hatred you see men as they really are
If chosen over heaven, Earth will have been for them

I thought that I knew everything
I could make it in this scene
To be a rising star that only gleamed
But all the answers disagreed
With the questions held for me
I was legal now at twenty-one

I knew the way the world should run
My God just look what I had done
Simply drunk and having fun
Looked for friends, but I found none
All alone at twenty-one

That I was still even half alive
Somehow I managed to survive
I felt my body's doing time
And In my back a hundred knives
From friends at twenty-five

I'd buy your life, if you would sell
A year or two, if less compelled
So live your life and live it well

It wasn't if it would happen, it was when

Calling their firepower an unneeded expense

Its opiates for the masses under cloak as hope and change

And the perfect pawn
To spew the party line
Of the perfect falsehood

Es ging uns nur um Spaß an der Mucke
D. hat organisiert und produziert
Wir haben für Jams den Keller bei seinen Eltern okkupiert
Mit dem 8-Spur-Gerät, Mann leg jetzt One Take
Am Mikro, schreib’ lieber gleich so, dass auch was geht
Wenn du’s abliest vom Blatt, en masse Reefer gepafft
Die ganze Zeit gechillt und Lieder gemacht
Vier Mann Crew, drei die gerappt haben
Doch einer nur, bei dem sie gleich so geflasht waren
Und ich bekam Möglichkeiten
Meinen Kragen zu weiten, meinen Namen zu verbreiten
Du konntest dich freuen oder mich dafür beneiden
Doch jeder hat selbst seinen Pfad zu beschreiten
Damals dachten wir, wir schaffen’s zu viert
Hab’ die Texte noch auf englisch fabriziert, aber

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war
Und wie sich alles wandelt, wird hinterher erst klar

Ich hätt' es gleich wissen sollen: Es hat nicht gepasst
Sie wollte mehr und ich nur eine Nacht, schon gab’s Krach
Wollt' kein Arschloch sein, wir verstanden uns gut sonst
Also Zweifel runterschlucken, schauen was auf uns zukommt
Wir steigerten uns rein, sie sah Heiraten und Heim
Zweisamkeit, trotzdem gab es Eifersüchteleien
Sie fühlte sich besorgt und ich fühlte mich gestalked
Wir waren eigentlich klüger, doch wütend genügte nicht das Wort
Sie hat mir ein paar gewischt, ich hab’ ihr ein paar gewischt
Ich schlug eine Frau auf der Straße bei Tageslicht
War das ich? An dem Tag ist irgendwas gestorben innen
Mama schau nur das Monster, das ich geworden bin
Will so nicht sein, Hilflosigkeit
Will nur weg, doch sie will, dass ich bleib und ich will nicht
Ich will sie nicht mal ansehen
Doch ich hab’ mir Schuld aufgeladen, also muss ich meinen Mann stehen
Alles wurde schlimmer und als ich endlich die Vernunft hatte
Mich loszumachen, dacht’ ich nur solo für immer
Nie wieder Beziehung, in die ich was investiere
Jetzt hab’ ich ’ne Frau und eine Familie

Es kommt alles anders, wird nie mehr was es war
Und wie sich alles wandelt, wird hinterher erst klar

Ich bin einen weiten Weg gekommen seit ich ging
Schau’ zurück und die Dinge bekommen einen Sinn
Die Zukunft ist nicht nur, was ich für mich gestalte
Trotzdem muss ich tun, was ich für richtig halte
Und ich hab’ viele Fehler gemacht in dieser Sache
Hätte nie gedacht, dass ich es mal bis hierhin schaffe
Ein Wunder wie die Seele sich heilt
Wir haben bis unser Weg sich teilt ein Stück des Weges geteilt zusammen
Vielleicht begegnet man sich auf ’ner Kreuzung
Was früher wichtig war, hat heute kaum Bedeutung
Altes stirbt, doch kann zu Erneuerung führen
Wie wenn wir Schmerz erleiden, um dann wieder Freude zu spüren
Auch wenn das Leben rast und sich die Veränderung Zeit lässt
Lerne ich dazu, immer wenn ich denke ich weiß jetzt
Neues erreicht, altes begann das
Nichts bleibt gleich, alles wird anders

Mehr sein, mehr als du warst, du kannst ein Stern sein

Er ist leben, er ist sterben, er’s Berserker, er ist Arzt
Es ist ernst, er ist kein Scherz, er isst gleich mal paar
Rapper auf, Rapper lauf, er’s pervers mit Reimen am Start
Er’s ein sehr gescheiter Versdesigner, er ist einfach stark
Er ist Gärtner, seine Verse sind die Ernte seiner Saat
Er isst, wenn er Hunger hat, er isst, weil er jagt
Er frisst, er ist dunkle Macht, er ist einfach Darth
Er ist Sith, er ist Jedi, er trifft’s Herz mit seiner Tat

Planet dreht sich um Knete
Raketen gehen in die Sphäre
Wir geben Hundert Prozent
Der Mensch, König des Dschungels, König von Nichts
Holz den Dschungel ab für schönere Sicht
Stutz dem Phönix die Flügel vor der Reise zu höheren Hügeln
Es war irgendwann das Ziel, doch wir zögern, ermüden
Der Schlaf scheint so willkommen, doch eilt mir davon
Ich schreibe ’nen Song, high im Beton
Heim will ich kommen
Aber dieser Weg ist noch weit durch die Dunkelheit also schein’ so wie Sonnen
Die Zeit wie zerronnen, sie eilt dir davon
Was bleibt ist verkommen, das Leid hat begonnen
Heim will ich kommen
Aber dieser Weg ist noch weit durch die Dunkelheit also schein so wie Sonnen

Hoffentlich denk’ ich nur zu viel nach
Alles ist gut und mir fehlt nur ein bisschen Schlaf
Hoffentlich fühlt es sich nur so an
Als wär’ die Krone auf meinem Kopf in Wirklichkeit ein Dornenkranz

Alles gut, mir fehlte nur ein bisschen Schlaf
Ich hab’ geblutet, jeder Tag war wie ’ne Kugel, die mich traf
Hab’ meine Zukunft nie geplant, ich bin damals einfach losgegangen
Die Show begann und heute schreit das Publikum meinen Namen
Wollt’ nie auf Partys sein, die Fans machen Musiker zu Stars
Im Nachhinein betrachtet war die Jugendzeit für’n Arsch
In der Schule nie am Start, keine Klausuren, kein Diktat
Wer selber sucht und hinterfragt, braucht kein gutes Resultat
Denn was gut ist für den Staat, muss nicht gut sein für uns
Sie verletzen mich, so texte ich mit Blut meine Kunst
Hab’ genug meiner Jungs scheitern sehen, wir bleiben stehen
Doch sollten weitergehen und Hürden einfach nehmen so wie ein Leichtathlet
Du findest deine Wege zum Glück
Als ich nur stehenblieb und nach vorne schaute, ließ mich dieses Leben zurück
Ich mein’, ich sterb’ nicht dran, doch lernte manchmal gibt es nichts zu Ernte Dank
Ich schalt’ die Birne aus, schalt den Fernseher an und denke mir nur

Hoffentlich denk’ ich nur zu viel nach
Alles ist gut und mir fehlt nur ein bisschen Schlaf
Hoffentlich fühlt es sich nur so an
Als wär’ die Krone auf meinem Kopf in Wirklichkeit ein Dornenkranz

Denn der Radius unseres Lebens beträgt 50 Kilometer
Und soweit können unsere Augen sehen, Augen sehen
Und unsere Arme reichen gerade, um die Glühbirne zu wechseln
Unsere Probleme dafür einmal um den Planet, einmal um den Planet

Hoffentlich denk’ ich nur zu viel nach
Alles ist gut und mir fehlt nur ein bisschen Schlaf

Der Fluch und der Segen, die kostbare Heimat, das Fehlen der Wurzeln
Die Ängste, die Krisen, die Hürden, die Wege, die Schritte, die Stufen
Die Zweifel, der Glaube, die Kämpfe, die Ziele, die Bürde, die Tränen, das Schwitzen und Bluten

Will endlich ankommen! Aber muss ich übermenschlich sein, ein Muster für die Menschen?

Denn sie blendet jede andre Stadt in grelles Licht
Die Straße scheint, wir tragen Königsketten
Wenn wir sie löhnen wenn wir betteln, weil wir böse rappen
Wir treiben uns rum, haben die Schule geschwänzt
Rum gestresst, denn jeder war im Jugendarrest
Hat einen Gerichtstermin
Das hier ist Berlin
Deutsche wollen in diese Stadt, doch haben's nicht verdient

Waren nur ein zwei Stunden in dein kleines Kaff
Doch wir nehmen euch die Schmach wie ein eigenes Land
Es ist unglaublich, man sieht Blaulicht überall
Hier ist Silvester schon am ersten Mai
Und fast jeder hat bewirkt was mit großen Tabu
Mit deinen Fehlern am Block von den Bullen im Zug
Die Lichter brennen wenn das Nachtleben losbricht lichterloh
Groupies werden hier bedroht

Wenn du nicht raust kommst, wir laufen ein Stück

Und du boxt dich von unten durch

Figaro, der Architekt der verlorenen Bibelstrophe
Das Leben gräbt sich stetig in mein Antlitz ein
Geht tief, es muss wohl auf der Suche nach Atlantis sein
Entkam den Flammen auf der Fährte eines Phönix
Reiche Hände wie ein Bettler mit dem Herzen eines Königs
Nichts Gewöhnliches
Blende die Schweine mit dem Perlenschimmer
Schreib im Kerzenlicht, während ich alleine bin im Bernsteinzimmer
Nichts währt für immer, hier um den Moment zu treffen
Such in den Trümmern, um daraus ein Monument zu pressen
Bis mir meine Dämonen aus den Händen fressen
Taste ich mich blind stolpernd durch die engen Wendeltreppen
Mit jedem Atemzug meinen Ahnen näher
Keine wahren Gegner seit dem Ende der Titanen-Ära
Gerüstet für die letzte Schlacht im All

Die Zukunft liegt mumifiziert in einer Stahlkassette
Tanz dieses Sprachballett, bis ich sie in ihrem Grab erwecke
Im Spiegel nur der Bruchteil einer Kraterfläche
Was ich fühle, muss ich erst noch mischen auf der Farbpalette
Die Adlerklauen krallen sich den Schlangenleib
Ein Kampf im Schein des Vollmonds wirft Schatten der Vergangenheit
Verseucht mit tausend Viren, will ich aus dem Asphalt herausflorieren
Und von einem Grashalm zu ’nem Baum mutieren
Breite meine Flügel aus, um mich hinaufzuschwingen
Manchmal zieht man auch mit einem Aussichtslos den Hauptgewinn
Vertrau den Sinnen und nimm das grad Erkannte hin
Geh die Lavalampe dimmen und die Saga kann beginnen

Ich navigier mit 'nem goldenen Kompass
Ein Seelenreisender, Sphären beschreitender Seher

Ich seh' nur blinde Zöglinge, einäugige Könige

Euer Zeug hat 'n Bart, unser Zeug is' Avantgarde

Und lenk Wort vorbei am Zensor ins Fan-Ohr – Tor

Kreis um diesen Stern, als wär' er zwischen dem Benz-Grill
Feil an der Kunst und beschütze den Tempel

Fliegt mit uns, Max und Moabiter Jungs
So viel liegt hinter uns, vor uns leuchtet's golden auf
Wo Regen reinigt, kommt die Sonne aus den Wolken raus

Und die Magie passiert unverkrampft, aus Versehen
Im Glauben gehen, nach dem Untergang auferstehen
Sie können nix mehr machen, außer lauter drehen
Hinhören, genau verstehen, vielleicht auch was sehen

Will ich dich belügen, dann durchschaust du mich mit Leichtigkeit

Du kannst den Schmerz, kannst die Wunden und die Narben sehen

Und wenn wir uns begegnen, will ich dafür gradestehen

Und auch wenn du bei mir bist, bin ich allein

Geh, stopf dir die Taschen, geh die Stofftiere packen

Eh's zu spät ist, lass ich alle Sicherungen springen

Entspringen einer Blütezeit gemeinsamer Ideen

Hab im Geburtskanal gesteckt ohne Sauerstoff, Schlauch im Kopf
Schwor, wenn ich rauskomm, wird jemand ausgeknockt
Links, rechts, links und ich denk's, rapp's, sing's
Und ich trink sechs Drinks, während du mir dein Demo vorspielst
Sagst du „Findst' wack, stimmt's?""
Und ich nicke mit dem Kopf
Und jetzt beweg dein Arsch, Bon Voyage, ihr seid gefickt, Pornostars
Wie man den Scheiß hier rippt, ist für mich keine Frage des Honorars
Nur eine Frage der Ehre, ich kam auf die Erde und sah in die Leere und wollte sie füllen
Machte Karriere wie im Hollywoodfilm, dann kamen die Kerle und wollten mich killen
Und mich einsperren, aber ich sah in den Wolken ein Bild, und hab jetzt
Das Ziel vor Augen, kann es einfach nicht verfehlen
Und ich gestalte meinen Weg durch diese Reime, die ich wähl'
Ich behalt meine Ideen nicht, nein, ich teile sie mit jedem, der sie hören will
Aber viele können mich scheinbar nicht verstehen, fick sie

Nix im Magen, viel zu lang am Darben
Keine Klagen, darf nicht versagen
Ohne Ziel zu beginnen ist ein bisschen ohne Sinn
Wollt ich wissen wo ich bin, müsst ich raten
Ich leere meinen Kopf, entferne die Fragen
Augen offen, aber ich schaue nur nach innen
Nur noch konzentriert auf meinen Atem
Ich hör den Beat, leg die Bars hin
Lauf los, immer einen Schritt vor dem Wahnsinn
Spür' den Fahrtwind, gleit' durch die Straßen
Nichts zählt, ich bleibe nicht stehen, bis ich da bin
Schmerz kommt in Phasen, mit der Zeit
Trauer, Wut, Gleichgültigkeit
Ich lauf bis der Geist sich befreit, bis zum Streik in den Waden
Bis sich die Zweifel zerschlagen
Und wenn ich ankomm', schau ich nach oben
Doch der Himmel, ist noch da wo er war

Gedanken, die mich einholen und hetzen
Bilder, die vorbeiziehen in Fetzen, muss mich absetzen
'nen Vorsprung schaffen und Ordnung machen
Im C-H-A-Os, vamos!
Kick's hart wie Roberto Carlos
Ich hustle wie die Jungs in Lagos
Für immer ein Hustler, das Leben ist planlos
Versteh nur Bahnhof, so wie ein Schaffner
Doch ich muss schnell spielen
Ich will hinaus in die Welt ziehen
Wie schnell ich auch lauf, ich kann nicht vor mir selbst fliehen
Ich komm vom Weg ab, Seitenwind
Augen die mich quälen, Tränen, die nicht meine sind
Als kleines Kind schon geprägt von den Ängsten
Einziger Weg ist aufstehen und kämpfen
Krieg nichts geschenkt, ich spreng' Grenzen
Solange ich im Rennen bin
Und wenn ich ankomm', schau ich nach oben
Doch der Himmel ist noch da, wo er war

Ich renn, so als hätt' ich das Stehenbleiben verlernt
Als wär' da 'ne Million nur zehn Meilen entfernt
Hoffentlich bin ich gleich da
Der Weg ist weit, das Ziel scheint unerreichbar
Warum rennen, ich weiß nicht, ich mach's halt
Die Zeit tickt, der Nike trifft den Asphalt
Ich laufe nur der Zeit hinterher
Doch ich kann sie einholen und ein klein bisschen mehr noch
Der Preis, der da winkt als Ansporn
Das gute Leben sehen, ein paar Sitze ganz vorn
Zu dem geilen Film dann die Beine hochlegen
Seh's so real, denke gleich könnt's losgehen
Szenen surreal, schwarz-weiß gezeichnet
Die ganze Strecke in den Grabstein gemeißelt
So lang gerannt, um die Uhr zu entmachten
Nie gestoppt, um in Ruhe zu betrachten

Noch viel anderer als all die ganzen anderen
Und entspricht das nicht deinen Wünschen

Megaloh,"Zwei Uhr dreißig und ich frag mich
Wohin mit mir, ich bin noch hellwach
Alles neblig, die Stunden ewig
Ich kenn das schon, wieder so ‘ne Nacht

Ich bin irgendwo, ein anderer Film
Draußen die Stadt, hier drin alles still
Ich komm nicht zur Ruh
Krieg kein Auge zu
Was soll ich tun

Ich liege hier und finde keinen Schlaf
Denke über nichts und alles nach
Das Bett erscheint unendlich leer und weit
Die Zeiger drehen sich mit mir im Kreis
Schlaflos vergeht die Zeit

Drei Uhr zwanzig und im Nachtlicht
Werden alle Schatten übergroß
Tausend Fragen, ich hör mich atmen
Der Sturm in mir lässt mich nicht los
Wer soll ich sein und wo will ich hin
Macht dieses Chaos irgendwann Sinn
Ich komm nicht zur Ruh
So sehr ich's versuch'
Was soll ich tun

Ich liege hier und finde keinen Schlaf
Denke über nichts und alles nach
Das Bett erscheint unendlich leer und weit
Die Zeiger drehen sich mit mir im Kreis
Schlaflos vergeht die Zeit

Schon so spät, ich kann nicht schlafen
Zähl die Segen statt Schafe
Seh Probleme statt Schafe
Finde alles, nur Schlaf nicht
Die Gedanken ziehen Kreise
Große Zeiger drehen Runden
Kleine Zeiger gehen nach unten
Die bekannte Spielweise
Lieg da in dunkelster Nacht
Seh Sachen, die sonst nicht klar sind
Außer gerade
Wo ich außer schlafen nichts vorhab
Indessen, trotz Pille
Mit Morpheus kein Treffen
Warum bin ich wach
Denk an meine Jungs,
Die ihren Weg nicht sehen
Es sind Krisen, die lähmen
Perspektiven, die fehlen
Denk an Mama, wie sie älter wird
Denk daran, wie mich die Welt verwirrt
Krieg im Kopf das Gefühl zu kleiner Räume
Die Gedanken führen mich weg
Vom Reich der Träume (Träume)
Denk an Rechnungen und die To Do’s
Lieg im Bett, bin gestresst
Es gibt so viel zu tun
Ich will in Frieden ruhen
Sagen sie deshalb
„Schlafen kannst du auch, wenn du tot bist“?
Der Wecker klingelt
Meine Nacht ist vorbei
Ich muss aufstehen und los jetzt
Also los jetzt

Denke über nichts und alles nach

Megaloh,"Ich hörte schon im Kindergarten, Leute zu mir Nigga sagen
Grad wenn man für etwas steht, erfährt man sehr oft Niederlagen
Wollte nie 'n Prediger sein, eher 'n Aufklärer
Wollte mich nicht boxen, ich war eher so der Lautsprecher
Wuchs auf, fremd im eigenen Land, kein Ausländer
Schrieb drinnen Texte, hoffte, dass sich was da draußen ändert
Aber die Texte werden jährlich aktueller
Ich will, dass mich Leute hören, deshalb rap ich Acapella, wuh
Schwarzer Panter wie T'Challa in Wakanda, Brothers Keepers

Und fick H&M, Handelsembargo, Frieden für alle Farben
Ein Remix für Adriano

Yeah, woo, jau, woo

Das geht eins, zwei, drei, let's go

Jetzt ist die Zeit, hier ist der Ort
Hier, heute ist die Nacht, Torchmann hat das Wort
Denk' ich an Deutschland in der Nacht
Bin ich um meinen Schlaf gebracht
Mein Bruder Adriano wurde umgebracht
Hautfarbe, schwarz, Blut, rot, Schweigen ist Gold
Gedanken sind tiefblau
Ein Bürger hat Angst vor seinem Volk
Ein Wintermärchen aus Deutschland, blauer Samt
Als Kind schon erkannt, hier bin ich fremd im eigenen Land
Operation Artikel 3, da habt ihr gelacht
Jungs, das ist mein Leben, das ha'm wir uns nicht ausgedacht
In all den Jahren in denen wir Airplay verschwendet haben
Man könnte denken, wir Rapper hätten nichts zu sagen
Doch es rächt sich, ihr werdet sehen, es holt uns ein
Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein

Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein (oh, oh)
Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein

Dies ist so was wie eine letzte Warnung
Denn unser Rückschlag ist längst in Planung
Wir fallen dort ein, wo ihr auffallt
Gebieten eurer braunen Scheiße endlich Aufhalt (yeah)
Denn was ihr sucht ist das Ende
Was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände
Euer Niedergang für immer
Und was wir hören werden, ist euer Weinen und euer Gewimmer

Ich rapp' für meinen Bruder, denn ich könnte auch das Opfer sein
Falscher Ort, falsche Zeit, da hilft dir auch nicht tapfer sein
Wie viel Blut muss fließen in innerdeutschen Krisen
Alter, schau die letzen Jahre haben das mir zu oft bewiesen
Dass die Menschen sich erheben, wenn die Leute nicht mehr leben
Doch dann ist es zu spät, ihr solltet öfters drüber reden
Also, wie ist das möglich? Manchmal ist es doch tödlich
Gerechtigkeit, denn nicht nur Adriano hat es nötig

Zu viele Promis machen politische Promo-Gigs
Ich hoff' der Track hier ist 'n Dildo, der die Zone fickt
Ich will nix mehr erzählen zum Nationalbefreien
Ich sage K, sage Z, sage Nazis rein
Ich will nicht labern, denn ich kenn' mein Vaterland
Macht es mich krank wie Masern, dann verspür ich Tatendrang
Ich fühle mich eingeengt und will statt Prominenz
Und statt großer Fans, Nazis, die wie Poster hängen

Und was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände (ah)
Euer Niedergang für immer
Und was wir hören werden, ist euer Weinen und euer Gewimmer

Zuviel ungereimte Scheiße, nicht genug Protest
Rechter Terror wird verharmlost so wie Schulhofstress
Trotz Beweisen, Wahrheitsfindung bleibt ein Suchprozess
Keine Gerechtigkeit beim NSU-Prozess
Zu viele, die immer wieder weggesehen haben
Keiner redet hier gerne von echten Fehlern
Rechte Politik gefällt den rechten Wählern
Rechte Polizisten helfen rechten Tätern
Rechte Zellen in unserm Heer kommen nicht von ungefähr
Wehrmachtsveteranen starteten die Bundeswehr
Für viele ist das nur Geschichte und nicht mehr
Die alten Geschichten interessieren die Jungen nicht mehr
Sie sagen, „Reg dich ab, lass es hinter dir“
Aber wenn der Fremdenhass nicht endet, was beginnt dann hier?
Und wie erzieh ich mein Kind dann hier?
Asylantenheime brennen noch immer hier, was

The next time you're comparing me, 
Check what you never did, believe in me.
Fuck you and your 2 faced crew, 
And tonight you support everything we do
Check 1 that's right we ain't begging for none
So solid crew there're on radio 1

But you're there and we can talk to the girls and screw

Don't pull out your gat fast; don't drive in an A-class

Can we fight the way, back to yesterday?
Can we hit rewind back to a better time?

I almost wish we didn't meet
It's not enough to keep a romance sweet

Play a duet
That will make you forget
Where you are.

It's the beat of her heart saying,
""Let me be your star.""

With a song in her heart
As she's waiting to start the adventure.
The fire and drive
That make dreams come alive,
They fill her soul.
She's in control.

The tears just like pearls.
Well, they're all in this girl's repertoire.
It's all for the taking,
And it's magic we'll be making.

Forget what used to be.

The future is here with me.

I try to find the truth between all the lies
When Bleeding is feeling and feeling ain't real
Will I see you when I open my eyes?
Will I see you when I open my eyes?

When Breathing's a burden we all have to bear
And trust is one thing we're taught never to share
Somehow you just seem to shine
When loving means breaking and saying goodbye

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain, and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe, a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you, I never get burned

Caught in a trap of what we're taught to believe
When night overcomes day, life's so hard to perceive
And the clock keeps on ticking through night-shattered skies
Where the stars are all broken, and so are all the ties
But the one thing remaining is you
When I'm broken and bleeding, you pull me right through

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do
When you help heal the pain, and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe, a wonder to the world
And somehow, when I'm with you there's nothing I'd rather do
Than be right there
To escape my own life and all my fear
And I cant feel
Am I really real?

Come and wipe all my tears
Come and wipe all my tears

And I can't help but wonder what it is you do

Let me sway like the shade of a tree
Let me swirl like a cloud in a storm on the sea.
Wish me on my way

Through the dawning day I,
Wanna flow, wanna rise, wanna spill
Wanna grow, wanna grow
On the side of a hill.

I don't care if the train runs late
If the checks won't clear
If the house blows down.

I'll be off where the weeds run wild
Where the seeds fall far from this
Earthbound town.

And I'll start to soar!
Watch me rain til I pour out!
I'll catch a ship and it'll sail me astray
Get caught in a wind and I'll just have to obbey time
Time flying away! 
Flight!
Ah
Ah
Ah
Let me leave behind
All the clouds in my mind I
Wanna wake without wondering why
Finding myself for a burst for the sky!
Flight!
Flight!

I'll just roll!
Let me lose all control I
Wanna float like a wish in a well
Free as the sound of the sea in a shell

I don't know 
But maybe I'm just a fool

I should keep to the ground
I should stay where I'm at
Maybe everyone has hunger like this
And the hunger will pass 
But I can't think like that

All I know is that somewhere in a clearing (somewhere)
There's a grain of sunlight on a river long and wide

And I have such a river inside!

Like snow blushing in the sunlight
And I'd melt you
Like morning into twilight

Would you chain me
In view of the endless sky world
From the window
Wind reaches, desperate, through the cage bars
To seize me
And I'd die in your arms
But not your heart
If it please you

Fire flies and so do I
I fly high to hide in flight
Why, I delight in blue sky
It's almost like dying

Mocking bird
I'd fly all around
Top of the world
And never come down
From here

If I were a mocking bird
I'd give you feathers
And my very own blood
And other treasures
Which you keep on your dresser at night
In corner darkness
By the candle that you never light
Though it be moonless

Fire flies, so do I
I fly to hide in flight
Why, I delight in blue sky
It's so much, so much like dying

Against the tide
I'd fly all around
With the wind
And never come down

I'm swinging on the rocking chair
It's kinda dark on the horizon
But that's only 'cause the sun ain't there
As I sat the moon started rising
And I remembered like it were yesterday
It was kinda dark beyond the horizon
He had come to take me away

I don't know, I don't know of course
I don't know I don't know why life is so short

As I stood the moon started rounding
She saw him dismounting his horse
In the dark he led himself by starlight
To the porch and from the far lights of the storm
And as she stood the moon started rounding
Her heart started pounding like a fist on the door
From the dark she heard her name that he was saying
And that's what she was waiting for

I don't know, I don't know if it's tame enough there
I don't know, if I go, will I miss it out here

She would go but doubt slowly killed it
Where her love just could not fill it up again
And he just knew he didn't have to ask her
He did not run it past her if this were the end

So she walked here hair flowing behind her
As a gentle reminder that she was only a child
And it was dark but he gently kissed her
He knows he won't forget her with a hint of a smile
And as she cried he cast back a shadow behind him
And it did remind him that there were stars up there too
And it was dark but he gently kissed her
I'm so sorry I could not accompany you

I don't know, I don't know why it just wouldn't be
I don't know I don't know why I couldn't be company
I don't know I don't know
I don't know I don't know
But why couldn't you just stay here with me?

Quasi convinto che in fondo sia meglio così
Allentare la presa per merito di
Chi mi consola ed esorta alla rinuncia
Ma la pelle rigetta quel sorriso che
Trapiantato da bocche riverenti
No, lo sai non funziona su di me

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1993

Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car

Mehdi Favéris-Essadi,"J'me fous du monde et prépare ma libération
Je suis le nouvel observateur en pleine expansion
T'as le droit de savoir ce qui me révolte
Je suis un envoyé spécial remonté à 3000 volts
Les complaintes de la reconnaissance c'est ce qui m'a blessé
Toute mon enfance à me chercher je l'ai passé
Avec ce manque de reconnaissance ce qui m'a décidé
Y'a une faille dans ton système putain c'est que j' t'ai percé
Disiz la peste j'prône la paix tout le monde le sait
Avec j'pète les plombs j'ai eu tout ce succès
On m'a invité à faire des émissions pour que je joue ce rôle
Essaye de me faire croire que mes paroles ne sont que drôles
Quand ils veulent du sensationnel ils appellent Joey Starr
Quand c'est du negro peace and love c'est Mc solaar
Essaye de me coudre sur la peau cette étiquette
Avec des points de suture en fer pour que jamais je ne l'enlève
L'étiquette du rappeur casquette basket misogyne et sans hygiène
Pas grand chose dans la tête
C'que je viens annoncer à cet auditoire est effroyable
C'est que depuis le départ je joue leur jeu c'est vrai mais incroyable
Je suis parfait prototype qui contrecare tous tes clichés
L'antithèse du rap de base avec qui tu nous a lynché
Depuis Olivier Cachin et paris city rappin
HIP HOP ce cliché fut rapide
Je suis ton nouveau prof d'histoire j'te remémore ses éléments
C'est grave aujourd'hui les cd sont les livres de demain
Wesh mon frère, laisse cette pierre, laisse cette innocente vitrine
Si c'est toi qui tires tu transformes le tireur en victime
Je souffle sur ce molotov que tu mets sous ce coffre
Quel cadeau tu leur offres ils ont rendu ton âme amorphe
Pose ce molotov pour eux j'ai mieux que du héros j'ai l'étoffe
J'écris des textes sur des feuilles qui tombent partout comme en automne
Retranscris notre histoire à pleins livres en plusieurs tomes
Grossiste j'te vends d'la vérité j'peux t'en livrer des tonnes
Métisse donc pas monochrome c'est un homme au cromi
On m'a promis pour trop me le mettre
Depuis la petite école et ces maîtres envoie-leur ce sms
Maîtres et maîtresses pour moi le monde est une bibliothèque
Merci de m'avoir appris à lire maintenant gardez vos cours
J'apprenais plus vite dans la cour merci beaucoup
Pire qu'un pavé pire qu'un molotov
C'que j'aime c'est apprendre et ensuite je le rap et des gens m'entendent
J'me cultive lis des livres fais des noeuds avec mes racines
On nous a pas tout appris donc j'vous envoie un signe
Personne ne m'a dit d'où je venais j'ai dû chercher moi-même
Et ça y est je me suis retrouvé
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire, est-ce que tout le monde est présent
La tâche sera dure, 5 minutes pour parler de 500 ans


Ah ouais t'as toujours pas compris que j'ai repris ce que tu m'avais pris
Avec ceux-ci je reconstruis ce que tu as détruit
Dans les librairies j'ai appris ce qui n'a pas de prix
Je prie pour que ces écrits portent un jour leurs fruits
Maîtresse tu m'as rien appris sur mon Afrique
Est-ce que parce que t'as honte ou bien parce que t'as tout pris
Tu m'as pas dit que la guerre d'Indochine c'était de ta faute
Tu m'as pas dit que la guerre d'Algérie c'était de ta faute
Tu m'as pas dit que si l'Afrique est pauvre c'est de ta faute
Tu m'as pas dit que l'Occident a fait un puzzle avec le monde
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire, le cours d'aujourd'hui c'est sur thiaroye 44
Tu m'as parlé de Molière, Flaubert, Baudelaire
Moi c'est Senghor, Saizère et Martin Luther
Tu m'as parlé de De Gaulle et de Napoléon
Moi c'est Mandela, Loumoumba et Steeve Biko
Où sont les discussions à Saint Germain de Boris Vian, Sartre
Tu as oublié de nous dire qu'ils nous ont fait du bien
Maîtresse tu m'as pas dit qu'après la seconde guerre mondiale
10 ans fut le temps de l'embargo contre l'Allemagne
10 ans pour un pays qui a embrasé le monde
Alors que déjà 12 ans pour l'Irak et ses puits de pétrole
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire
Je prépare mes cours très tard le soir
Contre les politiques qui devant le pupitre se lèvent et mentent
Je bois un thé à la menthe et là je rappe avec véhémence
L'icône que tu me donnes me pousse à être stupide
Ta culture de masse m'asphyxie et j'la suicide
J'suis pas communiste j'suis pas islamiste je suis juste lucide
Et je sais ce que je sais
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire dans ce Etat français
Monsieur le prof, les Egyptiens étaient des négroïdes
Où je l'ai su ? C'est Cheikh Anta Diop qui me l'a dit
Les caucasiens ont un passé assez sombre
L'apogée de vos anciens empires a ses ombres
Nous ne sommes pas assez nombreux
Ce cours d'histoire aujourd'hui c'est pour comprendre
Adopter le mot prendre, oublier le mot rendre
Garde ton argent, tu penses payer nos cendres
Mes connaissance augmentent de janvier à décembre
Attention je ne discute plus en bas d'un hall
ni au pied d'un baobad tard le soir au Sénégal
Pas autour d'un bedo ni autour d'une teillbou

Here's on the street

A cloak of deceit
Brings honour to shame

(Where are you now?)
Is the one I can't let go

You are the reason
My faith in tomorrow
A Distant horizon
The one I must follow
You are the first, You are the last

I'help you to see
The light in the dark
The sun through the rain
Until you are free
And facing the truth
That words can't explain
But the truth I think you know(Tell me)
I could never let you go

You are the spell that has been cast

When you decided to stop the fight

All I know
Your spirit keeps living within me
Wherever I go
Your spirit keeps moving within me
Breaking every law that I know
Your spirit keeps running within me
Your spirit is...........

Higher dimensions
And stars in-between
Itç£? easy to hear, you calling
Illusions of life
Tell me how could it be
I feel so alive when Iç£? falling

I see you
When I close my eyes
Walking through space and time
Climbing the stairs
Just to touch the sky

Stick

Your spirit is:...........
The wine that Iç£? drinking
The tears that I cry(deep in the ocean)
And all I believe in
In these dreams of mine

To your body, to your soul!

'Cause when the God come you know he gon' be putting it down
Everything we do be blowing, better get on the ground

Bodies'll turn up missing, I promise you need to listen
Abolish the need for bitching, I polish and shine and glisten

Hardest to smash another artist son, regardless if it is

A nigga who think he the greatest son I'll lock him in the fridge
And hang him from both of his ankles when we drop him from the bridge
Blocking your paper really stopping that dude from getting his
Popping the safe and splurging, having the crew up in the crib

Block 'til these niggas having 'em rocking gargle with a bib
Shitting and farting, spitting and vomiting all in the crib
Falling into shock from the bullets we shot up in they ribs
Hot up the block and blew up the spot and got up out the mix

Tried it a couple stops and spotted the Squad up in they whips
Plotted and then I signed on the dotted line and made a wish

Shooting, shooting, shooting, high, low, vertical or horizontal
And if you were making plans I do think you gon' have to cancel
Sorry I had to ask you, save it I have to blast you
Taking a chance to laugh from you making the masses gas you

So now you thinking that you tough and that we can't get at you
Change up your mind and leave you stiffer than a massive statue
Tired of talking need to use all your precautionary measures
Washing off the blood hauling the water force of steady weather

You can handle it or you can't, it be only getting better
Like a candle, we burn your chandles and make you feel the pressure
Cocking it back, articulating the flow just like a lecture
Break it down and rebuilding the flow, now peep the architecture

It ain't safe., in the current state, of our democracy
Terrorism, motherfuckers bombing New York, shit is crazy

Considerably my 9 milli hit you at any angle

Shootin', shootin', shootin' - high, low, verticle or horizontal
And if you were makin' plans I do think you goin' have to cancel
Sorry I had to ask you, save it I have to blast you
Takin a chance to laugh from you makin' the ma**es gas you

So now you thinkin' that you tough and that we can't get at you
Change up your mind and leave you stiffer than a massive statue
Tired of talkin' need to use all your precautionary measures
Washin' off the blood haulin' the water force of steady weather

You can handle it or you can't, it be only gettin' better
Like a candle, we burn your chandles and make you feel the pressure
C***in it back, articulatin' the flow just like a lecture
Break it down and rebuildin' the flow, now peep the architecture

We made it through the storm

I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to
Satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration, 
Be the real love that I need

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

Oh, when I met you I just knew that
You would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations 
Lead me to want some real love

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

I got to have a real love

Loves so true and oh baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer to
The question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards
A love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good luvin' though the summertime,
Winter, spring, and fall

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
Been around the world and high and low
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love 
'Cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way because it
Seems he can't be found

Mekon,"It was Saturday night and I'm feelin kinda sporty
Went to a bar and caught me a 40
Got kinda a high and a...kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came dressed, she said, ""Who the hell?""
Wait momma, wait, it's me ya little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
""I know who you are, but who the hell is that?""
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know, she got into the car
I musta picked her up when I left the bar
Ya know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, ""Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I want to be your lover
Just one thing:  I forgot to buy a rubber""
Wait a little while then we snuk upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in with a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please!
Put back your gun, put down your brew
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, ""Ya come a little closer and ya will get shot,
I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock.""

Oh yeah, them wild Saturday Nights

It was Saturday Night and I was feelin kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man who did I see?
But the super bad bitch lookin back at me
I said, ""Fly lady man, you got a big butt""
Bitch turned around, all she said was, ""What?""
I said, ""My name is Schoolly baby, I'm down with the Shores""
Before I knew it up came my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Sayin, ""Yo Schoolly Schooll, what time is it?""
Looked a little closer and I knew it was gag
What I thought was a girl was nothin but a fag


Everybody rappin but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rappin to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke
The cow got high and the boy got by
Just don't come in my face and ask me why

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah it's that cheeba cheeba makin 'em feel like that
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need

Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Smokin a J and scratchin' the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, ""Yo, what's up with that, bitch?""
But then down the road came Mary and her lambs
Smokin' a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They were 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Let me tell ya a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucka MCed, tried to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man tryin to stick up a bar
The judge said, ""Boy, what was on your mind?""
He said, ""I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine.""
The judge said, ""Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doin shit for the next ten years.""

Filled up with misery and pain

In praying to an imperfect might
Accepting the mutilated
Bodies of little babies
As payment for the luxury of
A so called real and poor church
Somewhere they lost the meaning
Twisted it never seeing
There's no justification
For this runaway creation
Nothing is true and nothing is false
While no one can build or destroy
Worlds in less than seven days
Nothing is gained and nothing is lost
It's all a game that has no rules
Reality is insepted by
Reality so all we see is
Created by electron waves
That flow out of a living screen
The truth is portrayted just like a show
Where hate rules all the winners take nothing
While a hypocritical humanity
Sends frozen kisses to a
Tortured people lawn-mowing
The endless mind of
Different thoughts projected
By clean white coats in a
Castle of science no one
Can control and what's more

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it

No matter what the others have, I'm glad that I'm Bugs Bunny!

For every place I'd ever go, I'd have to take my trunk!
Suppose I was a Zebra, with stripes from head to tail,
I'd bet they'd think that I'd escaped, and throw me back in jail!

Suppose I was a tall Giraffe, and swallowed carrots, yummy!
With that long neck, I'd surely starve before they reached my tummy.
Suppose I was a big fat pig I might as well be frank,
I wouldn't care to end up as some kiddie's piggy bank.

What's up, Doc?

Suppose I was a smelly skunk, I wouldn't have a friend.
I'd be alone excepting for, A cent I couldn't spend.
Suppose I was a 'Gator in the swamps where time would drag,
Until the day when I'd be made into a traveling bag

Suppose I was a turkey then I'd end up on a tray,
In the middle of the table on the next Thanksgiving Day.

Mel Brown,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything

And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe,2011

When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold

Reminiscing on my first slant,
By the time I was sipping on my first Schlitz
Hit the game, I started as a look out,
See the fly cars that the big wheelies pushed out,
Dirt bikes popping wheelies by the cookout, that was that summer,
I was thirst to be plumper. It pays better but the risk was worst,
Save the fly leather copping kicks with the work.
It didnt work; I was fucken up the re-up.
Bottles at the tunnel, that was 98, I called papa for the bundles,
An easy ten grand, it felt like a hundred,
These Gucci belts by the stomach, with guns in them.
Its only wealth that we want, if we run wit em
Till the death, until the feds come and get em
Byrd gang money, it started off that Byrd Kane Money
New cars, in that third lane money!

Getting money is the hardest,
Your first hundred grand is a job
Your first cool million, you're an artist.
Especially if the niggas up the block, sell garbage
Told it, crumbles all apart when you hold it
Wasn't naturally born a crook, I was molded
Drugs kept my uncles in the green, so I sold it
Even learned to smell a good grade through the packing
Headed Midwest and got financial backing
Started networking with the wheelies on credit
Any concepts of being robbed I was debited
Anybody get it, don't come a day later with the eigth money
Got to play it out, cause I said it
Courts an acquittal, coming in the club with an entourage
Me I'm the boss in the middle.
The brain and the bran roc-a-house rope around the neck
A lot of letters for the chain, and the charm. Come on man

Just clean my fancy car

Nigga stuck, then your mans a flip
The situation real, then your mans a hit
You slow on the get-a-way, the can you get
You circle the block, you play track and field
A lot of real niggas on that track got killed
But you know me forever manning up,
Never sit down when I pee, forever standing up
I'm a boss, so I'm calling the shots,
Big homie, pioneer of the block
You wanna pump, nigga Ill tell you when and where at
Don't face-fight; I'm not the one to stare at.
Matter of fact dog, you and your man sits,
In the back off cop car, dog, pointing your index
I guess you could, cause you a Sammy the Bull
But somebody gonna die if a hammer get pulled.

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,

Mel Matrix,"Give me a minute to get in it
Give me a minute with one of your main bitches
Mental fitness I demonstrate
Right in front of your eyes
Watch your bitch elevate from a five to a nine
Confidence booster all in her mind
And I'm checkin' every dollar and dime
(Come with me)
To the city where my committee chase titties and ass
(Are you ready? Come with me)
I'll show you where the check break fast
And we bust heads fast
If a nigga not in single file
Run up on him single style
Let the thing break him down
You love my methods
Take a nigga off the Earth if he on my shit list reckless

The one hundred block where you can your whole shit broken
Like Mystikal ""Still Smokin""
The life ??
And rent free
I never let nothin' live on my mind
I gotta grind (grind), shine
And fight for my grandma
And don't do nothin' stupid like Hammer
Til I go bankrupt
Steady drinkin' til I finish my cup
Then bust ya head before I shoot up the gut
Fresh outta Folsom and proper beef injections
Chosen selections
Cause girl I ain't fuckin' without protection
I'm harder than erection
Teachers so you study your lessons
And advise for that viewer discretion
On a scale to one to ten I get eleven
Give a toast to the pussy like Devin
And beat it up off Sprite and Seagram Seven
I've plottin' on a way to get rich
And keep bread out that cock
And all the folks in the hood aimin' for head
Shots of lead poppin'
Situation's crucial
And every nigga I'm wit is feelin' neutral
Fuck takin' ten paces
And drawin' down
This ain't no Western movie
Roll a Swisher, pass it to Ric
Sat the window wit the doobie
I'm lookin' at booty
Onion ass on the strip
You fine but baby girl where your whip
It's jumpin' off

While I'm outtie on the West
I got the best weed
And the best hoes
I'm on the block at all times dressed in the best clothes
My focus is money 'cause pussy come natural
I only fuck wit those that can show me some collateral
I deal 'em all off top
I ain't a child molester or a killer
I don't need y'all props
Shit, if she wit me, she know what it is
We hotellin' and you don't deserve to go to the crib
If yo potna wanna roll she can roll
I ain't gotta touch
I like to smoke and watch you freaky hoes
And I could have my choice
Enie, meenie, miney, mo
Bust a nut, get the fuck
Play it how it go
My main ho called and told me she made some money
I said ""Bitch you ain't never come gave it to me!""
How many woman now done wanna get gangsta for me
Gotta be willin' to get down on your hands and stomach

Wonderin' how I'd made it through the day

Wild eyed and crazy all burnt out from thinkin'
Wonderin' how the hell I's gonna say

Goodbye marie - oh goodbye Marie
Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie
If I cannot keep your love
At least I'll have your memory

Wakin' up beside you in the Tijuana mornin'
With that ocean breeze to keep us cool

Three weeks of lovin' - 21 nights of heaven
I stayed just long enough to be your fool

Mel McDaniel,"I left home this morning didn't say a word
The sound of your crying is the only thing I heard
What I had to say you wouldn't wanna hear
So I left you alone with your anger and tears

Anger and tears, anger and tears
Is that all that's left us after loving all these years
As slowly as love grows how soon it disappears
In a house full of anger and a heart full of tears

A face like an angel, a voice like a dove
I knew you were sent her from somewhere up above
Am I to blame for your changing through the years
Have I been the cause of all your anger and tears

Anger and tears, anger and tears
Is that all that's left us after loving all these years
As slowly as love grows how soon it disappears
In a house full of anger and a heart full of tears

I know that sometimes my temper ain't so good
'Cause things haven't worked out the way we thought they would
But let's don't give in to our doubts and our fears
Let's try to put an end to our anger and tears",Anger & Tears,1987

Mel McDaniel,"I used to be so lonely - I used to be so blue
There was a time I thought I'd never see love shinin' through
I could not find a spark of hope - there was darkness in the air
Then I found someone now the clouds are gone and I see love everywhere.

And I said,""Oh me - oh my - mercy mercy - love is everywhere""
Yeah, I said, ""ooh wee"" then I sighed, -- ""Land o'goshen
Love is everywhere""

There was a woman that I heard of - they say every night she cried
About a love that long ago had withered up and died
And then one night she was observed by the full light of the moon
With a swing in her hips and a song on her lips and a man
Up in her room

And she said, ""Oh me, oh my - mercy mercy - love is everywhere""
Yeah she said, ""Ooh, wee"" then she sighed, -- ""land o'goshen
Love is everywhere"" 

There was a man that lived next to me and I swear that his heart was hard
There wasn't no sunshine on his back porch and no flowers in his yard
He claimed that he'd looked high and low but love could not be found
But it didn't take much - just a woman's touch to turn his world around.

And he said, ""oh me - oh my - mercy mercy - love is everywhere""
Yeah he said, ""Ooh wee"" then he signed, -- ""land o'goshen
Love is everywhere""

At the walls of Jericho

Yes home is where our hurt is that's why we don't stay at home much anymore

Mel Tillis,"When you left I changed the locks on all the doors
And I swore I'd never let you in no more
But I feel your presence here just like a ghost
Each time I lock the door is when I feel it most
Am I locking someone out or someone in I've got a feeling you're in the house again
Oh I wish I knew what this was all about am I locking someone in or someone out

I just watch TV till league goes off each night
Then I lock the door and turn out all the lights
That's when you walk here and I just stand and stare
I flip back all the locks and find there's no one there

Mel Tillis,"I've had to burn most every bridge I've crossed
It seems like everyone I've loved I've lost
When I met you I thought my luck had turned
But our love's just another bridge to burn
I'll soon light the match and move on I've already lingered much too long
Now I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned and our love's just another bridge to burn

Sometimes one must love enough for two and that's how it's been with me and you

I'll soon light the match",Another Bridge to Burn,1968
Mel Tillis,"There's a girl in a barroom we all know her well
Her name it's the story that some may like to tell
She may be young and pretty with lips red as wine
A girl whose eyes reflect the years no makeup can't hide
In her world walk the lonely the rejected and condemn
It's a world that once sent her there's no turning back again
Like a rose that lies brushed and crumbled on the sand

She was created by heaven now destroyed by man
Destroyed by man and the love that she gave
Lost unless heaven canceled worthy the same
Men don't respect her still they hold her hand
She was created by heaven now destroyed by man",Destroyed by Man,1968
Mel Tillis,"While walking one day in the country I saw a gathering crowd
And as my footsteps threw me closer I smell a sweet fragrance of flowers
That looked like a family reunion and my eyes not counted the tears
And the no man said by the graveside I haven't seen Mary in years
Hold my hand and leave me leave me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary I haven't seen Mary in years

When Mary and I were first married we had such plans for our child
But for no reason I started rambling and like the four winds I just ran wild
If I could just live my life over I would bring Mary such cheers
Now she's gone where she'll never need me I haven't seen Mary in years
Hold my hand and leave me

Then the old man left the graveyard and I walked along by his side
I called out his name but through all his shame his son he did not rocognize
Hold my hand and leave me leave me away from here
How could I know it was mama I haven't seen mama in years",I Haven't Seen Mary in Years,1968
Mel Tillis,"Do you remember me lonely girl in your guilty memory
My love you traded for the night world where all your dreams met with tragedy
Now do you remember how I love you so

Mel Tillis,"Normally Norma's kissing me just about this time every morning
With the wink in her eye she whispers goodbye
Then she tells me somethin' sweet and knocks me off of my feet
And normally Norma thinks of me as just as the swellest guy in the world
Oh but normally Norma loves me
One word led to another over a harmless joke
Then Norma went home to her mother I guess her little heart was broke
Oh oh normally Norma's waitin' on me every evening when the sun goes down
When I get home from work with my dirty old shirt
She pulls off my shoes and it's a goodbye blues

Mel Tillis,"I always called her old faithful she was always there when I came home
And I never thought the day would come she'd leave me
But for me those kind of thinking days are gone
Cause old faithful ain't faithful anymore she's stepping out to even up the score
She's out there where the lights are bright wining dining every night
And old faithful ain't faithful anymore

Night after night she sits waitin' just to touch the fool that she loves so
But now for her those waiting days are over
For absence makes the warmest heart grow cold
Cause old faithful ain't faithful
And old faithful ain't faithful anymore",Old Faithful,1968
Mel Tillis,"Well I was born in a tumbled down shack one quarter of a mile from a railroad track
Mama was a drifter daddy was a bum and they didn't want a little hobo son
But things do happen and here I am just outside of Birmingham
Train's slowing down and I'm gonna jump up
I'm gonna spread my wings and look all about

And I've got mu supper if I got me a hook

But there's lots of sweet mem'ries that I have today
And when I see autumn and leaves turning brown
I feel like mama is somewhere around
Don't forget to cover my flowers I still hear my sweet mother say
Be sure to cover my flowers or my flowers will wither away

Yes I remember though it's been so long
My heart feels so heavy and life seems so wrong
I'd give all my treasures and things I might own
To go back to mama's old country home
Don't forget to cover

As I wait in this jungle in this foreign land of people so indifferent to God and to men

And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed

Till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine

Lotten da, la da da da, lotten da, la a da da dee
Talkin' 'bout you and me and the games people play

Oh, we make one another cry, break a heart then we say goodbye

And you say you're tired of living in this sin
But please be patient and don't leave I'm just too ashamed to face it

That the home she helped me built I tear apart
Just give me one more day and then I'll tell her cause today I haven't got a heart

I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay

My hands're all dirty from working on my little boy's bike
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him
My wife's in the kitchen and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn

And I know why she's there I've been there before
But I made her a promise that I wouldn't cheat anymore
I tried to ignore it but I know she's in there my friend

And they expect answers to all of the questions they ask

And you've never once looked back at your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town but my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground, pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down when you're blue and all alone
When their glamor starts to bore you come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy but they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude, now you're haughty and so rude

Mel Tillis,"The man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die
He laid to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours and I guess we must've drunk a case of beer
I guess I oughta go and watch them put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' about the fire and hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome I do believe that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his rich Uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black
He's not even in the ground and they say that his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil
Listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps

Me and little brother would join right in there singin' seems to help a troubled soul

But I wonder if they know the sorrow that always overtakes the wine
I drink to find forgetful valleys where I can leave old memories behind
But always just before I reach them sorrow overtakes the wine

And I always try to drink them under but sorrow overtakes the wine
