Annie Raines,"Some say that love is sweet as a rose,
Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
""Candy""
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine
Mine",Candy,2004
Annie Ross,"I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
The devil and the deep blue sea",Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,1952
Annie Ross,"I could cry salty tears 
Where have I been all these years? 
Little wow, tell me now 
How long has this been goin' on? 

There were chills up my spine 
And some thrills I can't define 
Listen sweet, I repeat 
How long has this been goin' on? 

Oh, I feel that I could melt 
Into heaven I'm hurled 
I know how Columbus felt 
Finding another world 

Kiss me once, then once more 
What a dunce I was before 
What a break, for heaven's sake 
How long has this been goin' on? 

Let me dream that it's true 

Kiss me twice, then once more 
That makes thrice, let's make it four 
What a break, for heaven's sake 
How long has this been goin' on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?,1952
Annie Ross,"I've flown around the world in a plane 
I've settled revolutions in Spain 
And the North Pole I have charted 
Still I can't get started with you 

On the golf course, I'm under par 
Metro Goldwyn have asked me to star 
I've got a house, a showplace 
Still I can't get no place with you 

'Cause you're so supreme 
Lyrics I write of you, I dream 
Dream day and night of you 
And I scheme just for the sight of you 
Baby, what good does it do? 

I've been consulted by Franklin D 
Greta Garbo has had me to tea 
Still I'm broken-hearted 

'Cause I can't get started with you",I Can't Get Started,1952
Annie Ross,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man,1952
Annie Ross,"My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
The way he described it, he said I'd be better dead than live
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought I was crazy but I'm not
Oh no!

My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
He said I'd need treatment but I'm not that easily led
He said I was the type that was most inclined
When out of his sight to be out of my mind
And he thought I was nuts, no more ifs or ands or buts
Oh no!

They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas
But I knew what was happenin', I knew I was a genius
What's so strange when you know that you're a wizard at three?
I knew that this was meant to be

Well I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight
That's why I drank a fifth of vodka one night
My parents got frantic, didn't know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy?
I may have been only three but I was swingin'

They all laughed at Al Graham Bell
They all laughed at Edison and also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry if they just couldn't understand
The litany and the logic that went on in my head?
I had a brain, it was insane
Don't you let them laugh at me
When I refused to ride on all those double decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top

My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
The way he described it, he said I'd be better dead than live
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought I was crazy but I'm not
Oh no!

My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
But I said ""Dear doctor, I think that it's you instead
'Cause I have got a thing that's unique and new
It proves that I'll have the last laugh on you
'Cause instead of one head... I got two
And you know two heads are better than one""",Twisted,1954
Annie Ross,"Now you say you love me
But you cry the whole night through
You can cry me a river 
oh yes you're goin' to cry me a river 
'Cause I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry for being so untrue
You may cry a river
You may cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Yes I did child, yes I did my child

You drove me nearly out of my head
You stood by and never shed a tear
But I remember every word that was said
Oh yes, I remember - never fear

You may cry me a river - c'mon now
Cry me a river
You may cry me a river
I cried a river for you (Oh how I cried)

You nearly drove me out of my own sweet head
You stood by - you never shed a tear for me.
I remember every cruel word - everything that was said
Yes I remember - never you fear

You may cry me a river
I cried a river for you
Yes I cried a river for you

Turn back the tide of life, I cried - salty water runnin' down
I cried I love you
I cried I love you
I cried, I cried

You may cry, oh, she may cry now, a river of tears 
A river of tears for you
You may cry now, she may cry, oh, she may cry now
You may cry, oh, she may cry now a river of tears
A river of tears for you

I cry you can cry me a river
Lord loves a cheerful giver
C'mon and cry me a river of tears
C'mon now and cry me a river of tears
C'mon now and cry me a river of tears
C'mon now - c'mon down and cry me a river...","Cry Me a River (for the film ""The Girl Can't Help It"")",1956

He sure don't want you no more 

Don't let the sun catch you lyin'
Lyin' at my front door

Annie Ross,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry 'Bout Me,1956
Annie Ross,"Every time I look down on this timeless town
Whether blue or gray be her skies.
Whether loud be her cheers or soft be her tears,
More and more do I realize:

I love Paris in the springtime.
I love Paris in the fall.
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles,
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles.

I love Paris every moment,
Every moment of the year.
I love Paris, why, oh why do I love Paris?
Because my love is near.",I Love Paris,1956
Annie Ross,"I've told every little star
Just how sweet I think you are
Why haven't I told you

I've told ripples in a brook
Made my heart an open book
Why haven't I told you

Friends ask me am I in love
I always answer yes
Might as well confess
If I don't they guess

Maybe you may know it too
Oh my darling if you do
Why haven't you told me",I've Told Ev'ry Little Star,1956
Annie Ross,"If there's a gleam in her eye
Each time she straightens your tie,
You know the lady's in love with you!
If she can dress for a date
Without that waiting you hate,
It means the lady's in love with you!

And when your friends ask you over to join their table,
But she picks that faraway booth for two,
Well sir, here's just how it stands,
You've got romance on your hands,
Because the lady's in love with you!

If you've been travellin' by 'plane
And she says, ""Please take the train!"",
You know the lady's in love with you!
And if she has met your old flames
And she remembers their names,
It means the lady's in love with you!

And Sunday night, when you take her to see that movie,
And she says the gallery seats will do,
Well, here's just how it stands,
You got romance on your hands,
'Cause the lady's in love with you!
The lady is me, and I'm in love with you!
So in love with you!
Je vous aime beaucoup!",The Lady's in Love With You,1956
Annie Ross,"Summer journeys
To Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares

I've a cozy little flat
In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan,1956
Annie Ross,"Years we've been together
Seems we can't get along,
No matter what I do
I don't appeal to you
Makes no difference whether
I am right or wrong
If we can't be sweethearts
This much you can do

Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Oh, Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice
It's better not to talk at all, that's my advice
We're parting, you go your way, I'll go mine
It's best that we do
Here's a kiss, I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Just remember
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone.",Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone,1956
Annie Ross,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,1956
Annie Ross,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife;
Just serve me tomatoes; and mashed potatoes;
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y;
Give me the simple life.",Give Me the Simple Life,1958
Annie Ross,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1958
Annie Ross,"I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
I overlooked that point completely, 
Until the big affair began, 

Before I knew where I was at, 
I found myself upon the shelf, and that was that, 
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there, 
All that I could get was the air, 

My feet are back upon the ground, 
I've lost the one man I found,  

I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
Why did I buy those blue pajamas, 
Before the big affair began,

I think I'll crawl right back and into my shell, 
Dwelling in my personal hell, 
    
I'll have to change my plan around, 
I've lost the one man I found.",I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan,1958
Annie Ross,"Let there be you, 
Let there be me. 
Let there be oysters 
Under the sea.

Let there be wind, 
An occasional rain. 
Chile con carne, 
Sparkling champagne 

Let there be birds 
To sing in the trees, 
Someone to bless me 
Whenever I sneeze. 

Let there be cuckoos, 
A lark and a dove, 
But first of all, please  
Let there be love.

I can't even think of his name
But it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again
To my old flame

My new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent

So innocent or elegant
As my old flame

I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who sent me up to the skies

Annie Ross,"Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, ha!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" ev'ry day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,2002

I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you,

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream

At every stop that we made

The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz

That when you turned and smiled at me

How could he know we two were so in love

And as we kissed and said goodnight

To those hazy crazy nights we met

Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek

You should be ashamed of yourself

You're too short, you're too fat
Why don't you give up your stupid ideas
And do something right for once

Lined up one by one
They try to bring you down
Don't ever listen what they say
Determination, the battle will be won
And all the pain will go away

La forêt, comme la ville, compte un peuple à protéger
Mais comme un arbre ne peut siéger
On donne la parole au DG
Si on pensait aux animaux, ceux qui se font ravir leur demeure
J’parle pas d’ceux assis au bureau
Pour qui ça devient leur pain, leur beurre
Si l’homme était l’arbre et qu’on lui sciait les chevilles
S’il tombait en pleine face et qu’on le découpait en billes
Si on lui arrachait la peau, comme on arrache une écorce
Si à l’aide d’un canif, on lui grave un nom sur le torse
Si on lui cassait les bras, comme on ose casser ses branches
Si on le couchait sur le plat et qu’on en faisait des planches
Et si on le vidait de son sang, comme on le vide de sa sève
Pour le replanter en rang, comme un enfant qu’on élève
Si on l’empêchait de grandir en détruisant ses racines
Si on l’empêchait de se couvrir et qu’on le recouvrait d’acide
Si faut lui prendre son boulot / bouleau
Le priver d’son pain / pin pour qu’on lui fasse comprendre
L’attacher aux chaînes / chênes
Qu’on le traîne par terre pour qu’enfin l’homme tremble
Si l’homme était l’arbre et qu’il devait porter les feuilles
Un oeil sur le portefeuille à compter les deuils
S’il voyait son entourage se faire abattre à tour de rôle
S’il comprenait la rage qui fait pas juste pleurer les saules
Si devant les couleurs de l’automne
Faisant face à la vérité
Si, comme les feuilles, rougissait, l’homme
Menaçant la continuité
Si l’homme était fait en bois, serait-il plus sensible aux arbres ?
Se sentirait-il plus responsable des coupes à blanc, s’il est coupable ?
Couché sous l’arbre, l’avenir est sombre
Les arbres s’effondrent, la forêt tombe
À force de tondre, les terres s’inondent
J’vois les décombres sortir de l’ombre
Qu’on prenne de l’arbre ce qu’on doit prendre
Qui peut comprendre c’qu’il peut t’apprendre
Se tenir debout, se serrer les coudes
Affronter tout jusqu’à la foudre
Qu’il soit feuillu ou conifère

Anonymous,"What would it take to push a man,
Far enough to put somethin material over a human life?
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that? the green and gold.

I done filled my lungs up
With so much of this crack smoke
My necks bloated, my techs loaded,
I'm flat broke, and I'm pissed off,
Mad at the world I've had it with girls
And I'm frustrated, ran to the bus stop,
Just made it and hopped on 
Ready to drop bombs on the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on
I spot JOHN a white collar worker
In clean cut, walked up to em
He was like what? whatchu mean what? you know what time it is man
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch with that diamond wrist band.
Got his green and his gold dashed it climbed in his van to steal it and seen
A man holdin' a nine and then
Shot him from the bottom up
Stole his keys, put em inside the ignition and got em stuck, 
Hopped out to flee on my feet, 
Fucked around, forgot that I left my ID on the seat",Green and Gold,1998

Freak Out - Maybe 'cause I'm a star
Just because I'm pushin fancy cars
Freak Out - Chalk up another notch
Could it be the diamonds in my watch
Freak Out - Guess what? I don't even know
You think somebody tell her I got dough
Freak Out - Whatever, only do what you feel is clear
Long as we can freak out, I don't care

Park my Jeep, my Land cruiser blue
Hit the spot laced up like I usually do
The way I shine is a crime, cats might want to assume
Nothin' new, I been on the walk out here with a few

Has to wonder, Nut gotta slide with her
(Backwards), check your riches, son, I concur
Hit her long from gutter loans, get her sprung from wetter tongues
Body bangin' like a whole set of drums

Damn, wit time flat, spit my game
Drop a quarter by her nice thighs, ""This your change?""
Who these fake-trackin' field cats runnin' the see?
You can take this both ways, you're comin' wit me

On the real, need to feel some of that, lay wood like a lumberjack
From the side, little hair from the back
Of course, wit protection, never ever let em leak out
Words I speak out, who's a freak out?

[Chorus]

[Nutta Butta]
Ah-yo Nut, come here, is my vision a blur?
You know I ain't seen this [BACKWARDS], look at the hips on her
Shorty's mad phat, see every inch of her stack, black
Gotta act like groceries, bag that

(Word, son, take one, no, take two)
Too late, son, you know I seen her first, don't hate, son
Forget it, I spit at her to get her wit it
Like a friendly game of baseball, we all can hit it

That sounds doper, stet it, now Teddy set it off and rope her
End of the night we all get closer
What up mutt? See y'all might know who I am
Gotta sec, 'cause you need to meet the rest of the fam

Nothin' I'm sellin' but this is quite true, chicks like you
No tellin' what [BACKWARDS] on a nut might do
You lack, no if, and's and but's
'Cause when you're done, you'll know why they call me Nut

[Chorus]

Uhh
First of all, before you freak out the foreplay
Don't rush the lady, POP the chardonnay
Let her know the gentile manners you mental

Meanwhile she's wonderin' whether the in was out
No doubt, tip your glass, let the white wine soar
It might taste so-you're to a tongue that's poor
She want to know if I gotta girl, of course

Does the Teddy Riley have a mansion and dogs?
Keep it true, fool, so my time invested will be youthful

I wish I was in high school
So I could fuck young bitches like Anotha Level do
Let me hip you to my Lethal Injection
The black erec-tion, in your midsection
I have you walking through
Like Bowlegged Lou, heidi heidi hoe, bitch

I got Different Strokes like Willis and Arnold
Now, Mr. Drummond see me coming but
Watch your wife, for my dick'll be running a patch like
Slick Rick, thought I saw a putty-tat
Pussy fatter than the insane bitch that's singing
at the end of the game
Fumble more titties than Thurmond, Thomas, I'm as
great man as eight man, and Emmitt Smith
I got the gift to hit it swift
So bitch you need a lift and I'm out

Verse Two:
Well how can one young black mack unpack
papes in mad stacks with no gat? I'm cool like that
...and then some
I got styles in my files so I lend some, to the needy
You get up, kid, but you get hit up like graffiti
Yo this the A-L rhymes that we say well
So ease up, don't freeze up or get nervous
'cause if you do loc got Levels-N-Service

The pressure is on, I combine and come bust rhymes
In thousands of shows and still have Miller time
I speed it up, I slow it dowwwwn

come all over the track, I fake the wack
Fly honies I attract
Niggaz know not to act up, dips be on my tip
so much I tell em back up
But don't say nothin, just listen
I'm not on a mission, a wack MC dissing
I'm just here to present the rep of my group
We gots flavor, styles by the miles hoes and flows too
I'm tough actin like Tinactin for the feet

Righteous greed and derangement divine
Vacuum is given to the blind

To not comprehend while you're awake
Thrive on your deity for heaven's sake

To face the scorn of the earth

What a relief never bother the why's

With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that's why

All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
When memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain't lost

You were mine alone
And I haven't seen you since that day

I walk the line and for you I will shine

I'm just thinkin' about the child in me,
That I sometimes feel inside
And I'm figuring out just what it is
That makes me feel so small

Am I too blind to see that it doesn't work out

Do you mean to say

It's all so hard, It's so hard

Through the smoke of the party room
Your teeth like the ivory coast
Start singin' my favourite song
And it happen' to be mood indigo

Mood indigo
I just go weak when I hear mood indigo
Could last for weeks until I decide to wake up
Take off my make up

Holding on to my heart
Smokin' them downhill
In a room number thirteen
Tryin' to stretch my luck again
Down the corridor your footsteps echo against the wall
My man of mystery, my date with infinity
Tonight I'm gonna sacrifice, for the first time in my life
Make it all come back to me, like an old forgotten dream

Now don't you call me baby 
Just don't pretend you care

There was nothing out there for the lost and lonely 
But a voice in my head kept banging on my heart 
Says you're not the only one

Is it the way she looks at you
Laughs with you?  Can she
Does she make you beg for more?
This is hurting
What has she got that I don't have?
I tried to call him
Anytime anywhere
But he's never there
So I went to his place
And waited all day
So he would explain it to me
And this is what he said:
There is nothing left to say
I had my fill; I went away
Your crying eyes won't change a thing
It was just a fling
Well, how could an angel break my heart?
He said: We could still be friends
Are you kidding me?
What has she got that I don't have?
Is it the way she looks at you
Talks to you?  Can she
Does she make you beg for more?

Or brighten all the gloom

And if your hands are cleansed with sorrow
May it help you ease your pain
Though the windows have a view of city rain, city rain

And if you walk in constant sorrow
And you cry for me
May it hit the painful memories
Maybe then you'll see

That if you drown yourself in liquor
Because it keeps you company
Then just remember who you're losing
And be proud to set me free

Because it don't talk back or disagree
It just makes you see so hazily
But in the morning light your life is scattered with the wind
Scattered with the wind

I said they tell you he's a sinking ship
And he's trying to pull you down

You know you break my heart
You said you want me to come back home and try again
You want me to make a brand new start

But if wisdom says to let him go
Then it's hell, because you just don't know
Until you've tried to love a man who's loving whiskey, loving whiskey

And the lure of the nightlife

And another glass of Tanqueray

Let's just move on
I am setting you free

I don't wanna make you go

No I don't wanna hurt no more

I'm taking off today

Darkness you left in my soul
Now do we know how much we've lost?
Will the moon be shining as bright as before
And as I am singing this song
The tears went up in my eyes
And I will always wonder
Why I will never have the life I wanted
Now I'm letting it go

'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna make you go 
Through one more rainy day
No I don't wanna hurt no more
There's not much more to say
'Cause it's to late now
I won't hurt no more.

So I'll wait till morning comes
You made it clear it's been only pain loving me
Things that we don't do for love
I am setting you free

What do you do when you
Get lost inside your soul

But it was time for you to walk alone
Just know if you really need a friend
And you're feeling like you can't go on

Just walk back just a little bit faster
Take my hand I will blow your fears away
Break through to the other side

You better than anyone else

Get lost inside your soul

Live life without you

Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turn into fear and with my
One wing I can’t fly

With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that’s why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds

To a place without fear, with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
Where memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain’t lies

Angry words that were spoken, when I should have wept
There's a chapter of secrets, and words to confess
If I lose everything that I possess
There's a chapter on loss and a ghost who won't die
There's a chapter on love where the ink's never dry
There are sentences served in a prison I built out of lies.

Though the pages are numbered 
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no-one can read
In the book of my life

There's a chapter on fathers a chapter on sons
There are pages of conflicts that nobody won
And the battles you lost and your bitter defeat,
There's a page where we fail to meet

There are tales of good fortune that couldn't be planned
There's a chapter on god that I don't understand
There's a promise of Heaven and Hell but I'm damned if I see

Though the pages are numbered 
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no-one can read
In the book of my life

Now the daylight's returning
And if one sentence is true
All these pages are burning 
And all that's left is you

Though the pages are numbered 
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no-one can read
In the book of my life",The Book of My Life,2003

From Monday to Friday night
And the wages that they pay me
I swear they're very light

They take out a little for the state
Little bit more for Uncle Sam
How can I ever catch up
And get myself out of this jam?

I'll move in to the jungle
Way out in the woods
The way things are happenin' here now
I ain't doin' myself no good

I go to town on Saturday
Just to pay my bills
I gotta make it early
Or the collector will come where I live

I go to church on Sunday
Get down on my knees to pray
The preacher takes up collection
And say, ""Brother, what will you pay?""

Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this

Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss

Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Seen a little tight one, the bitch said, ""Hey!"" 
Rushed that ass to the store and got the Tanqueray 
Pulled over to the side, now I'm cold on the mission 
Threw the bitch in the back and put that ass in position 
Baby broke me off, OOH somethin kinda proper 
Bitch was so tight, I didn't want to stop her 
Now a nigga trippin, sippin on gin 
Drunk as fuck, and out comes her boyfriend! 
Time to call it quits, cause the fool might trip 
But the nigga shoulda known that a bitch ain't shit 
He reached for the do', now I got him in focus 
.380 on that ass, now his life is like hopeless

Yeahhhahhh, much props to the motherfuckin Dangerous Crew nigga 
YouknowhatI'msayin? 
Chorus (1/2, - {*1})",Packin' a Gun,1992
Ant Banks,"For the funky beats I made I get for my grade 
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, I can't hang with you 
Cause I'm from Oakland, bitch, where the game is true 
You don't belive me? Well, come on slide through 
Because the city of dope will give you somethin' to ride to 
Put my tape in your deck and do some damages 
But the six by nines, they can't handle this 
I'm twenty-three so I'm far from a young buck 
This gin and juice is gettin' me pumped up 
Fake rappers get chumped up 
You want to slang'em, watch your face gettin' lamped up 
Well, what's my name? You can call me Banks for short 
You want to book me? You're about to see a gangsta show 
Cause I be tighter than tight, give me a brew and the mic 
And it will be on like chickenbone, you know that's right 
Some mothafuckas didn't belive that I can do this shit 
Kick some funky ass rhymes with some beats that hits 
Now I'm provin' them wrong but still suckas want to clown 
But you jealous mothafuckas ain't bringin' me down 
I kept faith in myself, that's what I had to do 
To make it out here and stop fuckin' with you 
I'm 2 the head... 

Yeah! Now all you fake niggaz: get the fuck off my nuts! 

I got my shit rollin' so now I'm like a mack in town 
And when I'm ridin' through, the hoes be flaggin' me down 
I'm just a player kickin' funky shit with the Dangerous Clique 
And all these bitches, they out to get some famous dick 
But I ain't trippin', girl, you can bring that ass on 
Cause all this jockin' shit ain't guaranteed to last long 
But while it's happenin' you know I'm straight lovin' it 
You put your pussy in position and I'm pluggin' it 
But if you're lookin' for a nigga with a touch of affection 
You better take your ass to the love connection 
Cause, hoe, I ain't got no trust in you 
Cause if another rapper comes you'll be fuckin' him too 
And that's real, save the love for ????? 
Cause it's all about mackin' in 92 
One love, I ain't goin' that far 
I'm better known as a gigolo rap star 
I like to fuck groupie bitches cause it's fun too 
And I never get played cause I'm young true 
Hoes want to be mine but that's a no no 
Get the fuck off my face, bitch, I'm 2 the head, hoe 

Now for verse three, you know it never quits 
Cause Ant Banks is in the house makin' hits 
And since I'm doin' this I gotta deal with jealous punks 
Mad cause my shit like pumps in the trunks 
And when I'm ridin' I gotta roll strapped in my 500 Benz 
Cause it's sittin' kinda phat, fake niggas smile on my face 
But they ain't bold ones 
Trippin' out cause they ain't ridin' on gold ones 
I know you're envies, that's hell of dumb for me 
Cause the shit I got, it didn't come for free 
Late nights at the studio bustin' my ass crack 
Tryin' to make hits, man, but where was your ass at? 
Probably at the corner drinkin' Old E, slangin' D 
See, you was sleepin', now everybody's know me 
I guess hard work pays and doin' nothin' is off 
Lazy niggas like you were once fuckin' us off 
Stop talkin' about me and get a J-O-be	 instead 
Bitch ass nigga, I'm 2 the head... 

Yeah and this goes out to all you shit talkin'

Be pimping these hoes from dusk til dawn

All we do is smoke that weed 
And drink brew on the ave til we get keyed 
And a little bit of head is all we need 
Hanging on the streets of Oakland 

Welcome to the danger zone, where the niggas don't play that 
Every man for self, the rule is to stay strapped 
'Cause rat packers try to jack that ass 
From the jealousy that's built in the streets when you stack cash

Or quit it, cause niggas be flipping over dope and

Hey, you gonna see me slide when I'm on the Eastside 
Making all my fucking gitnotes 
Making sure my gat straight smitnokes, smobbing with my fitnokes 

That's all we doing is the town is seeing bitches clowning 
Kicking back getting high lounging 
It really doesn't matter what you do, yo chilling with your crew 
You're sipping on a brew, you're pimping bitches too

Blowing up like dynamite 
Selling weed, yey, angel dust, hop, and China white 
Fuck it, you're making duckets, never riding buckets

But the reality of our locality, and you'll learn this gradually, 

Is that motherfuckers do this shit to pay their rent. 
But here's a hint: how we gonna get it straight when we bent? 
Shit, see I ain't never had shit but my stripes and my game and my life,

From 94 to 95 we can do this
So nigga just love this with no player hatin'
Cause we gets respect all over the nation
Still in this to win this so you can pretend this
Beat this like my dick in yo mouth, until I'm finished
The shit goes on and on and on
But when you gets no promotion
That ass is gone
In the studio all day puttin' in work
Hoes didn't give a fuck and man that shit hurts
Used and abused no pain no gain
Sure them hoes tried to play us, but we still in the game

Still in the game, after all these years
Been bumpin' so long I can hardly hear
Still got the same flow that I used to have
You can clown if you want, but don't do it too fast
Cause I'm gone slow it way down, than shoot your ass
And send you want to be pimps, back to class
Cause Ant Banks been making these beats too long
You trying to get with these funky songs
But the formulas patented, we ain't havin' it
Game is all we spit
Keep on mackin' bitch
You can't make it hard
Can't tell a motherfucker how to play this part
Call me Short Dog baby of the Dangerous Crew
Talkin' on the Mobil Ant Banks came through
Ridin' in a brand new Benz
A nigga like that might have a few ends
No shit bitch, stupid hoe
You spent your last 10 years in the studio
We ain't no punks
We can't be played
Still in the game, still gettin' paid

You know we got all the hoes
More hoes than Swiss cheese nigga
Ant Banks you want to hoe, you want to bitch?

[Chorus]
Well can I get a bitch (bitch)
Nigga can I get a bitch (bitch)
$hort give me a bitch (bitch)
Banks jump yo fat ass in the mix

Yeah the shit gets hectic, but you gots to accept it
10 years chillin' in the game, well respected
But check this, some niggas don't give a fuck
Never be givin' us props, see we don't stop cause we don't give a fuck
We gets paid, so tell me what a nigga know
We hit him low with the bass, than we get more
Number one album, so where the fuck you at?
Doing sit-ups, stay off my dick still tryin' to rap
Damn, we never ballin' out of control
We open doors for the motherfuckin' O
Now lets roll
Everybody up cause we all got to get it
And when you get your motherfuckin' chance nigga spit it
So listen to what I'm tellin' G, come with the melody
Or keep yo skin tight so you can have longevity
Like the Bad Ass, shit I had to earn that name
Some love it some hate it, but I'm still in the game

[Chorus]

Young nigga in the fifth grade, stealin' cigarettes
At ten years old, he was a real vet
Sellin' gold weed, makin' money like a star
Wasn't old enough to drive, but I still bought a car
Ten years later, he was sellin' coke
Fuck with the nigga he was killin' folks
Had to do a couple of niggas or he would've caught the chrome
Hopped on the plane, straight got gone
10 years on the run, still in the game
Bounce back through the town ain't nothin' change
Caught a murder beef, but the shit was weak
Charges got dropped in less than two weeks
Nigga went through a lot, but his bank is fat
Tried to catch him up with them wiretaps
But that snitch then told
Its simple and plain
You can clown all you want, but we still in the game

Mmhhmm
I'm keepin' motherfuckers guessin'
That's right

(Verse 1):
It's a blessing so let me speak and teach a lesson
I run deep and freak on streets, I keep 'em guessin'
I'm flexin' when I hit the Hennessy
Then I see the enemy
Pretender think that he know my identity
But nigga that's a penalty so here we go again
You think you know what I'm foldin'
Cause what I'm rollin' in
Well I don't give a fuck nigga I was in the cut 
While you was up at my spot tryin' to peep what I got
Why not bust a shot when I was ridin' you was mad
And see me in the bucket and thought I was doin' bad
Thinkin' that I was broke but you can peep and goin' wonder
But little did you know that I was creepin' on the under
Goin' yonder now you dumber cause your number has been pulled 
You fool cause that shit you thought you knew was bull
At this beef where you at see I'm speakin' the facts
So forget that chit-chat cause it's deeper than that
And I'm keepin' a Gat and let my Tecs blast quick
So why the fuck you sittin' back stressin' of the next man's shit
Cause I'm the fuckin' one and only 
And you busters can't get on me 
You're in danger you don't know me 
I'm a stranger not your homie
You know fuck ya'll don't know about me
But check it out

Run up on this fool and get your head split
And if you don't know
You better ask somebody you'd better ask somebody

Niggas wanna trip I'm hard to the bone
They all on my dick so let's get it goin' on

(Verse 2):
Dressed up in these street clothes
I'm ready to beat hos this game is lethal
I'm sellin' rocks tryin' to move up to sellin' kilos 
But these hoes and negros 
Be tryin' to stop my progress
But when you're in my way
You's just the victim I'ma rob next
And it's a terrible thang I gotta fuck up your crew 
And have you goin' thru unbearable pain
I'm in the game and they claim that I'm on the run
I own a gun 16 shots bust up on this one
Yeah motherfuckers I'm the one
With beats from the streets
So don't talk that shit and be scared to come to me
I know them punk ass niggas be jockin' my flows
But when I turn my back they just yap like some gossippin' hoes
I guess I ain't got no true friends but I got a few wins
To pay for paint and put this AMG's on my new Benz
Them jealous niggas steady guessin' and wonderin'
Tryin' to catch up but stuck stressin' and wonderin'
I'm never stumblin' just bundlin' up my cash
I gotta last so I don't give a fuck to blast
My mind be havin' sinister thoughts 
I guess it's because I always mug when the ministers talk
I'm heavy-weightin' capable to breakin' a fool's neck
So quit tryin' to figure out what this nigga gon do next

I ain't sleepin' I'm just creepin'
I just lurks in the dark I'm that nigga Ant Banks
With beats burps and them farts
But niggas wanna start flashin' and trippin' on my lifestyle
Cause I'm makin' cash and they ass stuck up on a pipe now
I write down facts so the saps think that I'm dissin'
But listen guess this is just an addiction for non-fiction
And niggas break on the tracks and fat tapes
That Max makes so homie wait and get your fact straight
But act fake and end up bendin' from back brakes
A busted head, a broken leg and a cracked face
I can't let him live 
Crashed up his ribs with my body blows
I got him froze tremblin' cold with his snotty nose
You chose not to have a hustle now you desirin' mines 
Tryin' to find out my mix but I got those clips for inquirin' minds
Them tirin' lines I'm hearin' ain't phasin' me
I was raised a G and that's what I'm paid to be
So fuck them suckers with them false accusations
Lookin' for my location tryin' to stop my operation
You wastin' time cause a Nine is my protection
Get off my dick flexin' and keep on guessin'

You can't fuck with this here

Before your ass gets smoked and I ain't playing no games
Don't trip just because you know I'm talking to you
And when my boys catch you slipping, your ass is through

Fresh up out the Testarossa
Still buzzin off that sticky green Cali doja
Last night had, way too many bitches jock
Mr. Player himself, gon' always keep it poppin
And stoppin you and yo' ability to come tight, mack like Dolemite
Sometimes you learn the hard way, but you gon' get it right
Keep listenin, discipline plays a strong part
The majority of these bitches ain't got no heart
enough to roll with the punches, hundred dolla bills and brunches
Comin home in somethin way tight that's scrumptious like
steak and lobster, dank from rastas
And we don't roll with nothin but, G's and mobsters!
Zenithes, Daytons, twenty inch chrome ones
Never know the feelin of a bitch 'til you own one!

Yeah we Bay riders, call us, murder for hire
Closer, than hittin home runs than McGwire and Sosa
We supposed to be, killin 'em off, hittin 'em off
with this old ill shit, givin 'em an overdose of this so real shit
So feel this, way down deep up in your liver
Give a, nig a chance for the alcohol to make you quiver
Still a, assassin blastin any nigga who think he can outlast
the master splash yo' ass in a, pool of blood
So ask the, nigga who done rolled up and got his, dome split
(Dome split) I don't give a fuck motherfucker wait 'til the chrome hit!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
They say you got to have heart
 I roll with dese niggaz dey mob figures and killas you niggaz feel us

[Verse Two]
A player's proposition got 'em wishin they was laced up
Perfect conversation plus my new just game I make up
Talkin bout, mash you got me bout it now I'm gettin dough
Dress in style every day, own many expensive clothes

Ay tell yo' potnahs they can be a part of all the benefits
Ay, pinky finger diamonds all the finest ain't no limits and
what we tryin to do menage-a-trois up in the rental then
you can make a move you never lose with a gentleman
All about my paper fettucini and lucciano
If we keep this pimpin right we movin into condos
Baby want to treat to play, she want to lace me
Dress me up from head to toe and shoppin sprees at Macy's
Ay, copped me all the flyest shit, like Tommy Hilfiger
Calvin Klein cologne just want to zone with a real nigga
We can do it live and go through all your wildest fantasies
Tell me yeah you want to be as freaky as you want to be

Niggaz is so fake and phony
Nine times out of ten they ain't Oscar Mayer beef they Lady Lee bologna
Speakin on shit they never did, soundin like a tweeter
Wishin they was a mid, ho you don't know you blowin out like an amp
Lickin mo' pussy than the post office lick stamps
Money over bitches, boy you don't remember?
Just kick back and sautee, nigga never simmer

Motherfuckers ain't knowin I´m like a kilo of them
Try to shake me up and brake me down turned in a mo game
My daddy wasn't around 
All I got from him was nathin
My niggaz my dogs laced me about the bulletproof waivin
Whether it's in the game or in the gain
Fool I've been told 
Done sold more yak and records I guess I 've been so

Supplyin G's 
To my homies in the streets rollin

And puttin it down for years
And nobody could do it better
Always stay heated
For the case and bid
Keep the stinky man

Stuck and starvin was on the main menu 
And that's all that it was
Had motherfuckers trippin in shit 
With all that blood and crip shit
'cause started out of the street pharmacies to street promotion
It's all the same 
Anyway you look at 
It's to sale products for the cash and for the fame

You can take a man out the ghetto
But can't take the ghetto out the man
Plus we used to fall in the gangin them grands
Raise spot

Upon a cornerblock

For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it

So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine 
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine 
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket 
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it 
 
It feels good not to grind no more 
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle 
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal 
Livin' life truly successful 
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope 
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again 
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in 
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect 
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west 
It's just a Player Holiday

We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin' 
Buy some breezys and we kickin' 
And Cap what you doin? 

I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch 
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop 
Puttin' it together like a racing track 
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at? 
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle 
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble 
So keep your head up 
And know that things are changing for the better 
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids

And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd 
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town 
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown 

None of the homies got pop 
None of the spots got batteram 
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam 
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin' 
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin' 
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby 
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby 
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey 
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days 

Mama used to put my clothes on layaway 
Now I'm dipped everyday and every see-note got big face 
Holler at me man, used to ride the back of the bus 
Now I'm spinnin V-12's though the times is rough 
In God we trust haters, you can only hate us 
But can't front cause you knew that we was bound to blow up

Nothin comin soft 'cause I'll never throw weaker blows 
I'll kick you in your [ass] and your breath'll smell like sneaker soles 
Now how's that for a fixin'? 
You'd better rather go to Roy's, cause I ain't kickin' science fiction 
I kick a size nine sneaker or boot 
Chop chumps to stumps, and they remain minute

Because of my technique, I'm the one you let speak 
I collect crops and props like spinach 
I'm vintage, your single sums up to a ten inch

Keep the funk flowin' until the last beat stops

Might find their legs bein' replaced by steel 
This is a brand new year, and the penalty is death 
So there won't be a lot of suckers left 
I grab the mic, and I load it like a long four-fifth 
Huh, and dare you to riff 
Or even sneeze as I blow you to your knees, have you curled up 
In a corner like a dog, with hoof in mouth disease 
Spittin' razor blades, cuttin' veins you can't stitch 
I got you screamin like a [bitch] 
I took your microphone, you can't get it back 
Because your rap was wack

Stop your diction you drop, the science fiction 
Let's get specific you can't get with it 
I'm too terrific and scientific, forget it 
Don't even try to limp it, you're not ready to make hits 
You still got a learner's permit 
Poppin' that [shit], you better sit 
Here's a word, of a third degree burn, so listen and learn 
You're missin' a turn, so you better get, concerned 
My challenger, check the calendar 
I'm as live as a .45 caliber, Colt 
With a silencer, wettin' up, suckers I be settin' up 
Button up, while I'm cuttin' up, never lettin' up 
I don't link up, with suckers with raps that shrank

Too much, caught in the ropes, like double dutch

Or a fruit, or a guy that wears Brut

And the emptiness in her eyes was cruel to see

And I whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

And I whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

Through the endless days and nights
Could not help but wrap herself in sorrow (sorrow)
Through the endless days and nights

And the moonlight kissed her eyes

I'm trying to get in touch with what I love and what I fear
But what I love is freedom what I fear is freedom too
When I'm looking at my enemy is it me or is it you?

Every breath take is a choice
Every look I see a vision
With every step I take I move…move into a new direction.

Am I moving in a fast enough forward or falling steps behind?
Am I keeping pace with my own voice or with words that are not mine?
Is it compromise or sacrifice is the path of truth one line?
Which is justice which is pain? Is it past that will define?

Every breath take is a choice
Every look I see a vision
With every step I take I move…move into a new direction.

Every beat of my heart's in danger 
All I want is a minute 
Just close your eyes 

You belong to me (rap inserts) 
It takes two, not three, not four 
Love guaranteed and that's for sure 

Belong to, belong to me 
All my wishes comin' real 
As love to love, as friend to gee 
Freeze, you belong to me 

Back and forth, forth and back 
Move your feet to the bumpin' hi-tech 
Rhythm's pumpin' so let's get jumpin' 
Work your body till the groove gets funky 

Dance to trance, 
I've got the power in my hands 
Up and down jump to the beat 
Everybody move your feet",You Belong to Me,2011
Ante Perry,"It's 3:00 A.M.
I'm awake and my heart is still dreaming
It's 3:00 A.M.
Outside I hear the souls still screaming
It's been so long you know 
Since my head's been this clear
Just like a ship lost in the night
I just don't know which way I should steer
But I'll keep chasing my dreams
And only you can make them real
I pour my heart out every night
But do you know the way that I feel
Sometimes this is work
And don't you know sometimes this is play
Sometimes you are listening to me
And sometimes you don't hear 
A damn word that I say
Sometimes there's a girl 
Sometimes I go home alone
And I guess it's no wonder right now
That I do very well on my own
But I'll keep chasing my dreams
And only you can make them real
I pour my heart out every night
But do you know the way that I feel
And I will play just as long as you will listen
Now I'm in no big hurry to get back on the road
Sometimes in this lifestyle
I feel like there's so much that I'm missing
Well I'm missing you
It's just that I'm ... so far from home
It's 3:00 A.M.
I'm awake and my heart is still dreaming
It's 3:00 A.M.
Outside I hear the souls still screaming",3 A.M.,2007

Antennas to Heaven,"Redlight flickers in the dark
Throwing her electric shapes on the screen
A world of tiny colored spots
A world lacking that final dimension
And he watches, over tables and drawers that aren't his
He watches her flicker, illuminate, glance down at him from mounted on the wall
He watches because he trusts it
He trusts the walls without pictures and the surfaces without photographs
He trusts the sound of a zip over that of a door
He trusts the lock and key not being his
And the faceless cards that would let anybody in if they chose
Because he chose
He chose
She speaks only in silence
Without words, her mere presence is a sound
A dull hum that is there but not
She is only redlight
While he is emptiness
A card with a printed name
An unsigned dotted line

An empty mini bar
A forgotten badge crumpled on a forgotten lapel
But he has redlight every night
Redlight, wallpaper and minty breath
Because in the morning she is always gone
And then he has to ABC 1 his way to the car with a smile
And he will find foreign roads
And speak to static with a finger in his ear
He will find painted smiles that don't sign
And cheap wit cards to be crumpled in his wallet
He will drink spirits from paper cups
He will drink and laugh at the third dimension of the bar
And let the bar staff read his name to feel at home
He will find all of this and nothing else
He will find it and he will trust it
He will find it and he will trust it
He will find it and he will trust it
Because there is redlight in every turnoff on his road.",Redlight,2006

I forget what I heard

Becomes a lesson in virility
Set to a bossanova drum
Sung to tarts decked out like Christmas trees

High on whores and marijuana
Begging letters from celebrities
Begging ""Couldn't you write songs for me?""

Perfect pitch for language that's built within
Where half the rap ink couldn't hold my pen

They signed the documents with the, blood of the slain
Far removed from this hip hop life off course
But the confidence and resilience was never lost

In the think tank and research labs I laid tracks
Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back
Destiny forever shake from the events to come
From the (?) and the chemical contents of the sun

A solid gold figure with a verse that glitters
Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter
They joined in a likely alliance with the rest
Schemin' with unsuccessful in a zealous Quest

We all see, with a degree of certainty
Who the fake, cowardly cats behind the curtains be,

About the piroclastic flow
Hotter than the spark that made it blow

Why U-N-I-verse run like clock works forever?
Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather
The nature and the scale of events don't make sense
A story with no warnin' you're drawn in, environments

Gravity that's gone mad, clouds of dust and debree
Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar

From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circle of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter

The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance

See the people

And so I face the final curtain

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

I should have known better
But I took the chance
And I loved her with all of my heart

Pretend to tear me apart

And to live day by day
Knowing she won't return
It's useless, I won't even try

Anthony Armstrong Jones,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'

Anthony Armstrong Jones,"On a quiet street
In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June

Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts 
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon, piece of paper and wrote:

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you
",Whoever Finds This I Love You,1970
Anthony Ashur,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2003

Chorus",Fire Pon Rome,1996
Anthony B,"There was a little boy once upon a time
Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind
For every copper penny and clover he would find
Make a wish for better days the end of hard times
For no more cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

His clothes were always clean
His face was always scrubbed
There was food on the table enough to fill him up
His house was full of life - His house was full of love
But when winter days arrived
There was never money enough to shod his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed
He made a life for himself, free from worldly wants or needs
But with nobody to share the life he'd made
No body to keep him warm at night
When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above
Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God
When a woman passing by brushed his arm
He turned and found love
He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger
Who she was to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things
So he promised more than he could buy
And he promised her the sun and moon to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He worked day and night his fingers to the bone
Hi worried mind guilty conscience drive him on
He can't give her what she needs
He wants to give her what he thinks she wants
Her sad-eyed face, his empty pockets drive him on and his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man
Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land
But some guys he knew from high school days
Said they had a plan to get rich quick
And they could count him in if he don't have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms
Dreamt about the life he'd buy
The comfort that would come without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around
He said the little boy is dead
A man stands with you now without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
Without cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He thought he'd set his clock right, He though he'd read his watch
He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck
Makes no difference if you're early, No difference if you're late
When you're out of time, The flowers have been laid
You're six feet underground
With cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

Yu worthless 
Pass mi sword and mi cutlass 
You think is a laughing matter this 

Verse 1: 
You a try everything you have you trap set up 
And you plan is for one brother to hate the other brother 
And slay him so Babylon can crush him cup 
It's a pity many of the youths don't realize 
That you stray them with your dollars 
Give them your killing orders 
And turn around and sell dem out just like french fries 
But here is what you do, you use the youths like dem a tool 
For doing a bag a evilous things 
But woe be on to you for turning people pickney fool 
You shatter their hopes and dreams 
You can't deny don't even try 
You are the reason why decomposed bodies are often found 
But will not be for long can't escape with all your wrong 
Countless murders committed in towns 

Chorus: 
Fi di bag a people you mek a suffer 
Fi di blood money that mek you richer 
Oh oh oh Mr. Heartless you end it a go bitter 
Shall be bitter, shall be bitter

Al a di body whey dem dump in a gutter 
Oh oh oh

Well nuff a dem skin get burn

Verse 2: 
Check it out many times the innocent get slay 
And you same one name the killer 
To the crime stop media 
Collect reward while sufferer grieve in pain 
Mama face the hardest time to give youths education 
And end up loosing many ways for her is only wasted days 
No chance of getting back a fraction 
So youths you need to stand up strong 
Don't take no boosting from no one 
Take this advise I give 
Don't get red eye because a money just work and earn it honestly 
Don't say that I'm talkative 
A lot of youth like you dem use and heard it often in the news 
Most wanted for killing a few 
No follow them and loose your soul 
Just keep you cool nuh loose control 
Like others they will shake you up too 

Chorus: 
Fi di bag a people you mek a suffer 
Fi di blood money that mek you richer 
Oh oh oh Mr. Heartless you end it a go bitter 
Shall be bitter, shall be bitter

Al a di body whey dem dump in a gutter 
Oh oh oh

Until the colour of a man skin is of no more significance 
Than the color of his eyes, 
Then shall always war

It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
So I left my gate and went out for a walk

(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
'Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing

Don't wanna fuck with me
Dogg Pound Gangstas
We do it like that
Motherfuckers out there be like, takin our styles
Be trying to do they own little dissing
But they can't do it, you know
So we gonna, do it like this
Sit back relax and get a cool one

Have you ever heard of a slaughter, I oughta start dippin
Sippin on that S-T get's me to trippin
I don't slips I bangs
With that mad ass Dogg Pound Gang it's a DPG thang
Kurupt from the S.C
You wanna test me let's see if you'll survive .45 times
Like a hollow point headed for your dome
Take a couple of steps, turn around and it's on
Couldn't withstand the murderous mental
I subdue, and then take two to your temple
When I cause holocoust from what's spittin
Niggas collapse and when the straps is clickin
Look, this is how it's done nigga, one two three
I grab my strap you best run nigga
I gives a fuck, Kurupt's the kingpin of the click
Littlest G, with the biggest dick

Shit, a motherfucker better recognize
With a twist of my wrist like O.J. you all die
I snack on motherfuckers like a bone
Known to be the shit upon the microphone ever since I was born
Not to ever love a bitch
Learned game after game, that's why we are the best
Motherfuckers be gankin styles minute after minute
But soon as you did it I smelled the niggas shitted


Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

Bitches butterfly all day, while I steady make my pay
Every single day in the LBC
Cruising through the Eastside, me and Lil' Style
When I back up a green six-fo' busting freestyles

There's no escape, give me the papes and the tape case
How much money can a nigga make in one place
The review, ain't shit new
You stupid motherfuckers can't fuck with my crew

I see all these niggas trying to get with my kin folk
Get so many busters on the West Coast
And then to say the least
I see a few trick ass niggas layin low on the East Coast
And the question is asked
Do you wanna rap, scrap or blast to that nigga Daz
I'll be the first one to him em
Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knocc Out and every nigga down with him
Cause I'm a Natural Born Killer
In a Steeler hat motherfucker cuz it's like that

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include
Whose quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud
It doesn't make a difference, cuz it's about
Who's the quickest on the draw to end all existence
For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools
These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room
Assume, it's only for conversation, so let's
Conversate slip a nigga the .38 then dip
Empty out the clip
Mind on stead-trip, cuz niggas talk shit

Now if, a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive
And if I was in your shoes, would I survive
Probably not, you'd probably let your Glock go pop
Now drop, to your knees
And picture Dat Nigga Daz flowing in the breeze

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

From the twitch of the eyes
You can see the line, just know it when you see it
Cause it messes up the flow, to the real fillings y'know
And I'd rather be sipping on a glass of wine
Can you feel yourself in the room with Everlast
Trying to steal a flow, I don't think so
Cock-blockers come with their hearts beating jealousy
Then away like a stray dog
Tryin to claim every bitch as his own
Cock-blockers, come in every color
Even blue, now this is true
Trying to fuck your woman, and even you
Now what the fuck would you do, motherfucker",What Would U Do?,2004

The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Anthony Braxton,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak

I would be, caught in the undertow

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1995
Anthony Braxton,"Gee, how I miss
Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

Anthony Braxton,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon

I'll get through today but not tonight 
Almost a perfect life with you 
We were so close, we were almost 

I know I must move on from here 
Don't think of the past
Sometimes there's no amount of love 
That can make it last 
All the feelings that we shared 
That we'll never have again

[Chorus]

So this is me letting you go
And now I've got no one to run to 
We'll always know we were so close 
We were almost

It's traveling away

'Cause I only ever needed one way to run
Here I am miles from where your heart beats

All I'm feeling is the nothing inside

I wait here in the darkness

To come back again

Come back, I don't know how to live without you 
Impossible, I won't make it through

Though you will never know the way I feel

How much longer can my love hide 
When I look at you, with that other man 
How I'd wish you'd understand

Here I go again
I Keep making true same mistakes 
Here I go again
Why do I put myself through this pain
Isn't it a shame
You don't feel this way 
No one else to blame 
Here I go again

I'm used to imagining you here beside me 
Though I am all alone I hear your words whisper 
My friends always ask me, what's on my mind 
If only they knew, I wouldn't have to lie 
When I look at you, with that other man 
How I'd wish you'd understand

Its been playing tricks on me again 
It hides every piece of the puzzle
I find them but it's too late by then
I hear your heart has been mending
The truth is the hardest thing to take and I miss you today 

[Chorus:]

If only I could see you now
If only you could be here in my arms 
How can you find someone 
But lose the one thing you wanted 
Wanted the most
And all these walls are built so high 

I will climb
(If only I could see you, If only I could see you now)
I will climb
(If only I could see you, If only I could see you now)

Blinded by all of the bright lights
Still I can't help see your face 
Where are you now my baby 
You are the one thing I can't replace 
I hear your doin much better 
I'm lying here lonely, make this right 
I miss you tonight

",If Only,2006
Anthony Callea,"No, no one lives for love
How can we go on
When no one lives for love
And though we see the world is falling down around us 
Why can't we see, it's you and me 
Alone, is the sun without the rain to carry on 
Is the heart without the love to keep it warm 
Where did we go wrong, where did we go wrong 
What if this life we live, is a chance for us to give 
What if dreams were made to show the way 
How can we survive, when we push the love aside 
Only God can save us now this night I pray 
No one lives for love
Someone tell me why 
No one lives for love
We must realise, that no one lives for love
When all the beauty of the world is all around us 
Why can't we see it's you and me
And now, as your soul becomes the rain that's falling down
I pray, that we, we can learn to live for love the way 
God has shown us, through your life his, love will find a way
Through your life, we've all learned to live for, love

Anthony Callea,"I walk these streets alone
I see the world around me changing
I'm in a dream
Faces that I knew
Are slowly turning into strangers
I've never seen
I read each line I turn the page
I laugh and cry at this true story
It's time for a new chapter to begin

Why does love fall easily for some
When will it ever come to me
How do I show you what burns inside my heart
I'm not just who you want me to be, to be

I hide out here sometimes
I watch the sunlight leave the skyline
Here I am safe
I close my eyes and sleep
Tomorrow brings another journey
That I will take

Do you tell a white lie 'cause it's easy
Do you keep what you find, like I do

'cause I make perfect mistakes
Day after night and night after day
All my life I try to do better
Show me the way

[Chorus:]
I see it right now, no turning back
I found all the signs for the wrong direction
I am at the crossroads again
This time I know I'm not the same
And maybe it's alright to make a perfect mistake

Do you hurt the ones that you love
Words that were said you didn't mean it
Told too many lies like I did
Have you walked from the scene of the crime
Stole somebody's secret and blown it
It'll come back and get me sometime
'cause I make perfect mistakes
Day after night and night after day
All my life I try to do better
Show me the way

[Chorus]

I don't wanna be falling down like an angel
And the devil takes me when I'm weakest
When I'm lost, confused, when I wanna change my name
But this time I refuse to feel ashamed

All my life I try to do better
Show me the way

I wanna runaway 
I wanna fly to you
I don't wanna live out a lie 
But that's all I can do

I wanna runaway 
I wanna just escape
As sure as the night hides our love 
Soon the dawn must break 
And I will wake
You'll be gone

Oh oh, I wanna runaway

Every time that you believed 
You were there to carry me
Now here I stand 
I know who I am 
You knew how to guide me

I never thought that I could win this fight 
Until you saved me tonignt

When the strength was hard to find

Don't try to fight it, don't try to save me""

[Chorus]
She's a woman in love
And he's gonna break her heart to pieces
She don't want to see
She's a woman in love, but it's not me

Well alright, do what you want
Don't try to talk, don't say nothin'
She used to be the kind of woman
You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
She let the little things go

[Chorus]

Time after time, night after night
She would look up at me
And say she was lonely
I don't understand the world today
I don't understand what she needed
I gave her everything she threw it all away
On nothin'
She's a woman in love",Woman I Love,2005
Anthony David,"I want your kisses in the morning
To let me know that everything will be alright
I want to touch you every night before I go to sleep
And let you know that everything will be just fine

Whenever you're happy 
It makes me happy
I want to be there for you 
And do whatever makes you smile

We only get to see each other every now and then
And know I'm really grateful for that time
It's just not….

It really ain't enough for me
It really ain't enough for me
I really need to have you here by my side

I want to see you when I get home from work
And let go of the worries and the problems of the day
I can listen sitting right outside of the shower curtain
We could both go in bed we can spend a lazy day

And I wanna do right
I don't wanna hurt nobody
If I slip well then I'm sorry
Yes, I am

When I was a young boy
I used to watch my daddy play
And in my heart I?d always say
He was wrong

He had to be crazy
Knocked stone cold out of his mind
To be leaving my pretty momma home alone

She?d always sit patient and waitin' then cussin' and cryin'
And who would have to be there to comfort her
And I would have to look my momma right square in her eyes
And I swear that I would never hurt no one like that

And I'll do all I can

And I don't wanna hurt nobody
If I slip well then I'm sorry
Yes, I am

Now that I'm older, I've found it's time to settle down
Because I need some love around to make me whole
But something is funny 'cause things I swore I'd never do
I find myself all in a victim to losin' total control

Oh yeah, 'cause recently, I ran into
Someone who reminds me of you
And even though I know that kind of thing ain't right

I'm finding myself caught up in lies
Tryin' to swim against the tide
And as the stage gets set for drama
I can't stop thinkin' about my momma

I'm a cheatin' man
And I'll do all I can

Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

I said how about right now

'N I asked if she believed in fate

Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' into her eyes
And when I popped the question much to my surprise

She said, 'Yes'
'N I said wow
I said how about right now
Love can't wait

If you told me last year I'd be laid up like this man
I would have never believed you
Things are a lot different

Seems like it was just a year ago
I was talking sleek about girls
About the little things they do to just piss me off, oh yeah
I was better off alone

I became numb and insensitive
Started being bitter and cold
Tuning in and listening to pimps on the radio and you know
It started making sense to me

But that's when I met my lady
Woman came and changed the game
Happy that I found my lady
And my life would never be the same, oh yeah

Wasn't even looking to fall in love
Was the last thing on my mind
Didn't see it coming till it already had me down
Struck me blind

I was on the verge of being through with the pain
Didn't see a reason to try
Couldn't understand what all these fools kept singing about
'Till I became one of them

When I became your lady
Everything started to change
Happy I became your lady
Life can never be the same

That's when I found my lady

At this place, at this time
All the memories are rushing back again

My old friend, how you been doing, yeah?
Somebody told me that you lived down here
Somebody told me you bought a crib down here
Maybe I could check it out, I could swing by the house
Maybe I could talk you into doing something bad

Or we can put our heads together
And come up with something new, yeah

Share what's happening in our lives

The way you smell, indeed divine

That a love carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate, could suffer so hard
From the game played much too often

And making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections

To be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

And there is something about you, baby, so right
I couldn't be without you, baby, tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one could say that

It's what makes the rivers flow and

You told her from the get go
Now that it's over
She can be like you and let go
But when she laid with you
She broke you off a piece of her spirit

She tried to tell you when you met her
How she was and
And now you're caught up
In this fatal attraction
You can't pretend that in the end
This isn't partly your fault

'Cause she's got no food to eat
And it ain't that, nobody's listening
And it ain't that, nobody cares*
It's just that everybody's busy looking out for what is theirs

I'm a hustler, on the corner, making very little money
But down the block, on the other corner
This nigger's down there getting paid
What's he doing and I ain't doing?
He got clothes and fancy things
Big ole car and pretty women, watch what jealousy and envy brings
On the backstreet, that's where I live
On the backstreet, there ain't positive

Now up the block comes my man Cee-Lo say what's happening, how you feel?
He don't care about no 5 - 0 'cause he's known to keep it real
Peep what's happening down the block yo, who is down there taking mine?
Cee-Lo knows about his bizness, so he runs it down one time
He get keys straight from Miami, hooks it up and sells it cheap
You ain't getting none but O's from Sammy so your prices are too steep
But I got just the thing you need son, if you really want to win
Sun light sparkles on his gold fronts as he makes this evil grin
Take a walk on down to my crib then let me show you something new
I got loads of guns and ammo that I bought from this white dude
He could tell that I was down that I was just the man to see
And he fronted me at least a G's worth of artillery on the backstreet
That's where I live, on the backstreet, yeah
There ain't nothing positive

Now in his bedroom it's amazing, he got guns of every kind
He lights a blunt we start blazing then I picked the one that shined
It's an old school Calicola, semi auto dark as night
It's just the thing I need to make my situation tight
So he shows me how to load it since I don't know what to do
Aims towards the wall and it exploded, through this poster of Ice Cube
Upon so much devastation that it's obvious to me
That is just the thing to separate your soul from your body
On the backstreet, that's where I live
On the backstreet, yeah, there ain't nothing positive

I went home and starting plotting for my come up at midnight
In the darkest catch them slipping, take his re-up money his life
I'll just catch him as he goes out to his car to make a run
Now you can't front when you're confronted with the cold steel of a gun
When night comes and I'm moving on the creep all dressed in black
Wearing a ski mask so he won't know who just put him on his back
So I hid behind the bushes at the people's house next door
3 shots rang out from behind me and my blood began to pour, no
What? What now boy? Told you I was gonna get you boy
Thought he's gonna catch me sleeping, in your dream
Do it hurt? Let's go

Everything happened in one swift action, shit I just couldn't believe
Cee-Lo told them what was happening, I been tricked,I been deceived
And it ain't that, nobody heard it
And it ain't that, nobody cares
It's just that everybody was busy looking out for what was theirs

Non-contributing citizens, what they call the NCC
I don't really know what that means but it's what the cops called me
They don't care what happens to me, they don't miss me on the beat
All they know is that there's one less nigger
Hanging on the backstreet, where I used to live

That things would get better with age

He can help me in the fight with his power

That a love carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate, could suffer so hard
From the game played much too often

And making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections

Me voy de la casa y vendo el anillo ya no te soporto punto y final

Tendré precaución libre de pecado porque en el infierno te puedo encontrar

Que ingrata mujer hasta no ví mala suerte te deseo lo peor

Sentimiento torito

El niño entenderá su madre fue muy mala, quizás me fuiste infiel
Hoy quiero el divorcio aceptes o no aceptes hoy yo me marchare 
Que cruel es tu castigo vivir junto contigo me sube la presión

Our parting coming nearer
The last embrace, the final touch
With nothing more to say
Nothing more to say

As silence fell around the bridge
Not a single word was spoken
A bitter breeze, a lonely stream
Echoed through the Glen
Echoed through the Glen

Agus droichead na gcaointe
Droichead na gcaointe
Agus droichead na ndeor

Memories fade with passing age
In forlorn hope we wait for
Distant hills still haunt us now
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
