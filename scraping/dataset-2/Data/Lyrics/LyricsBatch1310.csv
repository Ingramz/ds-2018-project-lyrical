Billy King,"I'm driving home for Christmas 
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces 
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah 
Well I'm moving down that line
And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away
Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time
But I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights on the run
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me
I am driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

Ooh, top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights on the run
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground
So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me
Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
He's driving, driving home

Billy King,"Es ist ein Ros' entsprungen, aus einer Wurzel zart
Wie uns die Alten sungen, von Jesse kam die Art
Und hat ein Blümlein bracht mitten im kalten Winter
Wohl zu der halben Nacht

Das Röslein, das ich meine, davon Jesaias sagt
Ist Maria die Reine uns das Blumlein bracht
Aus Gottes ew'gen Rat hat sie ein Kind geboren
Und blieb ein' reine Magd

Das Blumelein, so kleine, das duftet uns so süß
Mit seinem hellen Scheine vertreibt's die Finsternis
Wahr' Mensch und wahrer Gott
Hilft uns aus allen Leiden
Rettet von Sünd' und Tod",Es ist ein Ros' Entsprungen,2015

Billy King,"Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eyes
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you, I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears

Ooh
Oh baby
Ooh

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Oh oh now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special, special

Billy King,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall 
The most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then how all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee

Billy King,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
Just like the ones I used to know 
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white 

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

Billy King,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening 
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
When we stroll along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say, are you ready
We say, no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

Billy Kirsch,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1995
Billy Kirsch,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,1995
Billy Klippert,"This conversation's boring it goes nowhere
And it feels like I'm waiting for something

I'm watching shadows crawling up my wall
And I'm wondering where did the sun go
I'm in a room where you just walked right out the door

And I'm just sitting here waiting for the sun to shine again
And now I understand the workings of a troubled mind again

And it's deja vu I get from you it chills me
And I'm wondering where do I go now
'Cause I cannot seem to get up off the floor

And I can no longer rely on my two eyes
In an instant replay that plays over and over
Again inside my mind no big surprise
I'm here again",Again,2004
Billy Klippert,"Got this feeling you lost yourself
In change of seasons there's no one to help

You're all alone, you're all alone
You sold your soul, I told you so

It's aiming for you and you're outnumbered
You've run out of places to hide, it falls upon you
Your days are numbered don't let it take you down

No rhyme no reason you tripped the wires in your head
Fell short of succeeding, do you feel sorry for yourself",Days Are Numbered,2004
Billy Klippert,"Another sunset is gone, another place I don't belong
If you could hear this song oh, Lindsay what went wrong
One thousand long and lonely nights
Can someone out there save this life
You've always been my light, oh, Lindsay something's wrong

Some day far away
I'm gonna give you the world that you wanted
Lindsay don't say you're going to leave me the way
That you found me, I'm still in love

So many words so hard to say and would you hear them any way
But you're so far away, oh, Lindsay I was wrong
I'd give you my last mortal breath 'cause I was lost the day you left
You're better than all the rest, oh, Lindsay hear my song

I'm still in love with your smile with your eyes
With your sweet, sweet soul, now you're walking away",Lindsay,2004
Billy Klippert,"Have another drink, don't worry it's on the house tonight
You're losing all control and you think it's alright
But can't you feel the waves crashing over?

Pull me under, drown me again
Pull me under, I'm still your friend
Your reckless beauty I promise to defend

You stumble and you fall but somehow you're still graceful
And even when you hide, you'll still be in my side
And if the world would turn a little slower, yeah

Pull me under, drown me again
Pull me under, I'm still your friend
Your reckless beauty I promise to defend

Billy Klippert,"What is and what should be that sings like a scene from a movie
But it's all going down waiting on a new day
'Cause a promise may be coming around

I'm counting the hours 'till I see you again
And no one's going to know where we've been

I'm falling from grace right into your arms
How did you know when to be there
With all our mistakes we've buried the scars
But we know where they are

What is and what should be you said you weregoing
To save me and where are you now
So why would I make you stay I wouldn't want it that way
But it's all going down

For every beginning that comes to an end
Another one is starting again, and...

Never asked me for a reason though I know you wondered why
You kept on believing believing you and I
Were meant to be together and maybe you were right

How did you know, how did you know, when to be there",Scars,2004
Billy Klippert,"Who know what tomorrow will bring, all we have is today
Maybe this is the calm before the storm
Who can really say, who can really say

I want to be with you at the end of the world
And breathe my last breath in your arms
I want to be with you at the end of the world
And burn across the sky like two shooting stars

There's no place that I'd rather be
Than with you here today maybe this is the dark
Before the dawn
Who can really say, who can really say

Wherever you are you're what I need
Wherever you are that's where I want to be",With You,2004
Billy Kraven,"You got a face like a doll
Will it last forever, no
I just want your beautiful
You don't need to think about it
Tell me things I wanna hear
Take the truth, I'll take the dare
Feed me lies and eat my fear
Cut the chase and get right to it

We might never meet again

Kiss me like the end will end

Acid mixed with alcohol

Worth the pain, I'm versatile
Quick before they milk it all
No one gives a f*ck about it.

Billy Krechmer,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?

Billy Krechmer,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary Blues,
Billy Krechmer,"A very precious love
Is what you are to me
A stairway to a star
A night in Shangri-La

Twinkle in the shadows
While I dance with you

An echo in the wind

Across the summer lake

Billy Kyle,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,

Billy Kyle Trio,"Had my lunch all alone
Waited for you to phone
Said you call me at two
So at about twenty of three
I had cocktails with Lee
Baby, I don't cry over you

Stood me up in the rain
Tried to hurt me again
Bet you thought I'd be blue
I went out to a show
With a swell guy named Joe
Baby, I don't cry over you

These foolish games you keep playing
Might work with somebody else
But I could have told you
Right from the start
No man is man enough
To break my heart

If you don't come tonight
Think you'll give me a fright
Tell you what I will do
I'll put on my best gown
And go painting this town

I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known

You are mine alone.

For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say 
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

You walked inside my dreams dreaming to me was reality

Hittin Hennessee with my peeps from Tennessee
Givin you a head rush straight to your dome
I'm in the zone, plus I'm sitin on chrome
You jealous, what? Take your black ass home
Yo spots been blown from the brown skin pretty tone
I got it sown plus I'm bad to the bone

[Chubb Rock]
Ever since mom kissed me and said, 'Seek life!'
My mind had an idea like that kid with the kite
No 'caine slingin, strong-arm bringin check my eyes
Redness done, so I can script 'My Life' like Mary Blige
I've, been around the world in 90 days, pro-rated
Like Prince no shame for that past few Sheila's I've dated
Made it, with only one but I'm foreshadowing the rhyme
Like a nice Pirollo(?) wine, life takes time
I'm, one of two and to see it a one who's part of many
The quarters of my thoughts will cost more than a damn penny
Any debate we can correlate as to my release date
A nine-seven slate, New York state will have to check me
It's been some time since the break of the dawn
The genre has definitely changed since I've been gone
Whether, bad or good the flow remain tight
So I can come and drop my li-ight, li-ight

[Chorus]

[Chubb Rock]
Well in the past black men used to work for (?)
My age group was plotting to obtain Dead Nixons
The plot, had three vectors for young prospectors
School, entertain, or become Hannibal Lectors
Stressors, used to stress the best, cess wine
But at that particular time I chose to use my mind
Goody too, size twelve shoe the Troy Ave grew
Waited 'til, after eighteen to introduce the brew
Downed the suds and gave a street buzz
High in the +Forrest+ but stupid is as, stupid does
And, that's all I have to say about that
Flipped a Pulitzer prize script and started rap
Simplistic at first, and the knowledge came later
Rob-ski, Dave Wit, and Swanny on the fader
The struggle was on but the fame was in sight
And the tunnel had a light that distinguished my life

[Chorus]

[Chubb Rock]
The low point was mad low when I lost James Los
Spent eighteen years livin next to this high-pro bro
And that's all I got to say, about that
While I give thanks to the man that my brother and I'm back
Onward, to the medals while the boys aged the mix
To the mental utopia, so walk past the six
And the rhyme and the flow, must stay real tight
Like it's always been in my li-I-ife, my life

[Chorus]",Life,1997

I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Billy Lester,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1995
Billy Lester,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair

Or somebody else whose got their life together
Daisy was a genius in waitress disguise
She spoke of New York, Vegas
Or use a French word, and flirt for my attention
Did I mention, that I was in love

Back home, my mother told me
That Daisy was a poison or just some floosie user
A confuser
But how could she know
That my girl was a flower, a lover
The kind of sunrise that every midnight recovers
Rediscovers, and then you sleep with a smile

And I didn't want to leave her
But this blind man couldn't see her
She just took my love
And since, nobody's seen her

I got killed by a flower
I got taken by a waitress who was pouring it on
I was weak in the knees
Just I wasn't that strong enough to see
That the flower's killing me

With my intuition in remission
I gathered my guitar, got into my car
And left town for New York
I couldn't let Daisy go
I drove like a demon throught Cleveland
With images of her walking New York streets in my rear view
Then my tape deck blew
But my mother's words sang on

And I know I should have let go
But I couldn't live my life and not know
If she ever loved me at all

Where's Daisy going
I searched for days in cafes, cliches
Nobody will ever know just where I've been
I got drunk till I made a scene
I slept on the village green
She was gone, I was wrong
For chasing a dream
I climbed on the top of the Empire State Building
And screamed

I've been living on Grove Street
For three years, waiting on tables
Writing my songs
And the city turned out better,
Better than I planned
But it took a Daisy obsession
And a couple more things that I don't have the pride to mention
To keep my good intentions from a jaded soul

You know I heard she was out in Vegas
At the Palace as a cocktail waitress
And she never loved me at all

Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

And I'm all by myself
I guess she thinks now that she's gone

I won't sit home, all alone

All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm

No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part

For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine

Billy Maxted's Manhattan Jazz Band,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

But I miss you most of all my darling

Billy May,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,

You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

While I was there
I felt romance everywhere

Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday

It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesi meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesi

A lovely senorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesi

She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine

Billy May,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic

Billy May,"London by night is a wonderful sight
There is magic abroad in the air
I'm often told that the streets turn to gold
When the moon shines on Circus and Square 

Deep in the dark that envelops the park
There´s romance in each cigarette glow
Down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems
Seem to wink at each girl and her beau

Up comes the moon when the city's asleep
He´s not alone, for it seems
Somewhere up there stands an angel to keep her watch
While each Londoner dreams

My love and I saw the sun leave the sky
Then we kissed in the fast-fading light
Most people say they love London by day
But lovers love London by night",London by Night,1998

I fell and when I rose

And scandalized my name

Well I went up on a mountain top
To call my baby back
She was gone with that Eastman
Down that lonesome railroad track

If I ever see that Eastman
I'll shoot him with my gun
I'll cut him with my long Jones
And dare that pimp to run

I couldn't sleep last night
Come on back home baby
Everything will be all right

I'll give my life away

Seem to be so cheerful, here's an earful
Of the chatter you hear

every morning, every evening
Ain't we got fun?
Not much money, Oh, but honey
Ain't we got fun?
The rent's unpaid dear
We haven't a bus
But smiles were made dear
For people like us

In the winter in the Summer
Don't we have fun
Times are bum and getting bummer
Still we have fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get children
In the meantime, in between time
Ain't we got fun?

Just to make their trouble nearly double
Something happened last night
To their chimney a gray bird came
Mister Stork is his name
And I'll bet two pins, a pair of twins
Just happened in with the bird
Still they're very gay and merry
Just at dawning I heard

every morning, every evening
Don't we have fun
Twins and cares, dear, come in pairs, dear
Don't we have fun
We've only started
As mommer and pop
Are we downhearted
I'll say that we're not

Landlords mad and getting madder
Ain't we got fun?
Times are so bad and getting badder
Still we have fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get laid off
In the meantime, in between time
Ain't we got fun?

When the man who sold 'em carpets told 'em
He would take them away
They said, ""Wonderful, here's our chance
Take them up and we'll dance""
And when burglars came and robbed them
Taking all their silver, they say
Hubby yelled, ""We're famous, for they'll name us
In the papers today

Night or daytime, it's all playtime
Ain't we got fun?
Hot or cold days, any old days
Ain't we got fun
If Wifey wishes
To go to a play
Don't wash the dishes
Just throw them away

Streetcar seats are awful narrow
Ain't we got fun?
They won't smash up our Pierce Arrow
We ain't got none
They've cut my wages
But my income tax will be so much smaller
When I'm laid off, I'll be paid off

All the little birdies go tweet, tweet, tweet.
And in the evening when the sun goes down

That when she kisses me I sure stay kissed

I want to hold you so much closer than I dare to 
I want to scold you 'cause I care more than I care to 

And when you touch me and there's fire in every finger 
I get ideas, I get ideas 
And after we have kissed goodnight and still you linger 
I kinda think you get ideas too

Billy May & His Orchestra,"Gee, it's great after bein' out late
Walkin' my baby back home
Arm in arm over meadow and farm
Walkin' my baby back home

We go 'long harmonizing a song
Or I'm recitin' a poem
Owls go by and they give me the eye
Walkin' my baby back home

We stop for a while, she gives me a smile
And snuggles her head on my chest
We start in to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest

After I kinda straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
Once kiss then I continue again
Walkin' my baby back home

She's afraid of the dark so I have to park
Outside of her door till it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
I dry her tears all through the night

Hand in hand to a barbecue stand
Right from her doorway we roam
Eats and then it's a pleasure again
Walkin' my baby
Talkin' my baby
Lovin' my baby
I don't mean maybe
Walkin' my baby back home",Walkin' My Baby Back Home,2004

The same old pounding in my heart

When I awake I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view

Come rain-come shine

The oceans roar, a thousand drums

Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings

When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

But it was just one of those things",Just One of Those Things,2007
Billy May & His Orchestra,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.
I'm a lazy lout that's just about to stop,
But if Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top! You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you simply too, too, too divine,
You're a Botticelli, You're Keats, You're Shelley,
You're Ovaltine.
You're a boon, You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon over Mae West's shoulder.
I'm a nominee of the G.O.P. or GOP,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.
By the River Rhine, You're a sturdy stein of beer,
You're a dress from Saks's, You're next year's taxes,'
You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,
You're the foist in the Irish svipstick,

And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of flowers and song
When day is done and the sun touch the sea in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Tierra Novada
Soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft carbinera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay

I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico

And luscious lips, as red as wine

I left her and threw away the key to paradise

In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye

Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

He can laugh, but I love it

And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one

-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet

Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses

You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Does enchantment pour out of every door?

Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced

A comfortable in three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there
On a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar-speak

And of course you can't become
If you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me

Making sure I'm not in too deep

Across the street later that week
My sticky paws were in to making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight foot heap

Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me
If you steal my sunshine
Making sure I'm not in too deep
If you steal my sunshine

Keeping versed and on my feet
If you steal my sunshine

I know it's done for me

Not as some and hard to see
If you steal my sunshine

Keeping dumb and built to beat

Billy Mize,"Oh, hang your head in shame
Oh, don't your conscience ever bother you
Every time you hear my name
Well, try and think of all that I've gone through
And then you hang your head in shame

Someone came along and took my place
Then you gave me all the blame
Well, you should go somewhere and hide your face
And then hang your head in shame

When you said I was the only one
Was it just your little game?
Now look back on all the harm you've done
And then you can hang your head in shame

I should hate you but I love you still
In my heart I kept the flame
Oh, you'll be sorry, darling, yes you will, will
And you gonna hang your head in shame

At the armory

Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance

Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere

And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey

And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away

You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone

Billy Novick,"How little we know!  
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow from lover to lover!
How little we understand what touches off that tingle,
That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle.
Who cares to define what chemistry this is?
Who cares, with your lips on mine, how ignorant bliss is?
So long as you kiss me, and the world around us shatters,
How little it matters, how little we know.
How little we understand what touches off that tingle,
That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle.
Who cares to define what chemistry this is?
Who cares, with your lips on mine, how ignorant bliss is?

Billy Novick,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

Billy Novick,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2002

She said I was the tiger
She wanted to tame

Caribbean queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

I lose my cool
When she steps in the room
And I get so excited
Just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

I was in search of a good time
Just running my game, yeah

Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind

There'll be sad songs to make you cry, love songs often do,

If I had to paint a picture
To show the world how true love can really be
I would use the brightest colors

Billy Ocean,"I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again I wouldn't change a thing
Cause this love is everlasting

Suddenly life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of
You wake up suddenly you're in love

Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before now you're all I'm living for

Each day I pray this love affair would last forever

There's beauty up above and things you never take notice of
You wake and suddenly you're in love",Suddenly,1993

Billy Parker,"Oh, you tell me that you love me
Yes, you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married
But tomorrow's never there.

Oh, tomorrow never comes
No, tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me
But tomorrow never comes.

Many weeks now have I waited
Many long nights have I cried
Just to see that happy morning
When I'd have you by my side.

Oh, tomorrow never comes
No, tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me
But tomorrow never comes.

So tomorrow I'll be leaving
Yes, tomorrow I'll be gone
And tomorrow you'll be weeping
But tomorrow never comes.

Oh, tomorrow never comes
No, tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me
But tomorrow never comes.",Tomorrow Never Comes,1990
Billy Pat Ellis,"I love that hair, long an' black
Hangin' down to the middle of your back
Don't cut it off whatever you do
I need it to run my fingers through

'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby

Got me a dollar that I saved
Saved it up for a rainy day
Everybody's callin' for bills that's due
But they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you

'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby

Got me a guitar, got a six strings
And a picker to make 'em ring
Every string's gotta know what to do
'Cause I'm gonna use 'em to serenade you

'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my baby

Well, I had me a gal, she said she's mine
But she run around on me all the time
Now she's gone an' I'm glad we're through
'Cause I'm plum-flipped over you

'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby

Oh, baby, baby, yeah you're my baby
Well, I don't mean maybe
You drive me crazy
I love you, baby, you're my, babydoll
