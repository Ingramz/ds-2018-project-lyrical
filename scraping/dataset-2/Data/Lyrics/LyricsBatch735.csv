Miley Cyrus,"Hey! I ain't looking at you
For no particular reason
It doesn't inspire for me to be in
I gotta open that door
Hey, I gotta get it open hey
I'm breaking way through, just like the robber
And smile for the camera
Damn, I feel awesome!
But she doesn't know more
Gotta get it opened!

You never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject
Cause, cause it's beyond you
When you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up and do it on my own!
I found a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my one, hey!
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own

Can't you get it done with the help of no one
I came to this word by myself
So I don't need nobody else!
We have just begun,
So much to do, so young
Don't be afraid of alone
You'll get it done on your own!
Uh, uh, uh!

I know you're in there
Open up, open up!
Just like the feds, looking for the stuff
Three knocks at the door
I gotta get it open!
I'm so confused with all the traffic
I'mma skip the line
Who cares what happens
I gotta stay on that course
I gotta get it open!

(Bangerz, f***in' bangerz)

All the way in the back, with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me ""what you doing with that""
Yeah yeah, you say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack

One day he wants me, one day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sitting 'round here waiting on a man
To tell me where the f*** my seat be at, where Mike Will at?

She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (F***in' bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff

Flying high up on a bird like a phobiac
I slick caught her, eying down my purse where the dollars at?
I love when all the rents due on the first,
They can call a hearse 'cause if there's any violation I go off with that

Cat walk, slick talk, flirting with them big dogs
(Why I need his milli's when I got Billy on the speed dial)
(You know I'm on that meow) Quick to scratch your eyes out
Struttin' on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (F***in' bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff

The play boss, the play, got to get that big rocks
Sit that on my hand, make that media big talk
The playin' boss, the play, sike that must be the purple
Got up in my brain, had me a little bit dismal

Miley Cyrus,"If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door, without me
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

I used to believe love conquers all
That's what seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see real life's much different

I don't want to see you go
Only want to see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see you there
We cried we lied, cannot pretend to change the fact
That what we had could make us feel alive again
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope
Tell me that now is not the end

If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door, without me
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
'cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else..
I've turned into someone else

I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
And fill me up when I'm empty

I don't want to see you go
Only want to see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see you there
We cried we lied, cannot pretend to change the fact

I can’t live a lie, running for my life

And now, you’re not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn

You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie dawg, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And I'mma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, give it time, time reveals

For a long, long time

I still know you're mine
Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough
But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time

Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody ever love you more than me
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'

Blow it high for the ones who ain't here
Seems like every day we putting one six feet underground
So bless
What goes up must come down

Now my buzz is gone, and I need to re-up on reality
Can't let me see them weak I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me

Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, and since when
So put 'em high, and tell 'em this
You can't aim, but you never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, and since when
So raise a glass to the memories and set em' free
And fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays

Tomorrow when you wake up and realise life ain't fair
Throw it back and make the whole world disappear
You never miss what you had, then it's gone
That is why, something will always go wrong

Miley Cyrus,"I read the news today oh boy 
About a lucky man who made the grade 
And though the news was rather sad 
Well I just had to laugh 

I saw the photograph. 
He blew his mind out in a car 
He didn't notice that the lights had changed 
A crowd of people stood and stared 
They'd seen his face before 
Nobody was really sure 
If he was from the House of Lords. 

I saw a film today oh boy 
The English army had just won the war 
A crowd of people turned away 
But I just had to look 
Having read the book 
I'd love to turn you on. 

Woke up, fell out of bed, 
Dragged a comb across my head 
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup, 
And looking up I noticed I was late. 
Found my coat and grabbed my hat 
Made the bus in seconds flat 
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, 
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream. 

I read the news today oh boy 
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire 
And though the holes were rather small 
They had to count them all 
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. 
I'd love to turn you on",A Day in the Life,2014
Miley Cyrus,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's (Gone)

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah

Followed her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're (Gone)

And waste life
It's just gonna go on forever
Like there's some eternal endless supply
Of what it takes to keep us alive
There might be a day
Where everything goes away to remind us
How ungrateful our culture is
We need to take time
To replace what's stolen from mother nature

We only had one sun, one moon, one me
One you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun) the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
We only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)

I once heard Grace Jones say
""I have my own concept of time""
I always think bout' that cause I've always felt like
I was running a little behind
But what's in front of me
I don't know
'Cause I can't see what hasn't started to grow

We only had one sun, one moon, one me
One you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun) the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)

Wake up, world
Can't you see the earth is crying?
Wake up, world
Can't you see all the clouds are dying?
And maybe one day there won't be rainbows
Grass won't be green and the sky won't be blue
I don't wanna see a cyclone
There's no sun, no moon, no me, no you

We only had one sun, one moon, one me

If you want to come in while I'm sleeping
I'm always sleeping naked
'Cause I wake up and you're creeping
Want to lick it so much
It's almost like I taste it on the tip of my tongue
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like
I can feel it on my fingertips
I want yours inside of me
But don't forget where I like licking baby
I want to make your fantasies realities
I want to be yours baby

I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

There ain't nothing I'm scared to try
I can be on top or if you like it I can just lie here
Take my picture position my body
Wherever you like just know I like it naughty
Teach me a lesson pretend we never met
But we just can't keep kissing
'Cause you're getting me so wet

The only downside to this morning is
You getting up and you leaving
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em
I wake myself up 'cause I'm screaming
What are you doing me
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage

Here I am, here you are
I want it so hard
You finger my heart
I know just what I need
What I came here to do
I've been thinking baby
Been mostly about you

Alright, I was sleeping next to him
But I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything
That he fucking did just made me cringe
And it was so hard to fall in
But so easy just to fall back right out again
This whole time, I could give to you
And I could paint you pictures
But I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe
I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling
'Cause my energy's just so strong that
I don't know if I'm creating this
Or this is actually what is meant to be
And you know that, they say
That you gotta think what you want into existence
But you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so
I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess

You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
Takes everything in me not to call him
I really, really, really want it, too
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

You know what, in the beginning
It was like we were fucking homies and shit
And then all of a sudden you started with
Some fucking baby goo goo tongue
Down my fucking throat I mean
Even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations
Where I look like a dumbass bitch
And I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA
I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be
More opposite of my last dickhead but
You know I just, I don't know
If I can get over the fucking goo

You keep saying again and again
We're laying in my bed just talking
And now I, now I can't hold it back
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really want to live out of you
I heard I change my mind with you often
Baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit
That's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what
Look, I like when you send me
You know, the, the queen emoji
But when I send back the monkey
You know, the ones with the
The hands over the eyes, that means
That shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it person
I just bury my head in your armpit which
Weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a fifteen minute
Oh, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit
And I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing
But no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo

I had a dream that we were in a weird sky
Why do people let their dreams
Be somethin' so bad?
Such a weird fuckin' dream
Flyin' around into the sky, superman
Changing tigers and your arrows land in circles
Those religious fucks will never understand

And we always end up singin' the same songs
They remind us of the bullshit in the world
Maybe it wasn't really a dream
I can't really tell anymore

And we always end up singin' the same song
'Cause we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget that we were wrong
And we always end up singin' the same song
And we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget we were wrong",Tiger Dreams,2015
Miley Cyrus,"I had a dream
Davie Bowie taught us how to skateboard but he
Was shaped like Gumby
And I had a dream, we took a helicopter
Flew it up too high
Got stuck in the clouds, don't wanna come down
And I had a dream, we went on a safari
I said look at that lion
She reminds me of you 'cause you're the queen
And I had a dream that you were dying
But I wasn't even crying
I just sang you to sleep, I sang you to sleep

But what does it mean?
What does it all mean?
I had a dream
But what did it mean, what did it mean?

And I had a dream we robbed the record store
The one with the yellow door
We stole every goddamn record they had
And I had a dream that I didn't give a fuck
But I give a fuck
I miss you so bad, I think I might die

But what does it mean, what does it mean, I had a dream
But what does it mean, what does it mean, what does it all mean?

And I had a dream, we were being chased by a monster
Or maybe they were aliens
But I wasn't scared cause you were there
And I had a dream, we took karate
That's when you said you loved me
You loved me

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

no bought it by the lines
'til tomorrow shine coast to coast
blow the smoke go for broke

& keep sippin' fifths 'til ya pis poor
& if ya can't handle this

It's strictly herb in the chest cavity
so we high to defy all the laws of gravity

Cigarrellas split open rollin' icky sticky lime green
High mean of high ?? to raise the limit to keep
burnin' Spinach 'til the moonlight diminish
still blazin' one nigga who ain't never too faded
let me explain it the rage man
they babble it's street babble
smoke herb & rearrange words together like Scrabble
Grab yo' E & J yo' Hennessaay yo' Presidentaay

We keep it lit y'all
but don't you get crossed up like ya bitch bra

Ja rakkautta varten

And Frowners never win

The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can

Faster than Roger Clemens,
Ya know the kid with the O's
That's as large as linens
When it comes to sellin' trees
I'm as large as Timberland
My lawyer got my charges slimmin'
He said the only way I am goin upstate
If it's in larger swimmin'
Pull out the garage like gremlins
Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'
And me and Flex don't roll unless they Andrew Jackson
It's Brooklyn by me the crook the I-B ya even look

Swinging on the poles
Buying coke, then they sniff it up in they nose

Were there too many people fighting in your head
Sometimes in love we all regret
That's when the bruises show and you know your love is dead

Hope in life there's something better
Now she draws the line on you
Her freedom feels like sweet surrender
Breathing is so pure and tender
Now she draws the line on you

She tried in vain but he can't hear the thruth
His only colour turned her blue

She's got nothing left to lose

Oh what can free the tase of sweet surrender
A trip away from love's own cruel pretender

Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing woman into life
She has danced into the danger zone
When a dancer becomes a dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-build iron sanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard warm place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push of the world but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold connective heat
Struggling, stretching for defeat
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go

Mary, a girl at a party
Pretty face, fantasy body
On the strength girl was fine
Mission: make her mine
So I stepped to her shyly
Before I could speak she walked right by me
Frozen, lost my cool
Out of the groove, what´s my next move
Should I chill, should I follow
Heart is pounding, I feel hollow
Paused, thought for a minute
If she was a pool I´d jump right in it
So in her path I did step
Nervous but I still had pep
It didn´t matter where she went to
I would be there too

Mary had a little boy but little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go

Saw her at the mall
Stand tall, courage don´t fall
To her smoothly I approached
Tried to speak and almost choked
Abnormal for the ruthless chiller
Normally I´m a ladies killer
Why were my nerves shaky
I knew she´d make me and not break me

Here she comes, should I talk to her now
Yes, it´s now or never

Hello Mary, how´s your day
Hope it´s going in the right way
How about dinner and some dancing
Later on some romancing
Music, we could talk
And express our inner thoughts
How about it, what do you think

When you where not the one you wanted to be

Can't you see the pain inside
Over the years we can hide
How long will you be able to stand yourself
If you think no one is stopping you

Only jealousy is blind
But there's a light that brings me back
It takes me to the right horizon
Takes me where I want to be",Becoming,2013

Leaving me a song that will not die

The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Millage Gilbert,"Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world",Rainy Night in Georgia,1997

So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day
Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say
That Man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flocks by night
Them see a bright new shining star
Them hear a choir sing
The music seemed to come from afar

Now, Joseph and his wife, Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
Them find no place to born she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day
Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say
That Man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

By and by, they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's litlle Boy was born

Millard Thomas,"I peeked in to say goodnight
When I heard my child in prayer
And for me some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair

All the stores were closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons
Not one ribbon for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching
And just before the dawn was breaking
I peeked in and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be a hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair",Scarlet Ribbons,1999
Millard Thomas,"Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

As morning breaks the heaven on high
I lift my heavy load to the sky
Sun comes down with a burning glow
Mingles my sweat with the earth below

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

I see woman on bended knee
Cutting cane for her family
I see man at the waterside
Casting nets at the surging tide

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

I hope the day will never come
When I can't awake to the sound of drum
Never let me miss carnival
With calypso songs philosophical

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

Mille Petrozza,"Down on his knees he sees the devil weeping/whinging his tongue
Mr. Cadillac doesn't even know he's been fighting his own
He's been trying shooting all the angels/devils inside
Playing around with the good and the evil in his mind
Alone in the desert and cold so cold

Driving back to the 10 house city something is wrong
He found the killer weapon in his car on the floor
Delusional the blood lost paint his mind in a cave
Feeding monsters in the back of his head
Killer, ripper, who are you
Take a look into the mirror then you will know
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better

Welcome to a world of chaos, you've been caught in the light
Saw the door to the 10 house tale 7 shots in the night

Standing in the dark and shaking my own hand for a while
Saw the angel/devil vanished out in the light
Breathing new air for a day to begin
Soulless body with an empty shell
Killer, ripper, who are you
Take a look into the mirror then you will know
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better

The price was high to pay and the memories are all crying like a child
A reason for all the blood that leaked, and a call up for the wild

I can't understand you're not anymore

all the things that we've been through
In my memory forever, you'll be there until I die

doesn't matter it's the end

But it looks good, just as it should
feels good, not when you're filled up with regret

Everything has it's time and I will sure have mine
so many things that we start almost tear us apart, eventually
everyone has their own way they got to go
so many things that we start with people who breaks our heart
one time, then do the same to another one

We're under stress again, but it has always been that way

random I am, I never give a damn about what's gonna happen next

Or how to be, to get some more out of me
I'm twenty two, so far away from all my dreams

But if it makes you feel better than this story's rather sad

Just let me tell you what I think
I think you really stink
You took my feelings and went away, stay away
Is it enough or do you want some more?
I will never open my door for you anymore
If you don't change your way, stay away

I don't want to ask you another question
About me and you
Because you don't care
You're acting like a square, is this fair?

I saw too many inmates falling apart
Call for the gods and let them out when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whispering)
I make it hotter in the summer colder in the winter
If the court paroal ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunning when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is coming
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal

Fuck shooting legs
Cock back put his brains on the pave

First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook

Turn quarters when you turn quarters know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimmy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

Dreams of bein a doctor will deteriorate
Takin over the underworld was a clearer fate
Luxury cars, a hundred girls at my face
Laced the name brand, had my game plan mapped out

Lost respect for those cracked out
Most of my elders were failures
To the poison that killed Len Bias from bein Celtic
The later I would hang, the greater my slang

It took my english, replaced it with game
Only cared about, sneakers and two-two bullets
Influenced by the hood, wasn't scared to pull it
Dared to do what I would

First blunt they passed me tasted nasty
Then overwhelmed in the spell the blunt had me
Eyes red, pants saggin
My first dime cut me off for braggin

That we was home alone tappin
Experimentin liquors, doin mixes, feelin sicker
Finish the Henn, throw the bottle, hope it hit ya

[Nas]
Blacked out, I can't see shit sober, not the least bit
Hold your head little man, why'all can't tell me shit
Try to knock the pants off shorty, my hair just cut
My Timbs just bought, the chain I sport I floss

Thugs walkin through the block party, hands on my drawers
Poppin cham' corks, posin like the man of New York
Talk to this hottie with my niggaz who quick to blast you
If you old cats, to these niggaz, they harass you

Hey yo 'cause, growin up, I almost shattered my plans
Some might say, I'm young at heart, but I'm a grown-ass man
Givin food to my fam, damn, remember the first time

A street thug showed me how to pitch dimes
Only twelve in this hell where kids die
I want bricks off the scale and just slide, and let my shit fly
My Range shift by, I peel the road up

With my shirt up, sweatin, with the ice restin on my chest
Wild as a teenage thug

[Chorus]

[Millenium Thug]
Livin and lovin this life, cap peel pump niggaz
And since these thugs is trife, give 'em dap for that
Yo where your mack at? I got mine
Twist weed pop wine shift finds, at the end of the night, it's all fine

Livin and lovin, cash stack cousin
Yo' own fam blitz so quick, put clips through whips
Six type shit let you hold it, ice roll with
Twenty below with gat golden, my hand look swollen

Under my glove shit rocky
Unless somebody in my life try to stop me, get popped papi
A breddern, straight to the head that my medicine

No fam of mine do time, we crime settlin
Deliverancy unbelivable, Na'shon tracks smash people

And plus it clap happy all of them hoes that's born happy

He lost his weight in friends

De pasion para entregar a quien las pida

Millie Jackson,"It was a hot afternoon,
Last day of June,
And the sun was a demon,
The clouds were afraid,

One-ten in the shade,
And the pavement was steaming.
I told Billy-Ray,
In his red Chevrolet,

I needed time for some thinking,
I was just walking by,
When I looked in her eye,
And I swore it was winking.

She was 31 and I was 17,
I knew nothing about love, she knew everything,
When I saw down beside her on the front porch swing,
And wondered what the coming night would bring.

The sun closed her eyes,
As it climbed in the sky,
And it started to swelter,
The sweat trickled down the front of her gown,
And I thought it would melt her.

She through back her hair,
Like I wasn't there,
And she sipped on a julep,
Her shoulders were bare,
And I tried not to stare,
When I looked at her two lips.

And when she looked at me,
I heard her softly say,
I know you're young,
You don't know what to do or say,
But stay with me until the sun has gone away,
And I will chase the boy in you away.

And then she smiled and we talked for a while,
And we walked for a mile to the sea,
We sat on the sand, and the boy took her hand,
But I saw the sun rise as a man.

Ten years have gone by,
Since I looked in her eye,
But the memory lingers,
I got back in my mind,
To the very first time,
And feel the touch of her fingers,

It was a hot afternoon,
Last day of June,
And the sun was a demon,
The clouds were afraid,
One-ten in the shade,
And the pavement was steaming...",Summer (The First Time),1974

Made me feel secure

Yet all that you give
There's a question that needs an answer
How can you give your love to another
Come home and face me the morning after

How do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
After you've given your love to someone new

Tell me now, how do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
I lay here all night long waiting on you

I know, I know, I know
You must be dying inside
If you tell me, you'll be confessing
So you can't apologize

Ooh, it hurts me so
To know that I'm the one to suffer
To know that I must be second best
When the best has gone to another

How do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
After you've given your love to someone new

Tell me now, how do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
After I lay here all night long waiting on you

Did she make you wanna cry the morning after
After you've given your love to someone new

Tell me now, how do you feel the morning after
After I lay here all night long waiting on you

Oh, baby, how do you feel the morning after
After I lay here all night long waiting on you",How Do You Feel the Morning After,1974

The one who said shed rather be alone

Just for a while, if I could make you mine

Too long in the rain

you look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
and pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.

All you gotta do is smile that smile

Just leave it up to you and in a little while
you're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses.

We both agreed it was gonna be a one-night thing, no strings attached.
I go my way and you go yours, and look what happened.

And I'm used to nights that go by slow.

But you never cross my mind,
Though I cry from time to time.
No, you never cross my mind.
You just stay there all the time.

I got a letter from you. You promised you wasn't gonna do that.
But from time to time my eyes found a picture,
The very one I forgot to put away.
Hmmm.
Just another memory trying to make me miss you,
And I found one more without you in my mind.
But you never cross my mind,
Though I cry from time to time.
No, you never cross my mind,
But you just stay there all the time.

You want to know why I'm calling you.
I want to know why you wrote to me.
Well, I-I--I just wanted to say hi.
I can understand that, 'cause...

Now and then, a friend will say they saw you, 
And I said what could all that matter to me.
You know what, late at night, when I'm content with being lonely,
I get this unwanted visit from old misery.
And that's why, that's why you never cross my mind.
And you never cross my mind.
No, you never cross my mind.
You just stay there (Stay there.),
Stay there (Stay there) all the time.
I said you never, never cross my mind,
Even though, I find myself crying from time to time.
I don't care what you say, 
I know you never cross my mind.

the cat was out of the bag
They would call it abuse

And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.

And will you still love me tomorrow

I guess she got back too soon for him, ‘cause she saw the car when he pulled away

And she was selling some new perfume
That she wanted his wife to try

Lord, he'd spent his life in jail
He didn’t even have enough common sense

But his love must’ve been too strong
But even a dog will get tired if you keep on doing him wrong
He won’t even come to you if you offer him his favorite bone, so she told him

Go on and hit the door

Time to give those blues a rest
Play for keeps - bet your life

Missionary or kama sutra?

There's only one thing left for you to do

Take the plunge - leap in the dark

How can I go on?

With you by my side,
You told me you loved me,
But honey you lied.
You left me here cryin',

Waitin' 'til the break of day appears, oh oh oh.
All night long weepin' like a willow,
Tossin' and turnin' on my tear stained pillow,

Macgyver's been hurt. 
He was just on his way home 
From saving the world again, 
He got jumped by some kids, 
He went down, now he's dying."" 

So I threw on my coat 
An ran out the door, 
Sped through the night 
To the old hospital, 
Where the doctors said to wait, 
So I camped in the ward, 
Watching the clock 
As it haemorrhages time so slow. 
And I've lingered here so long. 
The air in here so cold. 
The shallow breath so quiet. 
The Shibboleth of Macguiver laid bare, 
Flat on a table, 
Blackened by bruises he couldn't explain. 
And there was nothing he could build 
To save himself 
Out of biros and blue-tack. 

They opened up his cavities 
In the operating theatre, 
But the doctors couldn't find a heart, 
His lymph glands running motor oil. 
His calloused fingers lie inert, 
Their intricate ability 
Punctured by the God-shaped hole 
In adolescent consciousness. 

He couldn't build a bomb to mend 
The splinters of his broken heart. 
His home-made radar couldn't find 
A way to make his weapons art.

Of inverted discrimination, because it's getting old.

Million Dollar Dream,"I can taste the gin and oxy on your lips

When you can't even open your eyes
And I tried to right your wrongs
But I just end up with all of your lies

Such a pretty face but such an ugly mess
You got everyone but choose the loneliness
Yeah we crash and burn
And we argue to the point of no return
Yeah I'm finally done
And this song's been sung
So this I dedicate to you

Whoa oh oh oh

Oh baby it's a dedication, a dedication
This is dedicated to you
Baby it's a dedication, a dedication
This is dedicated to you

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow

Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings

Oh lying by your side
Tongue tied mesmerized I try

Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
With you

Weather is in disarray
Like all the things I've seen today
Come on take me away
Oh is it the clothes you wear
The color of your hair
Or your eyes they shine and shine and shine

Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
With you

Ah which way should I jump
Ah which way should I jump
Ah which way should I jump
Ah which way should I jump

No me importan los consejos que me dan

Yo prefiero no esconder mis sentimientos
Y que sepas que te quiero de verdad
Es tan grande este amor que yo te tengo
Que no puedo y no lo quiero callar

Siempre en el amor uno quiere más
Que el otro y yo se
Que soy quien está queriendo más
Pero que mas da estoy tan enamorada de ti

(En tus manos he puesto mi vida)
Soy tuya amor mío incondicional
(Has conmigo amor lo que tú quieras)
Pero nunca me dejes tú de amar

(En tus manos he puesto mi vida)
Pues yo no sé vivir si tu no estas

Jamás en mi vida hay enamorada

A ti que eres el bueno de los buenos, la mano que se extiende
Y llega al cielo

Vive que la vida te sonríe
Que te da los buenos días
Aunque llueva o se te caiga el mundo encima
Vive que la vida es una sola
Aunque guardes bajos llaves los papeles
Que aseguren tu parcela allá en la gloria

A ti que frente al mar te cresen alas
Y sin más nubes que tus sueños va lloviendo la esperanza
A ti que un simple beso es un milagro
Y sin golpes en el pecho ya te sientes perdonado

Pa' los muertos de los vivos, esos mismos que no te dejan crecer

Al que se tira y se recoge, de el debemos aprender

Milly Quezada,"Toma de mi corazón sus viejos recuerdos
Ahógalos entre tus ojos en tu, fabrica de sueños
Rompe la voz del adiós que hay en mi esquina

Visteme con tu esperanza, envuélveme en tu vida
Subo la bandera de mi amor sobre tu pecho
Te hago un traje de pasión que llevo, dentro

Baño tus espacios con la miel de un solo beso mio
Sirvo por la calle tu canción, sobre tu lecho
Un nuevo amor no avisa nunca nunca cuando

Llega pequeño fuego que se convierte, en hoguera y te quema
Y un nuevo amor se acuesta, de tu lado sin permiso
Sin, importarle el silencio frio de la espera

Amiga yo no se que esta pasando 
Será que habrá encontrado otra mujer 
Ya no es el mismo, su indiferencia 
La siento por las noches, rechaza mi presencia 

Amiga no será que has descuidado 
La forma de buscarlo en el amor 
Quizás la casa, la rutina 
Se ha convertido en tu enemiga 
Y estás cobrando un alto precio por tu error

Al llegar la madrugada
Tu manera de hacerme el amor
Al cielo me hace subir

Conmigo a un mundo nuevo
Muy lejos de aquí

Llévame a donde tu quieras

Contigo soy feliz

En un barco sin destino
Navegando en lo prohibido
Atrapados en los mares de pasión

Perdidos entregados sin medidas
En silencioy a escondidas
Esperando a que amanesca
En nuetra tierra prometida

A nuestra felicidad

Donde nadie nos diga
Que trendemos que amar
Y veremos a unos
Corazones h echándose a volar

Although we're few in numbers, we're the finest in the land
We play at wakes and weddings and at every fancy ball
And when we play the funerals, we play the March from Saul

Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band

Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair
The annual celebration, all the gentry will be there
When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the hand
Says he, I never saw the likes of MacNamara's Band

Oh, my name is Uncle Julius and from Sweden I did come
To play with MacNamara's Band and beat the big bass drum
And when I march along the street the ladies think I'm grand
They shout, there's Uncle Julius playing with an Irish band

Oh, I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a uniform of green
And I'm the funniest lookin' Swede that you have ever seen
There is O'Brians, O'Ryans, O'Sheehans and Meehans, they come from Ireland
But, by yimminy, I'm the only Swede in MacNamara's Band

My expression's erased
I'm stuck in this place
I wanna feel my face
I wanna feel my face

I'm wandering through the city
This calm summer breeze
Brushing across my case

I'm charging up myself
Through these streets I should know
These buildings once covered in snow
Just yesterday

I'm pushing through the years
These warm, younger years
That brought me here

I'm listening as they whisper in my ear
Pushing me back to what I wanna be
What I try to be
That calm, tame beast inside of me

Can you see my face?

Inside of me

Milosh,"I didn't sleep all night
I didn't sleep all night
I didn't sleep all night
I didn't sleep all night

Made a phone call last night
I've been thinking about it all day
I made you cry last night
But it's okay 'cause I heard you say I love you

I floated in those words
I floated in those words

I don't even know why I feel what I feel
I don't even know why I think what I think
I don't even know why I do what I do

I'm in love with you
You barely even noticed
What's good about me

So I'll keep on tapping my way
This song as my cane
For someone who dares
Take on this man inside of me
You could hardly see

Falling away

So I'll keep on swimming my way
Through that pitch black part of me
Singing this tongue tied and twisted melody
There you go falling into that sea of people

Falling away

You're falling away
It's gone without a trace
I'm singing love songs again

You're falling away
Those dark streets inside of me
How further can they be

Now I can finally see
That pretty seed inside of me
The one thing I need inside of me

And that beast ingrained in me
Is bursting to see
What you and I can be

I made for you as you sang along
Now I'm singing songs for everyone but you

As long as there's something that I can control

Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road [Live],2006

Milow,"Coming of age ain't about what you do
It's giving in to what's predefined
When you trade all your dreams for compromise

The path that you chose has got highs has got lows
But it's never what you have in mind

Must say that I still wonder why

But when it comes to living, dying is the easy part
Not exactly what you had in mind

I really doubt that I'll find out

You might ask if these thoughts that I just summed up
Are of any importance to you
Maybe not but when things don't turn out like you planned

Comes with only two shots of sad

Milow,"Life always dumps something in your lap
You're constantly busy redrawing your map
You leave behind a fading trail
Of images and words that you hope will prevail

Life always dumps something in your way
You try to make the best of it everyday
You could give up and give in but you prefer
To keep hoping some kind of change might occur
Just hoping some kind of change might occur

Misery sure loves company
And nobody's ever who they seem to be
The daily horror of people at their worst
And most selfish, one day, your bubble will burst

So much time should not have passed
At least not that way and not so fast
It wasn't always easy, it wasn't always fun
But it was always worth it, regrets I have none
It was always worth it, regrets I have none

Life always dumps something so you should try.
To acknowledge the fact you're surrounded by
These relics of a life that no longer exists
Your name still appears on the waiting lists

Life always dumps something that makes things worse
There are no rules in this self-help universe
It's never what you were expecting to find.

There's darkness ahead and there's darkness behind.

There's darkness ahead and there's darkness behind.

For one more day

Milow,"I'm Peter van der Hold
I'm 68 years old
I doubt some questions have increased
In 42 years of being a priest
I'm at the end of my life
I'm not sure if I'm gonna survive
I often don't know what to say
When I talk to Him, when I pray
In reply I receive
Only silence, no relieve
I've waited in vain for a little advice
From that great voice in ethereal skies

Once I was revolutionary
A devoted mercenary
A gifted student in God's hands
Now I'm old and sick of his demands
I tried to be honest and good
Did my job the best I could
But I always stayed that average man
Right in the spot where I began
During the grieve with which I've dealt
Spent three decades since I've felt
The certainty I so adored 'bout the existence of the Lord

I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago

I'll give him to my perish
Things I don't have myself but cherish
And namely love and charity
Mostly purpose that's what sets you free
So I'm where the metaphores
Are not comforting anymore
I think I'm almost done with my search
Got old so fast even in my church
But feels as if I'm kept out
Some sort of secret about
The meaning of live sometimes
Can't fail to notice these are mediocre types

I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago
I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago

And time has made me good at one thing
And horrible at everything else
The blessings of a world divine
Were always elsewhere and never mine
Oh, I would like to hold someone
Briefly maybe have some fun
My body's hardly designed
So I'm not really the hugging kind
Not once has there been
Someone with a softer skin
Who reached out for me in the middle of the night
'Cause my own lumpy mattress would've turn on the light
I think I've been miscast
And the time of saints is passed
My faith is reclassed but not least
After 42 years of being a priest
The church is like a woman
Thing out of reach like a vision
She glimmers in the distance which I could never quite get
Now I'm stuck here with my regret

I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago
I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago

I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago
I've seen enough, that's why I know
God left this place, long long time ago

In the sea, baby, all I do is wish

I wish you were a little slower
Not just slow but paralyzed
Then I could plug you into a socket
So you could never run away
I really wish that you were smaller
Not just small but really really short
So I could put you in my pocket
And carry you around all day",You and Me (In My Pocket) [Acoustic Version] [Version],2011
Milow,"You fill up my senses like a night in a forest,
Like the mountains in springtime,
Like a walk in the rain, like a storm in the desert,
Like a sleepy blue ocean.
You fill up my senses, come fill me again.

Come let me love you, let me give my life to you,
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
Let me lay down beside you, let me al-ways be with you.
Come, let me love you, come love me again.

Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.

Milow,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year, 
Coming home to a place he'd never been before.
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again,
You might say he found a key for every door.
When he first came to the mountains, 
His life was far away on the road and hanging by a song.
But the strings already broken and he doesn't really care,
It keeps changing fast, and it don't last for long.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
The shadows from the starlight are softer than a lullaby.
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. 
Rocky Mountain high.

He climbed cathedral mountains, 
He saw silver clouds below,
He saw everything as far as you can see.
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun,
And he lost a friend, but kept the memory.
Now he walks in quiet solitude, 
The forest and the streams, seeking grace in every step he takes.
His sight is turned inside himself, to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply.
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. 
Rocky Mountain high.

Now his life is full of wonder, 
But his heart still knows some fear,
Of a simple thing he can not comprehend.
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more,
More people, more scars upon the land.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
I know he'd be a poor man if he never saw an eagle fly,
Rocky Mountain high, the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. 
Rocky Mountain high.
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado.

We were gathered in the garden the day my daddy died
Although they had been separated apart for quite some time
I saw mother’s tears erase the years his young widowed bride

In springtime she’ll be turning sixty and be out on the town
I really hope she finds a boyfriend a man who stays around

Well yesterday I was heading west and now I’m headed south
While I’m wandering around the world she’s wandering the house
Mother do you hear the footsteps of your husband down the hall
Don’t you realize the danger of being trapped inside those walls

In springtime she’ll be turning sixty and be out on the town
I really hope she finds a boyfriend a man who stays around

And I hope one day that you will be ready
Have someone strong right by your side
Look back on your life and you surely regret it
Or find some happiness inside

Poured some wine, but she looked away

Milt Buckner,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Milt Hinton,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Milt Hinton,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Milt Hinton,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue

I have it today and give back tomorrow

Sweet, comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable

Prone to be unkind then
Wish they'd turn back time somehow

I ignored what was precious

Footloose and fancy free

Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1959
