Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"When skies are cloudy and gray
They're only gray for a day
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away
Until that sunshine peeps through
There's only one thing to do
Just wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away
Your castles may tumble
That's fate after all
Life's really funny that way
No use to grumble
Just smile as they fall
Weren't you king for a day?
Say!
Just remember that sunshine 
Always follows the rain
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away",Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams (And Dream Your Troubles Away),1990
Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"Sweet and lovely, sweeter than the roses in May. 
Sweet and lovely, heaven must have sent her my way.
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes; 
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise?

When she nestles in my arms so tenderly, 
There's a thrill that words cannot express.
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody haunting me.
Sweet and lovely, sweeter than the roses in May, 
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say.",Sweet and Lovely,1993
Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"Was in a Paris cafe that first I found him
He was a Frenchman, a hero of the war
But war was over 
And here's how peace had crowned him
A few cheap medals to wear and nothing more
Now every night in the same cafe he shows up
And as he strolls by ladies hear him say
If you admire me, hire me
A gigolo who knew a better day

Just a gigolo, everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance
Selling each romance
Every night some heart betraying
There will come a day
Youth will pass away
Then what will they say about me
When the end comes I know 
They'll say just a gigolo
As life goes on without me

Just a gigolo, everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance
Selling each romance
Every night some heart betraying
There will come a day

When the end comes I know
They'll say just a gigolo
As life goes on without me",Just a Gigolo,1994
Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard,1998
Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless,2000
Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"Beside a shady nook a moment's bliss we took
To talk of love beneath the stars above
I held your hand and whispered
Dear, I love you, I love you

And though it's just a dream
An idle scheme of mine to win your heart
And yet it seemed divine, it must be true,
I am with you and you are mine, all mine.",It Must Be True,2002
Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"We get it on most every night
When that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose they keep it tight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight 
Everybody's feeling warm and bright
It's such a supernatural delight 
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance and stay uptight

Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain

Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour.
I hung around for three or four.
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china 
Until the crowd got wise.

Incidentally
If you should run into a shower,
Just step inside my cottage door,
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store.
Love comes along like a popular song
Any time or anywhere at all.

Rain or sunshine
Spring or fall.
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place.
For example, take my case.

Gus Backus,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Still live in my heart all alone

Gus Chappell & His Orchestra,"Maybe he's not much, just another man
Doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man?

She'll just string along
All through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way

When a woman love a man
She'll be the first one to praise him
When he's goin' strong
The last one to blame him

When everything's wrong
It's such a one-sided game that they play
But women are funny that way
Tell her she's a fool

She'll say, ""yes, I know""
But I love him so
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man

Tell her she's a fool
She'll say, ""yes, I know""
But I love him so
And that's how if goes",When a Woman Loves a Man,1997

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

Gus Da Vigilante,"[Chorus x 2] 
What's the question?  
Why are you flexin'?
Here's the answer; choice of weapons

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, The Remainz, kid, why you flexin like a bicep?
Heat on your hip just to get a rep; it ain't worth it 
Just because you pack a biscuit doesn't mean you can't 
Become another statistic; you figure it 
Life's a gamble even for vandalz; I handle mine with minds 
Only unless my chest is under pressure in a contest 
The fear of layin' in wreck causes the stress 
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when it's best

[Guru] 
Yo, little big man, feelin' your oats because you're strapped? 
Bustin' a cap at another kid who's black? 
It ain't all that when the shots are flyin' back 
You made a choice, and the choice you made was whack 
Kinda tipsy, with the liquid confidence 
Pullin' your pistol when it doesn't make sense 
To be the bigger man you figure 
But in the end, it don't pay when you're livin' by the trigger

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
Yeah, it's the master of the who, what, where, and the why 
But, still, I got a problem with seein' my brothers die 
I've been around and lived past the average age of us 
In every obituary, a full page of us 
The game is money, but what about inner wealth? 
The mental, the spiritual, and physical health 
But still, everyday, the city is a test 
That's why some people feel a gun is the best

[Stikken Moov 2] 
No doubt I pack protection, but every altercation 
Or situation doesn't deserve blastin'; I mastered precisions 
Choice of weapon - should I peel or peel out? 
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts

[Chorus x 2]

[Stikken Moov 2] 
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in 
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam, Stikken Moov swarm 
Ready to bust off, like Ron Jeremy, but I chill, G 
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three

[Guru] 
That's why I wield the steel; yes, my microphone is crazy real 
I'm not the one sellin' out to get the mass appeal 
But jail cells are filled with my peeps 
While the rest are gettin' killed in these ill-ass streets 

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
So, pick your weapon - a mic or a gun 
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns; check it 
Leavin' the spot, I seen some wild kids 
One stepped to me, asked me to freestyle, kid 
Meanwhile he flexed a burner on his side 
I looked him in the eye, smiled, and walked to my ride 
He was actin' kinda hard on the surface 
I said to myself that it really wasn't worth it

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, you think you're all that, 'cause you pack heat? 
Seein' your own brother play the concrete in defeat 
Tryin' to prove yourself while you put the next man down 
But what goes around, comes back, black; best believe that

[Chorus x 2]

You know what I'm sayin'? 
That's all the real heads all over the world 
That realize that this music is real 
That we keep it real like that 
Peace to all my brothers on the third 
And all the real brothers in hip-hop 
It's like a rap's new generation thing, baby 
Peace to Guru 
It's Panche, the wild comanche, suicide",Choice of Weapons,2008

Moonlight finds me wandering once more.

In a garden fair where roses grow. 
In the tender light of the summer night, 
I can see her wander to and fro.

As she pass she flashed that come-hither look
The look
That was meant for me and for me alone

The look
Would be out of place in a children's book
The look
That could chip a piece off a heart of stone

Consider a bit this interesting little tableau
A look I could read but where would it lead me to
But mischievous elf I labeled myself diablo
And did just exactly what she was sure I'd do
Now at her beck and call
She ties me to the strings of her Spanish shawl
That isn't all
One foot out the door and she gives me the look

I say goodbye now she puts her foot down
I'm flying high now that's when I'm put down
I want to die now she puts her foot down
Freezes me with the look

Someday if she sashays by you and looks your way
I'd say you'll do well if you overlook the look

Gus Nicklos,"I want you to come home
I'm tired of being alone
And it's making me sick not knowing if you're safe and alright
The kids are growing up so fast
And knowing you're missing them
And they're missing you, has given me a pain so deep inside
Something from this world can't explore
Lately I feel like I've been becoming someone else
Someone I don't recognise, and someone I don't even like
I need you here to help me remember what it's like to truly be alive
Everyday I try my best to not get completely overwhelmed with you being gone
Please tell me how to be strong
Because everyday I am so worried I could lose you
There are so many things going on, so many things I want to share with you
I'm selfish for wanting you home, I know, but I really can't help it
I need you
We need you
I love you completely
I just want you to come home

Only a year or so they said
You won't miss out on anything
Save me from, free me from dispair
I just want you to come home
When the world is really dead

I lay at night thinking of you and the kids
Trying to put this into perspective of this day in the world
So much is happening in my life and I can't seem to put a finger on who I am
And these are the times I wonder what I was thinking
I mean what the hell was I thinking
Everyone says we're heroes, but I feel like I've abandoned you
I could feel the blood racing through my body, and know that I'm growing distant from the world

Only a year or so they said
You won't miss out on anything

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Y sobró imaginación 
Para hacer la vista a un lado 
Gasté parte de mi vida

Es que no había cómo apagar 
El fueguito entre las piernas 

Este dulce colocón 
Pega amargo en la garganta 
Es que el fragor de la lucha 
Deja el alma envenenada

Se pude oír el corazón

Son más suaves

Inevitable será el castigo
Para el que ose cambiar su parte
Mejor que vaya a vivir a Marte
Tienen los medios para engañarnos
Y, el periodismo, con sus mentiras, para ensuciarnos

No nos culpen más, cobardes
No nos culpen más
No nos culpen más, caretas
No se oculten más

Ay, el miedo mata con frío programado
Viaja el derecho, con los ojos bien cerrados
Algunos tibios sentados al volante
Arman discursos castigando a mis hermanos
Yo ya no quiero castigo ni condena
Por estar vivo ni ser un ser humano

Ay, estoy tendido debajo la avalancha
Parezco muerto, pero el límite me ensancha
Y aunque me ensucia el horror de la tibieza
Horribles días, donde el miedo más se expresa
No estoy rendido, mis ojos soy la lanza
Con la que enfrento esta condena que devora

No nos culpen más, cobardes
No se oculten más",No Nos Culpen Más,2018
Gustavo Cordera,"Y nada se dice en ámbitos atascados de malestar
Todo se expresa callándonos en la mesa
Y se repiten temores mecanizados que dejarán
Sólo palabras que suenan a niebla espesa

Y voy sin más que prisa
Buscando información
Que me dé paz
Todo el fuego soy, hecho cenizas
Estando solo me escucho yo

Hoy nos espera un viento predestinado a la redención
De un mundo viejo que duerme almas inquietas
Yo, mientras tanto, queriendo abrir los ojos del corazón
Voy abusando de mi osadía ingenua

Y voy sin más que prisa
Buscando información
Que me dé paz
Todo el fuego soy, hecho cenizas

Gustavo Cordera,"Es el encuentro de un valiente corazón
Con la estrategia mas fría
El entusiasmo de una nueva creación
Contra la amarretería
Es ser yo frente a toda la amargura
Regalando mi alegría

Es enfrentarme a todas las miradas
Pero igual hacer la mía
Es el talento de la improvisación
Contra el mio que conspira
Es el encuentro del que juega con amor
Y el que odia con mentiras
Es mostrale a todo el mundo
Que existe otra Argentina
Que ya quiere liberarse
Del que oprime y lo lastima

Soy campeón porque doy la cara
Y aunque me tiemblen las piernas
No me achica nada
Soy campeón como toda la gente
Que busca el mejor resultado
Siendo diferente

Es el encuentro de la dura realidad
Con la vida que soñaba
Ser campeón es confiar en nuestros pies
Teniendo el alma pisoteada
Es creer en uno mismo
Cuando el miedo esclaviza
Es alzarse nuevamente
Resurgir de las cenizas

Soy campeón porque doy la cara
Y aunque me corten las piernas
Sigo con el alma
Soy campeón porque soy de la gente
Que busca el mejor resultado
Siendo diferente
Soy campeón porque yo voy al frente

mejor que yo...

And if you can forgive, love can truly live 
And if you can forgive, and if you can forgive, love can truly live 

Toro, I am frightened, but I'll use my final breath, 
to tell you that I'm sorry, let us end this dance of death
Two centuries of agony, that tore your heart with sand
Here and now with my amends, this senseless giving ends

To figure out
It's in his plans
To leave alone
To find a way
To figure out
It's not your fault

And it's the both of you he's ruined
He's torn away
All the desire born inside

You could have even saved him

And I am not ashamed

Guster,"He smiled to the world 
But his heart fell below his pain 
He wanted only arms 
But he lied to himself again 
Closing doors and locking locks 
He looked inside himself 
Only to find 
Seeping from his soul 

Let me fall in two
Let me fall in two
Let me fall in two

Wide as a river and spread as thin 
What it could start and no one would finish 
Bottled up frowning treaties or what they would 
Knowing not nothing he was the only son 
Closing doors and locking locks 
He looked inside himself 
Only to find 
Seeping from his soul 

Let me fall in two 
What are you running from? 

He finds himself away 
Only have to make the world come find you 
Try to leave but there is nothing he can do 

Downcast eyes scrutinize 
As to what the lead ball hummingbird could not succumb 
To find what is gone you must burn what is dried 
And smell the essence of what remains inside 
Blackened thoughts erase all that is past 
Before him not knowing where it's coming 
So you shake him around and scream into his eyes 
That to drown in the water is to lie by his side

He looked inside himself 
Only to find 
Seeping from his soul

The river leaves run cold and dry 
But it keeps me from swinging tree to tree

You seek the truth and the quiet breeze 
But the air is too thin to reply

Because I can see the summer's done 
I try to let the river flow in and out of me 
And pray I float the way I think I want 
And pray I float at all 

Distant notions of subtle residue 
Cling to minds from our past 
Tell us what is what and who made who 
But time's events move us too fast
 
Simple sentiments whisked away by anxious steel wool 
Struggling to content ourselves with what we think best 
That what makes happy of which we seem never full 
Is actually more than plenty for it is already possessed 

Well I know that's where I'll never be 
Because I can see the summer's done

Not much of this makes sense to me 
The river leaves run cold and dry 
But it keeps me from swinging tree to tree 
And sometimes I'm too scared to even try 

Utter confusion feigns clarity 
Scattered delusions excuses destiny 
It's never exactly how it appears to be 
It's too much for any of us who even try to see 

Well I know that's where I'll never be

For exploration 
For split decision 
Or are you stronger to remain

It crept up on me 
Ignored all my pleas

And dot your I's and cross your T's

And in between his teeth
Was the shadow and a silhouette

Guster,"Corn in the fields
Listen to the rice when the wind blows 'cross the water
King Harvest has surely come

I work for the union 'cause she's so good to me
And I'm bound to come out on top
That's where she said I should be
I will hear every word the boss may say
For he's the one who hands me down my pay
Looks like this time I'm gonna get to stay
I'm a union man, now, all the way

The smell of the leaves,
From the magnolia trees in the meadow
King Harvest has surely come

Dry summer, then comes fall,
Which I depend on most of all
Hey, rainmaker, can't you hear the call?
Please let these crops grow tall

Long enough I've been up on Skid Row
And it's plain to see, I've nothing to show
I'm glad to pay those union dues,
Just don't judge me by my shoes

Scarecrow and a yellow moon,
And pretty soon a carnival on the edge of town
King Harvest has surely come

Last year, this time, wasn't no joke,
My whole barn went up in smoke
Our horse Jethro, well he went mad
And I can't remember things bein' that bad

Then there comes a man with a paper and a pen
Tellin' us our hard times are about to end
And then, if they don't give us what we like
He said, ""Men, that's when you gotta go on strike""

Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit tired of watching all the sound of your tears
Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years is going by
Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
If you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever

And we'd only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all the time

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
Living like a powder keg we're giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start

But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do

There are bones to bury
And bones to find

Restless prisoners
Damsels longing for lovers
Rhymers searching for rhymes

Diz o que é preciso pra te ter aqui comigo
Pra fazer o nosso amor reviver
Pra não te perder

E a velha chama reacender
Pra não te perder

Desculpe mas eu não entendo
A gente se perdeu no tempo
E eu fiquei tão perdido
Confesso que às vezes penso na gente
E em um recomeço
Melhor e bem diferente

Mas tem que partir de você oh oh
Amor fazer por merecer oh oh
Porque não se conserta assim

Dividido entre a esperança e a razão

Quem dera ser um peixe

Fazer borbulhas de amor pra te encantar
Passar a noite em claro
Dentro de ti, um peixe
Para enfeitar de corais tua cintura
Fazer silhuetas de amor à luz da lua
Saciar essa loucura dentro de ti

Que esta alma necessita de ilusão
Sonha coração
Não te enchas de amargura

Para unir-nos até o fim
Cara a cara, beijo a beijo
E viver para sempre dentro de ti

Fuiste mi luz, mi secreto

Oh, I know just what I say
That the Concorde it can wait
'Cause we still got time to say
 
And I know you ran away
Oh, I know my feeling, okay?
But now I found love, the feeling won't go

I see you walk away, feeling okay now
Happy now?

upon your turf

He's gonna make you step out
Of the state that you are in

Melting need to work
Only when it's all done
Will his tale be done.

And vicodin

The door opened as I fell through

Why the fuck am I trapped like this?

You fuck with me and I'll fuck with you
And I'm pissed so pissed off
Nothing you say can make me stop
Time is short like my fuse
Bet against me a you will lose
No, I won't give up
Only place I have to go is up

Morning came the feelings gone
There's nothing in my head
Push the cover to the floor
Stumble out of bed
Wishing I was somewhere far away

Ultimately, the band opted to carry on
Under the original doors name
Auditioning new singers.

Student from Athens Georgia,
Fred Schneider, who went on to front
The hugely successful B-52's tried
Out for this position

Impromptu jams was hard fought
To match the well structured
Melodies of the classic doors numbers.

Like an Irish man and a pot of gold
Or a four leaf clover for a twelve year-old

I scout for pigs, insert my yen
The good times, they can never end
I met a girl, don't ya' know
She took me for some coin-op blow
The Japanese work so damn hard

I'll sleep all day in last night's clothes
Have a beer, powder my nose

Parades around in underwear

Porcelain, topped off with pee
Traditional insanity

Parades around in underwear
I'm far from home, but don't know where

The beds are short are short
But, that's okay
We only use them to fornicate
If I knock her up
What then
I'm out of dodge with all her yen

As I mill around the lobby folks
The custom dictates you must smoke
With cancers and carcinogens
I need to find some air that's thin
My entire life I've lived this way
Like a vagabond, the punk rock way
Travel the globe and scream at kids
Fillin' water bottles up with piss

Parades around in underwear

Guus Meeuwis,"Wat gek! Dit is jullie nieuwe huis
Ik woon hier echt niet meer
Toch kom ik elke keer weer thuis
Als ik voor de deur parkeer 

In dit huis staan heel wat spullen
Die ik van vroeger nog herken
Het is een deel van de familie
Die vertelt waarom ik hier graag ben 

Is het opa’s oude tekening
Of is het papa’s grote stoel
Welnee, het is vooral
Wat ik bij jullie voel

Gelukkig heeft de klok niet stil gestaan
Is de bank opnieuw bekleed
En staan de boeken nu op zolder
Die ik één voor één versleet 

Met mijn dozen vol met speelgoed
Met mijn auto’s en mijn trein
Het blijkt dat al die kleine dingen
Groot en onverslijtbaar zijn

Is het opa’s oude tekening
Of is het papa’s grote stoel
Welnee, het is vooral
Wat ik bij jullie voel

Ik merk als ik binnenkom
En mijn moeder heb gekust
Hoe onstuimig ook de wereld is
Hierbinnen vind ik rust 

Mama vraagt of ik blijf eten
Papa hoe het leven staat
Ik weet dat jullie weten
Hoe het werkelijk met me gaat 

Is het opa’s oude tekening
Of is het papa’s grote stoel
Welnee, het is vooral
Wat ik bij jullie voel

En als ik dan naar huis ga
Naar mijn kinderen en mijn lief
Hoor ik ze nog wat zeggen
Rij voorzichtig, voorzichtig alsjeblieft",Thuis,2005
Guus Meeuwis,"Er gebeuren tegenwoordig rare dingen 
We zijn niet zuinig op de oude wereldbol
Toch blijf ik de mooie kant bezingen
De glazen zijn nog altijd halfvol 

Ik zie nog zoveel mooie kansen
En mensen en wensen, wensen heb ik ook in overvloed
En zolang er vrouwen zijn om mee te dansen
Zie ik de morgen met vertrouwen tegemoet 

En ik zal me voor mijn goeie moed niet schamen
Een lach is vaak het laatste wat ons rest
En zolang ik vrienden heb die dat beamen
Sta ik niet toe dat het geweld mijn dag verpest 

Ik zie nog zoveel mooie kansen
En mensen en wensen, wensen heb ik ook in overvloed
En zolang er vrouwen zijn om mee te dansen
Zie ik de morgen met vertrouwen tegemoet 

Ik zeg niet dat het leven nu zo simpel is
En ik mijn ogen sluit voor het venijn
Alleen dat ik te vaak de vlag en wimpel mis
Omdat het echt de moeite waard kan zijn

Guus Meeuwis,"Een muts op mijn hoofd
Mijn kraag staat omhoog
Het is hier ijskoud
Maar gelukkig wel droog

De dagen zijn kort hier
De nacht begint vroeg
De mensen zijn stug
En er is maar een kroeg

Als ik naar mijn hotel loop
Na een donkere dag
Dan voel ik mijn huissleutel
Diep in mijn zak

Ik loop hier alleen
In een te stille stad
Ik heb eigenlijk nooit last
Van heimwee gehad
Maar de mensen ze slapen
De wereld gaat dicht
En dan denk ik aan Brabant
Want daar brandt nog licht

Ik mis hier de warmte
Van een dorpscafé
De aanspraak van mensen
Met een zachte G

Ik mis zelfs het zeiken
Op alles om niets
Was men maar op Brabant
Zo trots als een Fries

In het zuiden vol zon
Woon ik samen met jou
Het is daarom dat ik zo
Van Brabanders hou

Alleen in de sneeuw
Het mooiste moment
Van deze eeuw
En ik dacht de wereld is klein
En ik wist dit had altijd van ons kunnen zijn
Hoe ben jij hier godsnaam beland
En ik keek naar jouw hand 

Ik keek naar je hand
Door de kou en het leven verdoofd
We keken en zwegen
Nooit de liefde gekregen
Die ons was beloofd 

De wind in jouw haar
Jouw stem net als toen
Je vroeg me hoe het met me ging
En ik lachte en zei
Ik doe nog altijd mijn ding

Mijn lucky shirt gespaard
En ik heb alles wat ik heb
Samen met jouw foto
In mijn achterzak bewaard 

Ik heb mijn wangen gladgeschoren
Want ik hoop dat je me kust
En zenuwen die brandden
Met water van de bloemen
En met rode wijn geblust

Guus Meeuwis,"Er is al even in ons jonge leven geen mooie muziek
Ook al klinkt er een lied
Wij twee op de schouw en een vuur voor de kou
En het vuur doet haar best, maar echt warm wordt het niet 

We wonen hier net, hier staat ons hemelbed
We slapen er samen, maar dromen apart
Het huis wat we kochten heeft kieren, het tocht er
Maar kil is het pas sinds de scheur in je hart

Niemand zei dat het eenvoudig zou zijn
Niemand heeft beloofd dat het vanzelf zou gaan
Wij zijn bijzonder
En jij bent het waard
Dus ik vecht tot de lucht is geklaard  

Een liefde begonnen, de toekomst verzonnen
De waarheid is harder, maar niet minder mooi
Dus moeten we strijden ons hart laten leiden
Soms mag je rusten, maar opgeven nooit 

Niemand zei dat het eenvoudig zou zijn
Niemand heeft beloofd dat het vanzelf zou gaan
Wij zijn bijzonder
En jij bent het waard
Dus ik vecht tot de lucht is geklaard  

Hard is jouw zwijgen
Je schreeuw om wat aandacht
Ik voel veel te goed dat ik nu iets moet doen
Jij moet me helpen, de wonden te stelpen
Ik twijfel voor twee om iets stoms als een zoen 

Niemand zei dat het eenvoudig zou zijn

Die nauwelijks verrassingen kent, we zijn het gewend

Eerst komt de zon, de wind en daar ben jij

Verblind door het geluk van alledag
En dat ik van je houden mag 

Vanavond gaan wij met zijn tweeën
Terug naar de kamer van toen, dat moeten we doen
Want het lijkt nu al zolang geleden
Dat je mij overwon met die zoen, in de kamer van toen

In elk geval de zon, de wind en wij 

Ik had te lang niet zo naar jou gekeken

Passionele nachten in het heetst van de strijd.
Die tedere momenten die iedereen ons benijdt.
We staan nu voor een tweesprong en we weten niet waarheen
Ach zouden we niet beter blind zijn voor de wereld om ons heen.
Chorus
Want ik wil jou schouders om op te huilen.
Jou huis om in te schuilen.
Maar alles wat ik wil lijkt zo ver weg.
Zo ver weg van mij.
Ja alles wat ik wil lijkt zo ver weg.
Verse 2
Zonde van de tijd maar wisten wij toen veel.
We waren net achttien en we hadden nog niet veel gezien.
We deden alles samen nooit kon het echt kapot.
Ja in al onze dromen stak de sleutel op 't slot.
Chorus
Verse 3
Nu zoveel jaren later zoveel meer gebeurd.
Ach we voelen het nog steeds, maar velen hebben 't afgekeurd.
Laat ze nu maar praten, laat ze nu maar doen.
We doen nu wat we voelen, en denken nog veel aan toen.

Op de vrouwen

Tenminste dat had ze gedacht
Maar ik heb in mijn hoofd nog wat zonlicht bewaard
Dus ik ben de laatste die lacht

Met zonder jas stap ik naar buiten

Ik moet me inhouden niet te gaan fluiten
Zo loop ik de zon tegemoet

Vandaag zie ik m'n vrienden van vroeger
Gewoon om te zien of er ergens iets zit
Van die jongens in ons die nergens om vroegen
Die niet wilde weten wat zwart was of wit

Ik heb tranen gelachen onnozel gedaan
En tenslotte tevreden, het licht uitgedaan

Ik word begroet met een klap op m'n schouder
Hoe is het met jou eerst grap eerste glas
Hier in dit licht zijn we nauwelijks ouder
Even een stilte dan lachen we pas

Eén voor één druppelt het binnen
De mannen van toen veranderen nooit
Maar toch is er nog zoveel nieuws te verzinnen
De mannen van toen veranderen nooit

Ik heb tranen gelachen onnozel gedaan

En ik kan hier op dit uur geen taxi meer krijgen
Maar dat maakt me niet uit, de Lente begint

We made vows to never depart

Every hour of the day brings me tears (I cry too)
So I guess I have to keep on hoping, wishing, praying, that you are here

To deserve even one

Help me Jesus I know what I am

Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Guy Béart,"Une branche à la fenêtre
M’a rappelé qu’à renaître
L’amour ne se lasse pas
Et qu’à traverser l’espace
Tout oiseau laisse une trace
Plus vivace que mes pas

Rien n’est jamais vain, ni l’herbe
Ni cette extase du Verbe
Qu’on avait pris pour un lit
Ni cette horloge, ni l’heure
Ni cette ombre qui m’effleure
Le temps d’un geste aboli

Jamais les fleurs du temps d’aimer
N’ont poussé dans un coeur fermé
La nuit, le jour, l’été, l’hiver
Il faut dormir le coeur ouvert

Quand tu traverses la chambre
La lumière de septembre
Fait revivre sur ta peau
L’ambre des amours anciennes
Assez pour que j’en retienne
Les mouvements les plus beaux

J’observe un vol de paroles
Qui me frôle et puis s’envole
Avant de prendre ma voix
Je les voulais les plus belles
Mais comme un peu de leurs ailes
Tremble encore autour de toi

Jamais les fleurs du temps d’aimer
N’ont poussé dans un coeur fermé
La nuit, le jour, l’été, l’hiver
Il faut dormir le coeur ouvert

Nous écoutons des sirènes
Dont la frêle chanson freine
Le navire de nos corps
Pendant que l’eau et la neige
Nous apprennent le solfège
À travers le vent du nord

Le dos tourné à la terre
Je commence un inventaire
Des planètes que j’entends
L’un de leurs clochers me sonne
Il n’est plus rien ni personne
Qui sache arrêter le temps

N’ont poussé dans un coeur fermé
La nuit, le jour, l’été, l’hiver
Il faut dormir le coeur ouvert",Une Branche à la Fenêtre,2010

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Guy Clark,"Well don't you take it too bad if you're feelin' unlovin'
If you're feelin' unfeelin' if you're feelin' alone
Don't take it too bad cause it ain't you to blame babe
Well it's some kind of game babe
Out of all of this living that we've got left to do

If you go searching for rhyme or for reason
Then you won't have the time that it takes just for talkin'
About the places you've been babe and the faces you've seen babe
How soft the time flies past your window at night

And we just can't have that girl cause it's a sad lonesome cold world
And a man needs a woman just to stand by his side
And whisper sweet words in his ears about daydreams
And roses and playthings
And the sweetness of springtime and the sound of the rain",Don't You Take It Too Bad,1978
Guy Clark,"Who walked out when the times got hard
When the truck broke down in the whole front yard
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
Who shot pool all night long
Wound up bettin' on the crack of dawn
That was you darlin', and that was me 

[Chorus]
And we are fools for each other, me and you
We are lovers, in fact, we've gone crazy out back
Like only fools for each other would do 

Now who gave up when the fire burned low
Who flew south when the wind blew cold
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
Who held on when the blues came down
Who took care when the tie was bound
That was you, darlin', and that was me 

[Chorus]

Who took off when their heart got broke
Let the whole thing go up in smoke
It wasn't me and it wasn't you, oh no
And who showed up when the time was right
Laid a little mercy on a bad ol' night
That was you, darlin', and that was me",Fools for Each Other,1978
Guy Clark,"I had a friend named Bill Campbell
He used to rob, steal and gamble
And on the side he'd beg
So he mopped up

Well, I told ol' Billy shouldn't do it
And ol' Bill said that he knew it
So he started beggin' with a bucket
Instead of a cup

He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
Now ol' Bill fluffed his dove
When he wrote a tuxedo to the country club
He's in the jailhouse now

Now Bill had a gal named Sadie
And she said have you seen Billy lately
No I don't believe that he's about

But ol' Sadie went down to the jail
It was just to pay his bail
Then she whispered
Sheriff please don't let him out

He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
It was while ol' Bill's away
Sadie's with the sheriff everyday
He's in the jailhouse now

Oh, you remember the last election, yeah
The prohibitionists was in action
Tryin' to elect themselves a president

And Bill Campbell and John Austin
They rode from New Orleans to Boston
[Incomprehensible] bottle in every settlement

They're in the jailhouse now
They're in the jailhouse now
Lord they caught them down by the railroad track
Stealin' a train to haul it back
They're in the jailhouse now

Guy Clark,"Cowboys and Indians and trees he could climb
Tomorrow came too fast but he didn't mind
Ah, the distance was short so light it again
It don't take no time to get where I am

But the one paper kid wasn't really so mean
He's just a little bit scared and a little bit green
And he'd heard of a place that was legal to dream
So he sat with his coffee and a blue Texas wind
And wrote on the rock ""the one paper kid, he's rollin' again""

The driver was drunk or he just didn't see
The future was there: it'll happen to me
And all the time that he wasted was his once again
It never takes too long to go where you've been

There's broken hearts scattered all over the past
And old bad memories tryin' to last
Whiskey and women and growing up fast
Fussin' and lovin' and itchin' like grass

Hell, the one paper kid wasn't really so mean
Just a little bit weird 'cause the times were so lean
Now he's gone to a place where it's legal to dream
No camels, no coffee, no cold morning wind

But the bad times always seem to keep the change
You been all alone so you know what I'm sayin'
So when all you can recall is the pain

Just you wait until tomorrow when you wake up with me
At your side and find I haven't lied about nothin'
I wouldn't trade a tree for the way I feel about you
In the mornin', anyhow I love you

Everyday it gets just a little bit better
And half the gettin' there is knowin' where I been before
I'm sure you understand 'cause I ain't your first man
So when you feel like runnin' for the back door, don't

Guy Clark,"He's a black haired boy of some confusion
And he makes no excuse for the things that he's usin'
He's gentle and wild and a child of the mountain
His words are for singing and his days are for countin'

[Chorus]
And he's looking for a home he's scared to find
Some lady beside him and he's drunk on white wine
Some lady beside him and he's drunk on white wine

He's a devil in the morning and a savior at night
Tomorrow's a case of whatever's right
Lonesome and high are the things that he feels
And the cards that he plays are the ones that he deals

[Chorus]

He's one of the chances you're entitled to take
He's one of the hearts that it's too late to break
I've seen him be sad and never know why
Seen him fall down to laugh, seen him stand up to cry

Guy Clark,"Now broken hearted people always seem to drink
And tryin' to drown those sorrows ain't as easy as you think
But living with a liar is a hard old way to go

[Chorus]
So take me to a barroom driver
Set me on a stool
If I can't be her man
I'm damned if I'll be her fool

They say that whiskey ain't the best way, but then I ain't too smart
To think I just found out she was lyin' from the start
So if this is nothing but a bad joke lookin' for a laugh
Hold on to your lampshade darlin' cause I'm looking for a hat

[Chorus]

So get this taxi movin' cause I got no time to lose
There's no time to be choosy, any old bar will do
Cause I'm lookin' to get silly and I'm lookin' to get loose
And if that don't get it done darlin', I'll come looking for you",Broken Hearted People,1982
Guy Clark,"I'd play the Red River Valley
And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?""

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin' ""

Guy Clark,"The old gunfighter on the porch
Stared into the sun
And relived the days of living by the gun
When deadly games of pride were played
And living was mistakes not made

And the thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Ah, the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

It's always keep your back to the sun
And he can almost feel the weight of the gun
It's faster than snakes or the blink of an eye
And it's a time for all slow men to die
And his eyes get squinty and his fingers twitch
And he empties the gun at the son of a bitch

And he's hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

Now the burn of a bullet is only a scar
He's back in his chair in front of the bar
And the streets are empty and the blood's all dried
And the dead are dust and the whiskey's inside
So buy him a drink and lend him an ear
He's nobody's fool and the only one here

Who remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Remember the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

He said I stood in that street before it was paved
Learned shoot or be shot before I could shave
And I did it all for the money and fame
Noble was nothing but feeling no shame
And nothing was sacred but stayin' alive
And all that I learned from a Colt 45

Was to curse the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Curse the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

Now he's just an old man that no one believes
Says he's a gunfighter, the last of the breed
And there are ghosts in the street seeking revenge
Calling him out to the lunatic fringe
Now he's out in the traffic checking the sun
And he's killed by a car as he goes for his gun

So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke",The Last Gunfighter Ballad,1982
Guy Clark,"He's a wino, tried and true. 
Done about everything there is to do. 
He worked on freighters, he worked in bars. 
He worked on farms, 'n he worked on cars. 

It was white port, that put that look in his eye 
That grown men get when they need to cry 
And he sat down on the curb to rest 
And his head just fell down on his chest 

He said ""Every single day it gets 
A little bit harder to handle and yet"" 
And he lost the thread and his mind got cluttered 
And the words just rolled off down in the gutter 

Well he was elevator man in a cheap hotel 
In exchange for the rent on a one room cell 
He's old in years beyond his time 
Thanks to the world, and the white Port wine 

So he says ""Son,"" he always called me son 
He said, ""Life for you has just begun"" 
And he told me a story that I heard before 
How he fell in love with a Dallas whore 

Well he could cut through the years to the very night 
When it ended, in a whore house fight 
And she turned his last proposal down 
In favor of being a girl about town 

Now it's been seventeen years right in line 
And he ain't been straight none of the time 
Too many days of fightin' the weather 
And too many nights of not being together 

So he died

Well when they went through his personal affects 
In among the stubs from the welfare checks 
Was a crumblin' picture of a girl in a door 
An address in Dallas, and nothin' more 

The welfare people provided the priest 
A couple from the mission down the street 
Sang Amazing Grace, and no one cried 
'Cept some woman in black, way off to the side 

We all left and she was standing there 
Black veil covering her silver hair 
And 'ol One-Eyed John said her name was Alice 
And she used to be a whore in Dallas

I swear to you friends that that life is some risky
I have backed away quickly from those who tried to burn me

And stopped up my ears that no one should learn me
But the lady beside me is the one I have chosen
To walk through my life like a coat from the cold

I have flown like a bird from each cage that confined me
And broken every one of the ties that bind me
And I have danced me around some sad ol' situations

And taken my share of them sweet temptations
But the lady beside me is the one I have chosen
To walk through my life like a coat from the cold

Well it's fountains full of dogs and kids.
And it's freaky apple pie.
And it's the ones who came to play.

And it's somethin' you can buy.

Who swears he's 83.

But it's country music in the park,
As far as they can see.

So always try to keep you heart connected to your wrist

Guy Clark,"Some days I think this old machine is out to get me
Some days she does what I tell her
It's like dancing with a widow-maker forty hours a week
You know I'm talkin' 'bout a big ol' D-10 caterpillar

I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
You know it ain't nothin' but a
Hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
Could be the money, babe, could be the power
Could be I love the way it feels, could be I love the way it feels

But you know she's mighty unforgivin', so you got to pay attention
You know a D-10 can be the death of you
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul
You know it's hard to tell who's drivin' who

And I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru
I can push the rocky mountains into the sea
You know heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me

But you know I'm like a modern day mule skinner
I'm drivin' ten thousand mules so I got to say a little prayer every day
Lord, just let me get her turned around
Without fallin' down this mountain
'Cause you know the boss don't like me treatin' his D-10 that way

I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
You know it ain't nothin' but a

Guy Clark,"Oh Ellis Island was swarming 
Like a scene from a costume hall 
Decked out in the colors in Europe 
And on fire with the hope of it all 

There stood my father's own father stood huddled 
With the tired and hungry and scared 
Turn of the century pilgrims 
Bound by the dream that they shared 

They were standing in lines just like cattle 
Poked and prodded and shoved 
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom 
Some were were torn from someone they love 

Through this sprawling tower of babel 
Came a young man confused and alone 
Determined and bound for America 
And carryin' everything that he owned 

[Chorus] 
Sometimes when I look in my grandfather's Immigrant Eyes 
I see that day reflected and I can't hold my feelings inside 
I see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life 
So don't take it for granted say grandfather's Immigrant Eyes 

Now he rocks and stares out the window 
But his eyes are still just as clear 
As the day he sailed through the harbor 
And come ashore on the island of tears 

My grandfather's days are numbered 
But I won' t let his memory die 
'Cause he gave me the gift of this country 
And the look in his Immigrant Eyes",Immigrant Eyes,1989
Guy Clark,"It's like when you're making conversation 
And you're trying not to scream 
And you're trying not to tell 'em 
You don't care what they mean 
And you're really feeling fragile 
And you really can't get home 
And you really feel abandoned 
But you want to be alone 

[Chorus] 
Old Friends they shine like diamonds 
Old Friends you can always call 
Old Friends Lord you can't buy 'em 
You know it's Old Friends after all 

And when the house is empty 
And the lights begin to fade 
And there's nothing to protect you 
Except the window shade 
And it's hard to put your finger 
On the thing that scares you most 
And you can't tell the difference 
Between an angel and a ghost

[Chorus]",Old Friends,1989
Guy Clark,"The sun was hot and the dust rose up like smoke 
So we hid beneath the elm tree and watched the watermelons float 
There in a big 'ol tub of ice 
And we'd split em open with a kitchen knife 
And everybody had a slice it was a watermelon dream 

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' sweeter than a watermelon dream 
'Cept sittin on the front porch eatin' that peach ice cream 
When life is really sweeter than it seems 
That's what you've got to call a watermelon dream 

With sticky hands and and faces we fought the yellow-jackets to a draw 
Then we used the rind for second base and played a little hard ball 
I don't know how much we ate 
But we all got the belly-ache 
And everybody stayed up wat too late 
It was a watermelon dream 

[Chorus]

Then a little after sundown we'd be runnin out of steam 
So we'd light a roman candle and try to hold on tho the dream 
Maybe slip out behind a car 
Take a little tastes from a jar 
Then just lay back and count the stars 
That's called a watermelon dream",Watermelon Dream,1989

With these two hands
It'll be a fair curve
From a noble plan

That I can't work my way around

Sometime for the glamour
Sometime I use my head
Sometime I get a bigger hammer

I worked on the railroad
I worked in the fields

Straight from Roger Miller
Life's just like takin' candy
From a gorilla
I started thinkin' man
This ain't so tough
That's about the time
That the monkey showed up
Sometimes I can't find
My heart with both hands
I usually got my head stuck
Down in the sand
I start to feel like
I can't even breathe
What's the little breath of fresh air
Blowin' up my sleeve

Must be my baby hey hey hey
She can make the Mississippi River
Run the other way
Must be my baby just in time
How's she always know when
I'm about to lose my mind

Sometimes it feels like
Everything's a drag
I could not smile my way
Out of a wet paper bag
It gets so dark
That the clock stops tickin'

Guy Clark,"Picasso said in 1910

You can play it straight or play it from left field
You got to play it just the way you feel
Come on boys and play it again

It's hard to stay between the lines

Ain't no chance if you don't take it
He said the damndest thing he ever heard
Was tryin' to learn to sing from a mockingbird

Picasso said before he died
There's one more paintin' I'd like to try

He was not scared of baggy pants

I got these lines in my face 
Tryin' to straighten out the wrinkles in my life

And I always knew she'd up and fly away""

I set my soul on fire just for show 
All it ever taught me was 
The more I learn the less I seem to know""

And the way that he lived by the tools of his trade
I can still hear his hammer singing ten penny time
Working by the hour till the day he died

Oh he was tough as a crowbar quick as a chisel
Fair as a plane and true as a level
He was straight as a chalkline and right as a rule
He was square with the world he took good care of his tools

Oh he worked his hands in wood from the crib to the coffin
With a care and a love you don't see too often
He built boats out of wood big boats working in a shipyard
Mansions on the hill and a birdhouse in the backyard
He was tough as a crowbar

He said anything that's worth cuttin' down a tree for
Is worth doin' right don't the Lord love a two by four

'cause I made it for about two weeks

She'd just barely turned fifteen
And I was a little bit nervous
If you know just what I mean.
But I've heard somewhere
That true love conquers all

Wearing nothing but my cowboy hat.

He was full of spit and vinegar 
He was bustin' at the seams
He licked his finger and he checked the wind
It was gonna be do or die 
He wasn't scared of nothin' boys
And he was pretty sure he could fly

He's one of those who knows that life
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
Always trust your cape

Old and grey with a floursack cape
Tied all around his head
He's still jumpin' off the garage
Will be till he's dead
All these years the people said
He's actin' like a kid
He did not know he could not fly
So he did

He's one of those who knows that life
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
Always trust your cape",The Cape,1995

Guy Clark,"My father had a Randall knife
My mother gave it to him
When he went off to WWII
To save us all from ruin
If you've ever held a Randall knife
Then you know my father well
If a better blade was ever made
It was probably forged in hell

My father was a good man
A lawyer by his trade
And only once did I ever see
Him misuse the blade
It almost cut his thumb off
When he took it for a tool
The knife was made for darker things
And you could not bend the rules

He let me take it camping once
On a Boy Scout jamboree
And I broke a half an inch off
Trying to stick it in a tree
I hid it from him for a while
But the knife and he were one
He put it in his bottom drawer
Without a hard word one

There it slept and there it stayed
For twenty some odd years
Sort of like Excalibur
Except waiting for a tear

My father died when I was forty
And I couldn't find a way to cry
Not because I didn't love him
Not because he didn't try
I'd cried for every lesser thing
Whiskey, pain and beauty
But he deserved a better tear
And I was not quite ready

So we took his ashed out to sea
And poured `em off the stern
And threw the roses in the wake
Of everything we'd learned
When we got back to the house
They asked me what I wanted
Not the lawbooks not the watch
I need the things he's haunted

My hand burned for the Randall knife
There in the bottom drawer
And I found a tear for my father's life
And all that it stood for",The Randall Knife,1995

It's kinda like workin' without a net

It's how do you feel, not what do you think

Till it drives me nits 
You can rattle on about 
Why, who, what

Wouldn't hurt that much 
A little somethin' 
With a human touch 

Now, if you're hurtin', Baby, tell me so 
If you need attention let me know

She's takin' it back that she's lost
It's just as clear as the window pane

All winter without 'em's a culinary bummer

Wha'd life be without homegrown tomatoes
Only two things money can't buy
That's true love and homegrown tomatoes

I've been out to eat and that's for sure
But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with eggs eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans pinto or navy
Put 'em on the side put 'em in the middle
Put a home grown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life that I lead
I'd be Johnny tomato seed
Cause I know what this country needs

When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better
I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes

Drinkin' em down for they sail with the dawn
They're bound for the Mexican Bay of Campche
And the deck hands are singin' adios Jole Blon

There's snowbirds in search of that sunshine and night life
And fond of greasin' palms down the beach as they're goin'
This livin' on the edge of the waters of the world
Demands the dignity of whooping cranes and
The likes of Gilbert Roland

In the cars of my youth how I tore through those sand dunes
Cut up my tires on them oyster shell roads
But nothin' is forever say the old men in the shipyards
Turnin' trees into shrimp oats Hell I guess they ought to know

Guy Clark,"Now bein' six years old, I had seen some trains before
So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for

Bigger than anything they is, at least that's the way she feels 

Trains are big and black and smokin', louder'n July four, 
But everybody's actin' like this might be somethin' more...

Than just pickin' up the mail, or the soldiers from the war
This is somethin' that even old man Wileman never seen before

And it's late afternoon on a hot Texas day
Somethin' strange is goin' on, and we's all in the way

Well there's fifty or sixty people they're just sittin' on their cars
And the old men left their dominos and they come down from the bars

Everybody's checkin', old Jack Kittrel check his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear 'em pop 

So we already knowed it, when they finally said 'train time'

Look out there she goes, she's gone,

Put me in his pocket, and here I go again

Guy Clark,"The only difference between men and boys 
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys 
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise 
Ain't it funny how men will be boys 

Kickin' tires round the pick-up truck 
Drinkin' beer and just cuttin' up 
Smokin' and jokin' out behind the shed 
Cussin' a blue streak till the girls turn red 

[Chorus: x2]
Sneakin' out of the house tryin' to have a little fun 
Lookin' for somthin' that he ain't done 
Look what the cat dragged in at the break of dawn 
He ain't passed out he's campin' on the lawn 

You can spend a lifetime growin' up 
You can spend a lifetime in a rut 
When it comes a time you got to make a choice 
Most men would just as soon be boys

You have filled up my pockets with quicksand and gold 
Susanna oh Susanna when it comes my time 
Bury me south of that Red River line 

My great grandfather came to that Red River line 
And camped on the north side until it was time 
To cross or to stay to be sooner or not 
He headed south to San Antone they said he liked it hot

Here's to Coronado, the Comanche, and the blues

Down at the river's edge

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul

Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon",Dark as a Dungeon,1999

At your side and find I haven't lied about nothin'
I wouldn't trade a tree for the way I feel about you
In the mornin', anyhow I love you

Everyday it gets just a little bit better
And half the gettin' there is knowin' where I been before

She found a thumb and stuck it in the breeze.
She'll take anything that's goin' close to somewhere.
She can lay it down and live it like she'd please

Chorus
She ain't goin' nowhere, she's just leavin'.
She ain't goin' nowhere she can't breathe in.
And she ain't goin' home, and that's for sure.

She's not sitting and cryin' on her suitcase.
She has no second thoughts by the road.
But she's feelins than need some reparin'.
And she did not give a damn that it showed.

Chorus

And the wind had it's way with her hair.
And the blues had a way with her smile.
And she had a way of her own.
Like prisoners have a way with a file.

Daughter of a miner
Her ways were free
It seemed to me
That sunshine walked beside her

She came from Spencer
Across the hill
She said her pa had sent her
'cause the coal was low
And soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter

She said she'd come
To look for work
She was not seeking favors
And for a dime a day
And a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor

But the times were hard, Lord,
The jobs were few
All through Tecumseh valley
But she asked around
And a job she found
Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's

She saved enough to get back home
When spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied
Her pa had died
The word come down from Spencer

So she turned to whorin' out on the streets
With all the lust inside her
And it was many a man
Returned again
To lay himself beside her

They found her down beneath the stairs
That led to Gypsy Sally's
In her hand when she died
Was a note that cried
Fare thee well

Guy Clark,"Everyone in Nacadoches knew Tom Ame's would come to some bad end 
Well the sheriff had caught him stealin' chickens and such 
By the time that he was ten 

And one day his daddy took a ten dollar bill 
And he tucked it in his hand 
He said I can tell you're headed for trouble son 
And your momma wouldn't understand 

So he took that money and his brothers old bay 
And he left without a word of thanks 
Fell in with a crowd in some border town 
And took to robbing banks 

Well outside the law your luck will run out fast 
And a few years came and went 
'Till he's trapped in an alley in Abilene 
With all but four shells spent 

And he realized praying was the only thing 
That he hadn't ever tried 
Well he wasn't sure he knew quite how 
But he looked up to the sky 

Said you don't owe me nothing and as far as I know 
Lord don't owe nothing to you 
And I ain't asking for a miracle Lord 
Just a little bit of luck will do 

And you know I ain't never prayed before 
But it always seemed to me 
If praying is the same as begging Lord 
I don't take no charity 

Yeah but right now Lord with my back to the wall 
Can't help but recall 
How they nearly hung me for stealing a horse 
In Fort Smith Arkansas 

Judge Parker said guilty and the gavel came down 
Just like a cannon shot 
And I went away quietly 
And I began to file and plot 

Well they sent the preacher down to my cell 
He said the Lord is your only hope 
He's the only friend that you gonna have 
When you hit the end of Parker's rope 

Well I guess he could of kept on preaching till Christmas 
But he turned his back on me 
I put a home made blade to that golden throat 
And asked the deputy for the key 

Well it ain't the first close call I ever had 
As I'm sure you already know 
I had some help from you Lord and the devil himself 
It's been strictly touch and go 
Yeah but who in the hell am I talking to 
There ain't no one here but me 
And then he cocked both his pistols and he spit in the dirt 
And he walked out in the street",Tom Ames' Prayer,2001

I know that I swore that I wouldn't forget 
I wrote it all down, I lost it I guess 
There's so much I want to say 
But all the words just slip away

This Arizona star, she just fell out of the sky
She was shining like a diamond, she had tombstones in her eyes
She liked drinking she liked smoking, she liked dancing in the aisles

She was a primadonna, pre-madonna, hard time southern bell
Man she should have been an actress oh she played the part so well
She might have been a singer, but you really couldn't really tell
She was the Arizona star and she was born to give 'em hell

So she always kept her shades on to keep from going blind
She was cool, She was out there so far
She was nothing less and nothing more than the Arizona Star

She had a girlfriend named George, George carried a sword
And wore purple tights an they hung out every night
Oh I'm talking bout a circus man, I'm talking bout three rings
And there was four or five clowns in a washing machine
Oh she never met a stranger least as far as I can tell
She was the Arizona Star and Jim McGuire he knew her well

She had a curve ball that wouldn't quit and a girlfriend for a joke

Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to die

So tell my baby I said so long
Tell my mother I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own
And tell my friends to mourn me none

There ain't no dark till something shines

Your dancin' days are done, son, it's a wonder you ain't dead
Then he went to work with a carvin' knife sweat fell from his brow
'Bout killed me tryin' to save my life when he cut that lead ball out

Give me some of that Soldier's Joy, ain't you got no more
Hand me down my walkin' cane I ain't cut out for war

Red blood run right through my veins run all over the floor
Run right down his apron strings like a river out the door
He handed me a bottle and said, son drink deep as you can
He turned away then he turned right back with a hacksaw in his hand

Gimme some of that Soldier's Joy you know what I like
Bear down on that fiddle boys just like Saturday night

Gimme some of that Soldier's Joy you know what I crave
I'll be hittin' that Soldier's Joy til I'm in my grave","Soldier's Joy, 1864",2002
Guy Clark,"A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

Guy Clark,"Elijah came to Texas 
To build his family a home 
With his wife and new baby 
And what little goods that they owned 
Had a good yoke of oxen 
And hand tools for clearing the land 
And he built him a church 
'Cause he was a God fearin' man 
All of his children when there 
Worshiped here through the years 
On down to my granddad 
He's buried 'bout 40 yards from here 
It's where I was baptized 
And where I took me a wife 
And if I have my say so 
That's where I'll rest when it's time 

[Chorus:]
When I'm dead and I'm gone 
Won't you carry me home 
To that little white church 
In my daddy's home town 

'Cause Lord knows I'm some kind of sinner 
But I've done come this far 
And it's too late for changin' 
When this race has been run 
Take me back where I came from 
And let me return what I took from the ground 
When this body won't carry me no further 
Take me back 
And lay me down 
This east Texas red dirt 
Won't grow much of nothin' they say 
'Cept tomatoes and peaches 
They mostly drill for oil nowadays 
And a hired hand named Regan 
First made me understand 
And he told me the red was the blood of my kin in the land

[Chorus:]",Elijah's Church,2006
Guy Clark,"Me and ol' Bill there we both come from Georgia 
Met Hank out in New Mexico 
We're bound for Duranqo to join Pancho Villa 
We hear that he's payin' in gold 

I guess a man's got to do what he's best at 
Ain't found nothin' better so far 
Been called mercenaries and men with no country 
Just soldiers in search of a war 

And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way 

When this war is over might go back to Georgia 
And settle down quiet some where 
I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile 
Heard tell of some trouble down there

And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way 

And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way 

And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way",Mercenary Song,2006
