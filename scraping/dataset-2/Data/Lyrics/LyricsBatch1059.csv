Submersed,"Hey, what's your name?
I've been crawling on my fingers for so long
Shame, is your blame
You think of a better day…

It shouldn't be so complicated
Cause I've been looking for this for so, so long
And I can't believe that many things are overrated
So I will follow you down

Then it happens again…
Blame, that's your game
You've been pointing fingers at me for too long
Fame, is all you gain

Submersed,"You're looking so beautiful
Standing in the light
I've waited for this night
For my whole life
I reach to grab your hand
I take it into mine
Our hearts become numb
Our hearts have become one
And I'll wait for you
If our worlds falling down
Cumbling to the ground
And I'll wait for you
If our worlds falling down
Crumbling to the ground

With this honor
On weak knees I stand
Strengthened by your hands

As the music starts to play
That look upon your face
I see what's in your eyes,
You see what's inside mine
We see our life together
We feel it as we dance
There's rhythm in our love
Its rhythm from above
And Ill wait for you
If our worlds falling down
Crumbling to the ground
And Ill wait for you
If our worlds falling down
Crumbling to the ground

With this dance our life begins
With these steps love has no end
With this dance our life begins
And Ill wait, and Ill wait

Do not disturb on the door
I lived in this madness,
And wondered what it's all for

Have let them go

I have come to know

This isn't what I wanted
What I need now is you
Falling,
Drowning,
As my weight is breaking through
Help me I'm falling

The price of fame has become
Is it all worth it
To try and be number one

It's hard to remember who I was,
When this began (When this all began)
It's hard to take the lessons that I've learned,
And make amends

A house of cards that I once made will fall today (Fall today)
My times out of greed, of love and pain (Love and pain)
It Will fall to me in the frozen rain

Weepin' on a stone,
Findin' it hard to breathe
As she stared,
Into the night
(Stared into the night)
Her heart to numb to feel the cold
Finding it hard to breathe
Face to face,
With the moonlight

Stone cold To her eyes to her lips
Feeling numb of anger and space
Just one leap,
And her life she'll forget
It's too bad that she feels it's the only way

Before I,
Say goodbye,
Throw it all away
I'll remember yesterday
To go,
Over my head
I still hold on to you

He sat all night,
Trying not to cry
His future heart seen
Should he stay,
With his family
(Stay with his family)
Their hearts to strong to let him go,
Makin' it to hard to leave
A better world
To chase a dream

Stone cold from his eyes to his lips
Feeling numb of anger and space
One wrong move and his life's thrown away
It's too bad that he feels it's the only way

Before I
Say goodbye
Throw it all away
I'll remember yesterday
To go,
Over my head
I still hold on to you

Sometimes it's hard to realize
What's the right thing to do
But I know you'll find a hand
To light your way through this dark place

Before I,
Say goodbye
Throw it all away
I'll remember yesterday
To go,
Over my head

Buone maniere che sono sempre le stesse 
Da sempre sa che c'è qualcosa che non va 

La notte che sorride ha denti fragili 
Per tutti i calci che l'aspettano 
Generalmente lei non dà la confidenza 
A tutti quelli che si atteggiano troppo 
Si nutre di cose che fanno male 
E ama quando è l'ora di odiare, 
Si nutre di cose che fanno male 
E odia quando è l'ora di gridare 

Solo una cosa so di sicuro vorrei raschiare la mia faccia contro il muro 
Solo una cosa so di sicuro lasciare andare tutto il mio dolore contro questo muro 
So di sicuro lasciare andare la mia faccia contro il muro 
Solo una cosa so di sicuro vorrei raschiare tutto il mio dolore contro-questo-muro 
Bocche dal sapore d'eventualità appiccicano sguardi, l'aria è satura 
Quasi vorrebbe la scoprissero gettarsi in pasto giusto il tempo di ricominciare 

A casa questa notte non ritornerà 
In viaggio fuori-serie verso nessun posto
Narici rispettabili festeggiano 
Così si sa che c'è qualcosa che non va

La notte scivola sugli occhi gravidi, 
Gonfi di amaro che rovesciano 
Generalmente lei riserva indifferenza 
A tutti quelli che si stringono troppo
Si nutre di cose che fanno male 
E ama quando è l'ora di odiare, 
Si nutre di cose che fanno male 
E odia quando è l'ora di gridare

Oltre a un respiro d'amaro per noi, ci resta solo il disegno del tempo.
So che avremmo ancora bisogno di crederci,
E anche se a volte parlarne fa male
So che resta un livido amniotico gelido,
Sto percorrendo a ritroso la strada

per noi, ma qui tu scivoli a fondo e non hai
Rifugio per sciogliere il peso che see'Ã¨
In me Ã¨ tardi in me

Sono soltanto parole per me, che la distanza ora complica
Io vorrei tanto capirne di piÃ¹, vorrei che non pensassi al male
Che perso nel sonno piÃ¹ chiuso che see'Ã¨,lascia soltanto un impronta nell'aria
Oltre a un respiro d'amaro per noi, ci resta solo il disegno del tempo.

se non posso nemmeno provare piÃ¹ a reggerti
Nel vuoto che raschia il tuo sguardo specchiandomi
Lasciare che il tempo ora passi sopra di noi
Rendermi immobile al flusso dei giorni

tra noi,ma qui tu scivoli a fondo e non hai
Rifugio per sciogliere il peso che see'Ã¨
In me Ã¨ tardi in me

Sono soltanto parole per me, che la distanza ora complica
Io vorrei tanto capirne di piÃ¹, vorrei che non pensassi al male
Che perso nel sonno piÃ¹ chiuso che see'Ã¨,lascia soltanto un impronta nell'aria

Sei per me livido amniotico,
Sei per me livido amniotico,

M' incazzo, ronzando, come un amplificatore in paranoia
E con un pungiglione, intriso di veleni,
Cercando un pretesto, cercando una scusa,
Affondo I miei colpi e soffoco la rabbia che grida.

Dentro frenetici momenti di noia...

Ci sono giorni in cui io non interagisco
E appeso al silenzio, come un ragno al soffitto,
Sorveglio il mio spazio aereo, minacciando tutto ciÃ² che gira.

Dentro frenetici momenti di noia...

Morbida vertigine sui vuoti della vita
Nebbia calda e densa appesantisce il mio respiro
Prime luci del mattino resto ancora in giro

Nuvole in bottiglia vuote come I miei pensieri
Cerco un po' di vita per dimenticare ieri
Piove e per la strada c'è una luce surreale
Né giorno né la notte dolce limbo boreale

Catalitica la notte incontra la mia sete
Stormi di dolci gabbiani dalle discoteche

Senza il tempo di fermarsi ma
Distorsione di colori in fondo agli occhi

Sovraccarico di umore,
Gioia, elettrico furore.

Voglio giocare con la pelle sugli spigoli,
Voglio rischiare ad aggrapparmi sugli spigoli,
Cadendo a vuoto sempre solo sugli spigoli.
E sugli spigoli,
Che noi giochiamo con la pelle sugli spigoli,
Che ci aggrappiamo sempre solo sugli spigoli,

I was sick to the sea that was beckoning me to it's end
In the light of the dawn, feeling ragged and worn
I pointed my thumb to the sky
Over and over and over that road again

A license to pill and spare no expense

You see a sealed off wrist on repeat

Completely destroying the snow globe
And a day begins before and during next
Between space heaters and constellations

Through their smooth calm sheets of plaster skin

Spreading in the heat left after beards.

And the fine line differences in skin consistancy.

Subtle,"The next day the exact same nurse
Is standing with her back to me
At every last passing bus stop
Only this time, what looks like a small stack of bills
With bat wings, is hovering just beside her

They're bound together by a narrow wishbone
Beneath it rests a large bowl full
Of some indistinct fruit
Waxen looking still, atop a three quarter
Length Corinthian column

To the left is a rather fit 'Right' woman's left leg
Buried thigh deep in the hallowed and wood-chip
Topped bus stop grounds

The planted lady's leg looking clean shaven and hot
Sweat beading up about its calf in the black
Avenue amplified sun
An eye blue high heel jut in full bloom on its visible end

And so you get off to find two suits arguing silent
Before a double-parked and obviously unmarked cop car
The blown-up head flesh of two big business men
A-hover above them
A good foot or two of twine dangling from their tied off throats
Running down into their hollowed dress shirt collar mouths

You overhear them mutter something serious about
'The second hand emotion'
And then comes something like semi-poetic directions
""A ways down commerce then turn, dead straight into ashes""

And so you walk
Predicting all possible presents in ever to bits, and back
From the bed to the bills you see nothing
But pit within pit within pit, an undeniable feeding on you
And more this

A honey smothered hand
Gun all covered in ants
Trembles on a three quarter
Length Corinthian column

To reveal row upon row of bulging black bird eye.
All gorged out toward you like exotic zoo snakes
Heaped up on fiberglass rocks,
Fat with farmed rats coaxed down their throat...

Below them in their brights,
Tilt finished arrows beached up on thin tin signs.
And where its corrugated stem injects into cement
There is a deep fried breastbone,
Popping hard half ate on a rich red curb...

All at once,
This moment has no mercy on your color find eye's
Stole blues version of oakland...
As you make for thin ice on your you on you violent night.

The next morning everything begins again over a walk,
Past a few balloons tied to a lovesick car-salesman's wrist.
You press on...

Behind a savage looking pair of women's dress shoes,
Abandoned to the left of a tire tread pressed dead pigeon
Lain askew in more rich rose colored gutter.

There...there...

Tinged city wind catching air
On your pleasantly imperfect and see-section shaped skull.

To drop more finished bills down to its gut...
Even though for all you know...
That's about as far as those things ever go.

As sad as it is so,
Kids today will never wear the perfect cape of clean air.
Nor one true brand new brazier of sheer luck...

Or does someone out there still expect that...
The way a moth gives freely of itself unto the bulb.

They will not learn their lesson from a teachers copy
Of a blackened lung, hung in the classroom, on the coat rack...
Or left dripping in the closet during math minutes passing.
Nor from a nice new globe made of gold, cast in the shape of a half eaten apple...

Not until...
The sun is on a stick.
The moon hung on a hook.

Desperate times call for step by step schematics of the human dive.

With no fish bowl on and a busted communicator...
Or have you everything planned.
Is there a simple universal system of buoy and rope,
That you would use to tug your weightless mass along on,
Till you found a planet that you felt might be just right for you.

Or is it possible the view of earth at such a distance
Would have played you for the fool as well...

And they'd come with the rain on of course.

Hope stole on in the equal parts miracle of
Bringing yourself to and from sleep.

On the floor at the foot of the bright light blocking and locked
Hundredth door of luck.

At the opposite end of the hall sits a pair of empty pay public binoculars,
Slumped, facing your way.

In the dead of their stare, you marvel about,
Until you eye this one door that appears to be both half open and closed.
And are drawn moth to the bulb,
Head down, as if reeled round a gear by the guts,
Inching toward your intuit-picked portal of choice...
Now knelt, yet not without nerves in this moment of mostly glory,
You look for the knob, and see nothing but healed shut keyhole.

Dax-strong in this dream you begin to cut key
In the furthest corner of a clearest skull,
When you feel your kneecaps being nursed by a white on white welcome mat.
You tilt your skull to read ""WOE-BE-GONE"" only written wrong or in mirror. Your hands and heart full of edge, you lift the mat gently,
And there beneath it's omen embroidered, sits an intact wishingbone...
You carefully lift your instrument of certain luck to the door,
And it slowly unclenches the scar seem set where it's keyhole would be....
And so you snap bliss bone, cut wish and begin to lock pick...

Until you hear trough the thick of the door the deadbolt caughing loose...

Suddenly the fear black above your skull, beneath your skin goes wild.
As the door of your choice opens itself slowly...
Sealing off your face with perfect stripes of rising bone and angst,
Of alabaster and pit,
Allowing the bright right light of luck
To completely believe
And eclipse you...",The Ends,2006

Of their only overcoat and gum's

And outside in all the lines going
And gone around the world

Its continual crunch of entire months
Toward zero's and ones
In the hoped pursuit of
What the time clock can't afford them

As it leans in slow with all their life
And eats those coming weeks to death

At 50 and are not psychic
Hung in the ever evening of their years
Buckling down in the absolute wind

Spun between two rather serious magnets

Good doctor bill

And it all boils back down
To timing and keeping up teeth

Of your next new rap name

I sit here all alone
Writing words to show
The thoughts and feelings I have towards you
Have we come this far just to figure out there's nothing new
Between us

I used to fall apart
And wait for that fire to spark
But now it's over
I know I lost
It's just so easy to break

I wanted everything but this
When all I want is happiness
Alone in life, Alone in love (I wanted more)
You show the side of you that's not
The side of you, you show a lot
All I want is something else
But you're not letting go


I sit back and watch the sunset
Nothing else could ever calm me down
I write words of so sweet breath
Composed to make your world go 'round
I like things that make me smile
Your personality can't give me that
And when you frown I think of why we'll
Never be the same

It's not cool to play ska music
It's not cool
It's not cool to play ska music
It's not cool

I pulled the microphone from her lips and said, She told me I don't date guys in a band
""I don't ever wanna be like this"" And besides

Ska doesn't pay
It's not cool
To play ska music
But I do it anyway

Prepare for domination
I think you'll like me
I've got quite the reputation
Here comes that feeling again
Out pop my guts now I'm a mess
Been up all night
Wondering why
Things aren't getting any better
You look so good
It can't be right
Tonight lets make our dreams come true
It's our little secret
For your information
I just can't beat it
I've got a strong imagination
I see you embracing me without a care
We're weightless floating on the midnight air
This moment is an unforgettable love affair
Nothing matters when I touch your soft brown hair
Hold on dear, we're falling now
I forget which way is down
Confusion clouding around
Never wanted anything more than you now
One step beyond its over
Now I regret it
Was it something inside my head?
I know I'll take it
One step again its not so bad
I can't fake it
Desires driving me mad
I can't contain it contain it

Suburban Legends,"Billy built a robot in his parent's garage
Because he had a list of problems that he needed to solve
He said, ""I'm sick of the Hills, Laguna Beach is fake and whack
Let's party like it's '96 and bring the horn section back""

Back before Gwen Stefani started rapping with Pharrell
Gas cost one fifteen and Goldfinger could sell
When reality TV wasn't scripted or contrived
The brass was phat and bumpin' and the beats were all played live

See, Billy was obsessed with third wave ska
The Mighty Bosstones, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake
He'd seen them all
He longed for a time when even Bill Clinton played the sax
On the white house lawn and kids wore shades and checkered slacks

So Billy sits back in the class and labs
Put a notebook on his lap 'cause he plans a task
To make a giant robot, how's that?
And bring the real Orange County back

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy, make the city understand

The robot was completed and it opened up its eyes
Weighing seven hundred pounds and standing eight foot five
With his black coat, white shoes, black hat, set to attack
The robot headed to the hills to give those spoiled kids a smack

Christoph Leary got knocked flat as Billy bumped the Aquabats
He ripped out Mischa Barton's spine to crank Save Ferris and Sublime
He burnt down Heidi Montag's home and to blast the OC Supertones
His scream was smashing LC's head, ska is not dead

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy, take the OC by surprise

He'll make you do the Macarena as you rock your Tamagachi
With your Newton down in Woodstock playing Sega la-di-da-di
He brought the 90's back and then he freed Tibet
If you can't find his jam on Napster then the warehouse sells cassettes
(Old school)

Gigantic
(He was)
Gigantic
(This robot)

Gigantic
(So very)
Gigantic
(Ska robot)

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy, make the city understand

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy, take the whole world by surprise

I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home

You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet

Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed

Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

DJ Screw player, I'll never forget
Represent S.U.C., forever my set
I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe
It's your boy Willean, and I'm holding it down
Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live
And if S.U.C. get a deal, it's goin' be a hundred mill

If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

Such a Surge,"Heaven on earth, god said let there be light
And there was light but also a dark side
Delirium, you try to run but you can't hide
You're greedy but you can't satisfy your appetite
You're doing everything to get that devil in your mind
You try to see things with the eyes of the blind
Isolation, the result of your addiction
You're stoned to the bone but still alone
You reach out for a shoulder to lean on
But all respect is gone and you can't carry on
Despised by society, treated like an animal
For the law just a piece of shit, a criminal
You thought that you could fly, high in the sky
Like superman but in reality you're a weak man
Tear-drops falling from your eyes
You're living in hell and you thought it was paradise

I used to know - a little boy called roy
He had a dream - he was just seventeen
He had a monkey on his back - a blood sucker called crack
Crack was a killer - roy's life became a thriller
The higher he climbed - the further he fell down
The king without a crown - became a clown
To get his stuff - roy used to know
How to handle a gun - he lost now he's gone
He's six feet deep - and nobody cares

Refrain : down to earth

My mind is free, I explore reality
Like an aboriginee, down to earth philosophy
I'm not on l.s.d. cause I'll prefer to use only
W.to the double e.to the d.
I'm feeling irie without mental slavery
No hard drugs ganja brings out the best in me
Weed of wisdom, weed of positivity
No negativity just creativity
My inner-mind's eye helps me to see
All this crazy shit going on around me
My life is not funny, not a fucking comedy
Nevertheless I don't do hard drugs, I
Wanna stay free
'cause yes it's me, the energizer battery
So wait and see who's got more energy
No heroin, no crack, no l.s.d.
I'm free for eternity with the b.o.n.g.

I try to get a grip on that slippery ground
What goes up must come down, I'm in too deep.
This night will be another restless sleep
So I'll go on and try to get my conscience free
I'll stop my enemy to free my dignity
Last night I dreamed what tomorrow might brings
I'm not your puppet I don't give a fuck I'll cut off the strings
My straightjacket fits, the sleeves made by society
It's always the same they chain me cause I'm insane
My hands, stained with blood but my mission is gods will
It's like a thrill I've got to kill
So lay your cards on the table it's time to play

I've got nothing to lose so I don't bring no sacrifice
But I realized that you have to pay the price

Flatlines, but now it's time for you to die

Sitting all alone in my room with the radio on
I don't know what to do 'cause I don't know what's going on
My mind is clear, so why do I have this fear
To look at my face to see these eyes full of tears
Crying yes crying all the time about my memories
Realizing that my life is full of tragedies
Stuck between two worlds and I can't stand the agony
Reality is my dream so won't you please take this pain from me
Shadows on the wall where are they from, another dream
I've got enough of this , back to reality
I've got a message for you and you might believe me it's true
You'll never see me crying again cause I'll break your rules
A dream about a perfect world is your identity
But beware of the fact, that I'm your enemy
The one who's gonna step up to you and show you that your rules
Are the rules of a fool

Du schreist die anderen hören weg auf dich wartet der Tod

Sich die Gewalt ein neues Opfer krallt

Denn sie haben dich in ihrer Hand folgst deinem falschen Stolz
Und gehst mit dem Kopf durch die Wand

Wenn man dich nicht hoffnungslos dem Vergessen überläßt
Sind Hass und Machtgier bald so chancenlos wie die Pest
Ich gebe nicht auf aber man kann ja zu sich stehen wie man will

Lassen sich treiben schlucken und schweigen
Auch wenn einer ersäuft Hauptsache ist daß es geregelt läuft

Wer hört den letzten Schuß und macht Schluß
Wem kann man heute noch vertraun'?
Wem sollte man die Lügen glauben oder lieber eine reinhaun'

And pray that the blue sky won't fade to gray

The price for the lies in your eyes
When you look at me
You're fakin' that same smile while you're drivin' me wild
Talking to you is like talking to the TV
I try to communicate but you don't wanna hear me
You try to teach us to hate each other
How to judge a book by the cover
All the bridges that you burn will come back one day to haunt you
Demons will be on your trail in hell
I don't receive relief when I'm in need of your helping hands

And too blind to see
That you won't change your life
That I can't understand
Cause you don't get further with it
So listen up loud and clear and try to make it for real
When you get home don't tell us lies
Searching for something that we call respect
You will never deserve it even if you don't quit
No one is remembers the ugly old past
To get through this, it's our family affair
But we're gonna make it and we don't care
Down to earth we're gonna stay fair

Day by day, up 'n' down, round 'n' round
What the hell is going on, how can I stay strong
I'm a outcast, power blast, free at last
In this to win this, of course, I am a menace
And I'm ready for the next move
Cause I'm two steps ahead
I can't wait to combat
Your getting hectic
Cause I know the right tactic
Tic tac yes I'm back to attack the redneck
Life is like a game only the strongest will remain
I wait for justice
But I wait in vain

Bring me your pressure I can take it
I'm always under pressure fool, ain't nothing new!!

No you can not, you can't call me a fool
Just by the fact that I never did follow your rules
Now I'm in the right mood to kick you
In your always smiling face with the spikes on my boots
Coming up like the living dead that's the way I act
Never hesitating to make you the next
So here we go, with the flow, going on with the show
Together with my crew I'm gonna show you what I know
Right!! the reason why I fight is to see the new daylight
You wanna know why? good try!!
I wont give up till I die 'cause I'm right yes
And I want you motherfuckers to accept this
Do what you want I'll never give you the respect
For what? you don't know how to handle that
And now it's time for you, you'd better pay attention
'cause now I'm under pressure

Under pressure but I can take this
Come opn bring me your pressure, easy going fool
Under pressure but I can handle it
My mind is under pressure every day
 
 
Under pressure
Extra, extra read all about it
It was you in the headlines but now I'm going for mine
I'm still doing my own thing on your advice I'll piss
So don't judge me as a sell out, slave to the business
Dream your dream while I watch you going down the stream
I talk about the truth but you don't know what I mean
I'm loud enough but still you don't wanna hear
The future seems dark but still I feel no fear
I know you love to hate me, so what fool?
I don't even love you but I'm keeping my cool
I know what I've got was hard to earn
But to handle your pressure was easy to learn
You say do this, do that or don't that 'n' this
I wish I had a gun, and that the bullet won't miss
Cause ain't no problems without chumps like you
So shut up'n'step back, you talk to much, fuck you!!!
Under pressure but I can handle that
I'm always under pressure, yes every day
Bring me your pressure what you're waiting for
My mind is under pressure, I've got nothing to lose fool !!!",Under Pressure,1995

(THOMAS D.)
Strömungen und Schwingungen sind die Tricks und die Bedingungen
Zum Zauber des Augenblicks, doch die meisten glauben nix'
Ich fühlte es über Nacht, alle Macht liegt I'm Jetzt
Und ich weiß, daß sich mir nichts mehr entgegensetzt
Und nicht zuletzt, weil gegen Gegebenheiten zu schreiten
Bei weitem nie alles war
Ließ ich mich gleiten, und mir wurde alles klar
Der Weise weiß den Weg, und er weist weiteren Wesen den Weg
Doch wer in dieser Welt weiß, wohin meiner geht
War viel zu heftig beschäftigt, um zu sehn' wohin der Fluß fließt
Und hatten Frust, wenn der Fluß freezed
Doch das ist vorbei, jetzt bin ich frei
Auf einmal wird dir alles klar
Daß es schon immer so war
Wir stehn' ganz nah' am Rand
Mit der Welt in unserer Hand

I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home

With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps
As a child of 25

This is the straw, final straw in the
Roof of my mouth as I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time.

You're the only thing that I love
Scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer

Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth I'm lost for words

Ich glaub
Heute gehe ich endlich mal raus, ich lauf'
Gedanken verlassen den Raum
Halt dich fest, denn ich lasse los
Atme durch und ich starr nicht mehr aufs Telefon
Dreh unser Lied auf und genieße jeden Ton
Jede Melodie, eine Erinnerung
Sie werden älter, doch bleiben für immer jung
Hah! Jetzt hab ich nichts mehr zu verlieren
Laufe Richtung Heimat, den Blick immer zu dir (zu dir)
Gerichtet, mein Herz, Geschichte
Erzähl sie deinen Kindern und berichte ihn' von mir
Der Zeitpunkt wo die Zeit in das Land geht
Und das Kind in mir einsam sein Mann steht
Ich hab verlor'n, denn ich kann nicht mehr weiter Kämpfen
Ich hab gewonnen, denn ich kann jetzt alleine Lächeln

Diese Welt ist so unglaublich groß
Einmal durch die Hölle Richtung Paradies
Wird dir schon nicht die Beine brechen, ah, yeah

Ich will's nicht einsehen doch wir bleiben nicht für immer jung
Also schwimm' ich ziellos durch ein Meer von Erinnerungen
Und irgendwie verletzt es mich schon selbst
Denn ich dachte echt bis jetzt ich bin ein Held
Atme ganz allein die Luft ein, die wir geteilt haben
Meine glänzende Truhe voller schöner Bilder werde ich Heim tragen
Und jeder Blick ist ein Feuerwerk für mich!
Mit jedem Schritt tanzt ein neues Herz im Licht
Und ich hoffe die Straße führt zum Ort der mich verstehen lässt
Doch schöne Blumen locken mich vom Weg weg, ich sing ein Lied
Es ist unser Song, ja vielleicht klingt er schief
Könntest du ihn hören, ja du hättest ihn bestimmt geliebt

Augen weit auf, laufe ich Raus
Mit allen Sinnen sauge ich jeden Augenblick auf
Einmal ist es still und die Welt bleibt stehn'

Und trotzdem lauf ich noch
Und jeder Schritt fühlt sich falsch an
Bin gespannt was da draußen kommt
Einmal durch dir Hölle ins gelobte Land
Ich steh' im Auge des Sturms und er tobt durchs Land
So geh ich mit 'nem Lächeln im Gesicht

Sie ist circa 20 Jahre und ne Bombe, keine Frage
Sie steht immer in der Schlange, um nach Fotos zu fragen

Kauft sich jedes Shirt
Schneidet es zurecht, damit sie auffällt

Schöne Frauen sind der Teufel
Und du fragst dich im Ernst wo das Problem bleibt?

Riesen Gefühle. Es fliegen Endorphine

Ich dreh fast durch, denn sie trägt einen Pokéball-BH
Sie macht den Sekt klar. Ich bin betrunken
Ich mach den Sex klar. Ich bin betrunken
Das macht die extra, sie ist verschwunden
Wo ist sie nur hin? Ich bin so heiß. Ich bin betrunken
Warum laufen all diese Pikachus an den Wänden lang?
Und warum sind ausgerechnet vier Finger an meinen Händen dran?

Ich war ständig besoffen und habe Mukke gemacht
Ich war mit Abstand der Beste, ich hab gewusst, dass ich 's schaff
Schule war egal, eure Oma ist fast ausgeflippt
Weil ich jeden Abend leichte Mädchen mit nach Hause bring
Da hab ich noch Zuhause gewohnt - Prominenter Sohn

Und heute findet man mit Sicherheit noch Koks in mein Haaren
Ich war ein motherfucking Rockstar hatte Sex mit Popstars
Wenn ihr jetzt lacht, ey, dann reiß ich euch den Kopf ab
Und eine Frau zu finden das ist echt nicht schwer
Wenn man berühmt ist und auf Liebe scheißt bei dem Geschlechtsverkehr
Übrigens, früher hat man ficken gesagt
Das habe ich in Songs so oft benutzt, dass ich nicht mehr darf
Wenn Frauen nur noch Namen in der Excel-Liste sind
Dann ist man ein Held und dann ist Sex der siebte Sinn

Ihr wollte euren eigenen Fernseher?

Verdammt was für ein scheiß Tag in einem scheiß Jahr
Ja ich denk' an dich
Denke nach, frage mich, ob das mein Ende ist
Gucke aus dem Fenster, doch ich finde keinen Mensch wie dich
Lebe in der Hölle, doch erfriere hier im Bett
Bevor die flüchten noch die Fotos hinterm Spiegelkabinett
Schrei mich selbst an ""Dann schmeiß sie weg!""
Das kann ich nicht
Blick in den Spiegel und schau zu wie ein Mann zerbricht
Ich bin nicht mehr ich und du bist nicht mehr du
Ich ruf' dich nicht an, denn mir fehlt der Mut dazu
Ich hab' so oft versucht dir ein Zeichen zu senden
Mein Herz ist schuld, wurde geschnappt
Und du bleibst mein Gefängnis
Ich würd' gern flüchten in deinen Arm
Ich flüster deinen Namen
Warum haben mich deine 1000 Schüsse nicht gewarnt?
Ich bin so ein Idiot
Ich sollt' die Knarre nehmen und abdrücken
Denn ohne dich bin ich sowieso tot

Ich kann dir nicht entfliehen
Ganz egal wie weit ich lauf'
Lass dich weiterziehen
Doch weiß genau, dass ich dich brauch'
Halt mich jetzt nicht fest
Dann komm ich nie los von dir und du von mir
Lass uns gemeinsam fliehen
Ich vor dir und du vor mir

Wie oft hab ich zu bremsen versucht?
Du weißt ich lauf immer weiter
Baby, du kennst mich zu gut
Ich weiß nicht ob du vor mir wegläufst oder ob du mich suchst
Schwimme durch das tiefe Meer der Trauer trotze der Flut
Bin noch nicht angekommen, doch hab an Land gewonnen
Der lange da hat dich am Abgrund-hängend deine Hand genommen
Einfach immer weiter durch den Regen in die Ferne laufen
Auf der Suche nach meinem Mädchen mit den Sternenaugen
Und ich kann nur für mich selbst sprechen
Ich bin mir so sicher
Nur dein Herz kann meine Welt retten
Alles was mich hält, Ketten reiß ich einfach mit mir mit
Kein Mensch der dich gesehen hat
Doch ich fühle, dass es dich noch gibt
Frag den Frühling und den Sommer nach 'nem bisschen Glück
Herbst, ob du noch auf mich wartest
Winter, ob du mich vermisst
Würde gerne abhauen und mir sagen, dass es dich nicht gibt
Doch wenn ich mich umdrehe, holst du mich zurück

Ich kann dir nicht entfliehen
Ganz egal wie weit ich lauf'
Lass dich weiterziehen
Doch weiß genau, dass ich dich brauch'
Halt mich jetzt nicht fest
Dann komm ich nie los von dir und du von mir
Lass uns gemeinsam fliehen
Ich vor dir und du vor mir

Auch wenn das Wetter beschissen ist und die Kälte mich killt
Ich lauf' mit dir wohin du willst
Auf der Flucht scheint die Richtung immer zu stimmen
Baby wir müssen nach Hause
Komm, ich bringe dich hin

Ich würde mit ihr essen in 'nem guten Laden
Ich würde wieder ehrlich sein und ihr versprechen
Dass wir eine Zukunft haben
Wir hätten wieder zwei Stunden Sex nach drei Stunden Mario Kart
Und für den diamantbesetzten Verlobungsring
Hätt' ich wieder Jahre gespart
Wieder würden wir uns streiten
Aber nur weil der Versöhnungssex so geil ist
Wieder würde sich zeigen, dass Paris für sie und mich zu klein ist
Sie würde wieder mit den Tellern werfen
Ich würde sie wieder in den Keller sperren
Mal im ernst, ich würde wohl anstatt ein Held zu werden ihre Welt zerstören
Sie würde mich wieder zum Teufel schicken
Und ich würde wieder ihre Freundin ficken
Wieder wäre klar, dass ich sie leider nie vergesse

Sie ist im Bett ein Biest, du warst mehr so süße Blume
Jetzt sei' keine blöde Hure und lern' fleißig für die Schule
Auch wenn du ein Teufel bist, Mama ist so stolz auf dich
Fick' auch deine Lehrer, wenn keine Eins auf deinem Zeugnis ist

Und der Kabelstrang in deinem Kopf,
Sagt ich bin ein Arschloch und ich habe es verbockt
Also brennst du meine Stadt kaputt
Mit deinen himmelsblauen Laseraugen
Und der Energie die sich als Last entpuppt
Du bist kein Mensch mehr, kein Wesen das noch Wärme gibt
Auf deinem Nacken steht jetzt ""Made in Germany""
Dich so zu sehen wie du lebst, doch zu wissen das du tot bist
Es tut so weh nicht zu wissen was da los ist
Du willst nicht mit mir reden weil du reden nicht mehr kannst
Programmiert zu überleben also gehst du auf Distanz
Du prallst gegen eine Wand wie meine Worte, meine Tränen
Jetzt kann nur ein Kurzschluss dich noch zähmen

Wählen (doch ich bin ein Fehler im System!)

Von Experten programmiert, keiner der dich übertrifft

Jetzt ist es zu spät, deine Gefecht und alles bebt

Ich am Abgrund, du stehst vor mir und du peilst mich an
Kurzschluss, du springst zu mir und greifst meine Hand
Ein warmer Blick, so vertraut kurz wie früher
Wir haben was gemeinsam denn wir beide sind Verlierer

Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me

Even ice men leave her alone

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say; I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas
Brother, she's the polar bear's pajamas

Is her delight; they say an evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your B-V-D's
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah
Anytime a woman can take a great big pan
Start pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

Oh, she's sweet as sour milk",Hard-Hearted Hannah,1993
Sue Keller,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Over the shadows and the rain

Yes home is where our hurt is that's why we don't stay at home much anymore

Suffocation,"The broken ways, as I walk through the emptiness
Lost souls as empty as mine
Barren and desolate, foreseeing the irony
Abolish the self, merge into a singular space
Confront the self, subduing the whim's inside
No feelings to exude and portray the sullen days
As we hide from the bitterness,
Embellish reality, or so your told

No other way, to prepare for awakening
Condense the frail ridden mind
Keep without consciousness
To adhere to the ending days
The gods are not here for you now,
Expect a dichotomy
Ancient thoughts to prepare for the exodus
Shutter at what knowledge will hold
Sullen days searching for a singular way

Now I conceive a brutal reality,
Just wanting to kill
Murder in mind, to silence a virus
Internal struggle containing the violence
Wanting to purge the earth
Denying my thoughts to obtain absolution
Pray for my soul to receive its ascension

Sullen days as I dwell in this empty shell
Hopes of redemption decline
Festering hate inside as I harbor the pain within
A tormented soul that's tortured and bound
God fearing agony

Broken days, in my bitter reality
Conform thy self, I brood within
Prepare to die, as I wade through these sullen days,
The know not my plans of what destiny holds

What I know is silence will manifest
Hatred, brewing within me
I dream of killing

Sufjan Stevens,"When he took the three disciples
To the mountainside to pray,
His countenance was modified, his clothing was aflame.
Two men appeared: Moses and Elijah came;
They were at his side.
The prophecy, the legislation spoke of whenever he would die.

Then there came a word
Of what he should accomplish on the day.
Then Peter spoke, to make of them a tabernacle place.
A cloud appeared in glory as an accolade.
They fell on the ground.
A voice arrived, the voice of God,
The face of God, covered in a cloud.

What he said to them,
The voice of God: the most beloved son.
Consider what he says to you, consider what's to come.
The prophecy was put to death,
Was put to death, and so will the Son.
And keep your word, disguise the vision 'till the time has come.

Lost in the cloud, a voice. Have no fear! We draw near!
Lost in the cloud, a sign. Son of man! Turn your ear.

The things I brought you
When I found out you had cancer of the bone

Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I could see what you were reading

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens

I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

In the morning at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared

All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I find the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of you mother

On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window

In the morning in the winter shade
On the 1st of March on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see His face
In the morning in the window

All the glory when he took our place
But he took my shoulders and he shook my face
And he takes and he takes and he takes",Casimir Pulaski Day,2005

With a slight of his hand, running far, running fast to the dead

He put a cloth on their lips, quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth

We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we travel so far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star

Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Glorious now behold Him arise
King and God and sacrifice
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Earth to heaven replies

Oh, star of wonder, star of might

Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light",We Three Kings,2006
Sufjan Stevens,"If you seek a pillow for your head
Or a fitted sheet for Christmas bed
If you see your shadow on the snow
Is it from the baby Jesus glow?
He's going to the country

Find a tree and put it in your house
Put a mistletoe upon your mother's blouse
If you see a woman dressed in black
Give her up a song and then ask for it back
We're goin' to the country! We're goin' to the country!
You're mom's going to the country
We're goin' to the country! The country

Sufjan Stevens,"I call you cabin neighbors
I call you once my friends
But I trust when you labor
And put my head to rest

But I was on the hatch
I was on the avalanche
And I had found my match
I was on the floor

I took a train from Virginia
To Illinois, my home
He said â??I knew you had it in you
A mind to make its ownâ??

But I was on the hatch
Riding on the avalanche
I tried to take it back
I was on the floor

Come on stone
Come on star
Come on snow
Come on car
Come on hands
Come on feet

Move it along

Come on life
Come on Lord

Sufjan Stevens,"Oh, stop thinking of tomorrow, don't stop thinking of today
You're not getting any younger, you've got nothing to explain

You've got resolutions, you've got resolutions
Fastening in your wake, fastening in your wake
Take instead the high tide, take instead the high tide
At the man-made lake, at the man-made lake

It may take a while, it may take a while
It may take all day, it may take all day
All the implications, all the implications
At the man-made lake, at the man-made lake

Oh, stop thinking of tomorrow, don't stop thinking of today

A fever anyway

",Dear Mr. Supercomputer,2006
Sufjan Stevens,"Oh life, with your shoulders in the mirror
From the park when Dakota ran and brought you there
In the car when your mother lost her temper
The catalog and the catastrophic smile

Let the bugles play the sermon on the raid
I kissed you on the face
I kissed you on the playground

Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What's right and wrong you cannot tell me
I jump before I get around you
Oh Father John

Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan tollway
Don't give up, let's go forget about yourself
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan tollway
Forget about yourself and all your plans

Oh life, with your colorful surprises
Eleanor, how you put one on disguises
Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What's right and wrong you cannot tell me

In the mortal life far in the morning light
We're back from Bloomington we let the runners win
Far in the morning light we let the movies play
A weekend from the holiday

Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan toll way
Don't break down, let's go forget about yourself
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan toll way
If I'm wrong makes nothing right about yourself

Snowmobile on the field where the gunners throw their weight around
Forget about yourself and all your plans
",The Henney Buggy Band,2006
Sufjan Stevens,"And the winter moves about Illinois
When my sister picks a fight with the Alexander boy
And my father locks the car by the store
Still we figure out the keys and follow him once more

Oh my God, we see it on the floor
The woman on the bed the ankle brace she wore
Stones and sled it could have been some other
The mind that knows itself has a mind to serve the other
And we run back scratching at the door, scratching at the door

If I'm hiding in the sleeves of my coat
When my father runs undressed, he's pointing at my throat
And my brother has a fit in the snow
And the traffic stops for miles, we take him by the elbow

Oh my God, the shuffling at the floor
(Oh my God)
A mind that knows itself is a mind that knows much more
(No one came to our side)
So we run back, scrambling for cover
(To carry us away from danger)
A mind that knows itself has a mind to kill the other
(Oh my God, no one came to our side)

Oh my God, he left us now for dead
(Oh my God)
He left us now for dead

Sufjan Stevens,"Up in the highest of heights, O'Hara blinks and fights
This land is yours, this land is mine
I see the captain in red and Cairo at his head
This land is yours, this land is mine

The lightning over the park, the waters, brash and dark
We take a swim, we take a swim
I never meant to escape the carpet and the trade
This land is yours, this land is mine

And when I make up my mind, I change it all the time
I take it back, I take it back
The numbers over the dam, Jo Davies and the band
I count them out, I count them out

There was a car in the bay, by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light, in the water that we made
I'm counting it out, I'm counting it out, I'm working it out
Inside, I'm counting it out from the floor

The ferry hatches Moline, Panola Beauty Queen
She takes a bow, she takes a bow
In Charles, we climb the hill and Danville window sill
I take it back, I take it back

My sister she counts the bars, the Macon county cars
She takes a bow, she takes a bow
The Mississippi amends, the Carver and the bends
This land is yours, this land is mine

My brother punches my ear, the injured ivory deer
I call my dad, I call my dad
We skip inside of the store, the Mason winter door
This land is yours, this land is mine

There was a car in the bay, by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light, in the water that we made
I'm holding your hand by the shore with our collars pulled up tight
I'm counting it out, I'm counting it out, I'm working it out inside

I'm counting it out, I'm counting it out, I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out

This land is not your land, for the right hand
Takes what it can, ransacks with the mad man
For this land is not yours or mine to have
This land was made for the good of itself

Sufjan Stevens,"Everything is lost, uh oh
But I know that you can take it to the Lord
Everything you want, uh oh
Is it all that you can gather for yourself?

Do you love a lot, uh oh?
It's the love that changes gifts to everyone
Everything is lost, uh oh
Is it strange that you perpetuate yourself?

You wonder what it costs, uh oh
It's the joy that he will carry to the door
Everything is lost, uh oh
Still I know that you can take it to the world

All that he has given to the world
All that he has given to the world
All that he has given to the world
All that he has given to the world

All that he has given to the world
All that he has given to the world

Sufjan Stevens,"All things passed in the pick-up, found my brother's badge

Abraham is alive and well in the pick-up
And his wife casts no more spells in the pick-up

Found myself in the pick-up, seatbelt on my lap

And my sister with her bracelet in the pick-up
Kiss my mother on her face in the pick-up
Clapping with the human race in the pick-up

Sufjan Stevens,"I'm not afraid of you now, I know
So I climbed down from the bunk beds this low

I can talk back to you now, I know
From a few things I learned from this TV show

You can work late till midnight, we don't care
We can fix our own meals, we can wash our own hair

I go to school before sunrise, in the cold
And I pulled the alarm, and I kicked up the salad bowls

Since that time we meant to say much
Unsaid things begin to change
After school we shoveled through the snow
??? stayed inside with silence in the cold

You can remind me of it
That I was lazy and tired
You can work all your life as
I'm not afraid of you anymore

If I loved you a long time, I don't know
If I can't recall the last time you told me so

Here in this house in Pittsfield
The ghost of our grandmother works at the sewing machine post
Hiding the bills in the kitchen on the floor
And my sister lost her best friend in the Persian Gulf War
There was a flood in the bathroom last May
And you kicked at the pipes when it rattled oh the river it made

Stand there, tell me that I'm of no use
Things unspoken break us if we share
There's still time to wash the kitchen floor
On your knees, at the sink once more
You can remind me that I was tired
You can work late and give yourself up
Now that I'm older, wiser, and working less
I don't regret having left the place a mess

You can remind me that I was lazy and tired
You can recall your life as
I'm not afraid of you, anymore
Anymore",Pittsfield,2006

Sufjan Stevens,"I don't care to say
What I failed to recognize
Every single day
From the poker to the prize

Running out of Springfield, I worked for the Capitol Air
In the bags
Found a woman there who said, she had a mind
To make me a messenger man

If my father took his life
For the national plan
I don't care, I'm not about to stick my grave
With an apron and a bucket of plans

Never ever, I can take the pillow cases
Off the yellow pillows, make a property line
From the bed in the living room, the living room
The morning papers made the most out of nothing at all

So we took the room
With a view of the runaway
I took off my clothes
And she took it for a holiday

I was taken for all the things
That I never had before
Running out of Springfield, she left me
With a note saying, ""Bobby, don't look back""

And if my wife took a bicycle ride
With a knife in her hand
I saw it coming all the shad-flies run at once
With a trumpet or a train, oh, I'm running from it

Wait a minute, wait a minute, give a minute, lady
I can explain the aftershave
Wait a minute, wait a minute, give a minute
Bobby got a shad fly caught in his hair, yes, he does

Sufjan Stevens,"Ring them bells, ye heathen from the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
And time is running backwards and so is the bride

Ring them bells St. Peter where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand, so the people will know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down upon that sacred cow

Ring them bells Sweet Martha for the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells for the time that flies
For the child that cries when innocence dies

Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the room
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance between right and wrong

For he waits in the dark, brooding magically, mustering paperback feelings

No I'm not afraid of death or strife or injury, accidents, they are my friends",Arnika,2010
Sufjan Stevens,"I know you won't get very far
With the back seat driver in the carpetbagger
With the dagger heart grabber stuck in your car

And the yard is grown to a hilt
And the money spent money spent where it went
Embarrassment, embarrassment to pay for the car

And the man who left you for dead
He's the heart grabber back stabber double cheater wife beater
You don't need that man in your life

And you worked yourself to the bone
While the people say what they say
It's the neighbors anyway
They don't know what's good for your life

And I see your head hangs low
In the black shadow, half shadow
Living room is fitting is sitting room is fit for your crying

Don't be ashamed'don't hide in your room
For the woman is, woman is the glorious victorious
The mother of the heart of the world

Djohariah Djohariah, etc.

And the time you held to the light
When water ran water ran with the strange attic
And when the walls were wet with your life

And you pushed yourself to the floor
And the spirit went where it went
Hovering discovering uncovering your life, on the floor

And the walls were wet with your love

For the mother is, the mother is the glorious victorious
The mother of the heart of the world

Don't be ashamed, don't hide from me now
For the woman is the woman is the glorious victorious
The mother of the heart of the world

Djohariah Djohariah, etc.

Don't be ashamed, don't cry in the bath
For it's the story of, story of, morning glory story
It's the gloriole that comes to your path

There is a time when the lights will arise
For the mother is, the mother is the glorious victorious
The mother of the heart of the world

Go on! Little sister! Go on!
For your world is yours, world is yours
All the wilderness of world is yours to enjoy

Go on! Little sister! Go on! Little sister!
For your world is yours, world is yours
All the wilderness of world is yours

Go on! Little sister! Go on! Little sister!
For your world is yours, world is yours
All the wilderness of world is yours

Go on! Little sister! Go on!
For you're beautiful, beautiful
All the fullness of the world is yours",Djohariah,2010
Sufjan Stevens,"Tell me what you saw in me
And I'll try to replicate it with a scene
Mm-mmm
If it troubles you to breathe
Wait a moment; I could change the scenery

Don't carry on carrying efforts, oh no, oh oh oh oh
Somewhere there's a room for each of us to grow
And if it pleases you to leave me, just go, oh oh oh oh
Stopping you would stifle your enchanting ghost
Mm-mmm

It's only that I meant to bring
Love and liveliness to your breast on the scene
Mm-mmm
Did you cut your hands on me?
Are my edges sharp? Am I a pest to feed?

Don't carry on carrying regrets, oh no, oh oh oh
Somewhere there's a room for us to speak alone
And if it grieves you to stay here, just go, oh oh oh oh
For I have no spell on you, it's all a ghost
Mm-mmm

I still have the things you gave me
Four anointing oils, the paper weight you made
Mm-mmm
For sure I haven't carried them
Or buried them in the name of your ghost, my friend

Don't carry on carrying efforts 
Don't go! No oh oh oh
Stay with me until I sleep within your host
Or if it pleases you to leave me, just go, oh oh oh oh
Stopping you would stifle your enchanting ghost

Sufjan Stevens,"Desperate measures lead to death
From the mouth of Gabriel
Who died in his sleep when the world was a very big mess
A very big mess 
He saw too much
From now on I will look away from every accident
That may or may not come my way

Saw you were talking up above the Aleph room
Masquerading as a loom
Both of us saw things
No one else would see as well
From the mouth of Gabriel
No one else would hear as well
From the mouth of Gabriel

Don't be so sure of what you feel (it might as well be trouble)
From now on just let the universe be your shelter from the enemy

Your face has changed
I hardly know who you are this time
And what a mess I've made of you
You probably would but I won't let you run away
You probably should but I won't let you run away this time

Don't be afraid of loneliness some refugee beside itself
Instead of what you've got
You probably would but I won't let you go away
You probably should but I won't let you go away this time

Your face has changed
I hardly know who you are this time
And when I came into your room
You tried to jump

Now I know this is strange to hear from the mouth of God
It was something like a scene from mars
In a struggle between loves and lies
The angel kept his face covered for to keep his word
And while I spoke something left from my life
Forget about the past
Be at rest I'll make things right
And while I held you at best you nearly died
Forget about the past
And I'll try to make things right",From the Mouth of Gabriel,2010
Sufjan Stevens,"When your heirloom's wilted brown
When the devil's pushing down
When your mourning has a sound
And you hesitate to laugh
How quickly will your joy pass
How quickly will your joy pass

And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more

So do you think I came to fight?
And do I always think I'm right?
Oh no I never meant to be a pest to anyone this time
Oh no I only meant to be a friend to everyone this time

And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more",Heirloom,2010
Sufjan Stevens,"All I had hoped for
I kept inside your car
The rabbit in the barn
Most of all I wait
I wait beside the door 
I wait beside the door

And all I was wrong trembling in the cage
I was diamonds in the cage
In seven hours I consider death
And your father called to yell at me
You little boy, you little boy

Found out you cheated me
I ran behind the barn and cut my hands somehow
Blood in the meadowlark
I punched your ears instead
I punched you in the head
You only laughed and laughed and laughed

How I was wrong tingling from the kill
Tickle me until you devil bird you evil still
Slept on my arms, sleeping in the sill
I was sleeping in the room with you
You little boy, you little boy

How could you run from me now?
The loneliest chime in the house
The loneliest chime in the house
You let it out you let it out
Come to me Calvary still
I'm weeding and raking until
I'm bleeding in spite of my love for you
It bruised and bruised my will

Counting alluvial plains
The breathing inside of the range
You touched me inside of my cage
Beneath my shirt your hands embraced me
Come to me feathered and frayed
For I am the ugliest prey,
For I am the ugliest prey
The owl, the reckless reckless praise

You said you'd wait for me
Down by the Tannery Creek
Far out by the clotheslines where we used to kiss behind the sheets
Wrapped in a blanket of red
The owl and the tanager said
The owl and the tanager said
One waits until the hour is death",The Owl and the Tanager,2010
Sufjan Stevens,"To bare it down to be in flight, to bare it down to be in flight
It wasn't about me it was only a stone in my shoe
Then worries came to perch on us
Impatience and a painted bus
I kept you close to me close to my ear

We set out once with folded shirts, with hairy chest and well rehearsed
I want it all, I want it all for myself
I'll set it right between your eyes
Your shoulder blades, your running knife
I want it all, I want it all for myself

Improving all the time, I am
Improving as I kiss the hem
I promise I won't be a trouble at all
For I'm okay, I'm in the red
Impressions of the unmade bed
You cradled close to me, close to my ear

We set out once forget our shirts with hairy chests and well rehearsed

Out in the earth I smell of you
Of bathing boy, amazing you
I want it all, I want it all for myself",All for Myself,2010

Oh you wouldn't say it but you wanted to
Don't look, don't walk away when I am speaking
I'll take it, but I know it's not for taking

The oneness of one of which you notice me
I told you, do not follow what you couldn't see
Oh, I love you, I love you
Some way, you will want it your way, sunrise
So I would not be mistaken what I know is right
Don't be so funny with me, I'm not laughing

Sufjan Stevens,"It's been a long, long time
Since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now
Since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch
I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets
I cover up my face

I do
Love you
I do
Love you

And when you play guitar
I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet
I feel mesmerized and proud

And I would say I love you
But saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long

But you are life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb

And words are futile devices",Futile Devices,2010
Sufjan Stevens,"I know you want it
I know you really wanna get it right
Have you forsaken, have you mistaken me for someone else?
Saturday night you sleep with a rifle at your side
Delivering speeches, delivering speeches left and right
Follow those created deaths
Fortune save me from his wrath
Spaceship out the house at night
Prophet speak what's on your mind

You know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord

Visit the future, visit the future from the outer space (space space space space)
A ring of fire, a ring of fire falling on your face (face face face face)
You dream of the dark age, you dream of the dark age of your youth
Consider the danger, consider the danger, as it moves

Sufjan Stevens,"Lover, will you look at me now?
I'm already dead to you
But I'm inclined to explain
To you what I could not before
Whatever you didn't do, what you couldn't say
I am sorry that the worst has arrived
For I deserve more.
For at least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye

Tell me, do you think of me now
As I think of you?
For I could not have shaken the touch of your breath on my arm
For it has stayed in me as an epithet
I am sorry the worst has arrived
For I'm on the floor
In the room where we made it our last touch of the night

I walked, 'cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation to what you said
But I'm not about to expect something more
I would not have run off
But I couldn't bear that it's me
It's my fault
I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

Lover, will you look from me now
I'm already dead
But I've come to explain
Why I left such a mess on the floor
For when you went away
I went crazy. I was wild with the breast of a dog
I ran through the night
With the knife in my chest
With the lust of your loveless life

I walked, 'cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation to what you said
But I'm not about to expect something more
I would not have run off
But I couldn't bear that it's me
It's my fault
I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

I walked, 'cause you walked
I walked, 'cause you walked
I walked, 'cause you walked",I Walked,2010
Sufjan Stevens,"To think that I would die this time
Isolated in the room where the bed rises
Photographic ordinary people are everywhere
Extraordinary histories, ordinary histories, ordinary histories

I'll find sleep, I'll find peace
Or in death you'll sleep with me

To figure that it was my fault
Or so I've come to realize life is not about
Love with someone (ordinary people are everywhere)
Extraordinary people are, ordinary people are, ordinary people are

Everywhere you look, everywhere you turn
Illness is watching, waiting its turn

Did I go at it wrong?
Did I go intentionally to destroy me?
I'm suffering in noise I'm suffering in (touching ordinary body)
The burning from within the burning from with (ordinary hysteria)
I could not be at rest, I could not be at peace (extraordinary hysteria)

So do yourself a good, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes
Or do yourself a favor, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes

Illness likes to prey upon the lonely, prey upon the lonely
Wave goodbye, oh, I would rather be, but I would rather be fine

I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well

And I forgive you even
As you choke me that way
With the pill or demon
And the shrouded shalom
Under conversation
In tremendous weight of
A crowd of ages outside
Dressed for murder

I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around

And shall I kiss you even as you take me that way?
With the pill or demon as my body changes
Apparitions gone awry
They surround me, all sides
But from within I see an unholy changes

I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around",I Want to Be Well,2010
Sufjan Stevens,"Ooh, woman, tell me what you want
And I'll calm down without bleeding out
With a broken heart that you stabbed for an hour
Woman, I was freaking out because I want you to know
My beloved, you are the lover of my impossible soul

Woman, too, promise me you'll stay and put off all your woes
I was wigging out, too much worry
I could not get you at all
And you said what you want, you would laugh it off
But I know you won't go, not for it at last
Must you write it off for the impossible soul?
And I was in a dream, I was gone away without you, but not too slow
Lest I put it off, for I put it right for the impossible soul

And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all, my life, to you
If I could get you at all
Don't be a wreck, trying to be something that I wasn't at all

Seems I got it wrong, I was chasing after something that was gone
To the black of night, now I know it's not what I wanted at all
And you said something like, ""All you want is all the world for yourself""
But all I want is the perfect love
Though I know it's small, I want love for us all

And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all, my life, to you
If I could get you at all
Trying to be something that I wasn't at all

Do you want to be afraid?
Do you want to be afraid?
For life in the cage where courage's mate runs deep in the wake
For the scariest things are not half as enslaved

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be alone?
Do you want to be alone?
For life isn't stained of righteousness pain
The seed and the hail, all impossible flights for an interesting light

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to love me more?
Do you want to love me more?
For love is the breath
If water and wave is cursed by the same thing that nurtured its shame
Is it worth all the work?

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Have you failed to feel delight? (NO, I DON'T WANT TO FEEL PAIN)
Have you failed to feel delight? (NO, I DON'T WANT TO FEEL PAIN)
Instead of the life, lived tired and lost, have you left it at last
Where it floundered its death with the language of ghosts

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be afraid? (NO, I DON'T WANT TO FEEL PAIN)
Do you want to be afraid? (NO, I DON'T WANT TO FEEL PAIN)
For life in the cage where where courage's mate runs deep in the wake
For the scariest things are not half as enslaved

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted

No... Don't be distracted

Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest
All my delight, all that mattered, I couldn't be at rest
From what I liked, from what I gathered, I couldn't be at rest
Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest

And don't be shy in the window
Come down and give your best
Oh, delight in the window I couldn't be at rest
Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest
From what I liked, from what I gathered, I couldn't give my best

Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to breathe at all
Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to breathe at all
Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to breathe at all
Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to speak at all

Sign of your children's fever

Sufjan Stevens,"Spirit of my silence I can hear you, but I'm afraid to be near you
And I don't know where to begin
And I don't know where to begin

Somewhere in the desert there's a forest, and an acre before us
But I don't know where to begin
But I don't know where to begin
Again I lost my strength completely, or be near me tired old mare
With the wind in your hair

Amethyst and flowers on the table, is it real or a fable?
Well I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end

Chimney swift that finds me be my keeper, silhouette on the seater
What is that song you sing for the dead
What is that song you sing for the dead
I see the signal searchlight strike me, in the window of my room
Well I got nothing to prove
Well I got nothing to prove

I forgive you mother I can hear you, and I long to be near you
But every road leads to an end
Yes every road leads to an end
Your aberration passes through me, in the willows and five red hens
You'll never see us again
You'll never see us again",Death with Dignity,2015
Sufjan Stevens,"I’m drawn to the blood
The flight of a one-winged dove
How? How did this happen?
How? How did this happen?

The strength of his arm
My lover caught me off guard
How? Head of a rabbit
How? Head of a rabbit

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this?

With blood on my sleeve
Delilah, avenge my grief
How? God of Elijah
How? God of Elijah

As fire to the sun
Tell me what I have done
How? Heart of a dragon
How? Heart of a dragon

What did I do to deserve this now?
How did this happen?",Drawn to the Blood,2015
Sufjan Stevens,"Light struck from the lemon tree
What if I'd never seen hysterical light from Eugene?
Lemon yogurt, remember I pulled at your shirt
I dropped the ashtray on the floor
I just wanted to be near you

Emerald Park, wonders never cease
The man who taught me to swim, he couldn't quite say my first name
Like a Father he led community water on my head
And he called me ""Subaru""
And now I want to be near you

Since I was old enough to speak I've said it with alarm
Some part of me was lost in your sleeve
Where you hid your cigarettes
No I'll never forget
I just want to be near you

Still I pray to what I cannot see
In the sprinkler I mark the evidence known from the start
From the bed near your death, and all the machines that made a mess
Far away the falcon flew
Now I want to be near you

What's left is only bittersweet
For the rest of my life, admitting the best is behind me
Now I'm drunk and afraid, wishing the world would go away
What's the point of singing songs
If they'll never even hear you?",Eugene,2015
Sufjan Stevens,"The evil it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?

Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We’re all gonna die

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like Junior High
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I?
My fading supply

Did you get enough love, my little dove
Why do you cry?
And I’m sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles

The hospital asked should the body be cast
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

Shall we look at the moon, my little loon
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light

Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?

Sufjan Stevens,"Are we to speak, first day of the week
Stumbling words at the bar
Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries
Long island kindness and wine
Beloved of John, I get it all wrong
I read you for some kind of poem
Covered in lines, the fossils I find
Have they no life of their own?

So can we pretend sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I am a man with a heart that offends
With its lonely and greedy demands
There's only a shadow of me in a manner of speaking I'm dead

Such a waste, your beautiful face
Stumbling carpet arise
Go follow your gem, your white feathered friend
Icarus, point to the sun
If history speaks of two baby teeth
I'm painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord hear my prayer
I've wasted my throes on your head

So can we be friends, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I love you more than the world can contain
In its lonely and ramshackle head
There's only a shadow of me in a manner of speaking I'm dead

I'm holding my breath
My tongue on your chest
What can be said of my heart?
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Where there remains but a mark
Beloved my John, so I'll carry on
Counting my cards down to one
And when I am dead, come visit my bed
My fossil is bright in the sun

So can we contend, peacefully
Before my history ends?
Jesus I need you, be near me, come shield me
From fossils that fall on my head
There's only a shadow of me in a manner of speaking I'm dead",John My Beloved,2015
Sufjan Stevens,"Now that I fell into your arms
My only lover, give out to give in
I search for the capsule I lost

Drag me to hell in the valley of the Dalles
Like my mother, give wings to a stone
It's only the shadow of a cross

I slept on my back in the shade of the meadowlark
Like a champion, get drunk to get laid
I take one more hit when you depart

I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
Lonely vampire inhaling its fire
I'm chasing the dragon too far

There's blood on that blade, fuck me, I'm falling apart
My assassin like Casper the ghost
There's no shade in the shadow of the cross",No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross,2015
Sufjan Stevens,"The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders, Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

Do I care if I survive this, bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises I wonder did you love me at all?

The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders, water stain writing the wall
Daniel’s message, blood of the moon on us all

Do I care if I despise this, nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises, how do I live with your ghost?

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow

The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God’s grace, nothing else left to impart

Do I care if I survive this, bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises, hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now, I wanna feel your touch

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow",The Only Thing,2015
Sufjan Stevens,"I should have known better
To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies

I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy

When I was three, three maybe four
She left us at that video store
Be my rest, be my fantasy
Be my rest, be my fantasy

I'm light as a feather
I'm bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only wanna be a relief

No, I'm not a go-getter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I wanna believe

When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Be my rest, be my fantasy
Be my rest, be my fantasy

I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should have wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling

Don't back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor's greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination

Don't back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
I'm a fool in the fetter
Rose of Aaron's beard, where you can reach me

Don't back down, nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination",Should Have Known Better,2015
Sufjan Stevens,"Innocence was never lost
Though it may have been insulted
Even if the Earth forgot
Her inheritance resulted
In contradiction, ceremony
Benediction, hallelujah

There are no more accidents
Living things refuse to offer
Explanations of their worth
We in turn avenge the Author
With paranoia and prediction
Exploration, competition
Ceremony, inner anguish

Sufjan Stevens,"My father, working night
First shift, eternal light
The curse of Adam labor
Outside, in the parking lot
The current of wind and the light went hot
He held his head in terror
By Jove and by surprise
The current of lightning filled with light
It burned his hands with symbols
White noise as Lucifer
The sacred fire, the sacred fern
Conceived with holy water

His radiance in the dark
Mysterious shape or beauty mark
As if it were Minerva
Breastplate of Jupiter
The hovering deep, as he spoke the word
The light, the virgin creature
All dreams of all disease are fantasy features, first conceived
Illusions worth remembering
Our father late at night, forbidding death, he kissed the light
As Jupiter transfigured

I need you to change me, prevent you, persuade me, by Jove
I need you, sensation, by virtue, persuasion, by Jove, by Jove
By Jove

Say it to my face, put me in place

Dispose of the future
Or put away your sword

She kept them hidden from the plague
But have you heard the story of my mother’s fate?
She left us in Detroit in the rain with a pillowcase
Fortune for the paperweight

We followed her to Joseph, near the Indian raid
She wept among the weeds, hide and seek, for the fallen chief
Spathiphyllum on his grave
And like the cedar waxwing, she was drunk all day
We put her in the sheet, little wreath, candles on the crate
As the monster showed its face

As she waits for her children in the shade
Demogorgon or demigod the ghost parade
No oblation will bring her back to our place

She stayed within the deep end of Wallowa Lake
The undertow refrained with the flame of a feathered snake
Charybdis in its shallow grave
She gave us one last feature, the fullness of her face
In the shade of ""Hin-mah-too-yah"" (Red Napoleon)

As we wait for the waters to reside

When the dragon submerged we knew she had died",Wallowa Lake Monster,2017

You're keepin' it vague
Then lay down in deep isolation
Hope you can make it

Pick my girls up to check the party uptown
I leave my shorty home cause I'm tryina fuck around
At the sports bar, honeys everywhere are lookin' mink
What's up star, let's get a drink

[Chorus]
What's up star, I'd like to get to know who you are
Let's have drinks at the bar
What's up star, I'd like to get to know who you are
And if I like what I see then the drinks is on me

Well is it you or is it me, uh, I saw you glancin'
I peeped you from the door and on the floor when you was dancin'
This is the pick up line, I got the big up mine
I'm steppin' to ya like a stick up
I don't have to drop on ya 
So let's go get a drink on the low and kick in in the corner
To the bar start walkin' and I'ma hit you off
On some of that good shit I was talkin'
I hope to keep you interested, you should get with this kid
And if you lucky you could hit this
But don't get souped, it's just a conversation at the bar star
And if ya slip you get the scissor

[Chorus]

Cuties everywhere I turn, when am I gonna learn
I be outta control, I see what I want and I roll
I get the digits quick from the honeys, they be fly and all that
But right now that's not where my head is at
Over and over again I step off quickly with my friends
To put this little love shit to a dead end
I got to stay on point, checkin' the honey with a tag
I got to bag my next chick
And there he is lookin' kosher, posin' like a poster
I won't bite come a little closer
I want to talk but it's loud shit
And it's gettin' kinda hot in this crowd shit
So step over to the bar, and let's kick that lingo
I like to mingle, honey are ya single
If I give you the OK that means I like what I see
What's up star drinks is on me

Yo yo
I was born with this magnet, warned by the dragnet
About my dirty habits, I got to have it, the super-glow
Deuce Bigelow - Male Gigolo
Gold hands crush Coke cans and Michelobs
Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino
Nine needles - voice; evil steelo
Hit, like the bull, more pull than Magneto
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle
Nine dirty strikes, leaped up off all you people
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes
See you through the peephole - in the crime lab
Countin Ginos, cut-tin dime slabs
Then he bagged up Chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho
Slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up Reemo
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo
In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
Lower than low, lower than zero
Who's your rhymin heroes? *heavy breathing*

I dogs blast turbo, supersonic
Hats off, welcome back, whipe the sweat off
Bobby Digital, half-man and half (?)
NY City, home of the fly bitties
With high-heel shoes and tattoos on side titties
Shorties swallow up the apple cider
Ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow Spyder
With the black interior, my mack superior
to your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
I used to cut class and bang lunch tables
With four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables
Now I'm known to smack drum machines, carry +Guillotines+
Watch my bullets scream (""Pheeewwwwww!"") and hit the target
You can't trace the path of air for Richard Starlett

[Inspectah Deck]
It's the return of the bad boy, the mic Sean Penn
Floss gems across the globe with my nine Sourceman
At a speed that excedes your convertible Benz
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens
Stay hotter than a ex-con dodgin the pens
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend
And the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom
Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
Kings of our kindom, reppin from our hoodlums
Gotta whip them problems, 'cause yo we step on toes
Bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros
Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?
I spin a song like Michael and Diana in the Wiz
The rough shit, I bust it for the republic
Government, you ain't lovin it, whatchu fuckin wit?
Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outside I don't expect no love
Man this grip, make the fans flip, don't chance it
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid

You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us

I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac
Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track

Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars
Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier
Hell yeh you are, yeh you are
Say it say it, coz they all deny it
Player play it, coz you can't deny it

And you know that nigga dead when the casket is closed
Off with his dreads, keep the mag' in my clothes
I'm trying, real good, the semi' got loud up
You can die in your hood, like Kenny from South Park

And what you thought was cupid
Turned out to be
A violent, itty-bitty, punk, drunk, punk
With a bow and arrow
Just like you, stupid!
And knowin everything I rap about is true
But the cold part about it is
I got half this shit from you
Now how in the hell
Did you figure you was gon cross
That pretty blue eyed-green eyed
Country voodoo creole female
Now you reaping what you sow
Cause I'm ??? you
And my heavenly father in heaven
Is watching you

And all the way from them A-be	-see's
To them 1-2-3's
To the birds and the bees
Drinking 40's with OG's
Came a group of young fools
Who was close as close could get
We sported golf hats and ???
Stayed down for the set
Ready to hoo-ride
Cause my life is a picnic
Just one big set-trip
Snitches and tricks to get with right
I went to sleep
To wake up to the same old thing
My lady, my baby
No job, just homies ready to gangbang
My momma tried her best to raise me right
But still I'm leaving with the homies
Hurtin her feelings
Bout to drive her crazy
She told me every time she hear the police
She was hoping it wasn't me in the street
Somewhere deceased
Now we struggle to live
But we living to die
I see my homies dying one by one
I want to cry
But if heaven's where your living at
That's the same damn place
Suga Free is gon be chilling at
I sold my soul for the good
Cause I don't want nobody
Going to my momma house
Telling her I died in the hood
So let me slide to the side
On my tippie toes
And thank my G's
Feel the breeze
And walk my girl on the beach
And have a little lunch
And make a little love
And kiss her body 
And appreciate the tingly bud
And to keep it real man
My freak Angelique
Just turned twenty
But when she was six man
Her daddy was her boyfriend

Chorus

That's right
Know it
I'm out here with it
I see it, know it, gonna tell it
Momma, I appreciate you baby girl
And to my homeboys that's resting in peace
I can't see ya homie
But we still share the same atmosphere
I love ya, I love ya man
Rest in peace dog
Rest

Chorus",Dip Da,1997
Suga Free,"[Chorus: x2]
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennesey because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood

Slide, slide, slippety slide
Because I heard it was a party jumpin' on the Westside
Ride, Dogg, show me your eyes
So I'm a drink this Hennesey and give my head a real drive

Now the rat-tat-tat-tat strapped on my back-back
Nothin' jacked but the cracker playa hater talkin' smack
'Cause the party that I'm headed fo' is oh so deep
And it's a Tony Lang thang so I'm bound to creep

Now Suga Free don't dance, but I'd like to now
And my hoes can't go until my money is right
Now I'm about to get go after I G up from the feet up
And roll this weed up, like ?, speed up with the beat up

And roll. Baby hold that stearin wheel while I roll this indo
Better known as the magic wand, the bomb, the antidote
The twilight smoker, 'fore smoke
As I swerve by the curb on some herb gettin' smoked

Hittin' 16 switches is the life
While your girl send you to players anonymous, I perform like the Macs
I sell her dreams to her like a quiet storm
The only reason why they be worth pennies is to keep her ankle from her

As I tip top out the Cadillac
I see my homie DJ Quik and Tony Lang with that sticky green thang

?? up in a planatary temper high
Tryin' to prevent a player from gettin' his pie, so let me fly

[Chorus]

Sway, as I begin to hit the Chronic I see birds
I'm paranoid but I still want that herb
Somebody ??? cause my cotton mouth is back but I'm feelin' superb
I'm in la-la land and I'm tweaky

I'm in la-la land, but I see these girls freaky
I'm in la-la land, time to start creepin'
One two three, I emerge as a G
The Chronic got my membrane stuck

I'm Suga Free and I don't give a huff
And my eyes are oh so loaded
That I can barely focus in on my folks
Sway, it's reserve, as I tip-toe

Slip and slide to the flow where the ?heatho?
Really though, here we go ho
Foe everytime I look around I see hoes
So many different freaks to be chose

So what you sayin'? What you sayin'?
Spit that game and bust these hoes
?? caught me for a dog, how?
Got you niggas slippin' with this freak in, bow wow

That ? was to, her skirt got hooked, her man got shook
'Cause that's the way it's written down in a players book
To a bitch thinkin' just like blue
Don't let her bounce off me, so we can stick on you

Now if you got a sack of weed say ""Right, right""
Now hold it up and wave it from side to side
'Cause your party ain't a party if you ain't got weed
Woman cloud and contact smoke that I can book breath

Yeah I can feel my heart beat
It's Suga Free, come take this weed from me
And something's wrong, I think I'm sprung, off of that twee.. Suga Free
And I feel so high, my mouth is dry

But I want to fly in the sky and say goodbye as I rise
Seems.. As I take a deep breath from that boo-boo AKA the chronic
Not that boo-bop that you got
Separate mine from yours, fool, I want the pie

That every other bud head do
The certain general has just informed you and I
To inhale and exhale, to breathale my bale well

Them disco lights and that 3rd strike
Cause I'll be damned if I go back to the penn
If I unlock my payroll, with a hoe, and do some time again
Back in the County with my hair gettin' thinner
Because I'm stressin' about my bitch and I wonder who's goin' in her
And I'm knowin' that the tramp ain't shit
But in the LA County Jail I'ma need that bitch
I'm on a roof, up in 95, huh, and I'm broke at that
I'm creepin' on niggas, sweepin'
That's for goin' with that money sac
And G's hittin' niggas up on from where they from
Ready to roll, bustas and marks up out of 95 huh

And I'll be damned if I leave it for a sucka to take
Hey Suga Free, I got some whoop whoop
I'm finna get some whop whop
You know I sold my drop top
On Daytons with them knock-offs
Partner you can straight shake the spot
I see the envy and jealousy in your face
And bump what you got fool

Now I'm on parole in the wind
And your trying to fit in
y'all humpback J

The L-O-you-S suckas make my day

Broke jealous trick

I'm far from broke

You need to look at yourself
Who gave Peaches five hundred for ???
I had a life-long dream
To do just this
In and out of jail
And didn't nobody send me shhh
But I ain't mad witcha
I guess we do what we do
And God Bless Chris, Flower, Dante and little Clue
We gotta make it right
Cause Mr. Gilmore is laughing at us
Killing each other
Over nothing every night
So wake up and recognize
What you fail to see
Cause I'm a black man partner
It was hard for me
Trying to get a job
With a cross tattoo under my left eye
They never called me back in interviews
It was hi and bye

Would you promise not to tell?

And my homegirl Qiana
Bless her soul
Bought me some shoes
I took off them ???
Cause my sacks was through
And moms kicked me out the house
Cause I wasn't paying rent
I got mad for a minute
Now I gots good sense
And me and pops used to go at it
Like every other day
But I apologize 
For all the remarks I used to say
Cause ah
I gots my life where I want it
I met Stan Sheppard, Black Tone, DJ Quik
Now I'm jumping on it
And Black Tone used to buy me clothes
Pay for lawyers and court
So Black Tone's my folks
Unlike some other fools I know
We got a snitch walking round
But I ain't mad at cha
Just don't let me see you
I'ma clown
Cause you smiling in my face
And pat me all on my back
And hate my guts

City to city, lookin' for the dark honies, suckle brown red titties
And bitches, y'all can't play a technique for a trick
Because I speaks softly and carries a big ol' dick

And um, I like the bitches that ain't scared to use they hands
I like the bitches that'd get naked in the back of the van
Yeah, see, see, I paid ya like I'm major
You bitches steadily gettin' over them, niggas, that done paid ya

Or suck my dick, till your taste of snot
Naw, it don't stop, we stays on top

Ah, MGD is the beer for me, that's right
MGD is the brew for me, that's right, yeah

I'm the Q to the U to the I to the K, okay?
Each day, I play my way, that's the fly way
And I'm older than a motherfucker, but they still ask me
For my ID, when I buy MGD, feel me?

'Cause I've got [Incomprehensible] in my family, uh huh
And I've got bitches that's finer than Vanity, hmm
Plus I'm not living above my means, buying Rolexes and rings
Flossing cars that I can't afford, lovin' these bitches and whores

You know, I never broke myself to see no hoe
Never did time, never took no pride in bein' cruised
Don't give a fuck about a pink slip, loose lips, sink ships
Hundred miles at least, when I sign a new lease

I never trick off my fanny with these bitches
You got to be clever, gots to keep your mind on your riches
And stop doin' the things that keep you broke
And keepin' niggaz names in your mouth
That you shouldn't have spoke, no doubt, I'm dope

In this game eight years, some of my peers have moved on
I proceed to succeed, I've stayed within my zone
I'm the baddest motherfucker, yet it's me that you despise
Look within yourself and find out why you wear that dumb disguise

Up in somethin', keep 'em comin', Playa Hamm be the source

Of the force you now witness, and this is just
Another stone in the succession of the nutties I bust
The homies told me don't put no cut on it, keep it raw
If you want 'em bangin', P clique swangin' down the shore

Tricks out here, tryin' to make hits instead of makin it hard hittin'
And perpetratin' frauds when they spittin'
The game is full of twisters and misters quick to do low
Victims of vendettas and busters infraredders, you know

What type of forty it is, when in the presence
Of the G's, pushin' P's, players, we be the essence
For life, it's the JB and pimpin' Carl

Get out, I don't trust your ass, now throw your hands up

Take it to the bump-bump-be-ba-dump
Dip, give me my chips, witchcraft
Now let me see what I can check you with now

Excuse me baby but, didn't I look you in your eyes
And tell you what you was?
Told you somebody sent you, but this here's what a pimp does

Ho, what, you can't see me with it, why, probably 'cause

And subject to make your trick, go get it
