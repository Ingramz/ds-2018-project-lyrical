U-God,"All I hear is gun shots
Can I touch something? 
What the blood claat! 
Niggaz want tical  make it happen
You know my fuckin' style  fuck the rappin'  
We can take it back to eighty five if you want to start actin' like you live 
It's all good, I'm rollin' with my clique  
Owls  Packwoods & Phillies  smokin' sess blunts  mixed with illy 
Got me bustin'  now the whole world looks dusted  
I'm in the area with the skill that never rusted
For real, nigga, touch it & you burn, when will motherfuckers learn 
What be spreadin' like a germ? Ha ha, it's Meth, word
I be that early bird that got the worm & if you check it 
I'm on point, like a fax machine you get the message
It be no question & them bust the second guessin's
Keep your thoughts on your lessons 
What the blood claat! 
To tell the truth, you don't amaze me Killa Hill project
A Star Trek phaser couldn't phase me what
Check the Raderuckus fuck this
Smoke a Dutchmaster, have 'em screamin' for the duchess 
Yeah, I gotta have it, so I strive to stick my piece 
If I don't do it for mydelf, I'm a do it for Kase
'Cause that's my peoples, I'm giving you injections that be Lethal 
Weapon, when niggaz start the half steppin'
Then I get evil. But don't let that negative vibe right there 
Mislead you, I'm humble, a fucking Killer Bee
Far from bumble, I sting you BZT and I bring you 
Thirty-six chambers of head banger, bitch
Why I deal with? I think the mic is on the fritz
Faggot soundmen! They be sabotagin' shit
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Methical, let the whole world know my fuckin' name
What the blood claat!",What the Blood Clot,2008

Yo there's no place to hide as I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
Bam! Aw, man! I, slam, jam, now scream like Tarzan
I be tossing and flossing my style is awesome
I'm causing more Family Feuds than Richard Dawson
And the survey said, you're dead
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fucking head
MZA who was that? Ayo, the Wu is back
Making niggas go Bo! Bo! like I'm Super Cat
Me fear no-one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to the eardrum

Put the needle to the groove I gets rude and I'm forced
To fuck it up, my style carries like a pick-up truck
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shining sea
I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T
Now why try and test, the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state

And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with
Straight from the motherfucking slums that's busted
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with

Hah! Step up, boy!
Represent! Chop his head off, kid!

The Meth will come out tomorrow
Styles, conditions, bizarre, bizarro
Flow, with more afro than Rollo
Coming to a fork in the road which way to go just follow
Meth is the legend, niggas is sleepy hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart coming on through
Niggas is like ""Oh, my God, not you!""
Yes, I, come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor, coming from the RZA
Which is short for the razor who make me reminisce true
Like Deja, Vu! I'm rubber, niggas is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you

U-God,"I was born and raised in the ghetto 
I was born and raised in the ghetto
I was born and raised in the ghetto
Listen to me

Far killed project 18 pound
Put it down that's the model
Regular
I know it's hidden in the gray labs
Visualize the shepherd and the green jets
I'm in the O.V. the cash 
I know it's part of the green bags
Visualize the shepherd and the green jets
Wait until I get on the haters is gonna hate it
And miss young Chris

Brother listen to me
Listen to me
How do you make your pride in the ghetto? 
How do you make your pride in the ghetto? 
How do you make your pride in the ghetto? 

We make pride in the ghetto by selling that cracks
Niggas make pride by busting the gang
Might stick a niggas up making a gap
So dirty bag game but we give them the stacks
Pride game better add to fame
Some sell to weed ain't no joke
Might sell anything as long as we got
So if we are getting that bread will you come for your dope
Raising with a brother might too for the pride
Violate the rolls until your family is
Get bread in the ghetto while we ducking the feds
To the ghetto got to his heads

Brother listen to me
Listen to me
How do you make your pride in the ghetto? 
How do you make your pride in the ghetto? 
How do you make your pride in the ghetto? 

So we ask them stuff them in the black bags
Throw the off the window
Take care the rats in the ghetto
Slap the medal
Fat guys get like
Billed a when the gun

How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
Feed one child and starve another

We like brothers
We came from the same 
Fuck the same horrors
Spread that name on the same wall
If that's what it is
Then that's what it is 
Die just to live 
Show me the competition
Friends got lost",Ghetto,2010
U-God,"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous (yeah, yeah)
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me? (Ayo, ayo)

Ayo, Wu-Tang forever
Who rhyme better?
We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever
R.I.P. O.D.B
Comin' through like Killa Bee
Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93
You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered
Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered
Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender
My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)
Yeah, we live and thorough
Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem, all the way to Maryland
Yeah, we comin' for all of 'em
Bobby Tarantino to the Digital
My shit is pivotal
Smokin' chronic, no medicinal
Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?
The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone

Ayo, Logic, what up?
We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room?
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more K
'Telligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate
Tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronounce-iate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Tea makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
Five-seven MB, yo, metallic green
Seats is piped off
Seize them old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wile out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statement: stop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'

The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs
Puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like the Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
Ill-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy
Hit y'all with their ""Okie-dokie""
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddammit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

Old-school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lacks the principles
Got mo' clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun smokey, Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
We're the unpredictable, torture over your physical
Drop a bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands-off from digital
Me and my lady bark, back when the Planets was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on

It's only Logic, we got 'em mobber than the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty, unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

Survival of the fittest in cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No.9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me, perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in see-saw
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes are two and the same
Nigga get cooked on an open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school
Wu B This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these roots

G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Whole style is mentally strong, the strength of your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, just mellow out
Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning
Regardless, I speak logic, clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)
W.T.C., ah-ha
The faculty
Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move
Nobody slide, you might get hurt

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous

This is my tragic story
Just to break into my heart

나 아직도 너를 지울 수 없어
자꾸자꾸 니가 생각나
니가 너무 보고 싶어
밤새 한숨도 잘 수 없어
내 맘 창문을 두드리는 빗소리
니가 떠나 버린 그자리
너무나도 그리워서
밤새 한숨도 잘 수 없어 난

빗길 비켜 지나가는 너의 뒷 모습
아무 것도 할 수 없는 나는 거듭
해서 매일 난 또 후회를 해 미안해
기도해 I want you to be back
I can't 견딜 수 없어 네가
없는 하루니까 참을 수 없어
눈가에 눈물 흘러 내가
Again 너를 잊을 수 있을까
언제까지 나는 이럴까

나 아직도 너를 지울 수 없어
자꾸자꾸 니가 생각나
니가 너무 보고 싶어
밤새 한숨도 잘 수 없어
내 맘 창문을 두드리는 빗소리
니가 떠나 버린 그자리
너무나도 그리워서
밤새 한숨도 잘 수 없어 난

밤새 너만 생각해 나는 잘 수 없어 (오 이런 오늘밤도)
Why did I turn on this love show (오늘밤도)
너와 나의 사인 멀어졌어
내가 이 사랑의 하인이었어
Why did we fight
우린 왜 이랬는데
Did you lose the sight
우린 사랑했는데
내가 왜 이 순간 멈춰 있는데
바보야 내가 필요한 건 바로 너야

어깨가 축 늘어져 있는 너
한숨만 땅 꺼지게 쉬는 너
답답한 가슴만 탕탕 치는 너
두손 모아 하늘에게 기도 하는 너
일거라고 모습이 나는 상상이 가
우리 다 잊자 지우자 나쁜 기억을 다
I'm sorry
너가 어떨지 알아
미안하단 말 밖에 할 수 없는 나

나 아직도 너를 지울 수 없어
자꾸자꾸 니가 생각나
니가 너무 보고 싶어
밤새 한숨도 잘 수 없어
내맘 창문을 두드리는 빗소리
니가 떠나 버린 그자리
너무나도 그리워서
밤새 한숨도 잘 수 없어 난

오 이런 오늘밤도 오늘밤도 oh

You and I 우리의 끈 놓지마
Don't deny our all square fly
내게 와 이제 다 괜찮아
다시 다시 다 모든걸 시작하는 거야

밤새 한숨도 잘 수 없어

나 아직도 너를 지울 수 없어
자꾸자꾸 니가 생각나
니가 너무 보고 싶어
밤새 한숨도 잘 수 없어

니가 떠나 버린 그자리

Some do iniquity for it
It makes friends, it break friends

Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.

Give us a wink and make me think of you",Lovely Rita,2009

No company take-overs - stock markets high
No more hand-jobs in the boardroom - sex is history
And no saunas, no jacuzzis - the penalties you'll reap

Messed big time everywhere - double-dealing lies

He's going down on his bad luck - his just deserts
He's going down on his bad luck - what he deserved

His old man told him always - listen son
It's a two-way street to fortune - you gotta hit and run
Don't forget the mirror - look who's behind
And don't you come up crying - when it's faster coming down

U.N.L.V. Jazz Ensemble,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1991
U.N.L.V. Jazz Ensemble,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996
U.N.L.V. Jazz Ensemble,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, Julie baby, you're my flame

Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy-o don't you dare

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle

What a lovely way to burn

That's why that's why the lady
That's why, that's why the lady is a tramp
Tramp
Hm, ooh

She gets too hungry for, dinner at eight, now
Hates the theatre but, never comes late
She never bothers, with the people she hates
That's why, that's why the lady is tramp

Don't go to crap games, with the barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermines and pearls
She won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why, that's why the lady is a tramp
She loves the free, fresh, wind, in her hair
Life without care
She's broke, and that's ok
Hates California, it's so smuggy and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp, now

She gets massages, she cries and she moans
Tells Slenderella just to leave her alone
She's not so hot, but her shape is her own
That's why, that's why the lady is a tramp
The food at Sardees is great no doubt
But she doesn't know what, motels all about
She puts in a dime, and some ice comes out
That's why the lady is a tramp

She loves the free fresh wind in her face
Diamonds and lace
No God, so what
For Rod Steiger she whistles and stamps
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
She don't know the reason for, cocktails at five
She don't like flyin' baby, but I'm glad I'm alive
I crave affection baby but not when I drive
That's why the lady is a tramp, now

She flew down to London and left me behind
I missed the crowning but, I didn't mind
She won't play Scarlet and Gone with the Wind
(It's got to rhyme)
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
I like to hang her hat, wherever I please
And fly, with a breeze
And no dough, hi ho
She thinks that Marciano was still a great big champ
That's why the lady is a tramp, now

She goes down to Coney and she thinks the beach is divine
She goes to the ball games and thinks the Yankees are fine
Why she reads Walter Winchell and understands every line
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
She likes do to go rowing down Central Park Lake
She digs a price fight, that isn't fake
Why she even goes to the opera, and stays wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp, now
I like the green grass, under my shoes
Now what can I lose
She's flat, and that's that
She's all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady, that's why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp",The Lady Is a Tramp,2004

U.S. Air Force Band & Singing Sergeants,"O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,
’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion
A home and a Country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation!
Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land
Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,” 
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.","The Star-Spangled Banner (National Anthem, USA), for orchestra & voice/chor",1999

U.S. Girls,"You've been sleeping with one eye open
'Cause he always could come back, ya know?
And you've been walking these streets unguarded
Waiting for any man to explode
You spend hours in the mirror hating
But you can get that power, too
It's not you, it's them
You should get it too, you should get it too
'Cause they always could come back, ya know?

It's all just friction
But don't forget the revenge
Act like you got some velvet for sale
Then you destroy their hope for deliverance
Don't offer no reason
Instill in them the fear that comes with being prey

Now watch me holding it one-handed
Sideways trusting in that clip
The cock and pull will get the ol' boys dancing
Then she said, ""the recoil is the celebration
The blood like oil spilling on the floor
This'll surely feel against your nature
But girl, you gotta move on
Guarantee at least one bullet goes behind the eyes
'Cause they always could come back for more""

U.S. Girls,"He left me alone completely
For once I slept deeply
And for this, I thank the father
But I gotta tell you something that you don't wanna hear
It's the truth and that's never easy to hear
But my new man, well he ain't that bad
And let me explain to you why

I do what I want
And I do what I like
Left my hometown to lie about what no one saw
But I soon found out
I can't expand on my own theme
I needed a partner
To creep in and feel his steed
Life made no sense without a beating, you see?
And life was just too quiet
With no one screaming at me
And then the incidental boogie
Grabbed a hold of me
And I got myself a real man
Who don't hit that hard
So I can still work at my job (doing for me)

Wonder what this incidental boogie's really doing for me
I'm no closer to free
I'm no closer to free

Wonder what this incidental boogie's really doing for me

I still do what I want
And I still do what I like
But now, I got this man to show me that I'm all wrong
He hits me left, he hits me right
All the time, but no marks
No marks, no evidence to see
Don't you know these days I feel so lucky?
To be brutalized means you don't have to think
And life is easy when there is only pain to compete, life is easy

Wonder what this incidental boogie's really doing for me

My lover has no heart
Magic moving blood around that body
He's cool to the touch
I don't see him much
But when I do, he does nothing for me
Persona-driven pleasure
And that's how he gets around
He placed me right before the fire
But I didn't want to
I knew how quickly my skin would burn

Fire on stone versus fire on flesh
My lover wins the contest
Can you imagine trying to get
Some satisfaction out of a stone?
One would have to wait their whole life and
I resent you for that
A swing and a miss
I weighed all the risks
When I agreed to this charade in the night

My lover, the time has come
I hate to break it to you in this way
Don't ask me
Stop snooping around
Spare me any talk of your future life
I don't know what I'll do without you
Take up worship at some mile's end?
But you said betrayal and pride
And then you took your time
And now I gotta spell it out for you

O, I'll only say this once
V, I'm very sensitive
E, everything's a mess
R, I'm repenting that L 'cause, 'cause it's over

Early is early, late is late
My lover, I got no faith

U.S. Girls,"I was standing at the Pearly Gates
I was looking for a man of faith
I had questions pressing on me more than not
I was looking for some answers on the spot, ah

Two girls walked in, paperwork in hand
They were tanned from the trip
They'd seen the judge, he'd heard 'em out
Wasn't lookin' good, wasn't lookin' good for us
What about us?

But like some roadside vet with a bag in hand
I could do anything St. Peter asked
For one chance to be an angel in his eyes
It seemed to be the safe bet, so I closed my eyes
And I opened my gates wide
And St. Peter came inside

""Never, never be safe even if you're in the gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter
Never, never be safe even if you're in the gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter""

I promise, this is not a rumor
I asked for nothing but to stop it short
I guess he didn't hear a word I said
And after he acted as if I hadn't been in his bed
I was definitely in his bed

But Peter bragged he was good at pulling out
He always knew the right time to take a bow
He practiced it every single night
It hadn't failed him yet
He'd been doing it a long, long time
And Peter just does whatever Peter likes

""Never, never be safe even if you're in the gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter
Never, never be safe even if you're in the gates
Give it up, you're just some man's daughter""

While you're looking at your phone
They snuck it in the room
Planted it and then it bloomed

U.S. Girls,"It was the rage of plastics, I was twenty-four
I was doing my time on the dance floor
It was all polyester and leopard print
And Fabergé coming off the ladies
You know it's a blight to the brightest how our designs unseam
Like the back side of some skirt in some old man's dream
I got caught putting off all my traveling plans for this refinery job and his maybes
With hair in ribbons, stockings in runs
Fashion bricks out of the breaks as they come
Land goes for less downwind of the plant
There's no telling how long you'll be paying

There are scores of us born in the silent spring
Whose wombs won't take, won't bear anything
He had want for a daughter, and I had want for a son
Now I rock my moon-faced man like one
Was it the river on fire that made us what we became?
Was it the cup that we drank from, or what it contained?
Does it move to the beat of the oil drum
Or flow out of our eyes as we're wailing?
And I see it rise in ribbons to the clouds overhung
Just to spit back down on everyone
Land goes for less downwind of the plant
There's no telling how long you'll be paying

I have tried to be patient as I've been made nurse
Get some help from the perks of my devotion's curse
And I know, yeah, I know the man's pain is much worse
For the moon and his grace are now waning
You say the first one now will later be last
My faith in scripture has come to pass
Now I won't play dumb, I'm done trying to sweeten this load
And you give me a ribbon, you tell me to run
To land my legs to your narcissist fund
But land still goes for less downwind of the plant
Making this living just brings about dying

I got a rage of plastics, the refinery floor
I got a rage of plastics, got nothing more
Now I won't play dumb and I'm done lying

Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo.""
I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body.""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but be back by 8

Kangol don't know if she want me or my money
So I'm bein' picky, cause I ain't sure
And I'm livin' a life you might call insecure

I want a nice individualistic that's not materialistic
Not bein' egotistic, ???I decide consentualistic???
The body artistic, a little bit of lipstick
Those the type of girls that make the Doc lovesick

Well, I'm definitely a lover, hard when I'm undercover
I'll do kinky things to you if you swear not to tell your mother
I'll push, but I won't shove ya, as long as I'm above ya
When I leave just promise me, ""Kangol ???? I love ya""

I want a girl with action, 'control' like Janet Jackson
I hate the dark, I'm on the light so I can see reaction
Against all relaxin', prepare for steady waxin'
When you leave you must pay E for what?  Satisfaction

[Chorus]

Tired of these girls tryin' to play the role
Every time I see em, they're on a stroll
Teasin' the fellas, wearin' tight pants
Leadin' us on after a slow dance
But in search of love that's how I'm livin'
I want a girl to give me the same thing that I am givin'
To her, from now till the day I depart
But she's got to be a redbone, a beautiful work of art
That is the way this pisces views
Like Gigi Williams on the Eye-Witness News
I hate a girl that knows every guy
Before you introduce, he already says hi
I feel like punchin' her dead in the grill
But that's ill, so Doc just chills
'Cause if it's meant to happen, that's how it'll be

She wants to be with me and I know this for sure
I can tell as soon as she walks through the door
Swings and sways and shakes her stuff like Jello
Waitin' for EMD to say hello
Skin-tight clothing with everything left hangin'
And all the boys admit that she's well worth bangin'
She only talks the talk, never walks the walk
She must be the most ???? up in all New York
Acts like an angel, pretends that she's a saint
A least that's the pretty picture she would love to paint
She's extraordinary, definitely rare
And anyway you want me, baby, I'll be there
I make you feel 'protect', fill you with bliss
'Send a chill up' your body with just one kiss
But if you don't show, I won't be stunned
Give your mother my number, I know she'll come

[Chorus]

I want a girl that'll turn me on
When I say 'go', I want to hear her say 'gone'
When I say 'leave', I want to hear her say 'left'
And if I say 'was it good', she better say 'def'
'Cause that's the kinda girl that I am lookin' for
I really don't think there are anymore
But if one appears one day
I walk up to her and gently say

I've been starin' at you a while
And every time you see me starin' you crack a smile
You cold want to be with me, it's true
If you didn't, I wouldn't be next to you
So please stop perpetrating
Girl, I'm tired of waiting
For you to hurry up and make your so-called move
That you been talkin' about makin', girl, show and prove
There's really no need to talk about it
You know what I want, so what about it?
We can either go fast or slow
Cause I'll be in and out before you know
You say you're resisting
But yet you're still kissing
Everybody know that I been wantin' you to kiss
Hey girl, here's a spot you missed

So cold",Ya Cold Wanna Be With Me,1995
U.T.F.O.,"You want to ride?

I got a ride

Hey girl, just imagine me and you, along the road
Switchin from silent gear to a moany mode
All you gonna hear is that's the motor, of course
(But don't let it get hot, or you'll feel the force 
Hello, my name is Kangol Kid (You can call him Kangol, if you choose)
I'm Dr. Ice (How can you tell?) You can tell by the mous'
And I'm the Educated Rapper (The brainiac
And Mixmaster) woo-hah (The four is back)
Individually speakin', though I'm speakin' for the crew
We all have rides, I hope you fellas do too
Mine is very powerful, yes, this is true
Mine can do tricks (What can yours do?)
Mine won't disagree with me, it's never frontin'
All I gotta say is: ""Yo, let's go skeezer huntin'!""
After those command my ride will stand
Taller and prouder than any man
Crashin' through vicious, on wet roads even
In other words, it's (Skeezin season!)
And brakes of course for my protection
So I don't waste my fuel injection
I'm makin' it clear, the way I steer
I'll reach my destination (Ah, I'm here)

I got a ride 
I got a ride, and you can look inside
And if I ever die, I want to die with my ride
I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
You want to know why? Well, because

It only takes one passenger when it's hot
Unless I want to share it, okay, why not?
Just imagine a volcano when it's bound to erupt
(You want to ride?) Come on girl, hurry up
Tell your mother where you're goin', and don't forget
If your mother want to come, tell your pops: ""Don't fret""
If he wants you home soon, tell him that's insane
(And if he says: ""Picture that"") consider it framed
(I got a ride) As if you didn't know
And if I catch a flat, girl, give me a blow
'Cause I don't carry spares, cause spares, they cost
And plus my nuts are too hard to come off
(You dig it?)
You see, my ride is not a stretch-limo Cadillac
To tell the truth, I think my ride is much longer than that
So if you ever see my ride, girl, face to face
I doubt that it'll fit in your parking space
But I'll (push) if you want to (push) if I gotta
And we can even (push) for the hell, why nada?
It's lovable and huggable and bendable
I won't sell it to ya, baby, but it's rentable
And if you're wonderin' why, I'll tell you what for
(They don't make rides like this no more)

I got a ride
I got a ride, and you can look inside
And if I ever die, I want to die with my ride
I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
You want to know why? Well, because

You see my ride 
A lotta fuel you give it, premium or regular
Any kind of fluid from a female etcetera
Four-wheel drive, so I can get there in a giffy
And turbo-jogs in case I'm lookin' for a quickie
But the tighter the roads, the harder I'll pursue
And my goal in my life with my ride is to shoot
For the finish line, so I can get there quick
Ask Bobby, Jimmy, Jack, or you can even ask (Dick)
You can even ask my mechanic
When she saw my ride, she didn't panic
You see, I got garages all over these parts
So I can park the ride whenever it gets dark
I got a sunroof, so wide, you can't miss it
Before I stick my head out, I gotta unzip it
Hey yo, I never got a ticket, if I do one day
They'll have a hard time towin' this baby away

U2,"And you know it's time to go
Through the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning

And you hunger for the time
Time to heal, desire, time
And your earth moves beneath
Your own dream landscape

Oh, oh, oh
On borderland we run

I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight
A high road
A high road out from here

The city walls are all come down
The dust, a smoke screen all around
See faces ploughed like fields that once
Gave no resistance

And we live by the side of the road
On the side of a hill
As the valley explode
Dislocated, suffocated
The land grows weary of its own

Oh come away, oh come away, oh come away, I say I
Oh come away, come away, oh come, oh come away, I say I

I'll be there tonight, I believe
I'll be there so high
I'll be there tonight, tonight

Oh come away, I say, I say oh
Oh come away, I say

The wind will crack in winter time
This bomb-blast lightning waltz
No spoken words, just a scream

Oh
Oh

Tonight we'll build a bridge
Across the sea and land
See the sky, the burning rain
She will die and live again
Tonight

Through the alleys of a quiet city street
You take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into a saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside is America
Outside is America, America

To drive the dreams he had away

A dog started crying
Like a broken hearted man
At the howling wind

He went deeper into black
Deeper into white
Could see the stars shining
Like nails in the night
He felt the healing
Healing, healing

Hand in the pocket
Finger on the steel
The pistol weighed heavy

Right about the time a friend of ours, Little Steven
Was putting together a record of artists against apartheids
It's a song written about a man in a shanty town outside of Johannesburg
A man who's sick of looking down the barrel of white South Africa
A man who is at the point where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor
A man who has lost faith in the peace makers of the West
While they argue and while they fail to support a man like Bishop Tutu
And his request for economic sanctions against South Africa

And sons turn their fathers in

But they don't want God in it

I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name

I went with nothing

Looking for you

I went out there
In search of experience
To taste and to touch
And to feel as much
As a man can
Before he repents

I went out searching
Looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking
With a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon

Told her I'd be back by noon

Burning inside of me

No colors anymore
I want them to turn black

Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back

I people turn their heads
And quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens everyday

I look inside myself
See my heart is black
I see my red door
And I wanna paint it black

Maybe then I'll fade away
Not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black

No more will my green sea
Will turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you

If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes

Want to see it painted
Painted black, black as night
Want to see it painted
Painted black, black as coal

Except you
You were talking about the end of the world

I took the money
I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You lead me on with those innocent eyes
You know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart

You were acting like it was the end of the world

A time to turn your eyes away
Is there a time for keeping your head down
For getting on with your day

Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
A time for curling hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear

Here she comes, oh oh
Heads turn around
Here she comes
To take her crown

Is there a time to run for cover
A time for kiss and tell
Is there a time for different colors
Different names you find it hard to spell

Is there a time for first communion
A time for East Seventeen
Is there a time to turn to Mecca
Is there time to be a beauty queen

Here she comes

You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
You don't smoke, don't even want to

Your wheels are turning but you're upside down
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
Is that what it is

Red lights, gray morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip sync to the talk shows

And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

If I could stay
Then the night would give you up
Stay and the day would keep its trust
Stay and the night would be enough

Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere
Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and Berlin

And if you listen I can't call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout, I'll only hear you

If I could stay
Then the night would give you up
Stay then the day would keep its trust
Stay with the demons you drowned
Stay with the spirit I found
Stay and the night would be enough

Take the scent hanging in the air
Take this tangle of a conversation

With my nails under your hide
With my teeth at your back
And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies

I never listened to you anyway

Greedy for the good things as well as the bad

In the queue for the lifeboat

He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

[Chorus]

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

[Chorus]

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

[Chorus]

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

A time to turn your eyes away

A time for curling hair

To find the right dress to wear

Here she comes, oh oh
Heads turn around
Here she comes
To take her crown

Is there a time to run for cover
A time for kiss and tell
Is there a time for different colors
Different names you find it hard to spell

Is there a time for first communion
A time for East Seventeen
Is there a time to turn to Mecca
Is there time to be a beauty queen

Here she comes

The land was flat, the highway straight and wide
My brother and I, we'd drive for hours, like we'd years instead of days
Our faces as pale as the dirty snow

Once I knew there was a love divine
Then came a time I thought it knew me not
Who can forgive forgiveness when forgiveness is not?
Only the land as white as snow

And the water it was icy
As it washed over me
And the moon shined above me
Now this dry ground it bears no fruit at all
Only poppies laugh under the crescent moon
The road refuses strangers
The land the seeds we sow
Where might we find the lamb as white as snow

As boys we would go hunting in the woods
To sleep, the night shun out the stars
Now the wolves are every passing stranger
Every face we cannot know

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah, let me see you
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry

Anger and no one can heal it
Shoves a little bump into the momentum
It's just a little lump
But you feel it
In the creases and the shadows
With a rattling deep emotion
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean

Yes boss, the government handshake
Yes boss, the crusher of language
Yes boss, Mr. Stillwater
The face at the edge of the banquet
The cool, the cool river
The cool, the cool river

I believe in the future
I may live in my car
My radio tuned to
The voice of a star
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm
And these old hopes and fears
Still at my side

Anger and no one can heal it
Slides through the metal detector
Lives like a mole in a motel
A slide in a slide projector
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean
The rage of love turns inward
To prayers of devotion
And these prayers are
The constant road across the wilderness
These prayers are
These prayers are the memory of God
The memory of God

And I believe in the future
We shall suffer no more
Maybe not in my lifetime
But in yours I feel sure
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm
And these streets
Quiet as a sleeping army
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven
For the mother's restless son
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior
Who denies his urge to break and run

Who says: Hard times?
I'm used to them
The speeding planet burns
I'm used to that
My life's so common it disappears
And sometimes even music
Cannot substitute for tears","The Cool, Cool River",2013

That you discover accidentally
Who falls against you gently
As a pickpocket
Brushes your thigh

The spinning darkness of her hair
A conversation in a crowded room going nowhere
The open palm of desire
Wants everything

Am I crazy

And says baby don't cry

But I say why
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

These days are ours
These tears are free

I've been waking up at sunrise
I've been following the light across my room
I watch the night receive the room of my day
Some people say the sky is just the sky
But I say
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

Sonny sits by the window and thinks to himself
How it's strange that some roots are like cages
Sonny's yearbook from high school
Is down on the shelf
And he idle thumbs through the pages
Some have died
Some have fled from themselves
Or struggled from here to get there
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
Runs his hands through his thinning brown hair
I'm accustomed to a smoother ride
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep the night
Some people say a lie is just a lie
But I say
The cross is in the ballpark
Why deny the obvious child?",The Obvious Child,2013

It's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts

Whenever you believe that
You'll be lost and love will find you
When the road bends
And the song ends

Inside my chest, but she

She jumps back

Abandoned, forsaken
In her cold coffee eyes

She can't sleep now

She fights a fever

Down in the maroon light

As near to love as love will ever beâ??

Uakti,"We sailed up a river wide as a sea
And slept on the banks
On the leaves of a banyan tree

When the world was young
And all of these spirit voices rule the night

To the brujo's door
Along a path of river stone

Seated on the floor
We join the fevers
And the broken bones

The falcon calls
A lime-green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall
And all of these spirit voices
Sing rainwater, sea water
River water, holy water
Wrap this child in mercy â?? heal her
Heaven's only daughter
All of these spirit voices rule the night

My feet were lead
I drank a cup of herbal brew

Combined with the lightness in my head
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo

Seed you, plead with you
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma

That was the chance I took
The more I searched
The more I shook for Thelma

A thirsty dreamless sleep released me
And I reached for the phone by the side of the bed

She's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught
People aware of my history
Trying to steer you away from me
I left a message at your hotel

We are time zones and oceans apart
The words I speak in the middle of my night
Fall on your yesterday's heart

If the wind don't break
If the clock don't jump off the wall
Thelma, my darlin', I will cushion your fall

I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
Without the taste of your sweet love, Thelma
I am only a man who skirted the edge of despair

UB,"[Intro: spoken by Big Rube]
Optimism, about the fate of the people
That have accepted the mission improbable
To become simpartical, purged by discourage of sufferin
Anger, hate, vengeance and war

It's tough to explain, debate, lament or explore
But I'll die straight to the core
In an implosion of introspection so quiet it can deafen you
Yet breathe breath into the singed lungs of the most temper thug

Tears of bull get dismembered and drug through the mud
With a point from the head of a heavyweight
From the cold detailed reality of hot graphite
Missing meat in a butcher trap

To the grandios flights of fancy from the abstract mind
Of a hip-hop super nerd, as long as the truth is heard
The truth must be spoken
My youth has been smokin and drinkin, drinkin and smokin

A life that to most may seem dream like
But rarely are things what they seem like
We ain't tight 'less why'all tight
Might bless me in all type, but it's all wrong

The goal is for all thrones to be sat upon by true kings
All pretenders must fall into the fathoms of their own character flaws
But as long as we attempt to fool ourselves, we are not yet free

All at once, say it, Bubba K now
I'm headed out west today, on the Greyhound
Sittin' in the back on top but close to 8 pounds
Huntin' for an innocent town that I can shake down

Past the Mississipp' by swimmin the Great Lakes now
Made it this far but still I can't escape how
The law ran in, back, in the A-town
All I'm worth is all that they ain't found

My brother in Denver used to do is sell dirt
Made it through him, I can move a little work
In Wichita, I produce a little smirk
Stop at Wal*Mart, new shoes and a shirt

Tried to call momma, shit she denied the call
Seems she don't smoke the shit I provide for why'all
Tried to doze off with PM Tylenol
Just moved to Q.P. and still I can't smile at all

With a pound of buffalo nicks that you can swallow
Only thing I'm holdin is pain that you can borrow
Plus a whole pocket of change, for your sorrows

My bones are glowing through my skin  
When I look up into black skies  
Mushrooms grow before my eyes  
Doctor save me if you can  
I'm a desperate man 
I'm a desperate man   
  
As he lay thinking he was dead  
A burning pain short through his head  
He looked into those tired old eyes  
Heard forty years of anguished cries  
And this doctor said  

Your eyes were open  
But you shut them with your mouth  
You always heard  
But you weren't doing the screaming  
You'd only just woken  
But Already, you'd forgotten,  
What you were dreaming

Step 5, Is to repent and beg forgiveness for your wrongs
Cause the wrath of Jah is clear to see in Revelation
So make up mind if you want to go to Heaven or Hell
Step 6, Oh yes there's more the King Step carries on
It carries on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
Step 6, is once you know the truth to pass the message on
And do the King Step daily as you trod upon Jah land

Left right eternal life for the man that tries his very best
Left right do bad and you'll go down in the pit that's bottomless
Left right Pato Banton has now come to preach the right
Left right left right me no partial if your black or if your white
Left right well now me know how fe do the king step
Me just can not keep it a secret
So right ya now you a get
The king step the king step the king step

Step 1, we all should know that there's one god and only one
Step 2, Is give him praises for this whole creation
Step 3, Is love your brother man cause you and him is one
Step 4, Is not to make the same mistake as Soloman
Step 5, Is to repent and beg forgiveness for your wrongs
Cause the wrath of Jah is clear to see in Revelation
So make up mind if you want to go to Heaven or Hell
Step 6, Oh yes there's more the King Step carries on
It carries on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
Step 6, is once you know the truth to pass the message on
And do the King Step daily as you trod upon Jah land
So when the right time comes for Babylon's destruction
You'll be among the few to march towards mount Zion

Before it's earned our money's always spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe, I got you babe, I got you, Babe.

I got flowers in the spring
I got you, you wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared you're always around
And then they say your hair's too long
But I don't care, with you I can't do wrong
Then put your warm little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe, I got you babe, I got you, Babe.

I got you to hold my
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you I won't let go
I got you who loves me so

C'est La Vie 

A woman came and said to me 
Now listen very carefully 
There's brother killing brother 
People living on their knees 
Biting sugar coated bullets 
For the pain of this disease 
C'est La Vie 

A woman came and said to me 
She had a husband on an island 
Found his body on a wasteland 
Soldiers came and took him 
Just to torture her you see
C'est la vie 
All alone she mourned her lover 
Crossed the sea to find a brother 
Maybe he could help her get her baby back for free

Don't you worry yourself my dear
It's a long long way from here

Drought and famine in TV land
Read the Sunday papers credit card ina your hand
Sing your song of freedom just to ease your troubled mind
And save your guilty pennies for the ones you leave behind

The burden that you carry from the cradle to the grave
Is like a badge of honor that you wear upon your sleeve
You make your contribution and you shed a little tear
And stage your celebration just to show how much you care

You obscure your stolen power with hypocrisy and lies
Your talk of understanding is a wafer thin disguise
You glorify my image but deny me flesh and blood
You radiate with goodness when you here me beg for food

Those rivers of blood will flow again
Someone changed the lyrics but the song remains the same
You can build a wall of protocol to keep the wolves at bay
But history dictates that someone has to pay

With nothing more than simple words, so I can say

Arriving home to always find

I love it when you smile  
When you're with me honey  
It happens all the while  
How it kills me when you cry  
And you know my heart  
That's no word of a lie  

Everyday you show me something new about you  
Honestly I could never live without you  
Look at me here's a soul who'll never doubt you  
And I will be forever by your side  

[Chorus]

Probably the greatest feeling I have ever known  
Actually is when you wrap yourself around me  
Promise me you'll stay now that I've found you  
And I will be forever by your side  

[Chorus] 

And you could say you've heard it all before  
And I know that any day you may walk out the door  
When I say no one will love you more believe me  
And I will be forever by your side

How I feel right now  
I would if I could

Just give me some time  
And I'll come around  
I'll pick myself up  
I'll dust myself down  

Let's leave it at that  
I don't want to fight  
Don't say anything that you may regret  
In fact, it's the last thing I need tonight

But you left it a little to late

Take the man in the white cloak
A pointed mask to hide his face
Murders in the name of religion
If you're not the right colour or race.
Take the man in the black cloak
He's holding justice in his hands,
Lets the man in the white cloak go,
Calls it the law of the land.

Fired by ignorant reaction,

I gotta tell someone,can anyone hear me 
The girl of my dreams told me that she loves me 
She whispered & I was consumed so completely 
Lost in the love that I feel whenever she's near me

Staring at stars getting high on her kissing 
Now I got my girl, my girl got me 
We're making plans for a family

Nothing come between us or get in our way 
This is for real the really big deal

The clean-up starts Monday despite the bomb blasts

And Uncle Sam's poodle's in need of a shrink

The war is all over but it would appear

But you make the blunder

With their souls like rolling thunder

There's always some pretention

Why do we lose so many tears?
Oh, so you go again

You take a piece of me with you
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free

They'll be long gone by the time the sun has risen,

Flash at the edge of your sight

More than all the noise

Overheated heart head over heels
Treating it so hard the spurting feels every day, every night

Down on my knees, God help me please

Could hear the sound of people making love

I surrender right now
I've to be touched

Udo Jürgens,"Weißt du wieviel Sterne stehen
Und wohin die Flüsse gehen?
Sag', warum der Regen fällt
Wo ist das Ende dieser Welt?

Was war hier vor tausend Jahren?
Warum können Räder fahren?
Sind Wolken schneller als der Wind?
So viele Fragen hat ein Kind

Ach Kind, komm' lass die Fragereien

Und woher kam die Gier nach Geld?
Wie kommt der Hunger auf die Welt?

Warum kommt jemand in Verdacht
Nur weil er sich Gedanken macht?
Ist man noch frei, wenn man nichts wagt
Ja, was ein junger Mensch so fragt

He, junges Volk, was soll denn das?
Und leistet ihr doch erst mal was
Ihr werdet auch noch mal gescheit

Das hübsche Spiel vom Overkill
Und wann macht ihr die Waffen scharf?

Sie schlug die Augen zu mir auf und sagte dann
„Du bist der schönste Mann, der jemals für mich da war

Nichts wird vertagt

Ich weiß
Was ich will

Wie ein Zigeuner durch die Welt mit dir ziehen
Dem ganzen Zirkus dieses Daseins entfliehen
Und alles das
Bis uns die Sinne vergehen
Wär das nicht schön?

Ich weiß
was ich will

Dass jede Nacht für uns zum Karneval wird
Und jeder Weg nur zueinander uns führt
