Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Say Aha, Aha
Say Aha, aha

At night it's eating up your head,
Backed against the wall
Got you in a tight place
Though you're not alone at all
Been fighting, trying to place a name on what it's called
Make you feel like a losing streak cause you know
But you're not involved

Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Say Aha, Aha
Say Aha, aha

It's alright, cause everything they say
Doesn't make no sense
It's that time
I'm picking up my ass
Up from off the fence
Gonna blow a hole in this charade
It's self defense
I'm a army got a whole brigade in my two sense

Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Louder than they
Louder than they
Louder than they
Allow, allow
Say Aha, Aha
Say Aha, aha

Oh
Send in your torpedoes for all they know
Make a show, shake them up before you blow
Cause they don't want no cure
No, you'd better find a way
Their aims not pure

Louder than they

Santigold,"Do it again
And I'll see you tomorrow
I want to get it
You've got something to borrow

Can't make it feel right on my own
That's when I turn you on again
I buy it but it don't measure up
What is the missed ingredient

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

Under the skin
It's not so easy to swallow
Don't reel me in
To find my dreams are so hollow
What is it you got I don't get
I watch you fumbling again
Look dreamy behind your cigarette
Know it ain't true now

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

We all find you easy so amuse us
Don't get too heady you might abuse luck
You're starstruck

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away",Starstruck,2008

I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie

0-0-7 Mission and it's just one day
I marked my position then I ran away
Got these boots made for walking and some pepper spray
My two guns in my pocket cause it's brick today
I said hey Mrs. Parker
Can I get your spot
The block too hot
No parking spots
The joker cops they ticket take my cash
The boys on the block
Got eyes for my ass

[Chorus]

Last stop Franklin smell it makes me sick
Got my street vision on I don't see shit
And still I stay fresh I spend the top dollar
Cause on my block the knockoffs are fiyah
Meet me at the J where they got the Domino game locked
Boy cross the street with tight pants
Your hipster ass on down to the Beacon
I fly right past him, don't take my mask off

[Chorus]

I got the talk
The beats and bass
Give me one I'll take it
Make you lose your place,
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you can't stop me
In this ra-race

Santigold,"Go Ahead, you know you want it
You'll have no other way
You just want to take us down
Go ahead,
I'll be the one hit
If I can take you, boy, it just might throw this town
Oh, you want to get it
You make us bleed, it'll prove there's life somewhere
And oh, no, I want to yell it
But do we speak or are we just nodding our heads
No way, not me, what you got,
It's not for me, but you'll find a way
No way not me, what you got,
It's not for me

Don't reach too far
You will fall over
Don't be surprised what you discover
Don't fear your call
Can't pull us under
You better watch out, run for cover

We see right through it
You get what you give, you get what you give

Go ahead
I'll be your junkie
I'll be deplete you can heap all rubbish here
Go ahead, now dump it on me
If I go quiet will the itch go down with me
Oh, you got to get it
Never mind that it was never there nowhere
But oh, no, not for a minute
For now you'll make your bed
And it will wait, I swear

No way, not me, what you got,
It's not for me, but you'll find a way
No way not me, what you got,
It's not for me

Santigold,"Motherfucker. You motherfuckers!

Keith Murray flips the undergroup cut dope funk flow chromotose
So listen close
I'm like the undertaker turning rappers into ghosts
Host and roast MC's like I'm suppose
I can send L.O.D. to bust caps perhaps
Bring E and Red and we can kick some raps
This track is so sickenin' and bouncin'
Make you nod your head so much you need counciling
I flow to a rough kind of mode
Competition run for cover cause I'm droppin' loads
No brainer crossing over in the Range Rover
Insainer pack heat like a super nova
Keith Murray gets it on and poppin'
Shut it down like administrative lockin'
Marble face poetry poverty hard
Perform like the ?
We went from allies to enemies
Stingin' like centipedes
Sit around and watch death come in threes
I burn like lye
Gruesome like Faces Of Death parts 1,2,3,4 and 5

Everyday I got a new style hatchin'
This is more than rappin' this is media hyjackin'
""As long as I'm alive I'm a keep the vibe
24-7 365""

I'm a leader without affair
Soldier without a past
Come around here frontin' and we gonna splash your ass
And you feelin' me you drillin' me with maximum intensity
Intentionally that's how it's suppose to be
Spectacular monster rap or slasher
At the nightfall I'm after ya like Blackula
I rap with a Blackenstein frame of mind
Aircraft fly when I use to push my braids to the side
Slide from Keith Jekyle to Murray Hyde
My battle cry make niggas wanna just lay down and die
It's imparitive that you feel the heritage I provide
Comin' courtesy but with no Jive
? freaka, conversatin' through frequent modulations out digital speakers
I make you give it all you got don't stop for a breather
Turn a rap aethesist into a Def Squad believer
Yo Keith Murray can't be touched
http://www.elyricsworld.com/soldier_lyrics_n.e.r.d..html
Plus girls jump in my flow like double dutch
What

Everyday I got a new style hatchin'
This is more than rappin' this is media hyjackin'
""As long as I'm alive I'm a keep the vibe
24-7 365""

You went from a full course meal to a half chicken wing
Girl you gotta grow up if you wanna do your thing
You can't make me or break me but hate me greatly
Call me on my birthday to try to aggrivate me
Cause when I rock I got all the girls with me
Got niggas bouncin' off the wall like spider monkey
Bury the hatchet in the back of anybody tryin' to match it
It's the vulture new fulture gonna scratch it while you catch it
There's a hole in the bucket there lies a
Nigga dead and stinkin'
For sittin' around with his ass stinkin'
Flamboyant undunted most wanted
Those that don't understand it better get up on it God damn it
The life of the party order hits like John Gotti
But shhh that's on the low don't tell nobody
The scientist of the George ave do work in the lab
Test my experiments out on the ave
They got you thinkin' but they lyin' anyways
So when they gossipin' about us they got nothin' to say
Don't play

Everyday I got a new style hatchin'
This is more than rappin' this is media hyjackin'
""As long as I'm alive I'm a keep the vibe
24-7 365""

Yeah yeah yeah once agian the incredible
Mr. Murray comin' at you incredible Def Squad unforgeytable.

We gonna let y'all niggas know to your face what's up",Soldier,2009
Santigold,"Lights out, shoot up the station
TV's dead where's there to run?
Watch everybody come undone (Lights out)
We'll make it easy we'll make it run
One life they see now, how'd they get one?

Still I'll wait another run

[Chorus]
Don't worry
Don't got to worry man I got you tight
Don't worry
Don't have to worry till I hit the lights

Wiped out, no concentration
They got us baskin' in a stole
I watched your ass head lose it all (Wiped out)
They ain't gone see me that's what I want
A casualty but I have more fun

And I know what it's about

I'm still here shaking my head
The way you care to come forth
I can't do what's down my head
There's no place to run

This is black hoodie rap, there's no fear in my eyes where they looking at
Better look on map, Besides, me nah like to eye fight
Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!)
But if a man test my Stuy, I promise he won't like my reply
Boom Bye Bye like Buju I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy I may take some getting use to
Chain snatching, ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shitted, from Brownsville to Bainbrididge
Fatherless child, mama put double shifts
So the number runners was the only one I hanged widith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fidith
Fit no orangutans piddeals kid-daps like orange's I'm dangerous
Please! Tell me what the name of this is

Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard! [Repeat: x4]

I father, I Brooklyn Dodger them
I Jack, I Rob, I sin
Aw man, I'm Jackie Robinson
Except when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, lucky we, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets I'm the Black Branch Ricky
From Brooklyn corners, burning branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie, Brooklyn, hippie
I pity, the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returning, tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half orphan, mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did, still I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this!

[Chorus]

[Santogold]
While I'm doing my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once pretend now I paid my dues
Risk takers we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warning
(Brook-Lyn!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick working like we good color
Rip it to the core, underneath it or we ought to
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step one step give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
With big ass dreams and a sick death wish
Probably like the commercials says
Kill the voice screaming in my head

Looking for your ticket, the less will go,

To tell it straight, I'm trying to build a wall
Walking by myself
Down avenues that reek of time to kill
If you see me keep going
Be a pass by waver
Build me up, bring me down
Just leave me out you name dropper
Stop trying to catch my eye
I see you good you forced faker
Just make it easy
You're my enemy you fast talker

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

What am I here for
I left my home to disappear is all
I'm here for myself
Not to know you
I don't need no one else
Fit in so good the hope is that you cannot see me later
You don't know me
I am an introvert an excavator
I'm duckin' out for now
A face in dodgy elevators
Creep up and suddenly
I found myself
An innovator

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.

Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Santullo,"Bajo a tomar un café, tropiezo casi caigo y siento que
Por un momento pierdo la fé
Me consuelo pensando que ya no muerdo el anzuelo
Levanto el alma del suelo, prendo un pucho, y salgo de este sucucho
Llevo en la mano el cigarro y pienso ""otro crack con pies de barro""
Mejor jugar de callado y nunca treparse al carro,
Ando emperrado en encontrar el tiempo perdido, en lamentos apretados
En penales casi siempre mal pateados
Laburo por chirolas, no quiero seguir y decido salir de la cola
Y aunque el lobo no puede, y aunque las gambas casi no quieren
Doy una vuelta a ver si todavía llueve

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón 
Y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

El vidrio que me mira, la gente que dobla la esquina
La bocanada casi me tira y la rambla, que sigue vacía
Suelo mojado, el tránsito encajonado
Como un perro que ladra encerrado en una trampa desconocida
La lluvia que salpica la memoria enrojecida por la nostalgia
Como lágrimas partidas, como lágrimas perdidas
Tiempo mejor, cielo de miel
Ahora que sale el sol y empieza a calentar la piel

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón 
Y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

Bronco tosarrón de tanto fumar, ganas de empezar a caminar
Y dejar de pensar en flores que se queman de frío 
En un sucio jarrón vacío 
En un Río de Plata marrón que ahora miro sin apuro

Chiflo bajo, me pateo el hormigón mientras pienso, 
Calentón, que me rajo del laburo y que me rajó con razón

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor

I drown myself in the water.

",De Colores,1986
Sapp,"When I was a little girl I wished I was a boy
I tagged along behind the gang and wore my corduroys.
Everybody said I only did it to annoy
But I was gonna be an engineer.

Mamma said, ""Why can't you be a lady?
Your duty is to make me the mother of a pearl
Wait until you're older, dear
And maybe you'll be glad that you're a girl.

Dainty as a Dresden statue, gentle as a Jersey cow,
Smooth as silk, gives cream and milk
Learn to coo, learn to moo
That's what you do to be a lady, now.

When I went to school I learned to write and how to read
History, geography and home economy
And typing is a skill that every girl is sure to need
To while away the extra time until the time to breed
And then they had the nerve to ask, what would I like to be?
I says, ""I'm gonna be an engineer!""

""No, you only need to learn to be a lady
The duty isn't yours, for to try to run the world
An engineer could never have a baby
Remember, dear, that you're a girl""

She's smart, for a woman.
I wonder how she got that way?
You get no choice, you get no voice
Just stay mum, pretend you're dumb.
That's how you come to be a lady, today.

Well, I started as a typist but I studied on the sly
Working out the day and night so I could qualify
And every time the boss came in, he pinched me on the thigh
Said, ""I've never had an engineer!""
""You owe it to the job to be a lady
The duty of the staff is to give the boss a whirl
The wages that you get are crummy, maybe
But it's all you get, 'cause you're a girl""

Then Jimmy came along and we set up a conjugation
We were busy every night with loving recreation
I spent my days at work so he could get an education
And now he's an engineer!

He said: ""I know you'll always be a lady
The duty of my darling is to love me all her life
Could an engineer look after or obey me?
Remember, dear, that you're my wife!""

As soon a Jimmy got a job, I studied hard again
Then busy at me turret-lathe a year or two, and then
The morning that the twins were born, Jimmy says to them
""Your mother was an engineer!""
""You owe it to the kids to be a lady
Dainty as a dish-rag, faithful as a chow
Stay at home, you got to mind the baby
Remember you're a mother now!""

Every time I turn around there's something else to do
Cook a meal or mend a sock or sweep a floor or two
Listening to Jimmy Young, it makes me want to spew
I was gonna be an engineer.

I only wish that I could be a lady
I'd do the lovely things that a lady's supposed to do
I wouldn't even mind if only they would pay me
Then I could be a person too.

What price for a woman?
You can buy her for a ring of gold,
To love and obey, without any pay,
You get a cook and a nurse for better or worse
You don't need a purse when a lady is sold.

Oh, but now the times are harder and me Jimmy's got the sack;
I went down to Vicker's, they were glad to have me back.
But I'm a third-class citizen, my wages tell me that
But I'm a first-class engineer!

The boss he says ""We pay you as a lady,
You only got the job because I can't afford a man,
With you I keep the profits high as may be,
You're just a cheaper pair of hands.""

You got one fault, you're a woman
You're not worth the equal pay.
A bitch or a tart, you're nothing but heart,
Shallow and vain, you've got no brain,

Well, I listened to my mother and I joined a typing pool
Listened to my lover and I put him through his school
If I listen to the boss, I'm just a bloody fool
And an underpaid engineer
I been a sucker ever since I was a baby
As a daughter, as a mother, as a lover, as a dear
But I'll fight them as a woman, not a lady
I'll fight them as an engineer!",I'm Gonna Be an Engineer,1986

Alive as you and me.
Says I ""But Joe, you're ten years dead""
""I never died"" said he,
""I never died"" said he.

""The Copper Bosses killed you Joe,
They shot you Joe"" says I.
""Takes more than guns to kill a man""
Says Joe ""I didn't die""
Says Joe ""I didn't die""

""In Salt Lake City, Joe,"" says I, 
Him standing by my bed, 
""They framed you on a murder charge,"" 
Says Joe, ""But I ain't dead,"" 
Says Joe, ""But I ain't dead."" 

And standing there as big as life
And smiling with his eyes.
Says Joe ""What they can never kill
Went on to organize,
Went on to organize""

From San Diego up to Maine,
In every mine and mill,
Where working men defend their rights,
It's there you'll find Joe Hill,
It's there you'll find Joe Hill!

Sapp,"John Henry was about three days old,
Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,
Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""
John Henry said to his shaker,
""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""
The man that invented the stream drill
Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord, Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry took sick and went to his bed.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord, Lord.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man.
John Henry had a little baby.
You could hold him in the palm of your hand.
The last words I heard that poor boy say,
""My daddy was steel-driving man. Lord, Lord.
My daddy was a steel-driving.""
Well, every Monday morning
When the bluebirds begin to sing.
You can hear John Henry a mile or more.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.
Lord, Lord.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.",John Henry,1986
Sapp,"Now, if you want higher wages let me tell you what to do
You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union,1986
Sapp,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

Imagine there's no countries

And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

No need for greed or hunger

Still hears my broken song of love

Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Stealing gold from the silver they see

Don't think I need to tell you more
I needed a raise I worked so hard for this love of mine
Still I got nothing to show for it.

Tongue tied and twisted, go on baby and go to my head.

Here's a simplification of everything we're going though
You plus me is bad news
But you're a lovely creation and I like to think that I am too
But my friend said I look better without you.

Too tired this time to deal with old suits you wear with your ties that won't bind.

Babe, baby believe me
If I stay it ain't gonna be easy
Okay we'll do it your way
But this is the last time
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down
Love on the rocks.

You love the chase but hate me for the runaround
We both just tired of the whole thing.
You tell me what you want you need you know you have to have
And I just pretend I'm listening

Too tired this time to deal with old suits you wear with your ties that won't bind.

Babe, baby believe me
If I stay it ain't gonna be easy
Okay we'll do it your way

The opposite sides on which we fall

My memory is cruel
I'm queen of attention to details
Defending intentions if he fails
Until now, he told me her name
It sounded familiar in a way
I could have sworn I'd heard him say it ten thousand times
If only I had been listening

Leave unsaid unspoken
Eyes wide shut unopened
You and me
Always between the lines
Between the lines

I thought I thought I was ready to bleed
That we'd move from the shadows on the wall
And stand in the center of it all
Too late two choices to stay or to leave
Mine was so easy to uncover
He'd already left with the other
So I've learned to listen through silence

Leave unsaid unspoken
Eyes wide shut unopened
You and me be
You and me always be

I tell myself all the words he surely meant to say
I'll talk until the conversation doesn't stay on
Wait for me I'm almost ready

Snow White is doing dishes again 'cause what else could you do
With seven itty bitty men?
Sends them to bed and she calls up a friend, says will you meet me at midnight.

The tall blonde lets out a cry of despair says
Would have cut it myself if I knew men could climb hair
I'll have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows.

You're so worried 'bout the maiden,
Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing

Next best thing
Once upon a time in a faraway kingdom, man made up a story
Said that I should believe him
Go and tell your white knight that he's handsome in hindsight
But I don't want the next best thing
So I sing and hold my head down and I break these walls 'round me
Can't take no more of your fairytale love

And it don't hurt
Like anything I've ever felt before
This is no broken heart
No familiar scars
This territory goes uncharted

Just me in a room sunk down in a house in a town
And I don't breathe
No, I never meant to let it get away from me
No, too much to hold
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
And I want uncharted

Stuck under the ceiling I made
I can't help but feeling

I'm going down

Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out
A foolproof idea, so don't ask me how

'Til I get alone, 'cause I can't stay
In the middle of it all, it's nobody's fault, but I'm
So alone, never knew how much I didn't know
Oh, everything is uncharted

I know I'm getting nowhere

But they sure as hell made me

Waiting for the road to be laid
Though I may be going down
I'm taking flame over burning out

Where you are to where you want to be

Somebody’s hands who felt like mine
Turned the key and took a drive
Was free

I recall the sun sank low
Buckley on the radio
Cigarette was burning slow
So breathe

Just yellow lines and tire marks
Sun-kissed skin and handle bars
And where I stood was where I was
To be

No enemies to call my own
No porch light on to pull me home
And where I was is beautiful
Because I was free

Once upon another time
Before I knew which life was mine
Before I left the child behind
Be

I saw myself in summer nights
And stars lit up like candle lights
I made my wish but mostly I
Believed

And yellow lines and tire marks

And I grow and change and I shift and I switch
And it turns out I'm actually kind of a b****

By some piece of s*** a**hole we all sadly know
And I sit and I write while reminding you all
That mean songs are still better than going postal

Your toxin wasting perfectly good space

Here I am sleeping on the floor
We changed just like the leaves
Outside my house
And my phone lay silent by the couch

I remember June
Back when I met you
And your eyes were green
And we were, too

But summer is over
We were tangled in the morning sun
Felt you getting colder
And we knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life
Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye to the lovers
'Cause summer is over

I can still see your silhouette
In the white hot sand
And I still feel your ring on my hand
And the clock was always ticking down
Behind that glass
Singing ""love, be good while you last""

But we both knew
What we were getting into
The things we said
Sounded true

But summer is over
We were tangled in the morning sun
Felt you getting colder
And we knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life
Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye to the lovers
'Cause summer is over

The distant innocence
We are leaving far behind
Your last words will be burning in my mind
In the winter time

Well summer is over
We were tangled in the morning sun
Felt you getting colder
I knew that we would come undone
And it's back to my town, back to your life
Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye, goodbye

Fell in love with another burning bright she
Dreamed of a way to ignite she said,

Break me to pieces, I
I think you're just like heaven why

Come on, come on collide

From the hope of being sun-kissed anchored home
in her interstellar sea but, poor lonely Cassiopeia

Learns to cry over love of constellations

They both smiled what a day to explode, she said

Capture the feeling that my earth is somebody’s ceiling
Can I deliver in sound

Sent to us as a gift from the future
To show us the proof
More than that, it’s to dare us to move

I’ve lost a grip on where I started from 
I wish I’d thought ahead and left a few crumbs
I’m on the hunt for who I’ve not yet become
But I’d settle for little equilibrium 
There is a war inside my heart gone silent
Both sides dissatisfied and somewhat violent
The issue I have now begun to see 
I am the only lonely casualty

This is not the end though

'Cause I have sent for a warrior 
From on my knees, make me a Hercules
I was meant to be a warrior please
Make me a Hercules 
'Cause I have sent for a warrior 
From on my knees, make me a Hercules
I was meant to be a warrior please

This is my darkest hour 
A long road has lead me out here 
But I only need turn around to face the light
And decide flight or fight

'Cause I have sent for a warrior 
From on my knees, make me a Hercules
I was meant to be a warrior please

'Cause I have sent for a warrior 
From on my knees, make me a Hercules
I was meant to be a warrior please

How untrustworthy is that
He could be less than kind
Or even worse he could be very nice, have lovely eyes
And make me laugh, come out of hiding

Oh, God

What if when he sees me
I like him and he knows it?
What if he opens up a door
And I can't close it?
What happens then?
If when he holds me
My heart is set in motion
I'm not prepared for that
I'm scared of breaking open
But still I can't help from hoping
To find someone to talk to
Who likes the way I am
Someone who when he sees me
Wants to again",When He Sees Me,2015

The things that I say just might matter to someone

And not a sound of her voice did he hear
While the watchdog did howl and the village bell tolled
The winds blew across the wild moor

Oh, how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door the next morn'
And he found Mary dead but the child yet alive
Clutched close to his dead mother's breast

Now the old man in grief pined away
And the babe to its mother went soon
And no one they say has lived there to this day
And the cottage is left to ruin

Now the villagers point out the place
Where the ivy grows over the door
Saying there Mary died once a fair village bride
From the winds that blew across the wild moor
From the winds that blew across the wild moor

Sara Evans,"She wore a dress with cherries on it
Going somewhere where she'd be wanted
A town this small, all they do is talk
No wedding ring chipped fingernail polish
She always wished that she could go to college
But some dreams fade, they just slip away
She started to show a few months ago
And she had to go, that's how she wound up

On the backseat of a greyhound bus
Head hung down with the windows up
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace
But she fell in love, she fell in love
On the backseat of a greyhound bus

Oh, yeah, yeah

Moon was full the stars were smilin'
God has a funny sense of timin'
The baby came on the interstate
Somewhere between Jackson and Memphis
She finally found what she'd been missing
She cried and laughed when the red lights flashed
Sweet baby girl, she looked into the face of a new, the face of a brand new world


On the backseat of a Greyhound bus,
Heart so full that it could bust.
Starin' at the rest of her life.
She never thought this would be the place,
Where she would find her savin' grace,
But she fell in love; she fell in love,
On the backseat of a Greyhound Bus.

Give me a sad song that I can hold on to
Anything to set me free
Just one big cry, big tears in my eyes

I got this fever that just won't break
I got some troubles I got to shake

When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck

Sorry but I got to go
And that was all she wrote
Her Mama's heart was broke
And that was all she wrote
And so the story goes

Starin' out the window
Scratchin' and a rackin' his brains

Growed up to be a woman

And the clothes hangin' out on the line

Gonna preach about Sunday morn'
Nothing quite like this
Has happened here before

A smooth talkin' son of a gun
For such a grounded girl
To just up and run

And you can't stop love

Gossip goin' non-stop
Sippin' on pink lemonade

From Album: Amazing Grace 3 - A Country Salute to Gospel

There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it afar
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there

Refrain
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirits shall sorrow no more
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest

(Refrain)

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days

All the concrete and the glass 
I don't know where we're going 
I hardly ever see your face 
And there's not enough space 
For all the love we should be growing 

Chorus: 
We just need a litte earth to stand on 
Plant our hearts on solid ground 
Turn the lights out on this city 
And wake up in a new hometown 
We'll stand out in our front yard 
Where we can finally breathe 
If we find a little earth to stand on 
Baby you and me 

Imagine Friday football games 
Where everybody knows our names 
They even stop to say hello 
I bet they'll have a town parade 
Kids selling lemonade 
Baby, don't you wanna go, ohhhh

I don't want to face tomorrow 
If we don't leave this place tonight

Of anything in my life 

All we need's a little earth to stand on 
Plant our hearts on solid ground 
Turn the lights out on this city 
And wake up in a new hometown 
Stand out in our front yard 
Where we can finally breathe 
If we find a little earth to stand on 
Baby you and me 

Need a little earth to stand on 
Plant our hearts on solid ground 
Turn the lights out on this city 
And wake up in a new hometown 
We'll dance out in our front yard 
Underneath a maple tree 
If we find a little earth to stand on 
Baby you and me

Sara Evans,"Roll Me Back in Time Lyrics
He was just a boy of seventeen
And I was older by a year
And we spent everything we ever made

To get away from here
We got married in the winter time
At the Open Doors Cafe
No matter how he tried, he couldn't fine the peace of mind to stay

[Chorus]
All the glitter out in Hollywood
All the stars that never shine
They can't hold a candle to your wind
Could you roll me, roll me back in time

Got a job and worked the early shift
I spent hours by the phone
Promises are easy to forget
When there's too much time alone

You've got something they can't argue with
That's what all the people say
He's just wating for the obvious
His star is on his way, any day

[Chorus]

Just this side of sunrise,
You can feel it in the air
That something's bound to happen
It's just right there
Everybody loves you, it's so easy to see
But it's only, yeah, it's only in your dreams

I love the way you touch me
You know my body so well
You do much more than love me
'Til I'm overwhelmed
Wrapped up inside of you
Is where I wanna be
'Cause nobody knows, nobody knows
The secrets that we keep

Once we get inside these four walls
All the hesitation falls
We can't wait no more
And as you help me get undressed

You don't have to guess
Baby, you know what I want
I wanna love you 'til the sun comes up
'Til I'm sure you're satisfied

I was skipping to school with a lunchbox
Pigtails in my hair
Where did the time go

How'd I get to here from there
Making lunches and folding clothes
Is not the most glamorous life I know
But I've got so much more than most

[Chorus]
I'm not famous but my kids think I'm a star
I'm not rich but I've made a million memories so far
I may not be a model
But my man thinks I could be
I may not be from royalty
But in these four walls
I'm the queen

I had it all planned
First I'd make it big in Nashville
Then take Hollywood by storm
But it was in God's hands

There were three little lives that would need me
To one day be their mom
I wouldn't trade it for anything
Those movies stars don't have everything
And I know I'm right where I wanna be

I had to let it go, but I have no regrets
I would have never known this kind of happiness

Ten years old
Waitin' in my room for him
To come home
And I just knew
He'd be so mad
Though I begged my mother not to, she told my dad
There was no denying I let him down
But instead of being angry
He put his arms around me and said...

In the sunlight or the rain
Brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
Know you're never too far gone
My love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you'll always be my baby

There I was
Twenty-one
Oh, I was so ashamed
Of what I'd done
On a country road
Parked one night
Oh, it started out so innocent
Crossed the line
There was no denying
I let God down
But instead of being angry
He let his love surround me and I heard...

In the sunlight or the rain
Brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
Know you're never too far gone
My love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you'll always be my baby

There he is
My little man
I'm sure he'll get in trouble every now and then
And I pray to God that when he does
I'll be just as understanding as my father was
'Cause the last thing that I wanna do is let him down
So instead of being angry, I'm gonna throw my arms around him

And I'll say in the sunlight or the rain
Brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way

That we could work it out

She's listening to those working girls
The ones that never get heard

Every time I think I'm lost,
This world's nothing but luck
God always sends someone down,
Just to stir things up

Hallelujah, a little revival
Amen to love
Deep in my soul, a little revival
Amen to love

It rumbles down in your heart
You've got something to say
That kid with the guitar in the subway
He might change the world someday
If it's Jerusalem
Or in Tiananmen Square
Didn't it all get started when
Someone stood up somewhere

Hallelujah, a little revival
Amen to love
Deep in my soul, a little revival
Amen to love

Between the dawn and the darkness
The ashes and the spark
My miracle moment was
Giving you my heart

Deep in my soul, a little revival
Amen to love yeah

That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die

For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

I’ve got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

Oh Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old daddy
But I like you

Down to the Mermaid Café
And I will buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing
And smash our empty glasses down

Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have a round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town

Oh Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old daddy
But I like you

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano
And put some flowers 'round my room

But let's not talk about fare-thee-well’s now
The night is a starry dome
And they're playin’ that scratchy rock ‘n’ roll
Beneath the Matalla moon

Knows where you are

That David played and it pleased the Lord

The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
Now you never show it to me, do you?

I remember when I moved in you
The holy dove, she was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you

With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Why would I want to live for man, and pay the highest price 
What does it mean to gain a whole world, only to lose my life 
So much of what I do is to make a good impression 
This journey is my own 
And so much of what I say is to make myself look better 
But this journey is my own 
And why would I want to live for man, and pay the highest price 
And what does it mean to gain a whole world, only to lose my life 
And I have never felt relief like I feel it right now 
This journey is my own 
Cause trying to please the world, it was breaking me down 
It was breaking me down 
And now I live and I breathe for an audience of one 
Now I live and I breathe for an audience of one 
Now I live and I breathe for an audience of one 
Cause I know this journey is my own 
And why would I want to live for man, and pay the highest price 
And what does it mean to gain a whole world, only to lose my life

Sara Groves,"I have a friend who just turned eighty-eight 
and she just shared with me that she's afraid of dying. 
I sit here years from her experience 
and try to bring her comfort. 
I try to bring her comfort 
But what do I know? 
What do I know? 
She grew up singing about the glory land, 
and she would testify how Jesus changed her life. 
It was easy to have faith when she was thirty-four, 
but now her friends are dying, and death is at her door. 
Oh, and what do I know? 
Really, what do I know? 
I don't know that there are harps in heaven, 
Or the process for earning your wings. 
I don't know of bright lights at the ends of tunnels, 
Or any of those things. 
She lost her husband after sixty years, 
and as he slipped away she still had things to say. 
Death can be so inconvenient. 
You try to live and love. 
It comes and interrupts. 
And what do I know? What do I know? 
I don't know that there are harps in heaven, 
Or the process for earning your wings. 
I don't know of bright lights at the ends of tunnels, 
Or any of those things. 
But I know to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord, 
and from what I know of him, that must be pretty good. 
Oh, I know to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord, 
and from what I know of him, that must be very good.",What Do I Know,2001
Sara Groves,"I've done every devotional
Been every place emotional
Trying to hear a new word from God
And I think it's very odd,
That while I attempt to help myself
My Bible sits upon my shelf
With every promise
I could ever need

And the Word was
And the Word is
And the Word will be
The old Word is the new Word is
The old Word is the new Word is

People are getting fit for Truth
Like they're buying a new tailored suit
Does it fit across the shoulders
Does it fade when it gets older
We throw ideas that aren't in style
In the Salvation Army pile
And search for something more to meet our needs

I think it's time I rediscover
All the ground that I have covered, like
Seek Ye first what a verse
We are pressed but not crushed,
Perplexed but don't despair.
We are persecuted but not abandoned
We are no longer slaves
We are daughters and sons,
And when we are weak
We are very strong

And neither death nor life
Nor present nor future
Nor depth nor height
Can keep us from the love of Christ
And the Word I need
Is the Word that was
Who put on flesh to dwell with us.

And the table was full of good food 
And friends and neighbors 
That's not how we like it now 
Cause if you sit at home you're a loser 
Couldn't you find anything better to do

Will another take you in?

Looking through a million portals

Waiting in our velveteen
Tell me you can really see me

Are we walking through the streets
Of invisible empires

Taking me to the universe edge
Returning carefree through the night
On shooting stars
And meteorites

You fly away
Stealin' my heart
Like takin' dust from the stars
Like takin' dust from the stars 

What gave you the privilege  
Of taking me on an adventure through the mist
To some romantic galaxy
When all along
You could not commit 

Like a robbery on Jupiter or Mars
You fly away
Stealin' my heart
Like takin' dust from the stars
Like takin' dust from the stars 

Using all of me till there was nothing left
An emptiness I don't regret
So fly always if you must
(And) scatter me
And scatter me

Hot water scalding
I can still feel you
And my skin's crawling
I'm dirty right down to my heart

You said trust you I could trust you
Then you used me you used me
In some selfish act
Of gratification

And cleanse myself of all this pain
I need to cry I could die
I feel so stained
This just can't be what love is
Now I need to wash you all away

What I gave last night
I can never give again
I always said I'm not like that
Now I don't know who I am
I know I can't undo it
Somehow I just gotta get through it
If I turn up the heat till I start to scream
Will I find my soul cleansing 
In the scalding steam

Now I just wanna wash you away
And cleanse myself of all this pain
I need to cry I could die
I feel so stained
This just can't be what love is
I gotta wash you all away

My heart nearly bled to death
And now I'm dying for a little salvation

After a dead brother
And your mother hung the cross upside down
Salvador, so much of time hung over

Old men's sleeves
The prick of guilt's thorn rusted and worn
Sewn into our hearts in the shape of a star

Up the alley I stop at a window
Through the curtains I see
Figures moving, figures swaying
Figures talking in time

Paintings of persistence
Paintings of persistence hung like a jury
Searching and seeking
Silent icons I wipe the dust from my hands

Salvador, no one believes me
But I swear I know what I'm doing
And once you were painting
The ground you were breaking
But it's never enough to gain their approval

Up the alley, the window is broken
The sky's on the ground
They unravel the rope of un-reason
They will hang me for sure

Searching and seeking their silent icons
They wipe the blood from their hands

Salvador, they want a savior
And they crowned you king
They begged you for answers
But the glory or fame took away time
From your obligations

I'll kiss your feet when they take you

Dog barking to the heat of the beating sun
Hot ground, sweet ground a feeling of fever in the air
Kissing the nape of your neck, sighing colors
Breaking sticks into heartsick flaming words

In the fields making love
The luck of the Irish tucked between your toes
Love's debt pays regret, in months I begin to show
Dressing as a car drives by gasping buzzards
Turning time into a lover's rhyme
Pressed between the pages of my heart

In the fields where are you?
Are you hiding yourself there still?
Oh in the fields where are you?
Are you hiding yourself in a city of weeds?
Are you hiding yourself in a city of glass?

In the fields tripping on
Pushing through the barbs to reach the greener side
It was years ago we let each other go
To follow the paths of our dreams

Sometimes I carry the memory, full time
Delivering the spitting image of you
Eyes burn and I live at peace
I did what I had to do and you, and you, and you

Tossing flowers, the names engraved with pencil marks
A constant quirky conversation
Oh, should you change your name

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will

Nothing

I have to scribble quickly she talks so fast so full of life
There she goes around the corner into another dimension and

I scratch my head I waste time thinking about scratching my head
And I wonder
Do we really hold all power here inside
I jump for joy at the thought I jump off cliffs and into
Fields of love

She is smiling he is toothless

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Music I hear millions of soft guitars

the very moment you're in Argentina
If you're romantic Senor 
then you will surely adore Argentina
You'll be as gay as can be
If you will learn to 'Si Si' like a Latin
For mister soon as you learn  
then you will never return to Manhattan
When you hear 'yo te amo' 
you'll still a kiss and then
If she should say Manana
It's just to let you know
you're gonna meet again

I'll bet an old castanet that
you will never forget Argentina

to tickle your spine

Of the old friends

Winter companions the old men
Lost in their overcoats
Waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust
On the shoulders of the old friends

Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be seventy

Silently sharing the same fear

A time of innocence
A time of confidences

Sara Musinowski,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.","Speak Low, song for voice & piano (from ""One Touch of Venus"") [From One",1996

A day to give

My finest day
Is yet unknown

Fought every gain
To taste the sweet

I rise and fall
Yet through it all

When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny

Now lay the chance
Here in my hands

When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny

I will feel eternity

If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle",Introduction,2000

I know my screaming and shouting won't keep you

You're one room right over, you're stressing and loving me

I'll sacrifice for you dedicate my life for you.
I will go where you lead always there in time of need.
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill.

You're all, you're all I need to get by.

Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me.
Darlin' in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door.
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher.
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.

Jane and I were having Solstice, now we need a place to stay."" 
And her Christ-loving uncle watched his wife hang Mary on a tree, 
He watched his son hang candy canes all made with Red Dye No. 3. 
He told his niece, ""Its Christmas Eve, I know our life is not your style,"" 
She said, ""Christmas is like Solstice, and we miss you and its been awhile."" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
And just before the meal was served, hands were held and prayers were said, 
Sending hope for peace on earth to all their gods and goddesses. 

The food was great, the tree plugged in, the meal had gone without a hitch, 
Till Timmy turned to Amber and said, ""Is it true that you're a wtich?"" 
His mom jumped up and said, ""The pies are burning,"" and she hit the kitchen, 
And it was Jane who spoke, she said, ""It's true, your cousin's not a Christian,"" 
""But we love trees, we love the snow, the friends we have, the world we share, 
And you find magic from your God, and we find magic everywhere,"" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
And where does magic come from? I think magic's in the learning, 
'Cause now when Christians sit with Pagans only pumpkin pies are burning. 

When Amber tried to do the dishes, her aunt said, ""Really, no, don't bother."" 
Amber's uncle saw how Amber looked like Tim and like her father. 
He thought about his brother, how they hadn't spoken in a year, 
He thought he'd call him up and say, ""It's Christmas, and your daughter's here."" 
He thought of fathers, sons and brothers, saw his own son tug his sleeve, saying, 
""Can I be a Pagan?"" Dad said, ""We'll discuss it when they leave."" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
Lighting trees in darkness, learning new ways from the old, and 
Making sense of history and drawing warmth out of the cold.",The Christians and the Pagans,2010
Sara Watkins,"I've never had a way with women, but the hills of iowa make me wish that I could,
And I've never found a way to say I love you, but if the chance came by, oh I, I would,
But way back where I come from, we never mean to bother,
We don't like to make our passions other peoples concern,
And we walk in the world of safe people, and at night we walk into our houses and burn.

Iowa oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
How I long to fall just a little bit, to dance out of the lines and stray from the light,
But I fear that to fall in love with you is to fall from a great and gruesome height.
So I asked a friend about it, on a bad day, her husband had just left her,
She sat down on the chair he left behind, she said,
""what is love, where did it get me? whoever thought of love is no friend of mine.""

Ioway oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
Once I had everything, I gave it up for the shoulder of your driveway and the words I've never felt.
And so for you, I came this far across the tracks, ten miles above the limit, and with no seatbelt, and id do it again,
For tonight I went running through the screen doors of discretion,
For I woke up from a nightmare that I could not stand to see,
You were a-wandering out on the hills of iowa and you were not thinking of me.

Young girl in tears
She hasn't seen the man she loves in years

And her mother is a waitress
At the harbor bar, good graces
Where the seamen come a fishin' with their lines
And it was one of them that caught her
And left her with a daughter
Who lives with hate and loving him in mind

So the young girl goes to the water
And she calls out for her father
But she ain't seen the old man in some time
Yes, and he was always boastin'
Just a drinkin' and a toastin'
And one day he left his family far behind

So the mother comes home a drinkin'
With a sailor who's a thinkin' out loud
That he might stay with them awhile
So she loads her mother's pistol
And she shoots him as he whistles

I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me

Is the prairie and the sky

And I don't want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire

I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain 
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, I watched it burn

I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham

And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive
And I come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down
Out on 95
And pretend that it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean
Baby, do you know what I mean?

With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music

My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips


And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

Long ago the wise man said
That to our land
Soon the prophet will be sent
We will cross many rivers

Need your body warmth
Ginger Red there's no reason to get mad
Hold you in my arms.
Want you to stay and lay down with me
Don't go 'cause the pourin' rain is wet
Thunder and lightning is not just my plea
So lay down
Don't worry
Stay in bed
Ginger Red there's no reason to get mad
We got time enough
Ginger Red yes I really would be glad
Come on
Don't get tough
Want you to stay and lay down with me
If you leave
I really get upset
Just let it happen
No push naturally
So lay down - so lay down
Don't worry
Stay in bed
Nobody knows that you here now with me
Nobody saw that you came
Don't be afraid of my neighbours you see
Because love
'cause love is not a shame

Want you stay with me in bed

And playing Yukulele.
And when I waved to the girl
Come on and teach me that sway

Oh yes
come tonight to the bay

The beach and the sky - the moon of Hawaii.

you've gone and left my heart in pain.
All you left is our favorite song, the one we danced to all night long.
It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be,
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.
Breaking up never, it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song, 
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Precious memories keep-a lingering on, 
ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.
The happiness we spent, we used to dance to the music
make romance to the music, 
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone. 
Oh I can't bear to hear it, 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone; 
it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning since you been gone;

Sarah,"I don’t need a long worn conversation
And you don’t have to make a sunrise fall
There’s been too much to give some explanation
It’s just another day, another mind, another soul

With a little bit love
A little bit tenderness
A little bit love
We can make things right

Can you give what I need
Can you die at my feet
Can you look in my eyes
By the truth in your lies

Can you give what I need
Can you die at my feet
Can you look in my eyes
‘Cause there ain’t no truth in your lies

It ain’t no use to get your confirmation
About things that you pretend to do
We’re stuck in such a crazy situation
Tell me what’s left between me and you

With a little bit love
A little bit tenderness
A little bit love
We can make things right

Can you give what I need
Can you die at my feet
Can you look in my eyes
By the truth in your lies

Can you give what I need
Can you die at my feet
Can you look in my eyes
‘Cause there ain’t no truth in your lies

Some may say
That our love has flown miles and miles away
There’s no use to try
There’s no reason to cry
‘Cause I won’t lose my pride

Can you give what I need
Die at my feet
By the truth in your lies
Can you give what I need
‘Cause there ain’t no truth in your lies

Can you give what I need
‘Cause there ain’t no truth in your lies

Sarah Brightman,"How sweet the answer Echo makes
To music at night;
When, rous'd by lute or horn, she wakes,
And faw away, o'er lawns and lakes,
Goes answering light.

Yet love hath echoes truer far,
And far more sweet,
Then e'er beneath the moonlight's star,
Of horn, or lute, or soft guitar,
The songs repeat.

'Tis when the sigh, in youth sincere,
And only then,
The sigh, that's breath'd for one to hear,
Is by that one, that only dear,
Breath'd back again.
Again, again, again,","How sweet the answer, folksong for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. IV)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"'Tis the last rose of summer,
Left blooming alone,
All her lovely companions are faded and gone,
No flower of her kindred,
No rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes,
Or give sigh for sigh.

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one,
To pine on the stem,
Since the lovely are sleeping,
Go, sleep thou with them,
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie senseless and dead.

So soon may I follow,
When friendships decay,
And from love's shining circle
The gems drop away!
When true hearts lie withered,
And fond ones are flown,
Oh! who would inhabit
This bleak world alone?","The last rose of summer, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. IV)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"Easter day was a holiday
Of all days of the year,
And all the little schoolfellows went out to play
But Sir William was not there.

Mamma went to the School wife house
And knocked at the ring,
Saying, ""Little Sir William, if you are there,
Pray let your mother in.""

The School wife open'd the door and said:
""He is not here today.
He is with the little schoolfellows out on the green
Playing some pretty play.""

Mamma went to the Boyne water
That is so wide and deep,
Saying, ""Little Sir William, if you are there,
Oh pity your mother's weep.""

""How can I pity your weep, mother,
And I so long in pain?
For the little pen knife sticks close to my heart
And the School wife hath me slain.

""Go home, go home, my mother dear,
And prepare my winding sheet,
For tomorrow morning before eight o'clock,
You with my body shall meet.

""And lay my Prayer Book at my head,
And my grammar at my feet,
That all the little schoolfellows as they pass by
May read them for my sake.""","Little Sir William, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. I)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"Oft in the stilly night
Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
Fond Mem'ry brings the light
Of other days around me:
The smiles, the tears of boyhood's years,
The words of love then spoken;
The eyes that shone,
Now dimm'd and gone,
The cheerful hearts now broken!
Thus in the stilly night
Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
Sad Mem'ry brings the light
Of other days around me.

When I remember all
The friends, so link'd together,
I've seen around me fall
Like leaves in wintry weather,
I feel like one
Who treads alone
Some banquet-hall deserted,
Whose lights are fled,
Whose garlands dead,
And all but he departed!
Thus in the stilly night
Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
Sad Mem'ry brings the light
Of other days around me.","Oft in the stilly night, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol IV)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"Oliver Cromwell lay buried and dead,
Hee-haw, buried and dead,
There grew an old apple-tree over his head,
Hee-haw, over his head.

The apples were ripe and ready to fall,
Hee-haw, ready to fall,
There came an old woman to gather them all,
Hee-haw, gather them all.

Oliver rose and gave her a drop,
Hee-haw, gave her a drop,
Which made the old woman go hippety hop,
Hee-haw, hippety hop.

The saddle and bridle, they lie on the shelf,
Hee-haw, lie on the shelf,
If you want any more your can sing it yourself,
Hee-haw, sing it yourself.","Oliver Cromwell, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. I)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"A flaxen-headed cowboy, as simple as may be,
And next a merry plough boy, I whistled o'er the lea;
But now a saucy footman, I strut in worsted lace,
And soon I'll be a butler, and whey my jolly face.

When steward I'm promoted I'll snip the tradesmen's bill,
My master's coffers empty, my pockets for to fill.
When lolling in my charlot so great a man I'll be,
So great a man, so great a man, so great a man I'll be,
You'll forget the little plough boy who whistled o'er the lea.
You'll forget the little plough boy who whistled o'er the lea.

I'll buy votes at elections, and when I've made the pelf,
I'll stand poll for the parliament, and then vote in myself.
Whetever's good for me, sir, I never will oppose:
When all my ayes are sold off, why then I'll sell my noes.

I'll joke, harangue and paragraph, with speeches charm the ear,
And when I'm tired on my legs, then I'll sit down a peer.
In court or city honour so great a man I'll be,
So great a man, so great a man, so great a man I'll be,
You'll forget the little plough boy who whistled o'er the lea.
You'll forget the little plough boy who whistled o'er the lea.","The plough boy, folksong for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. III)",1988
Sarah Brightman,"Quand j'etais chez mon pere,
Apprenti pastoureau,
Il m'a mis dans la lande,
Pour garder les troupiaux.
Troupiaux, troupiaux,
Je n'en avais guere.
Troupiaux, troupiaux,
Je n'en avais biaux.

Mais je n'en avais guere,
Je n'avais qu'trois agneaux;
Et le loup de la plaine
M'a mange la plus biau.
Troupiaux, troupiaux,...

Il etait si vorace
N'a laisse que la piau,
N'a laisse que la queue,
Pour mettre a mon chapiau.
Troupiaux, troupiaux,...

Mais des os de la bete
Me fis un chalumiau
Pour jouer a la fete,
A la fet' du hamiau.
Troupiaux, troupiaux,...

Pour fair' danser l'village,
Dessous le grandormiau,
Et les jeun's et les vieilles,
Les pieds dan les sabiots.

[English Translation

[When I Lived With My Father]

When I lived with my father
As an apprentice shepherd,
He sent me to the moor
To look after the sheep.
Sheep, sheep,
I had but a few.
Sheep, sheep,
I had none that were bonny.

No, I had but a few,
I had but three lambs;
And the wolf from the plain
Ate the finest of those.
Sheep, sheep,...

He was so ravenous
He left only the pelt,
He left only the tail
To put on my hat.
Sheep, sheep,...

But the bones of the animal
Made me pipe
To play at the fair,
At the village fair.
Sheep, sheep,...

So the village could dance
Beneath the great elm,
Young women and old
With clogs on their feet.
Sheep, sheep,...","Quand j'étais chez mon père, for voice & piano (Folk Songs, Vol. II)",1988
