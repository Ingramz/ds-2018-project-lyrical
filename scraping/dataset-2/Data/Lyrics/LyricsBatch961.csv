Rudimental,"Feeling like it's all been pointless
I keep holding on

Rudimental,"If were oceans apart, I'd keep sailing 'til we're on the same land
If there's no end to our start, I'd keep hold of it with both hands
Just say what's on your mind, 'cause I can't cope with false hope and pain
Am I wasting my time if I know you don't feel the same, the same?

Let's find a common emotion, something we both can feel
Let's dive, sink and drown in devotion, so I know that this real
'Cause I want to feel a common emotion, common emotion

I tried to find something sacred and mutual

I’ve been spinning out for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I’ve been sitting here for ages
Ripping out pages
How'd I get so faded
How'd I get so faded
Oh no no don’t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell when it kicks in
Tell when it kicks in

I’ve been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now

Only leaves you wanting more?
Where do you go when everywhere feels
Like where you've been before?

Tell me if you know the feeling

Tell me if you feel the same

What do you do when you get scared
Of the world outside your door?

Rudimentary Peni,"

God is nothing more than an obsessive lie.
While Sunday school children are brainwashed into the line,
And presented with as truth what's really just a lie,
Another childs' self-belief is sacrificed.

In the eyes of the lord, men are his servants,
In the eyes of the lord, women are mens' servants,
In the eyes of the lord, we're authority's servants,
In the eyes of the lord, everyone's a servant.

Sexual roles perversely glorified,
Beyond virgin motherhood, all status is denied.
But starvation and death's; the real testiment
To the truth of the god your bible represents.

Behold 'tis I the commander whose grip controls you all
Resist me not surrender I'll no compassion call

Tyrant captor of humanity
Tyrant conqueror of all
Tyrant hideous destructor
Tyrant everyman shall fall

Your very lives are held between my fingers
I snap them and you cower down in fear
You spineless things that belly down to slither
To the end of the world you follow to be near

Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live
Since tyrant was enthroned

I listen not to sympathy whilst ruler of this land
Withdraw your feeble aches and moans
Or suffer smite from this my hand

My legions faithful unto death
I'll summon to my court
And as you perish each of you shall scream as you are sought

We fought many
And we'll fight the night until we see the sun
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones
We are here

Under the sun, I found we were left to drown
Evil abounds, weight is pullin' us down
No sight or sound, impaired to His care
Chasing after the wind, running after the air
Deserving of desertion, servants of destruction
And everyday we taste of a grace that we're unconcerned with
My sin I should be burned with, I'm guilty, filthy, and stained
But He became a curse, drank my cup and took my pain
And for that he reigns, through faith I'm changed
And I don't have a reason why he loosened up my chains
I don't believe in luck; I believe in grace
But they say we're lucky cause we seen your face
And we heard Him call us, and He heard our answer
And He gives us second chances when we throw our hands up
So weary and broken, hopin' His arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into focus
(I guess we the luck ones, huh?)

[Chorus]

You're greater than my shame, guilt, my doubt, and my past
Fortunate to trust in you cause I've doubted your plans
I've questioned your ways, every question I raised
Is foolishness compared to mountains, the wind, and the waves
You're so mindful of us, we rise from the dust
You love these cheating, beating hearts and these eyes full of lust
Gave us power to fight it, though we cower in quiet
We have the faith to start a riot; how can we deny it?
Fire inside us that you kindle when it starts to dwindle
And simply put I'm sinful so your love is essential
I don't believe in luck, no, I believe in grace
But they say we lucky cause we seen your face
Lord, we heard you call us, You heard our answer
And you give us second chances when we throw our hands up
I'm weary and broken, but your arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into your focus

See, I'm not sayin' I'm always right
And I ain't sayin' that I'm perfect

I'm glad that I got it

Rudy Grant,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry

I never dreamt it could be

Why am I crying these bitter tears?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.

Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers,
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours,
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim.

I say ""Let's call it quits.""

Rudy Lawless,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1961

So how can I sleep

I made pimpin' a full time job
So bitches wouldn't have to go out and rob
I made the streets of new york hot as a sauna
And hung a home sweet ho sign on every corner
Yes I'm the player of all players and the mack of all macks

Why you insecure no business barn junkyard

I was callin' whores jives ass bitches
And pimps sucker ass lame
Kane, before you can take my reign
You gotta cook me a chicken and a half a day
Walk from new york to los angeles and throw the bones away
You gotta be born blind and cannot see
Yo' bitches have the pocks in the ass so bad they can't even pee
Ride a bald eagle a million feet in the air
And get out and do the runnin' man while you up there
Have the mumps and the asiastic flu
And the crabs around yo' ass start singin' the yankee doodle doo!

Rudy Traylor Band,"Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh what a lovely couple they made

Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy who's silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...

Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
oh what a shock ""you're on the wrong block""

Rushed out to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you, my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade

Don't make it serious;

Betty Co-ed has eyes of Yale's deep blue, 
Betty Co-ed's a golden haired for Princeton,

Betty Co-ed's a smile for Pennsylvania, 
Her heart is Dartmouth's treasure, so 'tis said, 
Betty Co-ed is loved by every college boy, 
But I'm the one who's loved by Betty Co-ed! 

She made a wreck of Carnegie Tech and all its engineers; 
She did the same at old Notre Dame, her line is good for years; 
Roguish eyes, telling lies, breathing sighs!

What happiness might come my way

I'll bet I could work wonders, seems too good to be true

Single handed I'd rescue ship and captain and crew

All my pretty speeches are a bust 
And so I must try something new.
I've been sitting up the whole night long
Writing a song all about you.
I don't care if it's a big success;
As long as it will change your 'no' to 'yes'.

Chorus:
My song won't appeal to a lover of art.
My song will reveal what I feel in my heart.
It won't have so much of Franz Schubert's touch.
And I can't begin like Irving Berlin.

My words may be crude; the tune may be wrong,
But you'll find my heart in my song.",My Song,1992

Sing for your supper,
And you'll get breakfast.
Songbirds always eat
If their song is sweet to hear.

Sing for your luncheon,
And you'll get dinner.
Dine with wine of choice,
If romance is in your voice.

Trilling makes a fellow willing,
So, little swallow, swallow now.
Now is the time to

I guess I'll have to change my plan,

I found myself upon the shelf, and that was that,

All that I could get was the air, 

My feet are back upon the ground, 
I've lost the one girl (man) I found,

Because they're obviously....definitely....Nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one

That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a

In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run

In Hong Kong they strike a gong and fire off a noonday gun

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Feel your touch and realize

The thrill is gone.

And let it linger on.

Rudy Vallee & His Connecticut Yankees,"You're as pleasant as the morning and refreshing as the rain
Isn't it a pity that you're such a scatterbrain?
When you smile it's so delightful
When you talk it's so insane

Still it's charming chatter, scatterbrain
I know I'll end up apoplectic
But there's nothing I can do
It's just the same as being in a hurricane

And though my life will be too hectic
I'm so much in love with you
Nothing else can matter
You're my darling scatterbrain

You're as gay as New Year parties, you're as sweet as sugarcane
But when you get serious, you're such a scatterbrain
When we dance I think it's heaven
'Til about the third refrain

Then you start your patter, scatterbrain
Perhaps I'm much too analytic
But I'm up the well-known tree
I've tried to understand your double-talk in vain

Yet won't you please forgive your critic
'Cause you mean so much to me
Nothing else can matter
You're my darling scatterbrain",Stein Song (University of Maine),1999

A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh

On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings, as time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate

A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by",As Time Goes By,2006

Remember you
Walking down these city streets
And the sweet taste of your kiss

Think about you often
Then forget you as fast as I can
Why did you choose him?
Oh yeah, that was all my fault
Sure I've got my freedom now
It's like being locked inside of a vault
By the door
With no key

I don't want that much at all
I don't need someone to love
I just want a girl to touch

Door in this city hides a pretty girl

I wish I never knew ya

Instead of wandering and drinking

A lot of days I’ve been staying in bed
Everywhere I go reminds me of her

I know it’s time to stop worshipping her
To stop wanting her
To stop missing her
To stop thinking about her

Then it all starts again

I’m so sad
I’m despondent
I’m so sad about losing her
I’m so sad
I’m despondent
I’m so sad about losing her

There are moments when I become paralyzed
Thoughts of her can keep me from speaking
Dream of her breath in my ear and I cry
But everybody reminds me that I’m better off without her
God she was cruel a lot of the time
But when she was kind
Oh when she’d smile
When she called me honey
My soul would surrender to her
My heart and body were hers to use as she wanted
I just wanted to be near her forever

And I'm talking about the first time

And even though it's been so slow
Now everything is about to unwind
I never thought it would feel so much like dying

Don't think about it just sign and walk away
Don't dwell on the shame
Don't let it fan the flame in your heart
Because it's time to let everything die
It's okay don't be afraid

We both know once you let go
Even though the past was sublime
The death rattle will sound in the direction it will lead us
And in the afterglow of all we've been through
There will never be another time
I can't believe how much this feels like dying

I spent my days with you
Drinking 'til I killed us
I never meant to hurt you when we died

There are miles of road we will never know
And I can't say that it'll be fine
Because there's no way to fix what's broken between us
And if you want to know how the love could go

For handstands and toasts to your health
From strangers, and past loves, and friends
Who won't be there in the end

So run baby run

As you trip to the magical water swim, try not to drown
Just remember when it's time to get out that I won't be found anywhere around
Because I can't be second or third unless I'm someone else
And I can't deny or love less I can just be myself
I never thought you'd be the one to make my heart go black
But I'm telling the world in a song I was wrong about that

I wrote one a year before 
It was a sad dark tune about my broken heart and snow and 
Not knowing where you were 
Another year has passed and I’m lifting a glass 
To say good bye and hello to the new 
But the only thing I wanted for Christmas was to be close to you 

Hey hey merry Christmas 
Hey hey happy New Year too 

When the ball drops in Manhattan 
And he leans his head in close to yours 
And your heart speeds up and your palms sweat honey listen 
Well he’s in your eyes and you taste his breath 
But there’s something you’re probably missing 
Cause you shouldn’t be kissing who you’re kissing 

Hey hey merry Christmas 
Hey hey happy New Year too 

I spent last year trying to make things right, but 
Sometimes I try to fight 
New York City remains a light in the dark 
I need a thread to sew my broken heart 
So much leaving and returning 
So many ambitious dreams 
Sometimes leave me empty 
Sometimes leave me stumbling 

When your mother calls to say happy New Year 
Remember all the moments we shared 
I’ll be singing in a bar with some friends quite aware 
That you’re not there 
I hear the man in your mouth isn’t in your heart 
I hope you find a way to tell him the truth 
And remember the pace of its rhythm when it was me and you

At home from school my best friend was there 
If I recall correctly 
I thought, ""Oh my god Gaddafi has bombed us from a tiny country"" 
Far away though I didn't know where Libya was exactly

Could be the impact of the crew compartment slamming into the water 
Could be a car wreck, a violent attack, or something genetic from your father

Rue Snider,"Hey, I can't wait to make you dinner and hear about your escapades 
Hey, do you know I really love you and you bring a smile to my face? 
Hey, remember when we were almost strangers in the bar by your old place? 
Those days when I would take a car to see you 
And you would hold me while it rained 

We've come so far I know it's strange 
To love you now but in a different way 
To want you to hold me just so I can feel safe 
I'm grateful for today 
I'm grateful for you and me 

Hey, may you play shows in every season and may people know your name 
Hey, may you have whiskey to fill your belly and healthy food upon your plate 
Hey, may you kiss all the girls you want to ‘til one becomes your darling 
Then when your soul is overflowing write happy songs to her for me 

We've come so far I know that it's strange

Rue Snider,"Remember the night with the knife? 
That memory feels like a dream 
Those years we couldn't quit drinking 
When we pledged our love by the sea 
There were forces stronger than the ocean

We were young, too young to know the truth was 
We were never gonna have those babies

Rue Snider,"I might have sent you the wrong message
When I didn’t try to kiss you
But darling I wanted to taste your mouth
And feel your body soften as I pulled you closer to me
Then gently laid you down onto the couch

Breathing heavy for the first time
Touch your skin you start to moan
Your heat could burn the house down on its own

Moving in rhythm like you’re moving me
With that angel voice and those guitar strings
Moving in rhythm like you’re moving me
Moving in rhythm like you’re moving me

Don’t know why the trepidation
Like I didn’t want to kiss you
Like I just came around to share some songs
Not speaking out loud about your beauty
Or your eyes that cut right through me
Wishing you could teach me to be strong

Breathing heavy for the first time
Touch your skin you start to moan

Rue Snider,"This isn’t where I thought we would be 
Half a decade deep celebrating white supremacy
Fear is an easy sell, like reality TV
Evangelicals chose the candidate of bigotry, the hypocrisy

Privilege is ignition
It burns in the alt-right
These are people who think women should be in kitchens
These are people still against miscegenation who think white men are maligned
And they speak their minds
So I’ll speak mine

When you politicize reproductive rights 
You threaten the lives of people that I love
When your immigration line is that it’s deportation time
You threaten to destroy families that I love

Dr. King dreamed about equality this morning I woke up and I felt like that dream died
The successor to my county’s first black president
Is a KKK supported climate change denying misogynist who lies
Seventy two percent of the time 
It still makes me cry

What do you say to the kids that wake up today
Who aren’t Christian, white, able-bodied, and straight
It’s hard to teach them to love even in dissent
When ridicule is embraced by the president

So now we’re standing in the present naval gazing at the past
Depending on where you’re standing
It might not look that bad, if that’s the case you’ve been had
We can never go back

Ruff Endz,"Gonna tell you a story,
Where does love go, where does love go, baby.
Say you want to find love in her.
Listen love, listen closely,
So I'll tell you something.

I've been thinking to myself, what the hell I did wrong.
Always in a relationship that, that never last long.
Let me tell you a little story, about someone I met.
A situation so trifling that, that I'd never forget.

So I met this girl and, she seemed so right.
I got so caught up by, what was on outside.
As time went on, I really got to know.
That the girl I thought was an angel, was nuttin' but a hoe.
My homie tried to warn me, but I was too caught up.
I started tripping on my best friend, I told him shut the fuck up.
I said ""You don't know what yer talkin' 'bout, this girl loves me.""
But as quiet as kept, she was lovin' everybody else.

Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Somebody now tell me now, baby.
Cause I can't seem to find true love no more.
I can't seem to find baby,
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Cause I can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.

Listen to this,
I still wasn't trying to hear,
What my man was kickin' in my ear.
Heard the same gossip, down in a barber shop,
But I still didn't hear.
I had to find out, found out the hard way,
Til my man called me up on phone, this is,
This is was what he said.
""You remember what I told ya, about your girlfriend
Saw her down at Kiesha's party,
Drove off with a nigga named Ronnie.""
""Uh un, this can't be true.""
""But this what is I, been trying to tell you,
That the woman you love, just trying to play you all day!""

So I left work early, trying catch this girl.
Driving all over town, I couldn't find my girl.
I finally gave up, and, I took my ass home.
That's when I found my girl, laying with Ronnie,
They was getting it on, tell me.

Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Somebody now tell me now, baby.
Cause I can't seem to find true love no more.
I can't seem to find baby,
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Cause I can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.

Somebody tell me, tell me, I said tell me.
Somebody show me, show me, you gotta show me.
Somebody tell me, tell me.
Where does love go from here, where does love go.
Somebody tell me, tell me, I said tell me.
Somebody show me, show me,
Somebody tell me, tell me.
Where does love go from here, somebody sing it.

Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Somebody now tell me now, baby.
Cause I can't seem to find true love no more.
I can't seem to find baby,
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Cause I can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.

Can't somebody tell me, somebody show me,
I want to find, I need to find true love and peace of mind.

I want to find,

I'm trying to mend the wounds of my broken heart
It's hard to believe that your really gone
It's hard to really accept it and move on

There's times I feel all hope is gone
I'm wanting embrace from your loving arms
But I must try and start all over again
And know that within myself I have strength

Look to the hills, look to the mountains
From you in the storm, you can find strength
I know the hurt and pain that you cry
And no matter what goes on the sun will shine

There's a lot of things I wanted to tell you
A lot of more getting to know you
But through God, I believe I can talk to you
And tell you that I'm always missing you

Sometimes I get so lonely
And it seems like life ain't worth living for
When hurt and pain is all you feel inside
You go to look to the hills and say ""I will survive""

Look to the hills, look to the mountains
From you in the storm, you can find strength
I know the hurt and pain that you cry
And no matter what goes on the sun will shine

When you're down and out and there's no way out
And you think that hope is gone
Lift your head up high and be strong and

Look to the hills, look to the mountains
From you in the storm, you can find strength
I know the hurt and pain that you cry
And no matter what goes on the sun will shine

To share with you these feelings that I'm feeling now 
It's been three years since I've known you 
Nothing but happiness since I've found you 

Its been a long time coming still going strong 
Through good and bad we've been holding on 
Within my soul its been overdue 
'Cause my hearts been longing to ask you

Will you be mine on this day 
Will you be the sun shining may 
Will you be the stars and my nights 
Will you be the joy, the joy in my life 
Will you be my everything 
Will you be the happy every song I sing 
Will you be the love I can't deny 
Will you be the love, the love of all time 
Will you be mine 

When I think about how it all began 
I was looking for fun but somehow we became 
Good friends 
We couldn't see this fate that lied ahead 
Or that we would ever bond like we did 

I praise the day my fate was revealed 
Now I know that destiny is real 
Is it a sin for love to feel this good 
I don't think but I'm asking you

I'm down on my knees to vow to you 
My everlasting love because its overdue 
For all the times we shared and those to come 
Is ever still coming

You, it doesn't matter what I say or do
Cause every step I take leads to you
And now I realize it's true
The only love for me is you
It doesn't matter how far I roam
Cause every road I take leads back home
And now the fact is absolute
The only love for me is you

I thought I needed time and space
But baby that was just a front
I never knew how much we had
Until I almost gave it up

I was so blind that I could not see
It was all in our history
Everything I wanted love to be
Had been given to me by

Chorus

Thank you for being a friend
And giving me one more chance
I'm so glad you wouldn't let it end
And I'm lost within your sweet romance

I was a fool to ever let you go
Being away made the feeling grow
Now all I want to do is show you
How much I'm in love with

Showed me what my heart is for
And now you're the one I want to be with forever more

To me, the niggas with the most money, is the cheapest 
Want to give me money off the book? Daddy you can keep it

Verse One: 

Couldn't live the life I live 
Why's that 
I could die any minute  I get high every minute 
Fuckin' with snake niggas  and sleepin' with foul bitches 
Came through on the lightest whip with two pounds in it 
Pull over where the hustlers be 
Why's that 
Cause I get chills when you talk of hustlin' Gs 
So I'm always where the powder be at 
What it mean 
I can blow five bricks to ten in an hour if that 
Stay away from where the cowards be at 
Why's that 
Time is money god, and you can't get an hour back 
Or I would do it again to get the power back 
Have godfather status, make niggas bow to that 
You can all shine and glitter and keep the ones 
Fives and tens, for twenties and up, we dummy it up 
Make a lot of money, and look bummy and what 
Cause money ain't shit, respect is everything 
So if I kill niggas dead, don't ask me shit 
I take blunts to the head, so don't pass me shit 
I'd rather die from a bullet, than a nasty bitch 
If the good die young, all that mean to me 
is that the hood die young/ We call it the last days 
What you know about coppin a house to fight pits in 
Or blowin' weed smoke on the cops that write tickets 
Henny and what, shit we can semi it up 
With your picture on the wall, in memory of 
Stay in sync with the hood, gray minks with the hood 
We tryin' to get money like chinks in the hood 
They ask me how I'm doing now 
I tell 'em better than them 
And if your man front 
He can get eleven in him 
And if you told them once 
Then you better tell him again 
Ay yo, now let's see 
Who you know fuckin with Sheek Luc, Jadakiss, 
And S' paper

From dope money to rap money, and back to dope money (C'mon)

All my niggas will die over dope money (Let's go) 
Bust your nine niggas, Side by side niggas (C'mon) 
We hit the ?wreek? of law, Run and hide niggas (Let's go) 
Death is the only thing that might divide niggas (C'mon) 
So don't fuck around with them Ryde or Die niggas (Let's go) 

Verse Two: 
So we speakin', all I know your face will be leakin' 
I rap full time and still pump bass on the weekend 
A nigga hoppin' all over the map 
And what you learn 
That niggas with long paper take longer to crap 
That's why every chance I me a gat 
And why you rather buy you a chain 
I aim at your brain 
Nigga, robbery is all we know, so how we gon go broke 
When we can just take all y'all dough 
And then fly out to Cuba, and get in the coke fields 
Die off the buddha, fifty and fifty mill 
Bring drama cause Gianconna got Kennedy killed 
If you come through in a jet, you frontin' wit us 
Cause when the coke price was up 
It was nuthin to us 
We got blocks full of heroin 
Weed and dust/ Seen bullets pop off 
Cause of greed and lust 
And when the big dogs die 
Who gon feed the pups 
My niggas is here, so you know the circle is tight 
I circle the block, and cut off the lights 
Pray to Christ 
Cause when the cops come in, we carry shotguns 
Dem niggas with the most ice, get the hot ones 
Stay on your job, nigga I'ma stay on mine 
And if I lose my voice nigga, I'ma flow online

Well guess what mommy? I heard the same, You heard the name

(Jigga) What's my mother fucking name?

Got a license to kill so I stay the gat
Roc-a-fella, Ruff Ryders, nigga scared a that
Got a new motto this year, Don't Fuck With My Ones
Knock on your door, three in the morning, ""It's just us and our guns!""
See I scrambled with priests, hustle with nuns
I got the mind capacity of a young Butch Cassidy
Niggas get fly, let 'em defy gravity
Four-five rapidly lift your chest cavity
Streets won't let me chill
Always been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill
Mother fuckers wanna wet me still, I remain ya'll
Raw, the one, like five divided by four
Shit, this just the hate that's been provided by ya'll
Reciprocated and multiplied by more
You likely to see Jigga in a Wide Body or
Drop-top Bently is all, Holla at me ya'll

I don't give a fuck if I sold one or one million, but I think you should
Cause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood
The all black, in the gloves, the outcome ain't good
Them niggas act like wolves, how come? They could
Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash
Till the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass
All I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn de'Glass
Let me sit up in they whip till I launch it back
Snap they neck, then shoot 'em till they aren't sent back
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back
Monster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that
And everybody sing-a-long to the track, Come on

They tryin they comin' for my head po (uh) 

They're tryin' to put pressure on a nigga 

Huh  short notice (uh huh) 

Got sumpin' for them niggaz though (uh huh) 

Yo 



[Verse 1] 

I'm like the Dow Jones of rap  my stocks is high 

And it never was all of  so stop the lies 

Mothafuckas'll blow your brains out  and watch you bleed 

The same niggaz that you trust, let 'em watch your seed 

You got a dead niggaz, money don't stop the greed 

That's why now I gotta rock my vest, pop my 3 

And whoever die first, may god forgive 

the nigga who lives, sometimes you gotta handle your biz 

To my niggaz when I die, keep inhalin' the lye 

And come to my wake high, when your tellin' me bye 

What goes around comes around, am I comin' or goin'? 

All i'm tryin' to do is leave you numb, gunnin' or flowin' 

I might cock-back the gauge, and start shootin' at 'cha people 

I'm lookin for the devil 'cause money's the root of evil 

And 'Kiss won't be happy 'til my bezel look see-through 

Until I flood N-why with pediquo and diesle 

Catch me with the top, off my whip 

Bust my gun while it's still tucked so you could hop, off my dick 

I run with a few parolees, all thieves, that rocks ice 

Blue pacholies and rolies 

At the mob meetin', keep quite when the God speakin' 

Squeeze my joint, 'til my mothafuckin' palm squeakin' 

And nevermind who the lox'll sign to (that's right) 

What difference do it make nigga? 

Just listen to the tape nigga (c'mon) 



[Chorus] 



Jay to the mmwwaa, hustle coke, ryde or die (uh) 

Kiss hand-wash money, let it drip dry (uh-huh) 

Jay to the mmwwaa, keep cowards on their toes (yeah) 

Kiss push the drop, rock the ice, get the hoes (uh) 

Jay to the mmwwaa got the smash on the block (uh-huh) 

Kiss got the label's tellin' niggaz not to drop (tell 'em) 

Everthing you get (uh-huh), you really don't expect (naw) 

'cause when you Jay to the mmwwaa, you kiss to the death 



[Verse 2] 

Yeah, Yo, Yo 

I want to know, is the promise land heaven or hell? 

'cause the niggaz that made promises, most of them fell 

If you hungry, then I got some niggaz servin' the shells 

With no sauce, and they silver, only take one to kill you 

It's a small world, so you better guard your secrets 

And it's easy to get money, but it's hard to keep it 

Never was the one that like to hound no bitch 

All I do is try to keep niggaz around me rich 

Screw all-a-y'all cowards, I consider you lames 

Had to save my lunch money just to get in the game 

That was back when I used-ta have a mean back-spin 

And no mack-10, it was just bats then 

you know, beat a nigga down, take his rope 

Now we-a, heat a nigga down, take his coke 

And you can call me if you want to bye them thangs 

I get 'em half-price 'cause papi know my name 

Call me, Jay to the mmwwaa 

And everything you got in your livin room, I got in my car 

'Cept for the bar 

I try to put a little money away 

'cause you know they say, tomorrow ain't promised today 

Either bubblin' or strugglin', nuttin between 

Or have a grimie nigga like me, fuckin' ya Queen 

And the Kiss only do shit with niggaz I know (that's right) 

And the outside nigga can't fuck up my flow (c'mon)

Smack you in public and embarrass you slut what?
Put you on punishment the same way I do to my son

You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon

Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggaz is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a backdraft
cause my fire retirin, aight then

Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a I love a slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I cant control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I
Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, one niggaz shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

Bomb shell just a second, mami wanna speak out
What I need in my life, make ya body freak out
Baby seem like the type, married niggaz sneak out

Boss type hold it down, wantin' all of y'all
Callin' y'all never chasin' me down
Three weeks, heartbroken, yes, you hatin' me now

She speaks soft spoken, till she datin' the clown
I'm takin' 'em down, reel 'em in and makin' em drown
Mistake, I said gimme that, but I'm takin' it now
What I need from a nigga, negative in his sound

Or dasity even askin' me, for ass, I laugh
This bitch is fast and free, swatin' 'em off
When I see this niggas a flea, plotin' of cost for riches
Millionaire wannabe, uh huh

Brick house stallion, think you taming me right?
Not this baby Val Philly streets, they raisin' her right

Keep it pretty or can make it gritty be a lady
Need boots pocket books and a baby 380
But prefer to keep it, calm and cool
When I'm heated I suggest you move
Just avoid a bad situation, what you got to prove?

Leave her be, chicken squakin' hatin' frequently
Manic Man is obsessed and stalkin' me
If he, icy enough, I'm pricin' his stuff
Be nicy enough , to let him spin, I'm callin' ya bluff

Puttin' it down, Ruff Ryders puttin' they work
Snatched up the illest viscous pittbull in a skirt
Makin' em hurt, haters steady dishin' up dirt
Changin' the game, settin' the rules, makin' it work, uh

All of this fame I'm hungry, hope you cats is prepared
Niggas, set me up and I'mma take it and run
Think it's a game, just check out how my format is done

Stalkin' ya shine and I do it to perfection
Made a promise everytime I touch the mic to bless 'em
Used to tease me how I keep is greezy just to test 'em
Eve handcuff niggas but I don't arrest 'em

Shorty bang, hear the niggaz sayin'
Shout my name, make the thugish niggas scream
Watchin' me entertain, dicks brick when I like the lips
Just keepin' it plain
Fantasizin' about this bitch, got 'em goin' insane

Ooh's and ahh's ,5'7"" thick in the thighs
Every thugs dream wife, see the love in they eyes
My time to shine, whole package make her a dime
Want some more? It ain't over, just keep pressin' rewind, uh

Ruff Ryders,"[Eve]
Alright now get your guns
Ain't no stopping me
Need the whole cash bundled up for me and my bitches shopping spree
The robbery, damn ya smart, and you guessed right in me

Asking all those questions gonna was to set you up right
Wet 'em all, pretend I'm Jada, lata set it off
Cartier, Rolley, time frozen get 'em all
Dingling medallions, all that glisten is mine

And all that bitchin' that you doing
I got you kissin' this nine

Y'all niggas, worst than bitches, tears in your eyes
I ain't got no sympathy so if you scared, nigga cry

On your knees, face in chest, lips shut
Fuck the mask, we're robbing you in lipstick and wigs, what?
Yeah we brawl, but you took me out and let me see it all
Braggin' 'bout the shit you got and now I get it all

Matter of fact, take your clothes off, I like it when they're bare
Everything from iceberg to silk Dolce underwear, come on

[Chorus]
Hey yo check that nigga cause we on that shit
Get out your ride fool cause we on that shit
Hid your stash box cause we on that shit
Run that ice cause we on that shit
Keep a loaded clip cause we on that shit
Ryde or die nigga cause we on that shit
We out to get it all cause we on that shit
And Eve don't play cause she takes no shit

[Eve]
Uh, yo, yo, yo
I shoot backing out, P max them out
And the only way I don't get shit is if you stash the house
Professional bitches, destined for riches and precious jewels

Distracted by the size of my ass, had you fooled
I ain't getting' nada, forget that
Just sit back and watch me take everything even you're drough sack
Yeah my bitch can roll with,

Expensive paintings on your wall, gimme that
Ain't no slacking, time ain't a factor
I'm a get it all
Used to ball with your niggas

Now I'm making you crawl across the floor
Ego crushed and I don't give a fuck
Small change to the range, heard what I said
Give it up

I know it ain't right, but me and my bitches gotta eat tonight
And every night from now on, get it right
Why, why ask why?
I'm simply living and I get what I want
By simply taking or you're simply giving

[Chorus]

[Eve]
Y'all niggas fagottish
Cops spot me got me running out my kiss
Unlatch the ice pieces on my neck and wrist
Screeching in the streets from the five series to a ditch

I'm fast, he'd have to waste it and I ain't scared to blast
Ducking, jumping over shit, bet this bitch could last
Ready for war, act like I ain't done this shit before
Practice on me next week, I'll be wanting more

Best believe you ain't gonna live to see tomorrow
My dogs already warned your mother
She'll be full of sorrow
Busting through the door, somebody's house, kids screaming

I ain't gonna front somehow I wish that I was sleeping, dreaming
Too late it's done now, all you hear is gun sounds
Cock back, pop, pop, pop, and I'm like what now
Ghetto bird on me, weaving through the trees

Last fence I hopped over, fell and landed on my knees
Barrels at my temple, hey yo fuck it I'ma make it simple

And ya'll niggaz can't block my shells
When I'm in jail the C.O. don't lock my cell
Before any rap group, we was the L.O.X. crooks
I'll slap a hundred dollars on the whole blocks books
And know the block shook, when I walk by
Niggaz just like you they rather not look
I inspired why'all niggaz to flow
I'ma always get money so I admire ya'll niggas that blow
Ask ya self who the nicest out right now
Put your ice up lets get on the mic right now

Where lightning and thunder at

[Styles]
If you runnin with the P. you gonna get your turn
Tuck my gun while its hot to feel my dick hair burn
Might come through the spot where the shottie and what
Body to block and hot want to the Bacardi wit rocks

Became a man at 6 cause at 5 you learned
Don't take nothin for granted except death
Man of the house cause you the last nigga left

Hope the Lord got your soul cause your ass is mine
Every time you turn around niggas know that I be right there
East turned to West coast, cravin for the nightmare
Don't give a fuck about what you sling 
Cause you ain't slingin that shit, or bringin that shit 
Up the hill, but you still singin that shit
Talkin shit like you know what its like to walk this shit
Get on some stalkin shit 
So you know what niggaz rule New York and shit
I'm just thinkin all the business and how to handle ya'll niggaz
All the families that I got lightin candles for niggaz
Breathin revelence, grandmothers fallen out and need the sedatives
Mom huggin the casket wishin that she raised a better kid

When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick
I avalanche your camp with, ten feet of snow
I'm cold blooded, my fam half-eskimo
My flows move like indo
Turn ten nickels to ten loads, outta ten sto's
Ride the crash course, do the math on it

But I'm on it, grillin with George Foreman
Ya peeps is at the Grammy Awards cornin
The ice, the fat wallet son, I want it
And the helicopter warmin before mornin

Got - ""fuck ya momma"" on my sweat band nigga

Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror
Scoop a high yellow Cinderella, Meth forever

I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind
Tryin to relight ya lime
It's a crime when I drop bomb lines designed
To tick, tick, boom blow your mind
Yeah me, M-E-T, H, the O, the D
Can't be done, like tryin to find a penny in the sea

Pull my dart gun and bust sixteen until it's dead

Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
Twenty steps ahead of the rest they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title ""hard""
Me pick of the litter
I was born to bubble why'all
Born to change game shit born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless
Nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve
Eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden
You better dart

Guys that'll roll them dice and win, 

Girls with 'fits that show the skin 
Real niggaz mind your best friend at the pen, 
Real hoes let your best friend know about men 
'Cause I be squeezin' ass 

And will make a full glass disappear like a genie 
Move to the LOX and Beanie, 
While them hoes backin' that thang up on my weenie 
It's like no nigga in the world could see me 

When I Ruff Ryde with Drag-On 
Rollin' up big babies in a Mercedes, 
If you want herb we got bombs 

[Chorus: x2] 
Gotta kick that shit for the fine bitches and all my nugz 
For the ones who smoke pot, do stick ups, and ball in our hood 
What do a nigga say when he say Drag-On and Twista (Wanna kill me) 
Gangsta (Let's ride), hustla (Feel me) 

[Drag-On] 
By know everybody should know, that the kid spit tight, 
And this kid spit fire light 
And the bitch I don' fucked like last night, 
I don't give a fuck 'bout a 2 and a half mic 

'Cause the only muthafuckin' magazine that I read, 
Is when I buy my gun from it 
How many bullets you could digest in that one stomach, 
I suggest y'all run from it 

And the click-click from the calico, I gotta go, 
Make it pimp with a lot of hoes 
I'm the same muthafucka that's countin' that dough, 
Cookin' that coke to a pot of gold 

'Cause my rainbow, is every color top that crackhead cop, 
I don't care I gotta cap me a cop 
As long as I got enough money to cop me a drop, pop enough glocks 
Drag open up boots by watchin' co-op's in convo at condos 

Keep the heat up in jeeps, in case y'all creep up on me 
I run up on y'all in a cab with a meter on me 
And the only on leavin' is me 
And the only one bleedin' is you, tryin' to breeze with me 

All the Roc is E-N-why-see-E, in the NYC with the white T 
All I really do is argue, 
Double F, are-why-D-E, D-are-A-G, to the dash O-N 
Catch me, smokin' potent, bet it leave y'all, niggaz soakin', 
With your insides open

Err!! 
Hold the fuck up! 
Slow down!

[Chorus: x2]

[Twista] 
Whether murder or bouncy beat, my flow be philosophical 
Smokin' on tropical, achievin' all missions impossible 
When I up the block at you, I'ma pop at you 
If your momma cry there's nothin' I could do 

Should not've fucked with Mr. Illogical 
When I'm in to clubbin', clubbin', shake it don't you break it 
You booty to shapey, can't take it, want to see you naked 
I don' drunk a boo muthafucka, so you know I'm lit up 
Everybody get up, spin witha a Twista, it's a stick up 

[Drag-On]
This where the shit pick up, let me load this clip up, 
Lust pour me some liquor, Flame-On and Twista, 
Let's see if you murdered who'll miss ya 
I love the dirty south, that's why I gotta dirty mouth 

That will burn you out 
Tell your bitch I got a dick that'll turn her out, 
Especially when I tell her turn around 
I don' hurt her now 

Shit will come back, and I think it's time to get murdered now 
I'm tired of silly clowns, spittin' out weak shit, sound like my shit 
You gon' make me pull a all nighter 
Standin' infront of your crib with that gasoline and that lighter 

Now hit, we won't miss ya, Drag-On and Twista

You don't gotta slap me five or give me a hug 
And it hurts when you gotta kill a nigga you love
But I'm gone deal wit my enemies sooner
Cause I got'em looking for my solo album like Kennedy Jr.
Fuck crush ice, go head and get your shine on
I'm bout to cop rocks that why'all niggas can climb on
Don't worry bout why I ain't got mine on
I want some new shit, I don't want nothing that you can tell time on
Things ain't all good right now 
Cause some more niggas die an turn all you in the hood right now
why'all can stop acting like that nigga J gone squeeze
Cause all I got is misdeameanors and some ACD's
why'all gon make me lay something down I promise
And Puff wear scarmas and listen to Carl Thomas

I'm always that, I'm always this
But the floor stay nasty like hallway piss
If you here the P spitting it's a deep ass song
When I die mama bury me wit street clothes on
Cause drama be the threapy, the beef goes on
should've been speaking out of it makes it a lot
But I was fucking wit the savages, kicking the drop
Live for the money, die for my niggas, run from the law
Catch me smoking my weed or fucking your whore
Push my whip to the limit kind of hoping it flip
Throw my clip to the tip kind of hoping you flip
I feel sorry for the crackheads, but happy for myself
So I got mixed feelings about this hussling shit
I keep saying I'm gone quit after a couple of bricks
But I can't stop building and I don't pop children
But I got no problem kidnapping a bitch

But you walkin the wrong way to really mean it
I done heard it, I done seen it, don't get caught up in between it

It's a dark road you walkin on, same street that I be stalkin on
Suppose to be quiet, but you keep talkin on
Now ya mouth got you in some shit
So we goin' let everybody see your gangsta ass get smaked like a bitch

Guess I'll remind y'all niggas, I can find y'all niggas
Click click, what's up, walk up right behind y'all niggas
Once the four four hit' you
You ain't going no where but out the door on a stretcher

Boy, I'm a get you
Wet y'all niggas up like a pool
'Cause I done told you, y'all goin' MAKE ME LOSE MY COOL
Yo Knock get the glock, these bitch niggas is actin

left them bitches blind, hit 'em up from behind
Yeah, that's how you do that
And he had such a good head up on his shoulders, but I blew that

Fuck you black, you new cats don't know somethin important
You die quick fuckin' with my shit, and my shits extortin'

I drop jewels that y'all cats can't afford to keep missin'

Shits about to get real out of hand dog, betta get ya man dog
Rap shit comes second, I'm a show you what a robber do

Dog it ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste

'Cause he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, YES
Ain't a whole lot to braking a nigga down fast

They call me black 'Cause that's how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin thing going down 'til I eat
So can I beef? You betta while you still got teeth

'Cause they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Popped out, through a you know what
'Cause you know why, and you know my

You heard it from the P, you oughta know it's the truth
I get you kidnapped and raped and thrown off a roof
You could nod your head to this like it's only a rap
'Cause when these bullets hit yo' ass I'm like it's only a gat

I need a funeral to feel good, I'm hopin it's yours
Think he religious? Heard he got shot in the cross
Holiday Styles, bitch I broke most of the laws
Fuck with the Porsche or flip to the boots, stick to the truth

Do anything it takes just to get me this loot
And missin' a tooth, but both of 'em chipped, toaster is gripped
You heard about the trouble, I start most of the shit
When I squeeze ain't no controllin' the wrist

And niggas leave the room when they hear the P flowin to Swizz
I'm an ignorant and negative nigga
I sell crack, bust guns, pop shit, and say I'm better than niggas
You think not, I'll look at your man and level a nigga

If you think a rapper's better why don't you give me his name
So I can run up on him, tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets, I'm the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters, but I'm bigger than why'all

If I left the gun home, I'ma give you the sword
I'm the devil in the flesh, I can't give you the Lord
It don't make no sense for you to pray for your life
I got my niggas in the crib, you oughta pray for your wife

Yo..
I do it all for my niggas, even ride wit a bomb

It's a million dollar bail, I'ma get it in cash

I sell crack like it's '88, I live in the past
You know the P carry the gun, live in the Maz'
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash
I like Malibu and pineapple, fifties of hash

Hundreds of 'dro, wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor, catch me right next to the dog
I'm Holiday Styles, and that's what the weaponry for
And I probably won't blow for the fact that I'm hard

But I'm good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Gettin' jewels from the old timers, stashin the cards
But jail ain't part of the plans

I keep weight on the scale 'cause I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars, I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash 'em up, the boy mighta went platinum but don't gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut

I don't deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes, I don't make mistakes
Double are now bitch you oughta know I'ma ghost
Blow up your face, blow up the coke, and blow up the smoke

So when y'all go and cop vests cop one for your mother too
And I'm way better than them other dudes
But I'm stuck wit, what I'm stuck wit, cause I don't suck dick

Sat with the players and I stood with the coaches
And I'm a always be in the hood like roaches
Flow is ferocious, dough is ferocious
Two guns by each lung with no holsters

And I control all the fish scale in the city
And still make your first week sales look pretty
I come through, all you hear is chip in the muffler
And you could ask anybody if the Kiss is a hustler

J: I always hold it down, gettin bankroll in 4, 5, 6 in trips
S: He's a gangster
J: I always make the paper and the FBI got me on they list, that's why
S: He's a Ruff Ryder nigga, Ryde or Die nigga
J: By the way, did I tell you that my name is Kiss?

And I don't understand how a broke nigga could chill
When a two liter'll dust you so get you a mil
Yes I got loose ends, poppin out the sunroof of the blue M
I'm like Lou Sims

And I'm a make sure they hit you wit both shotties
I think this summer's gon be the most bodies
You never ask a nigga in jail if he chillin
Just make sure you make all the sales in the building

'Cause now niggas think it's all right to tell
And you could put out some garbage and it might could sell
A lot of niggas be petty and sheist
But that's only til you treat 'em like a video and edit they life

This is a threat, when I talk you listen to death
And if I run out of money then my wrist is a bet
And the streets said they wanted more Kiss
Up north niggas pop me in, and do a hundred more dips

[Chorus]

Yo, whether it's dope money or rap money, gamble the shit
Trey pounds of Mauseburgs, handle the shit
Got too big for the city, cops brought in the feds
So we moved across the map and brought in the bread

Niggas chill for a month and a half, no ruckus
Got the pictures of baggers and all of the gun busters
And you know how it go, 'cause it rarely'll change
Everybody got a license and a alias name

We don't smoke when we hustle and none of us talk
Back to back til we home, we can front in New York
'Cause some of us is runnin' from court
Smokin' weed, mumblin' thoughts

Tryin' to stay humble for shorts
We could do this the mob way and kiss you on both cheeks
Or do it the hard way and shoot through your gold teeth
Stand on any block, play cee-lo and craps
And break niggas for they pack money, then give it back, uh

Make them think the car drivin itself, and I'm in the passenger seat
Signal lights, stashbox, a package of D
Drag dash, I'm happy to be
On, this rap shit is like a jacket to me
I wear it with cracks in my sleeves
So I keep it on, don't never take my jacket off cuz my shit be gone
What are you, lost your mind?
It took my time to cut these dimes
So I could dump drug a few minds, so don't make me bust a few nines

I got more bitches suckin dick, than niggas smokin niks
I got more shit up in my whip, than most niggas got in cribs
I got more, blocks of raw while y'all tryin to stop wars
Coward nigga lock your doors
I'll come through with the locksmith and pop it
With the glock 4 and show y'all what a mouth's for
I got black steel, blue steel, wheels, I mean wheelchair

Didda, getta, gotta, guns we cock it then pop it
Make 'em holler and swallow
Niggas stop it, catch it, all up in his jacket
I'm not a stingy nigga, I'll let a nigga have it
Hate chips that go away, lookin like white coke
Sit in the sun long, come back like french toast
Hair was up, now is down, eyes are black, now is brown
Used to frown, now you smile, nigga must have left you now
Went from bikes to the car, from the cars to the boat
Went from keys to the coke, went from coke to the dope
Went from cracks to the raps, went from bats to the gats
Went from slums to the stats, been to London and back
Me change cuz I rap, I can't do it
I went from muggin y'all to payin niggas to do it
It's all the same stupid
I got cake on cake, cuz I went from pow to pow
Wit my family, two R's, Ryde or Die

Feed y'all niggas more gutters like a mutherfuckin' all you can eat
And make you bounce how poncho will play the congo
And bang on the bongo, free to bounce on the bongo
From New York to Colorado, so just follow
I'm living for today and livin' tomorrow
Open up your mouth, I got somethin' big for you to swallow
Blow you through the chest with a hollow
Like the foul shit you waste and transpired right infront the impalo 
Yo, the general Busta Busta shock and memorable 
You know we precious like minerals, and deadly like burials

Bang out chicks, for fun we bang out whips 
Y'all go to war with revolvers that bang out flicks 
Now find me on two-fifth in the summer when it starts 
And iced up, nice cut, new pair of Jordans
Thinkin' of extortin, nigga your life ain't important 
Your camp hotter than ours?, the fuck y'all snortin'
My thugs bang out bricks, swing, mix, throw dem grams 
Hash smokers, hopin' more and out of soda cans 
(Yo Swizz, I heard you stole), Whoa! listen man
Mindin' my business will make you a missin' man
See the wrist and hand?, got plaques on the wall
And a fifth in hand, I'll put your back on the wall
Nigga don't ask me no more about nuttin' you hear
Just scream and shout and just wild in here

You know I brought my nigga with me
D-Block

Hey yo, it's jay hood bitch respect my bars
The doctors had to piece together your face like a collage
Niggas always talk breezy till the steel come out
And slugs rip through their gums and their grill come out
Motherfuck you and fuck your mans
If I don't clap you in the dome
I'm a leave clips in your diaphragm
I'm the hood prophet
Puff purple instead of chocolate
Stay from around chumps and cowards cause they gossip
And I'm a stay on the corner like stop signs
With a pack of them creamy colored rocks and the glock nine
When you speaking of the hardest nigga
Bring hood's name up
D Block bitch, we about to have the game chained up
My words too strong, bars too powerful
And your towel can't dry you when the dumdums shower you
Your mad because your garbage and your lyrics is boring
And your whip was made that same year you was born in

Listen man, Don't worry how many gats this crook has
Just know I stay strapped like book bags
Bitch is shook ass
You just getting off the porch
And me? I'm just getting off in court
I could make sure your coffin bought
Why would you mention a burner?
There is a difference between rap and attempting to murder
Talking the shit you living and the shit you heard of
You said fuck Larceny?
What is you crazy, bitch?
Before you walk the streets, here's a few safety tips
Watch who you speaking bout and watch who you speaking to
The cats you speaking bout could show you what the heat could do
A respirator is what you'll be breathing through
And you got beef with who that you need toast
The closest you came to beef was meat loaf
When we pose with bats and pea coats
Y'all niggas better be close

To fuck with Cam, y'all bitches better hope and dream
Every gun that I own got a scope and beam
When I approach the things shake the dice, rook the team
Best bitch on the east coast since Queen
Latifah, buy reefer, fly diva
Ride deeper, four pound bump louder than five speaker
Spit fire, hot lava flow
Don't get twisted, I'm not one of them prada hoe's
Catch me in Escada clothes, with a lot of dough
That's not mine, it's his
I need a lot more to live
You got to get the king before the kid
How you think a bitch like me afford to live motherfucker?

That's a bad bitch, shit you a bad ass nigga,
It's the younger generation, killing y'all, live, get busy on these niggas

Hey look, I'm trying to sell mad gravy
So I get birds from my crew and make Erykah Badu my ""Bag Lady""
You that crazy? Squeeze, I know you ain't spitting shells
Your hand shake so much it shows up on the Richter scale
I made the huskiest niggas look like they had sickle cell
I don't just sell bricks, dog I got a bitch for sale
So let me find the nigga that hate us a lot
No coffin, he get buried in the refrigerator box
God damn, I'm a hot man
I'm telling you straight up, I got my weight up
I'm calling my wrists Roxanne
Cause if I wore it in a dark room
You and your man would hate how I look animated like a cartoon
Bottom line, I'm telling you that you ain't fucking with me
Hard, nobody guards, you want a shot, come and get me
I'm not a sucker, nor is any nigga running with me
And why are y'all balling with wheels if they under fifty
nigga

Lock and blocks the motto
Got more slow than Dr. Zhivago
Same mind state that makes a poem rock in Chicago
But I don't get my gangster from movies
I'm a rock star, 5 star tellies, running with gangsters and groupies
Come through and leave a voice sick
Cause my S-type steers with a joystick
I'm the heart in my era
Listen, I lead an autistic life
Paint pictures with my actions, ain't no margin for error
My innate features, leave niggas dismayed, speechless
And please don't mistake weakness for kindness
I fuck with old timers
So don't make me forget that you real and catch Alzheimer's
Motherfucking hoes I spoil them
Remember, I'm known to break a bitch for reckless eyeballing
The top dog, nigga, I'm the bear truth
You want to get math?
Nigga I'm the square root
The rock star

I got mean stash
You seen case get his thug on
I strip my bitch and we get our hug on
She what I put drugs on and get my grub on
And dog, when you park your car, put your club on
The next cat I put the snub on
I'm a clap the gat till it get too hot, and that's with gloves on
You love drawing, you should go to an art school
I get my club on with the glow in the dark jewels
Trees in my shoes, polo in the dark blues
And I spark tools that the po and the narcs use
Fuckers, y'all stupid or something
What's the point in pulling your joint if you ain't shootin at nothing
Dude, fronting will get you banged in the face
If you have braces then you know how the banger will taste
I'm near anything pertaining to cake
Just copped the blue lighting with the rectangular face
Easy

Easy niggas, matter of fact fuck that go hard,
Cass' show these niggas how you built,
grab your guns and bust off, my nigga

Yeah my nigga, it's Cassidy bitch, get the name clear
I'm what you lame steer got the game near
Buy 'caine by the square, sell it by the o
I run through snow like a reindeer
The cool kid, got the coke heads nose red like Rudolf
I grind on the strip so hard I got blue balls
I'd rather knock a q off then get blue off
That's how I stay on my toes like my shoes off
You dudes are soft, really bitch like Ra Paul
When's it's war I move out like U-hauls
I'm a true boss
I send eight balls to the corner
My strip like a pool hall
And I ball like I been in the sport

Don't play around with him boy (why's that)
Cause Cass is a pain in the ass like hemorrhoids

Ice make 'em look like stars, they comin' through
On the bikes, but they look like cars, it's somethin' new
and Jada talk soo good, but 'cha brain is
Nowhere next to ready for this stainless
It's no helpin' you when them thangs melt in you
and way down in Athens, Jada's a bell ringer
I'ma bring the hood to the farm
Bless 'em with some purple hay
Remove the wood from the barn
Introduce them to the yak and cranberry
and make sure Bubba Spark good, then I'm gone
Even if we run the war, I'ma still run the raw
You can come and see me, I got 'em for twenty-four

Boy, silly if you saw them crackers ridin' with them pigs
and thought I might would hit this robe for less than twenty-five a gig
Doin' sixty-five, I sled off acid and shitty bourbon
Took a minute to adjust, but right now this big shit is workin'
I'm white just by chance, but I'm country by God's graces
Nowadays I find myself doin' laundry in odd places
But still, I keep it Bubba even into Mr. Kiss and them
Brought 'em down to Athens, let 'em cut with my sister's friend
Now we gettin' blist again, back on the block in Yonkers
and Tim done laced a track, man this shit is hot as bonkers
Kiss, not to flaunt ya, but just tell 'em Bed has come here
I'm doin' for my family, but why'all are really done here
But Bubba is the truth and perhaps this is discussion
Of wither I'm that deal or a product of Tim's percussion
why'all know to him is bustin', so just dap me up and frown on
Me and Kiss is necessary, that much you can count on, yeah

How did him and Bubba rise from this dirt and this cow feces?
To show you folks the hope for this changin' shall be me
Notice how he see, the picture for it's painting
and poured you up of this mixture before it was tainted
See I was rydin' ruff only when me and D became aquatinted

Them Arabs, fuck a gat, I use a knife
Keep my dick sucked like, straws in soda
Why'all know the deal like, cards and poker, huh?

Niggaz want to look at my chest, nigga watch your eyes
Cause, drag'll give you his change and give you a surprise
Cause when I ride, I put a heart in them niggaz and get 'em live
Then let my toast, put the ghost in niggaz and watch it rise
Yeah I look out for my niggaz, but I'm not a town hero
When I walk, I set fire to the floor like ground zero
I'm the reason niggaz jumpin out of buildings, shit
They better let that hard ground kill 'em then they run down sizzlin
Got a hundred hidden guns in the wall where I live
So the only way I'm fightin for the wall is they comin to my crib
Double-are motherfucker, we runnin this shit
Cause every time we put in our guns why'all runnin and shit, bitch

Listen, I wasn't born with stats, but I might stand while why'all was young
I used to be on the cheese line cause I was born to be a rat
My race is like a pizza pie, why'all can get a slice
And it won't be just them arabs runnin around with they face wrapped
So if you a thug - throw these slugs!
And not at my vest, throw it at my mug
Cause my niggaz'll get why'all back, love is love
Cause we all family and nigga blood is blood
I never back down, I put backs on grounds
That'll make your mother pull out that all-black gown
Man fuck this track, listen to how I sound
That's your block, that's your city, that's your town?
Bladoooow! it's mines now

You cats, talk slick but walk quick when the dog hit
The dog hits coming back to the raw shit
Aww shit they done let me back out the gate
Back out to tape back out to rape
Back off the chains so please back out the way
Before I blow ya back out with this fuckin AK
Don't give a fuck what a nigga say no matter who he sound like
Make sure you know what the rain is but its gonna be coming down like
Cats and dogs hold up it is cats and dogs
Keep fucking with the dog its gonna be cats in the morgue

Most y'all killers ain't even twenty- two years old

Stop but don't hate 'cause everybody got a lil blood to donate
Thugs'll go ape the women'll come around
Shortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down
It's just raspy nothin on the neck wrist ware just classy
No way I'm letting this money just get past me

His only choice was distributing the rock like Def-jam 
While everybody else was getting diplomas 
He graduated from the middle of the strip to the corner 
But I don't knock him cause he tryin' to bubble 
There's no food on the table, the rents past due and that's why he hustles

Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 

Now baby girl's got a promising future 
But her moms passed away while she was younger and her father's a loser 
He'd always abused her but what else you expect from a coward 
He wasn't even proud when she got accepted to Howard 
And even though she loves college everyday it would stress her 
But it wasn't cause of exams or she hate her professor 
It was her financial situation here she couldn't pay a semester 
And the only means of making it better was totally reversing the role 
Lap dancing working that pole even though deep down its hurting her soul 
And even if it meant taking off her clothes 
She was down for what ever to help her accomplish her personal goals 
And I ain't trippin' off a-how shortie livin'
She gotta pay her tuition put food in the kitchen and that's why she strippin'
And I ain't sayin' I agree with her job but shit times is hard 
I guess I just see eye to eye with her vision you know 

How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets 
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 

Now see the moral of the story is this 
If you ain't tryin' to help stop our troubles then don't knock our hustle 
Cause really at the end of the day its not ya'll struggle 
But you always got something to say 
Well hear this fuck you 
Yeah that's right I'm talking to you come try to sleep in our beds 
Eat off our plates, take a walk in our shoes 
Look at the world from our view try to live by our rules 
Drink the same water we do, put your kids in our schools 
I guarantee you won't maintain your health you'll probably try to end it all 
And hang yourself or bang yourself 
You couldn't possibly understand all pain we felt 
And without folding your hands play the games we dealt 
I'm being real I ain't tryin' to be evil 
Look how we live, look how y'all live 
C'mon be serious how is we equal 
Matter fact I feel I'm wasting my time 
I'm finished writing this rhyme 
Y'all never gonna see eye to eye with my people you know 

How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets 
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way

Ruffians,"There's a crystal view from my window
And I can see years to come
I live for the burn and the sting of pleasure
I live for the sword, the steel, and the gun
I can tear down the walls, storm them barricades
Run to the place where the frightened crawl
Desire lurks beyond good and evil
So dance on the graves where the hammer falls

[Chorus]
Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

You can touch, but please keep your distance
You're innocent and pure and with no shame
The spirit is willing, and the flesh is great
Your teasing your torment with the pleasure of pain

[Chorus]

Heaven and Hell, I know them well
But I haven't yet made my choice
I'm feeling dead 'cause I'm shouting loud
And no one can hear my voice
Walking the tightwire, can't look down
Strung out high, above you all
Faithful wind blows through this land
Howls my name, Hell is my fall.

Ich knalle mir soviel Zeug rein, dass ich tot sein müsste, aber: Prototyp-Junkie
Der erste der Welt, ja, mein Körper ist immun gegen alle Substanzen
Ich rauche das Blech in der Woche um fünf Uhr morgens, wenn du gerade aufstehst
Sie gucken mich an auf der Straße, denn ich hab mich nicht einmal Schlafen gelegt

Ich baller und baller und knalle mir weiter das Zeug rein, ich falle nicht um
Mehrfache tödliche Dosis, man sieht mich mit einer Spritze und dem Gürtel im Mund

Kein Gefühl mehr in den Beinen, doch das Glas will nicht halb leer sein
Kipp mir noch mal mehr ein! Mein Körper ist mein Erzfeind

Doch drei Literflaschen Wodka sollt ein Körper wohl ertragen oder?

Doch wird als Konsequenz noch mal zwei Liter hinterher gekippt
Er hustet, wenn ich rauche
Er muss kotzen, wenn ich saufe
Ich will schlafen, er will nerven
Ich will leben, er will sterben
Ich gib ihm Schläge um zu zeigen wer das Sagen hat
Doch er wehrt sich mit Schmerzen, dieser Hurensohn, ich schlacht' ihn ab
Was will er machen mit dem Messer an sei'm Hals
Ich nehm' sein' Kopf in beide Hände und schlag ihn auf den Asphalt
Und nach dem Knall fällt er zu Boden, zuckt und Blut beginnt zu laufen
Und mir wird schwarz vor meinen Augen

Arme wie ein Grizzly, Drogenschnelltest wie ein Regenbogen
Statt zum Arzt zu gehen bin ich nur unterwegs um E's zu holen
Die guten sterben jung, ich sterbe auch wenn ich's nehm
Aber ich denk, das ist ganz klar Zukunfts-Hauke's Problem
Die letzten Jahre ha'm mehr Lücken als mein Lebenslauf
Früher tat mir der Kopf nur weh, heut fallen mir die Zähne raus
Wenn mein Hurensohn von Körper nicht so macht wie ich will
Bestraf ich den Spast mit Schnaps und paar Pillen und lasse mich grillen
Sodass mein Gesicht beim klarkommen aussieht wie ein Pferdekuss

Dass die Zähne rumgeflogen sind wie Pusteblumensamen
Habe den Lehrern dann erzählt ich wäre hingefallen beim Fangen spielen (naja)
Weil man das macht, wenn man misshandelt wird
Hab vor meinen Eltern meine Fresse gehalten
Und jede schlaflose Nacht gehofft auf bessere Zeiten
Hab von Columbine gehört und wusste, dass ich nicht alleine bin
Hab mir im selben Jahr vom Weihnachtsmann 'ne .45 gewünscht
Zu klein, zu dick, zu seltsam, schreie schweigend diese Welt an
Und werd' wieder abgeholt von mein' verzweifelten Eltern

Nein, ihr seid nicht stark, denn ihr seid schwach ja, weil sie sich in Gruppen sammeln
Und sich dann plötzlich für unbesiegbar oder King Kong halten
Und dann suchen sie sich Leute aus, die nicht gerade die Stärksten sind
Alleine seid ihr auch schwach, weil ihr euch dann nicht mehr wehren könnt
Und sowas ist mir damals auch mal passiert
Auf dem Schulhof wurde ich angespuckt und dann schikaniert
Doch ich habe mich gewehrt und ihnen Grenzen gezeigt
Ich lass das nicht mit mir machen, ganz egal wie viele ihr seid
Und nach dem Schulunterricht haben sie dann auf mich gewartet
Mit fünfzehn Leuten auf mich losgegangen und mich geschlagen
Danach hab ich mir ganz alleine jeden Einzelnen gepackt
Und ihnen beigebracht, dass man mit mir sowas bestimmt nicht macht

Zu jung um zu verstehen, was man ihm antut
Zu dumm um zu gestehen, dass man sein Leben vor die Wand fuhr
Den Stolz zweier Elternteile mit Scheiße beschmutzt
Und, ja, ich schäm mich bis heute für jeden Schlag auf die Brust
Und er verfiel in Depressionen als er älter wurd'

Guten Tag, die Herren

Ich fahre durch die dreißiger Zone mit hundertzwanzig km/h
Und plötzlich seh ich im Rückspiegel die scheiß Cops hinter mir fahren
Aber ich halte nicht an, dass könnt ihr Fotzen vergessen
Denn mein Turn ist grad auf dem Höhepunkt von Crack, Speed und Acid
Ich habe Bock auf richtig Action werd das einfach ignorieren
Mit Blaulicht und Sirene wollen die mich zum Halten animieren
Dann werd ich ihre Reaktionszeit und Reflexe mal testen
Mit Vollgas bieg ich links ab doch vorher den Blinker Rechts setzen
Dass sie sich krass überschätzen war mir von Anfang an klar
Durch mein Manöver sind sie frontal vor die Hauswand gefahren
Und bei der nächsten AVK denk ich mir was anderes aus
Vielleicht bin ich total entspannt oder vielleicht raste ich aus

Beine butterweich, Kiefer hart wie Beton
Guten Tag Herr Kommissar ich habe gar nichts genommen

Guten Tag Herr Kommissar ich habe gar nichts genommen

Ich bin so lang wach, dass ich vergessen ab wie schlafen geht
Sowas passiert wenn wir auf Tour sind und Claus Bahnen legt
Häng irgendwo ab und saufen Tetrapack-Wein
Kenn kein Tag oder Uhrzeit doch da geht noch was rein
Schwestern grüßen mich mit Namen bin auf der Intensiv schon Dauergast
Verpiss dich mit deim Baggy alter, fünfzig Liter blauer Sack
Trainierter Kiefermuskel ich könnte Steine kauen
Wäre mein Mund nicht voller Blasen oder weißen Schaum
Mein Konsum ist wie ein Jo-Jo
Bin ich oben will ich runter, bin ich unten will ich rauf
Was für Therapie? Ich lege Speedborfderlines

Und mein scheiß Führerschein liegt sicher in mei'm Zimmer zuhaus (ganz sicher)
Augen wie ne Sonnenbrille, Arme wie 'n Nadelkissen
Wörter wie Speed sind für mich nicht mehr als Anglizismen (nicht mehr, Alter)
Wer nimmt schon ein bisschen, ich mag Mohnkuchen echt gern
Anders kann ich mir den Strich bei Opiate nicht erklären
Und auch sonst sind diese Drogentests doch nie so genau
Sorry für's sabbern, ab und zu wird mir der Kiefer halt taub
Diese ganze Kifferei fand ich noch nie so berauschend (nie, Alter)
Sicher hab ich ein Rezept für meine Ibu6000
Und ich mein das liegt im Handschuhfach, ein Moment ich schau kurz nach

In einem Erdloch wohnen, ohne Haus und ohne Garten
Oder zwischen Tretminen Streetsoccer spiel'n

Irgendwann drück' ich den Zünder, Mann, ich sterbe dafür

Nie mehr Brainstorm, statt Marker und Flipchart

Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Makin' a livin' off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whippin' on end now

The hurt it brings can't be cured

Just when I thought things were alright
You came and ripped out my heart
My stomach full of butterflies
The thought of you gone, it tears me apart

I remember you and me, when we used to laugh all night
Until we fell asleep
And I know we're through
But I've still got thoughts of you left inside my head
In my head

The love that I had for you is gone..has drifted so far away
But you're still here in my head
And you're still here

On first thinking that you've stolen my heart

I'm giving in to you
I'm lost again

There is no need in crying
There is no need in dying
It makes no difference
Were still alone

Hiding nothing we'll intertwine 
Pressing on till the sun arrives 
Shedding light on a view to save 
Over and over you pull me in with conviction 
You pull me in, I'm caught 

Like a drug, so addictive 
At first that you can't ignore 
Feel you pace, through my veins without a trace 
How I crave for more 
I'm slipping away tonight 
I've become so mesmerized 
I'm burning up inside 

You're the face of my addiction 
I can't hide these good intentions inside 

You're the spark igniting my desire 
And I'm burning up with a touch",Walk Don't Run,2005
Rufus,"[Chorus:]
Don't it feel good to feel
Don't it feel good

And you're not afraid to cry
Don't it feel good

Don't it feel good to be
Don't it feel good
Now that we all agree
Don't it feel good
Learning to know is what helps us show
We've always been the same
And when the walls come tumbling down
Don't it feel good

Don't hide it, it's there within you
You've found it, if you've ever been you
So take it with you

Much warmer thoughts of home

Tellin' the neighbors she's got a grandson

Paving the golden road back home

The closer we get with every minute just tickin' away
Our love has come to see maturity

I washed out our love for all

Our love is so much greater
One million kisses after
We share more love than laughter

we've been through a lot together ? you and I

'cause' I like it that way
But the happiness I know of giving
Equalize or I'd go insane

Now I know that I may have cause some sorrow
Will nothing cause I'm living that way

Or judge me in a negative way
Won't you?

Unconscience and it's insanity (?)

But you don't really know what to do
You see someone that you'd like to mingle
And imagine that she is waiting for you

Any love that you feel
Is real
Any time that you use love
You lose love

There is no certain crowd that you run with
But your passions they never run thin
You say 'hi', they say 'hi' and it's done with
Still you don't really love from deep within

Price you pay for all the years
Of holding back what's deep inside
And living with a hell of a lot of lies

One million kisses after

Even if you cannot stay

Though you're not mine

Oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything?

To love you child my whole life long
Be it right, or be it wrong
I'm only what you make me, baby
Don't walk away, don't be so shady
Don't want your mind, don't want your money

Don't you know you're my everything?
Oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything?
Yes, you are, yes you are

You are my heat
You are my fire
You make me weak with strong desire
To love you child my whole life long

Though you're not mine
I can't deny you
Don't you hear me talking baby

Rufus & Tony Thibodeaux,"If I
Had wings
Like an angel
Over these
Prison walls
I would fly
You know I'd fly
To the arms of my darling
And there
I would stay
'Til I die

Take my wife
My child
And your own mother
We would just
Sit and sleep
Each day
It's alone and so lonely
In this prison
But for wrongs
I have done
I must pay

You know I'm lost
Like a ship
On the ocean
That has lost
All its crew
In a gale
I got drunk
And I shot
My best buddy
.
Now I must
Spend my life in jail

Though if I
Had the wings of an angel
Over these
Prison walls
I would fly
You know I'd fly
To the arms of my darling
And there
I would stay

Never test be	-L-A-Q the six footer

Groupies in my hotel lobby I'm hittin' on 'em
niggas try to take my reign I'm shittin' on 'em
As is I'm trippin' on 'em tracks I'm flippin' on 'em
niggas ain't satisfied 'til my weapon is spittin' on 'em
Everytime I bust mine your soul burn
you niggas yearn to learn my flows spread the germs
Makin' you squirm any MC can get his ass beat
blowin' up the spot in spite of the last beef
Chiki ko ya highest title ya numero uno

[Rome Rap 1:]
I'm so hood and I can't change
Rip blocks from Venice
All the way to Fullton to Saint James
LA to BK
Young Rome and I'm serious
Born hustler more clever then my nemesis
Pop bottles like I'm Michael Jordon in the 90?s
Six ring all I do is big things
Fall sickin
My taste
Big ass, small waist
Flawless face
Really don't matter the race
Cause we all black as soon as the lights go out
If the head good I might show out
If its right I'm tight like a feen
When dis pipe blow out
The fifth ward
Let a psycho out
Young Rome like a redneck with his rifle out
what's that glow, mami ice no doubt
Rhinestone never
We have conference calls with Jacob
Been like this ever since I got my cake up
Pick up the dirt off the concrete and shake up
Been caring my timbs since B2K break up
I'm like Patton with no Shaq, Kobe the mailman
One word that don't compete in my brains is failing man

Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma
Let your boyfriend go he's a chi-chi man

We bag more then broads
We bag cities
You can have those hood rats with those t-bag tities
Rome gotta like him I'm slappin these dudes silly
Rip the nerve out your body that don't feel me
I rock the party like Bizzy be	 in his prime
I'm cool as an AC I'm not Busta Rhymes
No disrespect but I'm smooth as a Jazz artist
But live as the Roots
Homey I'm beyond the hottest
I'm not a star
I'm the sun
Not number two
I am the 1
I am not a rose
I am the gun
And I spit for the half niggas sleep on cots
Started from nothing 
Dreaming of boats and yachts
Man I use to dream a lot but then I stop sleepin
Got on my grizzle and kept bizzy
Got my mind right, money right
Never tricked
Chicks mad cause I'm tight
Cheap as a birds language
I ain't the one mami

Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma
Let your boyfriend go he's a chi-chi man

Niggas clapped up over brick shoot outs
With po-po, pepper stray, bully sticks
Broads impressed with this willy shit
Think willy?s a trick?
Have Diddy sippin on Cris on some silly shit
I don't drink from yellow bottles
I like my liquor brown as just jo
Hold a grudge no
I erase enemy?s like Bubba fat
Take stars to ball
Clap like the grammy awards
Down hits, seven up
Spit hit, seven up
Missed seven enough
Shredem up
Setem up, wetem up
Shock won't letem up
Hittem twice more cause he ain't dead enough
Call me iron man
Think I'm sexy now

Harder then you

I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready

When you talked about our future
You would nod your head and smile
But I didn't understand it, I was living in denial
I couldn't see the picture, didn't wanna see it clearer
'Cause I was so young
And now that I can't get ya, wanted to be wit' ya
What have I become?

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready

Mamma told me 'bout excuses
She'd say, ""They're no use to say""
What you would have done but didn't
I had to learn the hard way
Now that it's over, I wanted to just hold you
But I know I can't
I'm tryna be a soldier, I wanna do it over
Give me one more chance, I wasn't ready

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready

Can I get a redo, baby?
'Cause you know I need you, baby
And now I'm ready for your love, your love

I just wanna see you, baby
Just wanna smell and breathe you, baby
'Cause I hate what we've become
I wasn't ready for love

I waited, I contemplated and then I did it
It was room for relationship, but pretty had to hit it
We like hand and glove, head to a yankee fitted
Game is obsolete, it's all how you spit it
Better yet listen 'cause karma's a true avenger
Sort of like a Ninja or a king in all his splendor
Remember, love can be as cold as December
Unless it's in its truest form, I could never injure

Your heart, break you or make you see my vision
'Cause I know eventually you'll see my vision
By the way I'm livin' and it's a given
I'm giving you my heart, I'm giving you my soul
I'm giving you my gold

I'm sorry for the dirt that I did
Sneaking broads in and out the crib
The double life that I lived
They say a fool sells dreams
But a man makes dreams come true
Mami, I changed all for the love of you
I wasn't ready back then though

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love

"Rufus Bonds, Jr.","Joseph's coat annoyed his brothers
Brothers
But what makes us mad
Are the things that Joseph tells us of the
Dream's he often had

I dreamed that in the fields one day,
The corn gave me sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
All turned and bowed to mine
My sheaf was was quite a sight to see
A golden sheaf and tall
Yours were green and second-rate
And really rather small

This is not the kind of thing
We brothers like to hear
It seems to us that Joseph and his
Dreams should disappear

I dreamed I saw eleven stars,
The sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star,
It made me wonder why
Could it be that I was born
For higher thing than you?
A post in someone's government,
A ministry or two

The dreams of our dear brother are
The decade's biggest yawn
His talk of stars and golden sheaves
Is just a load of corn
Not only is he tactless but
He's also rather dim
For there's eleven of us and
There's only one of him
The dreams of course will not come true
That is, we think they won't come true
That is, we hope they won't come true
What if he's right all along?

The dreams are more than crystal clear,
The writing on the wall
Means that Joseph some day soon
Will rise above us all
The accuracy of the dreams
We brothers do not know
But one thing we are sure about
The dreamer
Has to go",Joseph's Dreams,1993

Do him in, while weave got the time

Could you use a slave,
You hairy bunch of Ishmaelites?
Young, strong, well-behaved,
Going cheap and he reads and writes

In a trice the dirty deal was done
Silver coins for Jacob's favourite son
Then the Ishmaelites
Galloped off with the slave in tow
Off to Egypt where Joseph was not keen to go

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing

You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Rufus Reid,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999
Rufus Reid,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1999
Rufus Reid,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily
Too
",Emily,2000
Rufus Reid,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,2000
Rufus Reid,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You,2000
Rufus Reid,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Rufus Reid,"Too young to go steady, too young
I hear him (her) say.
He (she) says I'm (we're) not ready
But then why am I (are we) feeling this way?

Too young so he (she) tells me
He (she) says we'll have to wait.
Why wait till it may be too late?

Can't he (she) realize he (she) drive me wild
Is he (she) made of stone?
Must he (she) always treat me (act just) like a child?

Won't he (she) ever own up
I'm (we're) grown up?
Some day he'll (she'll) be sorry
Some day just wait and see
He'll (she'll) wish he'd (she'd) gone steady with me!  
",Too Young to Go Steady,2000
Rufus Reid,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms

Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

Rufus Reid,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2002
Rufus Reid,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling,2003
Rufus Reid,"Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally
If you will be my love
 
Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
