Dick Haymes,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily
Too
",Emily,1995
Dick Haymes,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1995
Dick Haymes,"Samantha, you're all
I'll ever adore,
So forgive me, do,
If I say to you
What I've said so often before.

I love you, Samantha,
And my love will never die.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Together, Samantha,
We could ride a star and ride it high.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
And if some distant day
You decided to say,
""Get along, go away, goodbye!""
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one gal guy.","I Love You, Samantha",1995
Dick Haymes,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1995
Dick Haymes,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1995
Dick Haymes,"Somewhere in the night
There must be someone for me
Somewhere in the night
Who knows, where somewhere may be

Across the way
Or maybe, way beyond the distant star
How I wish, I knew
Just where and who you are

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
""No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night""

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
""No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night""",Somewhere in the Night,1995

Don't want to boast but I know
She's the toast of Kalamazoo

Dick Haymes,"Aurora comes from Rio De Janeiro
She dances in a little street cafe.
And when you're down in Rio De Janeiro
Here's what you'll hear each Latin lover say.

[Chorus]
You're a sweet heart in a million
Oh oh oh ooh (be mine oh oh) aurora
With your manner so Brazilian
Oh oh oh ooh (be mine oh oh) aurora (be mine)

When you smile and call me honey
Oh oh oh ooh (be mine oh oh ) aurora
Is it me or just my money?
Oh oh oh ooh aurora (be mine)

I'll buy you this and buy you that
If you'll be true to me.
I'll even rent a cottage
And present you with the key.
So if you'll marry me
And be my sweet senora.

Oh oh oh oh aurora, aurora
Be mine, be mine, be mine

You're a sweet heart in a million
Ha ha ha ha aurora
With your manner so Brazilian
Ha ha ha ha aurora

When you smile and call me honey

Is it me or just my money?

Oh oh oh ooh aurora, aurora
Be mine.",Aurora,1995
Dick Haymes,"I'll never let a day pass by,
Without a prayer or two
That heaven might find a way, so I
Might just run into you,
Just to be near you and to hear you say hello
Would give an ordinary day a lovely glow!

I'll never let a day pass by
But that I'll see you face,
And thrill to every tender sigh
While you're in my embrace,
I know it's all a dream, but darling, if it were true,
I'd never let a day pass by without my loving you!",I'll Never Let a Day Pass By,1995
Dick Haymes,"Away beyond the hills in Idaho
Where yawning canyons greet the sun
As it smiles above the trees in Idaho
To say another night is done
Warm summer winds toss the waving grain
Calling me back to my home again
To dream sweet memories of long ago
Beyond the hills in Idaho",Idaho,1995
Dick Haymes,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1995
Dick Haymes,"Stars in the sky were dancing
One night perfect for romancing,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
He wanted thrills, she wanted love,
Oh but his sighs were tender

As he begged her to surrender,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
And she believed that it was love.
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing,
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

Yes, miracles can happen,
I know 'cause I saw what happened
That night a sinner kissed an angel,
That was the night I fell in love.",A Sinner Kissed an Angel,1995
Dick Haymes,"Wrong
Would it be wrong to kiss
Seeing I feel like this
Would it be wrong to try?

Wrong
Would it be wrong to stay
Here in your arms this way
Under this starry sky?

If it is wrong
Then why were you sent to me
Why am I content to be
With you forever?

So
When I need you so much
And I have waited so long
It must be right
It can't be wrong",It Can't Be Wrong,1995
Dick Haymes,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring [From State Fair],1996
Dick Haymes,"Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Dick Haymes,"If there is someone lovelier than you
Then I am blind, a man without a mind
If there is someone lovelier than you

But no, I'm not blind
My eyes have traveled everywhere
In hopes that I might find, a creature half so fair

If there is someone lovelier than you
By all that's beautiful
Such beauty can't be true

If there is someone lovelier than you
By all that's beautiful
Such beauty can't be true",If There Is Something Lovelier Than You,1996
Dick Haymes,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1996
Dick Haymes,"Because I still get a thrill thinking of you
And I still feel your lips kissing me too
Although our love affair wasn't to be
I wonder if you care care about me

I still remember that night under the moon
I recall that it all ended too soon
I can't believe you're gone memories linger on
Cause I still get a thrill thinking of you

I still remember that night under the moon
I recall that it all ended too soon
I can't believe you're gone memories linger on
Cause I still get a thrill thinking of you",I Still Get a Thrill,1996
Dick Haymes,"A little bit independent in your walk
A little bit independent in your talk
There's nothing like you in Paris or New York
You're awfully easy on the eyes

A little bit independent when we dance
A little bit independent toward romance
A bit of sophistication in your glance
And yet you're easy on the eyes

Whenever I'm with you alone
You weave a magic spell
And though it be a danger zone
I only know that you're swell

A little bit independent with your smile
A little bit independent in your style
But how can I help but love you all the while
When you're so easy on the eyes",A Little Bit Independent,1996
Dick Haymes,"Won't you play some simple melody
Like my mother sang to me
One with a good old-fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody

Musical demon, set your honey a-dreamin',
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune 
That is choppy you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Play for me
That good old-fashioned harmony
Oh, won't you play for me
A simple melody

Play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all of my applause because
I wanna rag it
Ragtime melody",Play a Simple Melody,1996
Dick Haymes,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for

Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,1996
Dick Haymes,"We strolled the lane together,
Laughed at the rain together,
Sang love's refrain together,
And we both pretend 

It will never end.
One day we cried together,
Cast love aside together,
You're gone from me,

But in my menory,
We always will be together.

We strolled the lane together,
Laughed at the rain together,
Sang love's refrain together,
We knew long ago

That our love would grow.
Through storm and sun together,
Our hearts are one together,
You're gone from me,

But in my memory,
We always will be together.",Together,1996
Dick Haymes,"All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms

Here am I, begging for only five minutes more
Only five minutes more of your charms

Dick Haymes,"I wonder what's become of Sally,
That old gal of mine.
The sunshine's missing from our alley,
Ever since the day Sally went away.

If no one wants her now, 
Please send her back to me.

I'll always welcome back my Sally,
That old gal of mine.",I Wonder What's Become of Sally,1996
Dick Haymes,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1996
Dick Haymes,"Once we were so close we were fused,
Belly to belly

And now we're standing back to back
It's strange that we should be feuding
Once we were so close we were joined,
Forehead to forehead

Now we live in our own little worlds
We don't speak the same language

Who am I?  
I am you and I
Who are you?  
You are me too
Who are we?  
We are you and me
Who are they?

Let me tell you how much I adore all your charms
Though you leave me tomorrow for this night we'll borrow a love song

Til the scent of the roses caresses and closes your eyes

Let me kiss you tonight
While the stars in the sky give a heavenly light
So when love is an ember my heart will remember this sight
Live a lifetime of love in a moment holding me tight
Then forget me darling only
Let me love you tonight

Dick Haymes,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1996
Dick Haymes,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue

Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me

Your eyes mustn't glow like mine

Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me

Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes

Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Dick Haymes,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?

Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Dick Haymes,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

There's a breeze, though the wind has died

Are you headin' for the Alamo?

In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet.

Thank you for funny cards from Spain.
I recall Central Park in fall how you tore you dress,
What a mess, I confess that's not all.

Danke schoen, darling danke schoen,
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane.
I can see hearts carved on a tree
Letters intertwined for all time.

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams

And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

An airline ticket to romantic places

A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you

Dick Johnson,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Anniversary Song,2006
Dick Johnson,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2006

Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Way out on the rim of the hill

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,

Give a little whistle!
Give a little whistle!
When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong,
Give a little whistle!

Not just a little squeak,
Pucker up and blow.
And if your whistle's weak, yell ""Juminy Cricket!""

Take the straight and narrow path
And if you start to slide, 
Give a little whistle!

Till you know the folks, see them 
In their own native locales.

Growing into oaks, you gotta 
See the fellas and gals.

A bunch of merchandise, 
The all-American Cow wins the prize. 
Your All-American man is nice young man, 
He is a handy man in a pinch, 
Maybe he can't make love 
Like a clam who can, 
Till he gets his gal in a clinch. 
All-American Man may not get what he wants, 
For the All-American Girl wears the pants. 
Like the flag on the little red schoolhouse 
Like the ball on election day, 
Like a brass spittoon, and Daniel Boone, 
It's strictly USA. 
That is to say Bud! Down South it's hi-all, 
Cowboys say Howdy, Indians say How 
No matter where you're meeting folks. 
It's the real American way of greeting folks. 
Bring your gal to the rodeo in Reno 
Or to the beach in Chesapeake Bay 
Like the ice cream cones, or Casey Jones, 
Like Mr. Tambo and Mr. Bones

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,2011

Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
