Les Innocents,"T'as été ça et là
T'as itinéré j'ai su ça
Que tu t'adores là haut
Oublie que l'or et le fer ailleurs
T'as été à ça de moi
T'as ôté tous mes totems
Ça ne me surprend pas
Mais ça ne prend pas
Le pas sur nos vielles lunes

Sur le pas que j'espère
Faire hou hou retrouver le geste frère
Faire hou vriller les vents plier les temps contraires
Qu'on s'y retire au clair dans un nid
Nos violons et le fil des philharmonies martiennes

On a été on en est là
Dans le chic et dans le baba
Poseurs de bombes à eau
De digues au port de têtes ailleurs
Là ici, en bas, Riviera
T'as tout sidéré, on t'aime
Ça ne me dépasse pas
Ça n'efface pas nos traces sur cette lune

Et le pas qu'il me reste

Faire, faire hou hou retrouver le geste
Frère faire hou hou retrouver le geste
Et le fil, le fil des philharmonies martiennes

Tahiti d'autres fois
J'ai incinéré, j'ai froid
J'attends mieux de moi
Envieux de toi
J'emprunte la même dune

Et si le temps se laisse faire
J'espère hou hou retrouver le geste frère
Faire hou vriller les vents plier les temps contraires
Qu'on s'y retire au clair dans un nid
Nos violons et le fil des philharmonies martiennes

J'espère, faire, refaire tourner nos sphères
Je l'espère
Tous les mystères à l'ouest faire
J'espère retrouver le geste frère
Frère
Retrouver le geste",Les philharmonies martiennes,2015
Les Innocents,"On ne fait que danser 
Danser quel pied danser 
De tenir en joue 
Les souvenirs devant nous

Entends tu les fées
Aux mal disposés?
Moi je t'ai connue
Mieux que nue

Entends-tu peiner
Les coulisses causés?

Nous n'y sommes plus

S'épuisent les coups
S'épuisent les coups
Nous n'y sommes plus

Voilà que tu chantes faux
Couvre les sanglots
Voilà que tu chantes faux

Reviens-tu lestée
Et lequel s'est tassé?
Que j'aurais mieux cru
Porté disparu

Rien de moins hanté
Sommes horodatés
Rien ne sonne plus
Nous ne sommes plus

S'épuisent les coups
S’épuisent les coups

Voilà que tu chantes faux
Couvre les sanglots
Les lendemains qui sentent bon
On lave le revolver en cachot

Voilà que tu chantes faux
Faux

On a fait, à qui penser?
Et de tenir en joue
Les souvenirs devant nous

On ne fait que danser
Danser quel pied danser
Et tout tenir en joue
Les souvenirs devant nous
Mais voilà que tu chantes faux

On ne fait que danser
On a fait, à qui penser?

Les Innocents,"Hou hou love qui peut! 

Qu'ai-je fait? Qu’avais-je à faire? 
Aimer autant que peut 
Dans mon ombre avant toi 
Mais je n'en ai que faire 
Le vent le vrai refait du feu 
Et le monde à l'endroit 

Viens dedans les fièvres 
Les ivoires confie mes malheurs 
Viens dedans tes lèvres, tes rêves 
Tes livres ton eau de cœur 
Car je reste assoiffé 
De sel et à désaltérer 

Qu'ai-je fait? Qu’avais-je à faire? 
De peine autant d'adieu 
Sous les combles sans toi 
Mais je n'en ai que faire 
La chambre est claire à l'amoureux 
La lune monte à ton bras 

Viens la nuit est brève 
Mais il suffira d'une heure 
Vois le nuage crève 
Mais la pluie va tomber ailleurs 
En toute humilité 

Nous laissant seuls avec l'été 

Hou hou love qui peut! 
Love qui peut 

Viens dedans les fièvres 
Portant les vivres au bonheur 
Car lui est affamé 

Qu'ai-je fait? Qu’avais-je à faire? 
Aimer autant que peut 
Comme l'ombre avant toi 
Mais je n'en ai que faire 
Le vent le vrai refait du feu 
Ici l'ondé nous voilà

Si c'n'était pas un rêve
Qui va s'en aller
S'en aller

Où ça? Quand ça?
Déjà?
 
Comme le jour avançait
En moi, je pensais
Si c'n'était pas un rêve, eh bien
J'ai tout à aimer
Quand le jour s'est couché
J'ai réalisé
Que c'n'était qu'une trêve
Dans ma réalité

Nous sommes ici pour croire
Rien d'autre à laisser croire
Croire que l'on meure ce soir
Pour qui veut bien voir

Le voile est levé
Sur ma pauvreté
Qu'ai-je donc à garder
Qui ne sera soufflé?
Oui le voile est levé
Tout est si coloré
Qu'ai-je donc à donner
Que la nuit ne m'a soufflé?

Nous sommes ici pour croire
Rien d'autre à laisser croire
Croire que l'on meure ce soir
Et qu'il est déjà tard

Déjà tard
Mais pas trop tard
À toi de voir
À toi de croire

Le jour s'est levé
Sur cette étrange, étrange idée
La vie n'est qu'une journée
Et la mort qu'une nuit
La vie n'est ta journée
Que si la mort lui nuit",Le Jour s'est levé,2017
Les Insus,"Allez, allez!
Yeah!

Un jour j'irai à New York avec toi
Toutes les nuits déconner
Et voir aucun film en entier, ça va d'soi

Dormir dans un hôtel délaté
Traîner du côté gay et voir leurs corps se serrer
Voir leurs cœurs se vider et saigner

Il ne fait pas froid si t'y crois

La couleur des sons que tu bois
Et puis c'est tellement grand que vite on oubliera

Un jour chat, un autre rat

Les Jazz Modes,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

I've come to say goodbye,

Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

En ese momento, apareciÃ³ volando la mariposa Golosa. â??Â¡Socorro!â??, se quejaba la mariposa, â??Â¡Me persigue el oso Libidinoso!â??, why apareciÃ³ corriendo tras ella, el oso Libidinoso. 
El oso, perseguÃ­a a la mariposa ofreciÃ©ndole una margarita why recitÃ¡ndole un poema que decÃ­a: â??Â¡Sublime Ã©xtasis de amor, mariposa, que acelera mis latidos, vayamos, vayamos, vayamos, vayamos, vayamos pronto!â??. 
El molusco se interpuso. El oso bramÃ³: â??Â¿Y tÃº que quieres, despreciable molusco?â?? 
â??Â¿No vio mi caparazÃ³n?â?? 
El instante fue aprovechado por la mariposa Golosa, que se escondiÃ³ ayudada por el pajarillo Amarillo. 

HacÃ­a ya tres lunas que la bruja habÃ­a hechizado al duque. La hermosa princesa Teresa deambulaba en su bÃºsqueda, lamentÃ¡ndose de su suerte. La acompaÃ±aban en silencio sus fieles gansos Mansos.
El pajarillo anunciÃ³: â??Â¡Ya llega la princesa! Â¡Que triste estÃ¡!â??, why apareciÃ³ la princesa. 
Entonces, apareciÃ³ la bruja Granuja. La bruja se burlaba: â??Â¡Nunca sabrÃ¡s en que animal he convertido al duque! Â¡Ni siquiera Ã©l recuerda nada, ja ja ja!â?? 

La princesa clamaba: â??Â¿DÃ³nde estÃ¡s, Sigfrido, Sigfrido? Â¿QuÃ© clase de animal eres?â?? 
Los gansos consolaban a la princesa: â??Â¡TranquilÃ­zate!â??, dijo el gansito pequeÃ±o, â??Ten calmaâ??, agregÃ³ la gansa robusta, â??Todo irÃ¡ bienâ??, dijo el ganso viejo. 
â??Â¿No vio mi caparazÃ³n?â?? 

De pronto, la gansa robusta lanzÃ³ un grito de indignaciÃ³n, le dio una tremenda bofetada a un cuarto ganso enorme que estaba a su lado why saliÃ³ corriendo. El ganso enorme no era otro que... Â¡el oso libidinoso disfrazado!, que corrÃ­a a la gansa ofreciÃ©ndole una margarita al grito de â??Â¡Sublime Ã©xtasis de amor, gansita, vayamos, vayamos pronto!â?? 
Los gansos fueron en ayuda de la gansa robusta, why la princesa se quedÃ³ sola. 
â??No debo flaquearâ??, dÃ­jose la princesa, â??no debo flaquear, debo encontrar al duqueâ??, pero en ese momento, se hicieron oÃ­r los bajos instintos de la princesa: â??Olvida al duque. Recuerda los abrazos de aquel fornido palafrenero de palacioâ??. â??Pero debo cumplir con mi deberâ??. â??Â¿Y si algo falla why el hechizo de rompe sÃ³lo a medias? El duque podrÃ­a quedar medio animal...â?? â??Bueno, en eso es igual el palafrenero...â?? 

Mientras esto sucedÃ­a en el bosque, veamos que pasaba en una pacÃ­fica granja cercana. 
El granjero, silbando distraÃ­damente, ordeÃ±aba a la vaca Resaca. La vaca rumiaba sus pensamientos... why otras flores que habÃ­a comido esa maÃ±ana. â??Â¡Que extraÃ±o!â??, pensaba la vaca Resaca, â??es la primera vez que me ordeÃ±a de tarde...â?? why mirÃ³ al granjero. Resaca lanzÃ³ un mugido why saliÃ³ corriendo. El granjero no era otro que... Â¡el oso Libidinoso disfrazado!, quien comenzÃ³ a perseguirla ofreciÃ©ndole una margarita al grito de â??Â¡Sublime Ã©xtasis de amor, vaquita, vayamos, vayamos pronto!â??.

En el bosque, la princesa, ayudada por los gansos Mansos, se habÃ­a interrogado a casi todos los animales, pero no habÃ­a logrado averiguar cual de ellos era el duque. Una triste desazÃ³n invadiÃ³ a la princesa. 
De pronto, los gansos, viendo llegar al pajarillo why a la mariposa, bramaron: â??Ustedes dos, Â¿quÃ© hacÃ­an la noche en que el duque fue hechizado?â??. â??Nada, nadaâ??. â??Â¡Confiesen!â??, (marcha nupcial)â??y bien, si, pero nos vamos a casarâ??. Un fracaso mÃ¡s. Otra triste desazÃ³n invadiÃ³ a la princesa. 
Teresa, alzÃ³ sus bellos ojos, como implorando ayuda a los que la rodeaban. Hasta que su mirada se cruzÃ³ con la del jabalÃ­ AlÃ­. â??Â¡Miren!, Â¡Si, si, no hay duda!â??, dijo la princesa, â??Â¡el jabalÃ­ tiene la misma mirada que el duque!â??. El jabalÃ­, con sombrÃ­a voz declarÃ³: â??Es que yo no soy un jabalÃ­â??. â??Â¡Oh!â??. â??Â¡Yo soy... Â¡â??. â??Â¡Ã?l es... !â??. â??Un duque hechizadoâ??. â??Â¡El duque Sigfrido!â??. â??No, el duque de Mantuaâ??. â??Â¿Y que haces aquÃ­?â??, preguntÃ³ sorprendida la princesa. â??Â¡Me echaron de Rigoletto!â??. La Ãºltima posibilidad habÃ­a fracasado. Otra triste desazÃ³n mÃ¡s invadiÃ³ a la princesa.
De pronto, de la espesura surgiÃ³ el oso Libidinoso why exclamÃ³: â??Â¡Aguarde! Â¡Al ver a Teresa recuperÃ© la memoria! Â¡Ahora entiendo la causa de mi vergonzoso desenfreno! Â¡He sido vÃ­ctima de un hechizo cruel! Â¡Gracias, amor mÃ­o, por venir a salvarme! Â¡Yo soy el duque Sigfrido!â??. Dicho esto, el oso arrancÃ³ una margarita, why viendo la alegrÃ­a en el rostro de la princesa Teresa, se dirigiÃ³ a su encuentro triunfalmente. El oso le ofreciÃ³ la margarita a la princesa, pero en ese momento, la bruja Granuja se interpuso, why con aire trÃ¡gico gritÃ³: â??Â¡TÃº no eres el duque, farsante! No puedo soportar este atropello. Â¡Yo no sirvo para bruja! Lo hago para complacer a mi familia. El duque Sigfrido es el moluscoâ??, why la bruja se fue llorando, mientras el oso, conmovido, corrÃ­a tras ella, ofreciÃ©ndole la margarita. 
Todos felicitaron al molusco, quien avanzÃ³ hacia la princesa lentamente, como un duque. Mientras el molusco agradecÃ­a los aplausos, Teresa lo tomÃ³ con amor, why lo depositÃ³ suavemente sobre la palma de su mano. why ante el asombro why el esfuerzo de Teresa, el molusco se fue transformando en un joven esbelto why hermoso: El duque Sigfrido. 

AllÃ­ estÃ¡n Sigfrido why Teresa, con los corazones entrelazados, mirÃ¡ndose a las manos why con los ojos latiendo al unÃ­sono. why ya inician su triunfal regreso al palacio. Los animales los escoltan en eufÃ³rico cortejo. 
Todos bailan alegremente. why allÃ¡ van, encabezando el cortejo, el duque, la princesa, why su flamante dama de compaÃ±Ã­a que no es otra que... disfrazado, el oso Libidinoso.",Teresa y el Oso,1990

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Who tell you fate supplies a mate

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

About pain and heartache, ain't nothing you can tell her

But does this worker know what kind of jobs that there are?
Degrading things like cleaning up people's vomit
For a little bit of dough, and plus your brain gets nothing from it
I'm smarter than that this girl thinks to herself
I'm worth more than that, she thinks to herself
She pours a drink for herself while she stares out the window
This guy says he got work for her, maybe she should go to him yo
The money's good, and plus he'll dress her up nice
She left her baby's daddy 'cause he beat her up twice

And what's this girl's purpose? Will she self-destruct?
When this sisters about to go down, who's there to help her up?

All it takes is one quick stick
Gotta fill his belly now, which vic should he pick?
He does his dirt all by his lonely, forget his homies
He doesn't fell like splitting any loot, them suckas be acting phony
So much potential but all gone to waste
Now he lurks in night, with a loaded gun on his waist
Too late for this lost soul, his life's in a chokehold

Make me rock rhymes to it make me dance all through it
Yea, and I be doin it right
Time that I love her down's like every night
Everything about her is wow she fine(?)
She one in a million
More like a trillion
Lifted me up like Killian

Les Nubians,"Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo

Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things that's normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin' like the Titanic here come the panic
Bein' with you like a habit without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin' a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned or wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin'
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally

L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)

Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say ""word""
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin' from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin' over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin' approachin'
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin' but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin' but a bird
Yo, yo, yo

L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)

Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin' how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they don't understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like ""Shit, he payin for your rent"" missin' the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language

Universal love

On cherche l'amour sans trêve
See'est qu'sans amour, on crève

T'échangerais une promesse do paradis
Contre ma paire d'yeux
Regarde-moi de loin
Comme si mon garde do corps était dieu
J't'avais pas vu dans la mire
Un pavé dans l'amour
Endure tes vers pour entendre les gens dire
Qu'tu m'rendras légendaire

On cherche l'amour sans trêve
See'est qu'sans amour, on crève

Tu veux partager see'que je suis
See'que j'vaux, see'que j'vis
See'que j'vois, see'que j'ai vu
Et après on verra
Si l'amour meurt, alors dis moi see'qu'il reste
Des cases vides, des causes injustes
Juste des gestes

Tu dis qu'tu tuerais pour moi
Trouve une cible émouvante
Prouve-moi que tu m'aimes à mort
Au moins autant qu'tu t'en vantes

La balle au bout do fusil
Le fusil à bout de bras
Do braconnier à bout de souffle
La balle siffle
Un corps s'affale sa vie défile
Le bourreau s'tire dans la foule
Et moi, émue, je reste couchée

see'est moi qu'il a touché.

Un sang, un souffle, un son qui nous unit, ma sœur
You are my friend for life
It’s Jah love that binds us together

For in this life His love conquers all
And give us strength so

For He gave us life through the grace of love
So it’s only right to send this praises up

As donné au monde noir, à l?humanité

Traçant les sentiers de la science
Les marécages infestés de monstres carnivores

Recherchant les fossiles de la vérité, la nuit d?encre et froide de solitude

Sacrifié, oui tu l?as été, oui see?est bien cela
Tu t?es jeté dans la bataille, tu t?es exténué
Pourvu que nous puissions marcher fiers, la tête haute

Est-ce vrai que tu es mort Cheikh? Que tu n?es plus cheikh?
Toi qui quelques instants encore m?exhortais à redoubler d?ardeur
A braver les coups bas d?une Afrique qui se cherche
Toi qui m?invitais à rassembler les bonnes volontés pour un avenir glorieux
Est-ce toi qui n?es plus, Cheikh Anta Diop?

Nous, peuples d?Afrique, plaidons pour lui et
Le disons pour tout le bien qu?il a fait à l?humanité
Soyez loué, ô dieu, voyez cheikh anta diop vient à vous
Sans péché, sans mal
Il a donné do pain à l?affamé, de l?eau à qui avait soif

Des vêtements à qui était nu, un bac à qui n?avait pas de bateau
Il a fait des offrandes aux Dieux
Et des dons funéraires aux morts bienheureux
Sauvez Cheikh Anta Diop, gardez-le

Cheikh Anta Diop est un homme qui ala bouche pure
Les mains pures et à ceux qui le voient, sois le bienvenu
Nous, peuples d?Afrique, plaidons pour lui et
Le disons pour tout le bien qu?il a fait à l?humanité

Voilà donc notre plaidoyer, nous peuples d?Afrique, pour toi, Cheikh
Maintenant, tu peux partir, tu peux partir en paix

You'd play hooky from school
Good old summertime
You'd play ""ring-a-rosie""
With Jim, Kate and Josie

We now fondly treasure
When we never thought it a crime
To go stealing cherries
With faces brown as berries
In good old summertime

Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey-wootsey

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

One that they could croon 
As only they can

And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn

Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,1977

I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""

But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

A sleighing song tonight

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;

Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye

I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine

Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Les Paul & Mary Ford,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through

And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?

Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing

She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty

Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

On avançait avec maintien
Et d'un pas qui hésite.
On braquait pas des revolvers,
On arrivait les bras ouverts,
On venait en visite.

Mais ils ont poussé les verrous
Dans un accord tacite.
Ils ont fermé les contrevents,
Caché les femmes, les enfants,
Refusé la visite.

On venait pas les sermonner,
Tenter de les endoctriner,
Pas leur prendre leur site.
On venait leur dire en passant,
Un petit bonjour innocent,
On venait en visite.

On venait pour se présenter,
On venait pour les fréquenter,
Pour qu'ils nous plébiscitent,
Dans l'espérance d'être admis
Et naturalisés amis,
On venait en visite.

Que rien ne nécessite.

Allongé vers ces deux vagues
Allangui comme un noyé
Mais plein d'une vie formidable
Vers lui j'ai marché, comme illuminée, j'allais

Paressant au bord de l'eau
Il rêvait les yeux ouverts
De grands yeux verts, un menton triangulaire
Et une queue de poisson, un triton de Poséïdon

Une question, permets moi
Dis Triton comme je te vois
Qu'il me brûle de savoir comment
Vous foutez pour qu'il y ait des enfants

Triton embrasse-moi
Connaissez-vous l'ivresse, des profondeurs du bonheur d'amour
Une caresse me fît taire
Et il parla

Cette queue que tu touches là
Est un noeud comme tu n'en as pas
Un engin fort comme une un dauphin
La femelle, elle, c'est son vagin

Nous faisons tourbillons
Quand sa nageoire caudale s'ouvre comme une fleur des mers
La tempête hurle et bastonne
Et les hommes ont peur, bonheur

Dans un élan
Il file déjà au loin
Et l'écume scintillait
Si joliment

There's nothing in the way, they move to show
They too, know what I know
They too hunger for the beast below

A word about my weakness

There's nothing I can do to be cool
I don't sleep 'til I've had my fuel
It frustrates if I am deprived
A hunger that grates from deep inside
I feel like I'm doing time
Imprisoned by dependence on a rhythm sublime
In my mind I must overcome the need to define
The solitary silence of a faceless crime

Standing by the stereo I'm feeling so alone
My back against a speaker and I'm moving on my own
Surrounded by so many and they're staring at my face
They're picking up my problem

Suddenly I realise in a look that I was wrong
Everybody's groovin' to their own song
Down at the scene below
There's something in the way they move to show
They too, know what I know
They too hunger for the beast below

The backbeat of humanity it sweetens my tears

to the cool muddy waters of the riverside

Les Savy Fav,"Once when walking in the woods 
I came upon a burning bush. 
""What wants you vision?"", says I 
And it spoke, and I quote, 

""Apocalypse can go down easy 
You gotta know it's an acquired taste. 
You're sacrifice can't please me 
I'm dead set to destroy this place. 
Hip hip for imperfection, 
I want to make a mess. 
I've got a secret theory 
That disarray works best 
And though it don't work often 
Oh my God when it does- 
Watch as the outburst softens 
It's had its way with us. 

They're scared of the silence 
But be scared-er of the sound. 
Hearts are not only beating 
They are all counting down. 
You're not ready for disorder. 
You're not ready for decay. 
Have you been staving 
Time and aging 
Sloughing dead skin away? 

I must confess I said with a smile, 
""I'm frightened as a child. 
And I suspect by 
The smoke in your eye 
You're thinking 'So am I.' 

Apocalypse can go down easy 
You gotta know it's an acquired taste. 
Our sacrifice can't please thee 
You're dead set to destroy this place. 
If the aspirin you take 
Doesn't cure your headache 
Why do docs propose 
The headache's in your head? 
And if the orgasms we fake 
Take their toll and take the cake 
Why do they suppose 
We're better off in bed? 

And then the bush said, 
""You and I, we were meant to be together. 
You and I, we are gonna hang together. 
You and I, we are going down together.""",Pills,2001

Les Savy Fav,"I used to hold the biggest balls
Deep inside my castle walls
Spend my nights with concubine
Wasted, unchaste, drunk on blood red wine
Being the king was pretty cool
I'd have to say that ruling ruled
And I'd be in throne still
Had I not one day fallen ill

I spit and I coughed
My vision went soft too
And my chest got tight
My court, they surrounded me
They gagged and bounded me
And threw me out into the night

Out in the mud I sadly sighed
The waiting crowd laid and died
There came a noise boisterous
From down in the cloisters
And I heard them call the cry;

""Draw up the drawbridge, draw down the blinds
Everyone inside is getting high tonight
Waiting for the plague to move on
No one's getting sober till the liquors all gone""

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with

Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long

 Thou may'st be abus'd if thy sight be dim.

 Or to bubbles which on the water swim. 
 Wilt thou be thus abused still, 
 Seeing that she will right thee never? 
 If thou canst not o'ercome her will 
 The love will be thus fruitless ever. 
 Was I so base, that I might not aspire 
 Unto those high joys which she holds from me? 
 As they are high , so high is my desire: 
 If she this deny, what can granted be? 
 If she will yeld to that which reason is, 
 It is Reason's will that Love should be just. 
 Dear make me happy still be granting this, 
 Or cut off delays if that die I must.

	All day, all day, every day
	All day, all day, every day
	All day, all day, every day
	This is how we do every day, all day

Repeat 1 three times

Don't get it twisted
Make no mistake
I keep it real
With every jam I make

Tempo's down 
Bumpin' hip-hop beats
They feel me most
Out here on the streets

And I don't care
If you think I'm loud
I'm sensitive 
When my man's around 

My clothes stay baggy
That might be so
Dress like my brotha
But I'm sexy y'all

2 - 	With my style flow
	And Baggy clothes
	Loose style is how we go
	Every day and all day
	This way is how we stay

	Don't care what they say
	I stay right anyway
	Every day and all day

This is how we do every day, all day

Don't try to play me
I'm not the one
Might be a shorty
But I'm having none

a lot of people
They think they know
How I gets down
And how I flow

And I don't care
About Versace wear
Channel, Moschino
That shit is outta here

I got a dirty mouth
That might be true
No disrespect
But fuck you

Lescop,"Un coup de feu dans la nuit
Une douleur glaciale qui s'élance
La Foret soudain qui frémit 
Puis s'installe le silence

Tu te tiens là assourdie
Tu prononces la sentence
Le deuxième coup est parti 
Et fait bientôt la différence

Dans la Foret je te retrouve à l'heure opportune 
Un rendez vous improvisé sous la lune
Sourires crispés, situation compliquée 
Je sens ton souffle qui me frôle le coup
Un pistolet chargé me caresse la joue
Tu me dis ""cette fois c'est moi qui joue""
Dans la foret la première détonation raisonne 
Un coup de feu puis deux, mon corps qui frissonne 
Puis doucement s'écroule

Plus rien, plus un bruit
Personne n'a rien vu par chance
Pour moi maintenant c'est fini
Et tout le monde s'en fout, tu penses! 

Te voilà maintenant qui t'enfuit
Tirant ta révérence
La foret de nouveau frémit
Et je profite du silence

Dans la Foret je te retrouve à l'heure opportune

Où les garçons sont en privé
Garçons de mauvaises habitudes
Garçons de très grande solitude

Un perroquet vert rococo 
Me tourne effrontément le dos
Sur l'épaule d'une geisha
Qui sert la bière et la vodka

Tokyo, la nuit
Le doute, la crainte, l'ennui
Tokyo tu vis
Dans la mort, le sang, le bruit 

Se complaire dans la souffrance
Fait souvent la différence
Saint Sebastien tout contre moi
Tenant une flèche entre ses doigts

La fin, bien sûr est pour demain

Visage rasé et maquillé
Sous le soleil, acier trempé

I want to see if your pony is genuine
(Better ride it right, Hi-ho silver to the early light {early light baby}
Slow it down a bit, get your face all yet drown in it)
No doubt, the opposite of '96
(You turn me on sugar lick your lips)
Girlfriend, keep it right there, face down with your hands in the air
(Yeah!)
Watch my rocks
What's my M-O?
(Always hot)
As for my flow?
(It don't stop)
Am I good to go?

You could grip, trick it, to each his own
(I'll make your manhood shine like chrome)
What?, you could work me out
(I told you my ex-man turned me out, held me till I melt it down)
Pound for pound I could for real 'em out
Lover zone
(Unplug the phone)
You were out when ya mom and I home
(Stop, I'll shut you down, round and round, round and round)
Work it out now, see'mon, here's your reward
All aboard!
Word up, you can't get up, 
I'll leave your black cherry all split up, uh

[Chorus]

(Ooh all that drama sound real good, love to ride you)
Wish you would
(Yeah, but you won't call me back,
Man can't take it when it's squeezed like that
I bite back, re-mat, strike that, 
A real live player won't do me like that)
True, what if I strip for you, 
Dance on the bed while you under my leg
Would you suck your fingers, 
Start to beg, or would you crawl like a tiger
And give me some head
Either way you can have it your way
(Four play all day)
A.K.A. John Mickens, so I won't be trickin'

Conventional methods of makin' love kinda bore me
I want to knock your block off, get my rocks off
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft

I'm gonna call you Big Daddy and scream your name

I'm sittin' in my motherf***in' cell it's the same song

Keep cryin' and tell em I'll be home soon 

Oh baby I'm goin' crazy 
'Cause I keep seein' s*** that amaze me 
Still I had to kill a motherf***er last week 
He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep 

I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya 
but I can't, so f*** it

Hey ba-by 
What's happenin' honey? 
How you doin'? 
I miss you 
 
The kids keep askin' where's their papa? 
I had to tell em daddy got caught by the coppers 
It's time for me to raise em up proper by myself 
It's a goddamn struggle when a b**** ain't got no help 

Now everybody tellin' me that you ain't s*** black 
and when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the f*** back 
Damn, the pressure's gettin' hot and heavy 
and yeah, I'm gettin' sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy 

But now he's got a condo and a brand new Lexus 
Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas 
The ends don't justify the means 
and in another life he might've been the man of my dreams 

But you know I got your back to the motherf***in end 
but a b**** can't even trip like she doesn't have a friend

Coolio! 
(If you choose to accept this call please press 5 now) 
 
What the f*** you mean you need a friend? 
I can't be havin' no n****s round my kids 
Don't you make me break up outta this motherf***er 
and start killin' motherf***ers, S***! 

I know it's rough, I know it's tough 
but when you fumble in the game sometimes you get locked up 
You better stay away punk a** b****, he ain't s*** 
I don't want to have to kill him 

'Cause think about the times that we used to have 
Don't make me reach out and touch that a** 
You put yourself in danger when you f*** with a buster 
Like shootin' dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers 

You got more class than the average-type hooker b**** 
Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich 
Now I gotta check but if you've got the cheque 
Give a n**** a look and put somethin' on my books 

Peace 

[Chorus]

Ah-yo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas 
now he's wearin' the f***in Lexus like a necklace 
So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a b**** to do? 
My n****'s stretched in the pen since '92 

Them visits ain't doin' the trick, drop f***s make me sick 
'Cause this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip 
And that motherf***er representin' you, I think he resents you 
He got evidence he never presents to 

The people in court, I heard witnesses abortin' 
What's he doin' about gettin' you out to hold the fort? 
I got some ends, I'm a send you a dime and two doves

Lived a duck named Donald and his mother was a cluck 
Mickey Mouse wore a rag  pants in a sag 
Neighborhood kingpin  but his brother was a fag 

Donald had beef  so Mickey couldn't sleep 
They was hootin' for a while  and it was gettin' kinda deep 
Bugs Bunny had the props on the Eastside spots 
Known to hit a five from a mile with a shot 

Goofy was Mickey Mouse right hand man 
One day smoked a stick, and came up with a brand 
Called Pixie and Dixie, two killers from Chicago 
A game of 5K, to eliminate Donald 

But what they didn't know, is Donald was a G 
Had big time respect, from the West to the East 
Haps up see, and listen to the funk 
First chapter in the funky cartoon from the ghetto 

Huey and Duey and Louie with a 
Shot down Mickey Mouse made .. Minnie 
Everybody know Minnie got shot down 
And the cop on the case was Huckleberry Hound 

Huckleberry had a Deputy, by the name of Dog 
Eye-witness to the crime was Kermit the Frog 
But Kermit was scared and he wouldn't testify 
Pixie and Dixie just did a drive by 

On Donald Duck, but they shot and they missed 
And now Bugs Bunny is gettin' kind of pissed 
'Cause the shot that they missed hit his homeboy Elmer 
Bugs sellin' drugs on the motherfuckin' corner 

The future's lookin' shitty in fuck city 
So they called in the Feds, Beetlejuice and Miss Piggy 
Shit's on the street, no that's how it goes 
Scene two in the funky cartoon from the ghetto 

Now the war is on and Mickey Mouse is dead 
Quick Draw McGraw took two to the head 
Huey and Duey and Louie got caught 
And now they in the county, ready to sell out 

Pixie and Dixie's on the run from the mob 
'Cause they tried to kill Donald and they didn't do the job 
Bugs Bunny got popped, in a bar gettin' drunk 
Bullet fucked up Beetlejuice, while Miss Piggy had a pump 

Donald got the word that his nephews was snitchin' 
So Tom and Jerry stuck em on they way to the kitchen 
Goofy was a punk and everybody knew 
Him and Huckleberry Hound was spotted drinkin' brew

But they both got smoked by Jabberjaw the Shark

My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire

Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

May well be simple but they're true

To leave behind the life we knew
But there's no other way

Freedom the lesson we must learn

Lesley Garrett,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory,1993

In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?

The phantom of the opera is there,
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

My/your spirit and my/your voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my/your mind

He's there
The phantom of the opera
Beware the phantom of the opera

In all your fantasies you always knew
That man and mystery

Were both in you

And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind

Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Once in a while

When you find
That once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been

Think of me
Think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me
Trying too hard
To put you from my mind

Recall those days
Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day

Smoke gets in your eyes.

So I chaffed them, and I gaily laughed, 
To think they would doubt our love,
And yet today, my love has gone away,
I am without my love.

Now laughing friends deride,
Tears I cannot hide,
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies,

Never would

Won't help me to do

I could

And sculpted angels,
Cold and monumental,
Seem, for you,

Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999
Lesley Garrett,"Dreary days are over.
Life's a four leaf clover.
Sessions of depressions are through.
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true.

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last!

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's Lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you.",Long Ago (And Far Away) [From Cover Girl],1999
Lesley Garrett,"They, asked me how I knew,
My true love was true,
I of course replied, something here inside, 
Can not be denied.

They, said some day you'll find, 
All who love are blind,
When you heart's on fire, you must realize, 
Smoke gets in your eyes.

So I chaffed them, and I gaily laughed, 
To think they would doubt our love,
And yet today, my love has gone away,
I am without my love.

Now laughing friends deride,
Tears I cannot hide,
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies,
Smoke gets in your eyes,

Smoke gets in your eyes.",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes [From Roberta],1999
Lesley Garrett,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fear relieved 
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
And grace will lead us home
When we've been there ten thousand years 
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,2000

When their voices were soft 
And their words inviting 
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung
No wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
As they turn your dreams to shame

He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather!

Roses whither away like the sunflower

I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

I can give you my voice, bred with rythm and soul
Je te donne mes notes, je te donne ma voix
The songs that I love, and the stories I've told
Ce que j'imagine et ce que je crois
I can make you feel good even when I'm down
Les raisons qui me portent et ce stupide espoir
My force is a platform that you can climb on
Une épaule fragile et forte à la fois

Je te donne, je te donne tout ce que je vaux
Ce que je suis, mes dons

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer

Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde

Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté

Suffit d'une ou deux secondes

Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange

"Leslie ""Hutch"" Hutchinson","When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Come ease my mind
