Teish O'Day,"There are things that I did long ago
That I don't do anymore
We grow out of things
Each day is different than the day before
And yet to love you
I just have to breathe

There are needs we have when we are young
And discard as we mature
Time can change so much
The only certain thing is nothing's sure
And yet to love you
I just have to breathe

It's not an easy place 
This world we face
But I'll face anything
As long as that warm morning sun
Will always bring me you

There's a time for everything we do
When it's over we move on
Just true love remains
And I'll still love you when all else is gone
For me to love you
I just have to breathe

In this world where nothing stays the same
Stay with me",I Just Have to Breathe [*],2000
Teishan,"Como puede ser verdad
 
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

Teitur,"Can you say good-bye, without ever leavin'?
That's some sad soul to keep
Amanda awakes in a moment believin'
She's better off stayin' asleep
So she drives by the station
Imaginin' somewhere, sings a slow, slow, song

Now, she's waitin' at the stoplights
With no where to go
But in our town there's just one stoplight
Oh, I wish she would know

There's a world outside her window
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere's Amanda's dream

She sits late at night by the light of a candle
With wishes that never come true
And her hope gets so high they're too hard to handle
She stares as they fade out of view
And of these some words have led her to nowhere
Except a slow, slow, song

Now, she's waitin' at the stoplights
With no where to go
But in our town there's just one stoplight
Oh, I wish she would know

There's a world outside her window
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere's Amanda's dream

Well she sleeps like a girl
But she wakes like a woman
She sleeps like a girl
But she wakes like a woman, like a woman

Waitin' at the stoplights
With nowhere to go
But in our town there's just one stoplight
I wish she would know

There's a world outside her window
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere's Amanda's dream

Teitur,"Dreamt I was back with pirates and cats
In my Somerville
A girl, in the alphabet shirt covered in dirt
Lives on the hill

Well, my sweet Josephine
Are you still racing stray dogs across the old stream?
My neighborhood queen
Are you still kissing cowboys that cry, Josephine?

She stole my grandmother?s watch, a treasure to touch
To keep time to herself
Her mind was a very big house
We got lost there for hours until August fell

Well, my sweet Josephine
Are you still racing stray dogs across the old stream?
My neighborhood queen
Are you still kissing cowboys that cry, Josephine?

You say you're alright
""Josie it?s time you gotta get your feet on the ground""
But she says, ?No, but you see we have wings
It?s the funniest thing, it?s just that no ones knows""
No one knows, sweet Josephine

Well, my sweet Josephine
Are you still racing stray dogs across the old stream?
My neighborhood queen
Are you still kissing cowboys that cry, Josephine?

My neighborhood queen
Are you still kissing cowboys that cry, Josephine?",Josephine,2003
Teitur,"Our minds run in circles
Racing 'round the restaurant
Searching for what more to say
To say what we really want

Let's leave like it is
Stop staring at these walls
Let's not go headlong to that distance
Where you can't come back at all

[Chorus]
Let's go dancing 
Waltz around the rumor mill
In your faded dress with the daffodils
Let's go dancing
Let time stand still

Once your name was but a whisper 
A simple wish upon my tongue
Staring at your shadow
Was like staring at the sun

In this dark, dark hour
You still illuminate a room
Oh God give us the power
Gotta keep ourselves in tune

[Chorus]",Let's Go Dancing,2003
Teitur,"There was a party last night, last night
Cigarettes and empty bottles, empty bottles
Better open up this window, this window
Need some air to clear my head, clear my head

Alone in these strange beds
I think that I've traveled enough
Poetry and aeroplanes
I am tired of waiting for love

Tend to fall asleep in the fast lane, in the fast lane
Sometimes sinking low in the high life, in the high life
No more happy songs of heartbreak, oh heartbreak
Or playing white knight misunderstood, misunderstood

Alone in these strange streets
I think that I've walked them enough
Poetry and aeroplanes
I am tired of waiting for love

Another night I lie awake
In woken dreams of faith and fate
Hope my love don't come too late
Hope my love don't come too late

Alone in these strange beds
I think that I've traveled enough
Poetry and aeroplanes
I am tired of waiting for love",Poetry and Aeroplanes,2003
Teitur,"I'm lost in my head, been thinking all around
I gotta find the off-ramp to my heart

Stop-lights in a row when all I want is go
Drop into first and I'll get home

It's okay, I'm alright
I'm just a little rough around the edges of this life
Play it cool, you can always follow
Breadcrumbs in a line when you are lost

Little, little seeds grew into trouble trees
Sorry, sorry sight between my ears

I need to settle down and eat my troubled fruit
The sweetness of the taste will do me good

It's okay, I'm alright
I'm just a little rough around the edges of this life
Play it cool, you can always follow
Breadcrumbs in a line when you are lost

Well the corners of my frown have slowly turned around
No more upside down, no more upside sown
They've slowly, turned around
They've slowly, slowly turned around

It's okay, I'm alright
I'm just a little rough around the edges of this life
Play it cool, you can always follow
Breadcrumbs in a line when you are lost

Breadcrumbs in a line when you are lost",Rough Around the Edges,2003
Teitur,"Can I call you if I'm back in town
Leave a message when I'm southbound
Could I please, could I please?
Won't be long till I?ll be passing through
Maybe three days, maybe two

Could I see you one more time
If it?s okay, if you don't mind?
I'm the shade of a shadow, baby
Been thinking about you tonight
How sweetly you bring light
You're the ray of the sun
And I'm the shade of a shadow

For all the letters I never sent
And all the time we haven't spent
Could I please, could I please?
You've always said I play games I know I?d lose
You've always said that's the life I choose

Could I see you one more time
If it?s okay, if you don't mind?
I'm the shade of a shadow, baby
Been thinking about you tonight
How sweetly you bring light

Teitur,"Oh I've been haunted by this old ghost before
I want to hear your voice you know it's been so long
Well I could dance and wave you balance on the shore
Oh it would feel so good to see your face again

I still sleep with the lights on
I still stay up late alone
I still love another one
I still sleep with the lights on

Oh we both understand we got no way back
Oh our love was strange in a strange land
And we got broken wings we were bound to fall
Until the sun comes up you can hold my hand

I still sleep with the lights on
I still stay up late alone
I still love another one
I still sleep with the lights on

And take it easy and take it slow
Let's just watch the tides they grow
But wind is comin' from the side and
We are sleepin' in the light
In the light

I feel like wakin' up in your house someday
Or eatin' off your hand like a bird astray
But nothin's gonna change we'll still be the same
We said what's to stay nothin's buried nowhere

I still sleep with the lights on
I still stay up late alone
I still love another one
I still sleep with the lights on

I still sleep with the lights on
I still stay up late alone
I still love another one
I still sleep with the lights on

Teitur,"It's five miles 'till I see my lover
I guess you could say she's more than that
I've been sat in this seat now for hours
Reading my book like a map
These windows are crying
This train is dying to meet you

This train is filled with emotions
That all make me think about you
When we pass these old desert stations
I want to go there with you

It's four miles and counting
My hands are shouting to meet you
To meet you is fine
For I know you're all mine 
Waiting is nice
I can think of her eyes

These tracks can lead just to one place
And your face that I'll kiss and embrace when I meet you
I'm wondering if you'll ever come with me
We could play husband and wife
We could waltz around this globe and it's mysteries
And then rest till the end of our lives

It's two miles and closing
I'm overdosing in you

To meet you",To Meet You,2003
Teitur,"There's too much sky, not enough blue
There's too many questions to why I love you
There's too many clouds, not enough sun
The rain must fall on everyone

I'm fire
You're the ocean
I'm energy
You're the rhythm
Love is somewhere in between
What you believe and what you dream
I'm just trying to make you mine
You're the ocean

There's too much doubt and not enough dare
There's too much decision everywhere
There's too much talk and not enough time

You love to win, I dare to lose
Mostly you're a mindgame in my head
You are earth, I am water
I can give you what you're after

You can be the word
I can be the rhyme

There's really nothing you can do
You're going where I'm going too
Stay beside me, Stay beside me
I want you

Teitur,"I was just thinkin'
That I have been missin' you for way too long
And there is somethin' inside this weary head
That wants us to love just instead

But I was just thinkin'
Merely thinkin'
I've got loads of pictures yeah
I've got the one of you in that dancin' dress
But man I feel silly in that dim light
Just after doin' you by the side of my coat I put out the lights

I am sinkin'
Merely sinkin'
Yeah I think about long distance rates instead of kissin' you babe
I'm a singer without a song
And if I wait for you longer my affection is stronger
But I

Yeah I'm tired of postcards

Don't get me wrong I still desperately love you inside this weary head
I just want us to love just instead

Merely thinkin'
Yeah I think about long distance rates instead of kissin' you babe
And time is runnin' me still

Standing outside a broken window
My breath is warm, the air is cold
Hear noises of insects in the green, wet grass

I'm not gonna sell what I have stolen
It's something that belongs to me

The floor simmers, I am nervous
Place my hand on the entrance wall
There are shrieking whispers in the closets
Layers of dust on every surface

Please wash my head in a bucket of water
Rinse every corner of my body

I wish to own the glow in their eye
Because they are so beautiful

Teitur,"I'm in a state of mind
I'm in my private desert
I'm in a passionate study
Waiting for mars to come out

All the lights in Paris
All the songs of Belfast
Every detail in my head is
Waiting for mars to come out

My skin shrinks against my body bones
I'm lost into the weight of gravity
I'm at my best with my astronomy

Pyramids and starlight
Orchestrated midnight
The math of infinity and reason
Waiting for mars to come out

Vomiting and defeated
Total absence of grace

They keep me from falling

You stare at me with an empty gaze
You turn your back on me
And you search for more intriguing days
Loathing this
Controlling this
Let me get a hold of this so

I wear rubber bands round my soul
They keep me from crawling
And these rubber bands round my soul
They keep me from falling

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

Do I want them to respect or fear me?

Though I know I can't put the barrel to everybody

Pray for me now, what makes a soldier?
I know it's no breaths 'til beef is over
Keep your guns warm, my heart goes out to you Seth
And my cousin baby just died from crib death

Stay with me, just hit me on the celly cell
I know sufferin' and pain really well
If it don't kill you, it makes you strong

When it's going wrong

When I act like it's love and I know it ain't
If it was up to you, y'all niggaz would be throwin' paint
On my outfit, like he ain't about shit
Before you talk about shit, take your mitts of my mini fountain

See I had geeks and all y'all really had was feet
And you ain't never had a beef, so why you had to speak
Fasten your seat and I'ma take ya on a mission, nigga
I teach my own how to keep my own, listen nigga

Get the check, pay ya dues or pay ya respect
Or pay attention, 'cause I already paid the rest
To just focus on the God, as the God speak
Never waste a line like I'm sniffin' on the hard street

And as far as we go, you know how the squad see it
If it's love, it's love, if it's not, so be it

I put my love for boxing, into everything
I know the ropes, how to read the scale and work the ring
I'm military in the mind, hood in the streets
Good nigga in the hearts, nothing 'bout me weak

I open shop, rent the blocks and call the shots
You get popped, get knocked, co-operate with cops
I get live, survive at one sixty five
You nothin' like the God, I'm out raw 'til I die

Smile for me, kiss ya little child for me
I know the story, going to bed, feeling hungry
Wakin' up dirty, all eyes on me
Blinded thug angel 'til my God call me

I brought you up, from the ground up
Now you wanna run and say my sound suck
Tellin' niggaz Duck Down butt
But ain't no buts when I come around

All you hear is the crowd yell ""Buck""
Get it right or get it wrong
What's my name? Buckshot, What ya name?
Not in this song, heh, sorry no props today
Hard on the stretch, fiends won no rocks today

Shame, could of been in the game, but now what
You shine for an hour, nobody dug ya style, butt
The niggaz that be [unverified] you up
Hopin' you hand them a piece of the cut

Jesus, it sucks, your reason is what?
You don't got one, big deal, you got guns
I got guns, be for real, we can get it on right now
But stack up, your money short
And I'm long right now, I told you

Alive and free
Far away in time from our darkest day
That took our young and brave

From the cradle to the grave
70 years ago on July one 1916 on the Somme
The enemies had never seen fighting like this before
Such a simple plan--

How could any German man
Survive through that ordeal?
Company 'A' to Company 'be	'
""Morale is high here, sir, but I don't think it's safe to go""

Company 'A' from Company 'be	'
""Mister you have your orders and you must obey""
So the first line rose, and the first line fell
And a poet who survived later wrote about

A ""Sunlit vision of Hell""
And ""Larks singing""
Because after all it's just another summer's day in France
And the Tommie's on the Somme sang

Early natives related to throwns of David  
Captured by some patriots  and thrown on slave ships  
They stripped us naked  while they wives picked they favourite  
Lives were wasted, in the hands of the hated, 
Driven from the garden [garden], now we starvin' in the martyring Sodom, 

They call it Harlem, wordly problems got us at the bottom, 
The Earth crisis, and the righteous grab their ice picks, 
Seekers like us for our rices, I stay in ciphers, 
Our live is, connected to second son of Isaacs, which had a tight grip, 

On the heels of his brother, revealed to his mother, 
The elders who served the younger, words heard in thunder, 
Down from under, rose and fled to grow in hunger, now it's cold in summer, 
To slow your slumbers, behold a number, 600, 6 and 3 score, 

The same as he saw, who ate his heat raw, in the time before, 
They climbed aboard a dinosaur, information held behind the doors, 
We came from the atmosphere, the physical trapped us here, 
Then they gave us crack and beer, in the back of the stairs,

And watch the sunrise from sunset, none-slep, one flesh, one breath..

I lived like a monks of lowly, lowly, but lowly?, 

The president just ordered the navy to hit the borders of Haiti, 
Slaughtered babies from the waters of Ufraeties, 
Maybe they send germs that polluted our sperm, 
And made us live with circumcize in the serpent eyes, 

And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies, 
But in the halls of Farrow the walls are narrow, 
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom, 
Now free them, lets feed um', feed um'...

Promised us 40 achers and a mule, treated like an animal,

on arm and finger strength 

Once you've that  then the next step 

is to learn how to pierce stone 

Well you might as well start practicing now 

Do you Do you Do you Do you 

Do you know  mantis legends? 

How it was it all started? 

It was fighting off this blackbird 

Although it was only a tenth of the bird's size 

it was a very valiant insect 

And that's why the technique, needs a brave man 

And a strong one, who isn't afraid of birds

Tekitha,"It's been so long
Since he had a true friend
True friends are sure hard to come by

But then again
His loyalties lie within
Always kept his head to the sky
And they can't see, no, no, no

They can't see him walking through the darkness, no, no, no, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no, no, no, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no
They can't see him walking through, walking through

Day after day
And night after night
He's hustling just to get it right
There's no honor from thieves
No war without peace

The noose is tight, he'll still survive
Because they can't see, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
They can't see him walking through, walking through

No, in the end
Fate had it's place
On his road to become, becoming

They chased and gave haste
With zeal to a lemonade
Challenge instead of grace
And sealed his fate

They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no
They can't see him walking through, walking through
No
They can't see him walking through, walking through
Walking through

Walking through the darkness
Walking through the darkness
Walking through the darkness

A lot of things upset me as my soul rejects me
Enemy of my self physical.....listen, let me tell you about..
Yo yo confused but yet wise my problem surrounds me
A lot of things upset me as my soul rejects me
Enemy of self physically enslaved
By the luxuries of this world so I behave
Like a man inside the grave
Who's life is lost
I want the promised gold but can't afford the cost
Or could I, I know the prescribed laws
Any effect is a result of the cause
Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied
Burning inside wanting to open wide
And scream
The name of the supreme
But I'm trapped in this world
Lusting for girls
Therefore I imagine a genie and a wish
And searching for things that just does not exist
But in the midst there's the answer for which I have searched
Cause from me springs divine prince rakeem
And that is me the master of equality
With the ability
To set myself free
But b.o.b.b.y
He don't want to die,
He don't want to die he don't want to try
So I'm forced to cry
And get trapped up for living my life inside a lie
These problems surround me
A lot of things upset me
As my soul rejects me
Enemy of my self physically enslaved
By the luxuries of this world so I behave
Like a man inside the grave
Who's life is lost
I want the promised gold but I can't afford the cost
Or could I, I heard of the prescribed laws
Any effect is a result of the cause
Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied
Burning inside and wanting to open wide
And scream
The name of the supreme
But I'm trapped in this world
I'm lusting for girls
Before I imagined a genie and a wish
And I'm searching for things that does not exist
But in my midst there's the answer
For which I have searched
Cause from me springs the divine prince rakheem
And that is me the master of equality
Give myself the opportunity
And set free and be all I can be
Be all I can be
And not a nigga just trapped up in luxury
Yo bobby digitial got to get knowledge of his self right now,
As we go through the struggle of life we got to go from boy to man
We start off as sperm to baby baby to man from man to dead man
And from dead man back to sand

Three months man
Whatchu doin in here anyway?  You oughta be home with your momma
How old are you boy?
Thirteen
Thirteen?  Damn, the bastards must be runnin outta niggaz to arrest

Yeah, ohh yeah, this goes out
to all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo, dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box 
Some shared the same spoon, watchin saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this

I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality and reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin, aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
and again and again and again and again

Get some rest man, come on, man
Stop playin' wit' me, man
(Ohh ohh ohh)

Lately, I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately, you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

Broke the top of goose-down shits, kissed her on the neck
Real love, hope this ain't the last time we meet
Felt like a king who had a queen want him
I usually deserve hotels, this one's the gift, slick

On our eye-to-eye contact, body movement, all on the grind
A lady's starin' at me, all in my mind
Sayin', ""Boo, I gotta live with you, let's connect and be a bridge""
You stay three forths and I'm-a wiz you

Sayin', months ago, you came to me
Told me, love me forever
See, time has passed and lonely days
Have rid his head now, stormy weather

But out of the rain, came some delight
I ain't ashamed, I know that it's right
The way that I'm feelin'
He touches me, in ways I like

Says things you won't, won't day or night
Givin' me healin, I'm leavin'
'cause you wanted to know that is the reason

Lately, I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately, you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

The only set back in my state of grace
Is that the love is real, for you and him in different ways and
You're out in space, yes here on earth it's fun to play
I wish you were present so my love wouldn't go astray
And he gives what I need
Quenches my thirst when you say ""Girl, please""

That's a waste of my breath
And it's funny to me that you get upset
And I told you quite often
I'ma fill up the space, did ya think I was talkin'
Out the side of my neck?
You left me alone, what did you expect?

Lately, I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately, you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

I'm dead in my sleep, she's standin' over the kid
I'm terrified, shorty was deep
I had my hand in her account plus livin' in a lab
Like a count, I had to go six shorties was pink yo
She had the yolk on me that's when I went broke

We used to flip coke together, get boasted and float
We split real bread, we was large
We had our weddin' in the garage
And then she stopped reviewin' my bars
Hold up

Lately, I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately, you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

Lately, I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately, you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

So much trouble between each other cause ya ghetto life is strange

But still pimps and liars got my family zoned and took us on higher
The scale is off the rim, somebody stole ya meal
How was I to tell, you was chokin high shit
A lot of time was wasted, on hoes in different places
I made the first step away like rehabilitation
I learned something so serious
Life is a game and when you play it's one time period
A lot of my niggas be playin' foul ball
Expect that tech when y'all ass get that last call

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Been up for days cause where I stays, I can't blaze
A nap and it's beginning to weigh heavy on my thinkin' cap
I'm gettin' higher but shit I'm tired
I'm bout to pass out, slowly and surely off the wire
Relyin' on the starin' image of pimp shit
Nothin' but a word I see is pity
Now that the rain is gone I maintain killin' prone
Protection if you restin' in my zone
They in my spot, my home see
They want to take a load off my cot when you ain't makin' up ya own bed
Said Fred, that's the wrong leg snapper
You ain't gotta go home but I ain't cha' got damn Jed Clampett
But it's two misses that I miss in my direction
My own niggas in Memphis is cuttin' up my intersection
I did those and shattered lives and the lost souls
Save a prayer for them there table dancin' hoes

Quote fiction of fact, who gon' have yo back
When that shit get to poppin' off like that
Quote fiction or fact, who gon' have yo back
It's gon' be hell on wheels comin' back

Time is gettin' leerier, niggas are gettin' serious
Man you know I understand ya pain, that's why I'm feelin' ya
The words I'm comprehendin' the beats I was observin'
It was bumpy time in those planes caught up in some turbulence
Reservin' us some seats, we be like seated, exposited
And when this bitch here bleedin' I balled up just like a fetus
Young you by yourself and there was death upon the shelf
It' was pointed at cho' ass not from the right but from the left
Hours like them days and them days was like them hours
Screams was continuous, analyze of the phallus
Shit is goin' on in the zone
Predicted and convicted us a whole millennium
For philosophy, psychologically we outta reach
Mental capacity was actually positioned and breached
Now them sounds of the wrath got us subtract like math
Under gettin' holy and souly off the path

[Verse 1]
It was this bitch named LaQueesha, met her on the Eastside
Rollin' in my boat while pullin' her over with the p-sign
Spit the competence, and confidence in conversation
Chances on point and I'm not in violation
See hoes are like the value of a fraction
With me, I just proceed to do my deed to go to askin' em' relaxin' em'
Spit that game that drain from Imperial, she said a nigga be cereal
Like Cheerios, we live for hoes, here it goes
I'm rollin' with Suave and I ain't givin' a fuck
Employed with some voids is doin' jobs to us
A must, I can bust from a hundred yards plus
But St. Gal is the rough, got in the Seville and mushed (Nigga hush)
Now who's sweeter, the nigga Tela
5-0 be the leader, speed of a T to Vida
Switch the bitch, enlisted dicks
I'm love she up to this, no contradicts
I'm givin' a fuck about man understand this

[Chorus]
Keep on rollin' from the danger
And I'm loadin' one in chamber
Ain't nobody out there ridin' close to me, not for free
Keep on rollin' from the danger
And I'm loadin' one in chamber
Ain't nobody out there ridin' close to me, not for free

[Verse 2]
Now I'm makin' her mind cum off steak and rum
Abaci whites and henny whites and plenty umm, plum
Candy, man she understand me
See the name of the game is to be enchanting
Listen to those, I suppose that's the catch
In the beginning tryin' to get in, naw that's a childish act
Laid back, play that, roll havin' control over ya beau for a minute
Give her a hold and touch her titty
A pity someone gotta spit it intellectual
And give it the sexual meaning, keep it warm and dick it
I'll get it, the chick like I'm supposed to
Makin' a toast to the evening as we leavin'
I told ya she's gettin' social
Sayin' she's around the smoker of the doja
And she knows the soap and close to
Super tight, teeth white like liquid paper
Versace jeans, got the Beamer schemes on that ass
Shake her, take her silk from the fit that I just ripped
From the boss, see God finally pick on the other car off of the

[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here tryin' to figure if sweetie want to dick up
My eyes on thighs that gotta slide in thicker, picker
Questions apart from solutions
From dark ways back to Houston, I shoot competin'
Now loosen up the lips between the hips
Clutchin' on my nuts like grips
Gettin' full of this eclipse
Slips, it's something more loungin' than see-through gowns and
Got me clownin' in a tight town housin'
A thousand thangs on my brain as I recline
Dick these whores down from the crease in panty line
I guess I'm gonna seek through ya pines
I'm pressin' down the blinds to see reflection of super signs
A bitch goin' on out cha' gates
A nigga just pulled off his plates and ran up the staircase
Plates till seen like a scene from a tale
And nigga thinkin' she a queen so he ain't physically well
I can tell from the cussin' he talkin' about bustin'
He grabs a galss and hits my ass with the bloody stubs and
Now you runnin' down the hallways tryin' to get to the stairways
Gon' and bust his ass between Winchester and Airways
Get paid, never take murderers, take no services
If they got cho' bitch then you feelin' kind of nervous

Cause it ain't nothing like left
Your last step or should I say your last breath
G is past death
Do us part when you fucking with that Suave - House
Here, click whenever you on that corner
Bitches born from the south, tremendous doubt
But I ain't tripping, how I'm living
I get to dipping
From 96' to 2000 back to the thresh holds of Olympus
No limits, heaven forgive us, we was born solely sinners
Continuous, extraneous with this, cold as quitters
Oldest niggas, still they be like acting like such
So I ain't giving a fuck, with chances to clear the shit up
For what, I seek steel, I get stuck
I play jacks on the year like Bill Rodell, get hit by a truck
Bent the fuck back, despite the worst day handle my shit

Ain't no tanks in my trunk with some pumps
Just some chrome and such
And you can break the seal
On top of the wood on the bottom, that's the one's that are real
I can feel attention
It's all around me when I'm flipping at home in Memphis
Mentality, doberman pinscher
Not to mention that my ride stays out of state
And that my mind state is out of state
So they try to hypocrate
Setting voodoo, like in the movies
Giving me hell, call me Denzel
Chasing pipe bombs through A-T-L
But I prevail, cause I'm the best one, unconditional
With a high tech vest, maintain these little unknown body bags
Blast through sheet metal, and disappear
Come back, as a street weapon wearing some Suave gear, niggas unprepared

Rider, I just want to ride
Pass me a lighter, pass it to me, won't you pass it to me
Rider, I just want, I just want to ride
Pass me a lighter, pass it to me

I sets it off, in the center of the spot
It's getting hot, even in the winter I make it thicker than sheet rock
The plot I'm plotting, has got you open, hoping, scoping
That you can keep up with the flow that is spoken
No choking, I'm soaking, like collard greens, it seem
All this game of, where I came from, done seen many things
Bring killer niggas around me, shotguns in the county
Bounty hunters with runners, 5-0 bet em' they can't find me
want to blind me and my diesels, with my peoples behind me
Grind and grit to the bone, I'm stacking paper till I'm gone
Phone, house I'm getting, while I'm on the pot shitting
Trying to figure out a way to get better on Thanksgiving
Plymouth and powder rocks get dropped
So it don't take but a second for me to fuck your whole block
Stop, but I can't see I'ma ride till I die
Nigga S-you-A-V-E tatooed down my spine

No sooner than I walk in the club I'm gettin love from the masses
Women admirin' my baldhead and glasses
They makin' passes, I see they asses, I'm gettin' flirty
I got that liquor in my system, plus I'm wild and dirty
In my pockets is tickets for the Rockets
Million dollar nigga from the projects
I see no logic in niggas' hate when I ride past
My .45 sing lullabyes to they tired ass
See me, I be a candidate for bustin'
Don't fuck around unless you ready for the repercussions
Baby blushing, she drives a Benz, but I handle 'em all
Sophisticated as fuck, and she ain't wearin' no drawers

[Scarface:]
I met the broad in the parking lot, riding a 'Stang
Pulled her way up to her parking spot, the escalade
She hesitated for a minute, then she finally stopped
When she seen a nigga hollerin' at her ridin' a drop
Out her car to my passenger side the bitch came
Say she in a hurry this time, but no thang
Here's the pager number, I can call at night
Rarely ever beeped a bitch, but this broad was tight
Better yet got the cellular number, she seemed changed
Diamonds 'bout the size of a dime, and these thangs
Tend to 'em open, no question and one reason
That diamonds be a girl's best friends, so I treat them
Like bitches

[Tela:]
These bitches I be doin' in, hoes I be screwin', and
If she talk about her friends, then I probably flew 'em in
What's a man troublin', like fuckin' in a bubble Benz
With her hair in the wind, sittin' up from the rim
Gettin' down, plenty room, it was in the month of June
I was on promotional, she was into trickin' dudes
I'm no dude, or no guy, but I can fuckin' get you high
I won't tell you any lie, I don't play with any mind
She know about the L-O-T and how we roll
She know about the L-O-T and say we all cold

So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

[Too $hort]
I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch

Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
Piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces

I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P

Now, slide them lights and blow on my throw I
shakes 'em twice through the air they float, point
Twenty-five on the line (6 the easy way)
Thirteen in the field, 50 odds, oh my God
My whole table charged
I picks up a hundred eighty-eight yards
Sparks, balloons, room, V.I.P. cards
(Hook us up) You fuckers think y'all smart
Who sent y'all?  Hey fuck y'all
Fuck these cards, I'm outta Dodge

[Tela]
Towards the do' my ass done stopped
You guessed it, I'm at them slots
I drops two rubber bands, why not?
I'm up a hand at the MG Grand
Two mo' honeybuns the whole shit locked
Big guns, seven across, jackpot
My ass is hot, I'm heated
I'm scorch, I'm holdin it down, I'm runnin the court
In other words to make a long story short
.. I know the fuckin sport
I got the owner bout to shit his shorts
I got the city on life support
After this run I'ma sit and soak
Cause after this run, ain't SHIT broke
After this run, I don't need to smoke
I'ma get a bitch and get throwed on the boat",Can't Stop Me,2000
Tela,"It was this bitch that I knew back from '86
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckas go
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well
How the hell you been since I had no job
Hum, why don't you give me some
Cause you know I flow and run for Suave
Nah, all of that was on the couch
No doubt y'all records spin, y'all shippin' in gold
It's cold ""On The Outside Lookin' In"" (Br!)
You'd besta make yourself worthy
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their Johnson very dirty
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit
Ain't this a bitch
I remember when you would not give me shit
Now you down for them habits
Put your numbers on them natural
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom

Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothe sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?, Suave love

No different from the rest
She's just an ordinary hoe
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks
Niggas in love
Can't stay out the club
All in the hoe's face
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased
I see him in the back
Countin' up that chedder
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd
I think I know one
I remember you, oh yes I do
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo
What time the club close, at 3
What's up, you comin' with me
We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees
You want some cheese
Hoes don't stay at the suave house
Hoes around my nuts like knats
Real dogs don't pay for cats, dats
For real baby
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sho' 'nough

[Chorus]

Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe
Wants to get close to me
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow
Lookin for, confidants, and tickets to my next show
Check yo' bitch
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses
Oh yes it's very true
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do
Let her loose or let her remain
Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame
A bigger name
Look, this thang with bigger game
And she claim she ain't heard my music
Tryin' to trick me
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsly
She still hit me
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I
Really just don't plan on takin it out cause I

Tela,"I woke up out that coma 2001
'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin, wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts fallin' down
Better change your tune

Reach for the sky

Straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher

Got the truth bein' left behind

I gotta shake you off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake, 
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
so I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it

Raggedy-ass bitches
That bitch ain't no good

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
Look at your face all frowned up
The only thing you got goin for ya is your fake tits and round butt
You're a rich nigga's worst mistake
You're just a trophy, and what make matters worse you're fake
A mall broad tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Whatever they wear in the videos, you want it
You tryin to find the nigga with the biggest contract
To get you pregnant, so you can ride around and get fat
And collect big money, with the baby all sharing
Got a 18-year career from child bearing
And only God knows what this kid'll go through
Got mixed feelings about his dad cause of you
The dollar signs popped up, that's what did it
And dude, he was just as fucked up cause he hit it
And now you out there buyin champagne for the club
To me that's kinda fucked up

[ CHORUS: Devin ]
Only your mother could love you
Much too freaky, you're easy
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I ain't never had to pay for mine
Only your mother could love you
Much too sneaky, you're freaky
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I wouldn't give a broke bitch a dime

[ VERSE 2: Devin ]
You used to turn up your funky-ass nose before I even stepped up
I guess fuckin with me just wouldn't keep your rep up
I used to think about you when I'd go sleep, even dream
Of fuckin you without a rubber, fillin your pussy with cream
But when I wake and see you again, it be the same old shit
I finally realized you just a plain old bitch
Started gettin my shit tight rockin shows every night
Gettin my dick sucked, fuckin hoes left and right
Workin hard to blow up, now you wanna show up
With your stretch mark titties and pussy lips all towed up
I heard you got married, that was it you thought
Until he kicked your ass and took back all the shit that he bought
Now you're lookin for a shoulder to lean on
Bitch, I sho' hate it, cause my shit is dis-located
You was the only one I was thinkin of
But now you got a face only your mother could love

[ CHORUS ]

Break it down

[ Devin ]
I can't do nothin for ya
Only your mother could love ya
I can't do nothin for ya

Aight, check this out

[ VERSE 3: Tela ]
Look, Young Tela a pimp by force, not a pimp by choice
See, these bitches ain't playin when it come to the courts
They'll fold you like some foil when it comes to support
And you niggas out here trickin like nature takes its course
I'ma spit it till you're fitted, it's your main employ
See, I was trained and I was taught that a pimp keeps a choice
But you lames gotta change when you gave the whore a port'
One weekend at the Allstar and the bitch bought a Porsche?
I ain't mad, girl, flip em, you can get em, look we did it
Cause his mind was all twisted off the aether from the clinic
Now hit it, oh lawdy, look at shawty
Mission hit your boy for a four and a forty
Miss done get your Ford for a house - ""Help me homie""
See, I can give a fuck about your loss cause you're phoney
You'se a lame and she seen it in your heart from the start
Why she ripped yo ass apart? It was lying in her cards
But eh, she'll only come up with another, I don't trust her
But she got one hell of a hustle
You black-hearted bitch, you are full of lies
So like go on and suck Young Tela and die

No different from the rest 
She's just an ordinary hoe 
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo 
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix 
 
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks 
Niggas in love 
Can't stay out the club 
All in the hoe's face 
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased 
 
I see him in the back 
Countin' up that cheddar 
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
I think I know one 
 
I remember you, oh yes I do 
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
What time the club close, at 3 
What's up, you comin' with me 

We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
You want some cheese 
Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
Hoes around my nuts like knots 
 
Real dogs don't pay for cats, that's 
For real baby 
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sure enough

Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe 
Wants to get close to me 
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me 
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow 
 
Lookin' for, confidants, and tickets to my next show 
Check yo' bitch 
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses 
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses 
 
Oh yes it's very true 
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you 
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do 
Let her loose or let her remain 

'Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame 
A bigger name 
Look, this thang with bigger game 
And she claim she ain't heard my music 
 
Tryin' to trick me 
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsley 
She still hit me 
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I 
 
Really just don't plan on takin' it out cause I

We could have patched things up

Easy way out in friendship

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

In the window, 'Attack of The Killer Tomatoes'

Stands next to me and says he's pleased
To meet me, a tomato jumps from

Télépopmusik,"Spending our days translucent, in and out of everything
Hanging out with strangers that's the way that we begin
Staring at the sun, thinking it's the moon,
A tiny indication it's gonna happen soon. 
But not like you expect these silhouettes are getting closer
They bring you what you need never what you hope for.
I guess by now they shoulda told ya
I guess by now they're getting closer.

There's so many things I just don't want to say,
Like have you got the stuff I need a good day
There's so many things I just don't want to do
But your way is my way so walk on through
Did you get the letter, the one I never sent ya
I'm all alone on my own misadventure, seeking something
That I don't want to find, 'cause if I do there's no rewind.

Spraying our names on the trains in silver and black
Then I make my way back across the tracks
I can always find you wherever you are
There's fire in your eyes in the miracle park
I'm on the very last train to wherever, reckon that
I'll see you sometime like never, not even in
My wildest did I think that it would go like this, 
Moving through the air, crazy kinda poet kid

I owe you this I say to myself
I owe you this and nothing else

The nowhere else you'd find my kind
Dear John, oh yes I did all I could 
To make it be like the wallflower who never could
And I admit I wasn't pure, dear John
When I try so hard to make you sure
Life without you is not a cure
Dear John

And my unsung hero lies beneath
The rooftops made of gold
He's telling me I should jump
He'll be there when I fall
So I step back, pretend I'm shocked
Really I always knew
This would happen to me and you, dear John

I bought last week in Kensington Market
And I wore my brand new Chelsea boots
I rode there on my scooter but there wasn't anywhere to park it

And it was some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Salvador Dali's garden party
Salvador Dali's garden party

Everybody was there
Everybody was there
Everybody was there
Everybody was there

Got an invitation to a garden party
And it said that everyone would be there
Famous painters, the Pop Art poets, Hollywood filmstars
More celebrities than you have ever seen

It was some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Some kind of happening
Some kind of happening

Jack Nicholson was there
Mia Farrow was there
Woody Allen was there
Dennis Hopper was there
Peter Fonda was there
Debbie Harry was there

Telluride,"Once upon a time, in a far off land
Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light

They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And this miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase those miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

Now all around the world, in every little town
Everyday is heard a precious little sound
And every mother kind and every father proud
Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed

Nothing but a child could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase those miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

I'd be with you tomorrow and today

Beside you all the way
If the world should stop revolving
Spinning
Spinning slowly down to die

I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away",If,1999
Telma Costa,"Ah, se já perdemos a noção da hora
Se juntos já jogamos tudo fora
Me conta agora como hei de partir
Se, ao te conhecer, dei pra sonhar, fiz tantos desvarios
Rompi com o mundo, queimei meus navios
Me diz pra onde é que inda posso ir
Se nós, nas travessuras das noites eternas
Já confundimos tanto as nossas pernas
Diz com que pernas eu devo seguir
Se entornaste a nossa sorte pelo chão
Se na bagunça do teu coração
Meu sangue errou de veia e se perdeu
Como, se na desordem do armário embutido
Meu paletó enlaça o teu vestido
E o meu sapato inda pisa no teu
Como, se nos amamos feito dois pagãos
Teus seios inda estão nas minhas mãos
Me explica com que cara eu vou sair
Não, acho que estás te fazendo de tonta
Te dei meus olhos pra tomares conta
Agora conta como hei de partir

And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,

I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.

In love forever

Look! To all my people hurtin, all my people searchin
What we know for sure, God is always workin
Workin while you flirtin, workin while you jerkin
Workin while the world is turnin and these cities burnin
God is always workin, workin while you learnin
Workin while you ignorant and when you're not concernin
Christ consciousness, get that, got that
Spit that, rock that, hip that, hop that
You sniff that? Stop that, I give back and got back
Greedy? I'm not that, you needy for that shock rap
Slangin on the block rap, duckin where the cops at
I don't know that, but Jesus done copped that
Not that man on the cross, it ain't like that
You must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me

[Chorus]

One thing's for sure and believe it hurt
It's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church
They don't know God's law, and can't see God at work
So when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church
Like fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit
They gospel artists, still tryin to chase that loot
Hear the truth now, I come to enhance the light
They women of God, singin while they pants is tight?
They not hot! Really they, regular
They clothes they flows, all that, secular
What's the difference I could stay in the world and wild
if these church girls wear more makeup than Destiny's Child
Keep it real Christian, some of y'all liftin ain't likin
But this is the difference between a Christian and a Christ-ian
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me

They the type to get down, I'm the type to get up
From ""Criminal"" to ""Spiritual Minded"", now raise your head up
Let me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart
All they want is quick money, and a movie part
Let me begin - what, where, why or when
What's the use of double platinum if you're livin in sin

So you wanna be a conscious rapper
Can you handle the press and they negative chatter
Can you eat cold platters, and still spit data
Watchin others spit lies and they pockets get fatter
Can you climb up the ladder, and reach the top?
But it still doesn't matter, cause you ain't pop
Can you rock for the love of the art
Can you drop hit after hit after hit and still don't chart?
Can you REALLY stay loyal to God
when your life is full of strife, plus it always seems so hard
Can you handle the criticism
People holdin you up to higher standards, but they don't live 'em?
Can you hear these kiddy flows and laugh at it
But when you spit they callin you arrogant?
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', let's do it!

[Chorus]
Think you can do what I do
Think you can step in my shoes
You have no clue what I go through
You never felt my pain
When they attack my name
All because I have spoken the truth

To be a conscious rapper ain't a mystery
You gotta laugh when they call you contradictory
The whole industry, you gotta push and pull it
To really get with me, you gotta dodge they bullets
Blaow, blaow, blaow, every day and every way
You critics got somethin to say
At the same time, you gotta uphold Christ
Uphold life, while others flash cars and ice
It could break you down, take you down, make you frown
It could actually shake your ground
But if you love who you are, and believe in that
Best believe you will BE where the teacher's at
And where's that? In fact, in cold or heat
Yes, I declare victory over the streets
Overstand, over these beats, over the so-called elite
Over the strong, over the weak
I know how to speak, and most of all I know how to eat
I know I want humble and meek
So you better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', uhh

[Chorus]

Look!
So you thinkin about bein a concious MC
Well you gotta love God and you got to live free
You got to see the life that others can't see
You got to be the person that others can't be
You can't be a S-L-A, V-E
If you sayin to yourself, ""This may be me""
Then you know goin in that you work against sin
Your very skills will kill the demons within
So don't expect respect from slaves and hoes
Nor the slavemaster's video shows
Nor the rap mags, you know how it go
Especially black mags, you know they don't know
Just go to the crowd that you know will need you
Cause NOTHING compares to the respect of the people
That's what you look for, that's what you work with
Cause anything else, is truly worthless
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris'
You better think about that, 'fore you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris', uhh

But only a few can hear it though
The metaphysical lyrical blow
The minute you're in it and hear it, yo

See the evil and clear it, yo
See that for as many that died there was twice as many miracles
Uh, so let the dead bury their dead
Life is but a dream and in the dream we gotta get ready for bed

Better we look ahead instead, to the ones that survived
Pray for them too, 'coz there grace of God kept them alive
Yes, we mourn for the dead and will still kill for them
But what about the injured that must still rebuild again?

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

To all the people, that never lost someone
Consider the cost of the loss of a lost daughter or son
These cowards slaughter and run
And to know that there's more than just one

Makes you wanna store up your gun
And withdraw all the funds, but

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victorya
The love I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

First realize givin up is wack
Say to yourself I can never be wack
Then realize that we must go back

is you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain

You still the creation of a music executive

They throw you away and they pimp your kid

You know why we got racial profilin?
Cause you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name

Hardcore like The LOX is, Scott LaRock is where Tupac is
Where hip-hop is, Digital-ly Underground like Shock is
Oh yes -- I know where the top is
But I'd rather rhyme about how crooked some of these cops is

TV is wack, they wanna show us beatin Iraq

Gets now the brow beateth to underground emceeth

Know that they get what they want before they act

Here's what you DO have that be bringin the drama
Ask and it shall be given, with a comma

So when will you be it, when will you see it
That thoughts and things they manifest when you decree it
But God be lookin out for you
Puttin a stop to what you're about to do
In your life, and in your circumstances
Every time you speak you be takin chances
Talkin bout things that you really don't have to have
So when you get 'em, your life turns sad
Your life turns bad, now why would your God be allowin that?
Trust in God, that's where the crown is at
It's not in what you get, it's what happens after that
So if you think your life is shrinkin
It may be cause you keep thinkin
Not that intellect is wrong
It's just the beginning, it might be time to move on

Walk on by
It's just a difficult time in which the people could die

It's a difficult time
Put your friends on the wall
Take a look at the scene that you can see past paradise
Then just close your eyes

Take a gamble and make a little bet on paradise
So then wonder why

Age fell into the seas, sunset of the east, you and I alone here

Shake away and become from an hour of the day

Little did I know back then what my tapping fingers meant
A compulsive urge to hum a tune, to touch a piano key
In every sound and rhythm scape, I found a piece of me

The picture began to become more clear,
My purpose more firmly grounded
The day I sat at my brother's drums,
Picked up his sticks and pounded
I felt the ceiling open up, heart and mind were lifted
This primal force convincing me, my goals in life had shifted

Then I learned a few guitar chords just to seal the deal
The power of music I could not ignore, the surge inside
Me real
I plucked away at Misfits' tapes 'til I could play along

Yeah right! You got the answer 

Through the years he came to know 
Sometimes its better to let it go 
And never look back no matter what they said 
And then the ones he learned to ignore 
The ones who always asked for 
More secretly respect the life that he led

And he was once in a desperate 
Need for attention and so much more 
Living his life with the question of conception There is no more... 
No more feeling sorry 
And no more getting mad 
Yeah right! You got the answer",Never Look Back,1994
Ten Foot Pole,"You tell me of a place where everybody knew their
Neighbors all the families helped each other and no one
Ever locked their doors you tell me no one locked their
Doors old man please stay a while I know at first I seemed
Too busy but now I'll make the time stay and tell me one
More story tell me about the time you ditched school to go
Fishing you thought the branch would hold your neighbor
Pulled you from the river he helped you wash your clothes
And stitch the hole in your trousers and your mom never
Knew why he giggled when he saw you a place where no
One locks their doors a place where no one locks their
Doors you tell me that you would show me only now it is too
Late I would like to build community only now it is too late
Things can never be the way they were before you can't go
Back to how things were before once the trust is gone
Once the trust is gone once the trust is gone you'll lock the
Door I can imagine that life but it seems so far from real it's
Just like a story that's the kind of life I've never known old
Man you're leaving now taking with you things I've never
Known I wonder where you're going and if it would be like
Your old home I hope you find the place you're looking for",Old Man,1994
Ten Foot Pole,"Looking in the mirror what's left to see
Fragments of life all the pieces are broken
The skyways open to conquer the moon
I'm going to get there just watch me
Maybe tomorrow I'll think of tomorrow

The Dai Lama prays for us
Oppressor and friend
Human understanding
We can build a better world
Oceans of wisdom
Speak out loud
We'll think of tomorrow
Tomorrow's children
Come out and play
When I have a kid of my own
What will I teach him?
Prepare him to be alone
Because some day he'll be all alone

But the only truth is what you feel inside
What's inside?
When will we ever get along?

Ten Foot Pole,"They tell you there were better days
You can't remember through the haze
This is the only life you've ever known
They sigh and talk about fist fights
When you could go to sleep at night
Without avengers tearing out your wishbone
You pray to god and wonder just who's up there
What kind of father would leave his kids alone
In a world where you're lucky if your mom cares
Hordes of people call the street their homes
They want to take away the guns
You want to get some bigger ones
Your defense is up to you alone
They think that they can stop the heat
But they don't understand the street
You don't want your girl crying on your tombstone
Living in that memory
Don't understand what they see
So they pay cops to make it yesterday
You can't push back the hands of time
You want to know and keep on trying
Do your best to stay out of their way",World's Best Dad,1994
Ten Foot Pole,"Sitting on the couch watching time slip away
Reach for your lighter to burn another way
The clock runs fast while you run slow
Nothing worth doing and nowhere to go

Don't blame it on the herb
You get what you deserve
There are people all around that it has served
I know how you feel
I have been there before
But now it's up to you I can't do any more

I can't wait for you another day
Your attitude has got to change
What else do you expect me to say
Get off your ass or I'm on my way

Maybe life is pointless and full of pain
But slowly dragging through it drives me insane
I know we were close and I will miss you
But I can't wait around there's so much I want to do

Don't blame it on the herb
You get what you deserve
There are people all around that it has served
What can I do when you ask me for help?
I have tried everything but you do it for yourself

I know you just want to dull the pain
But life goes fast and you stalled in the slow lane
You know you're lagging and it's time to shift gears
And blow this rut you have been stuck in for years

Now it's time, it's time for a change

Ten Foot Pole,"Mommy, what does hyper mean?
Teacher says I'll never read
She says I need to take a pill
So I can learn to sit real still

The microwaves did something to our brains
We need to take these pills to help us change

Please, let me take them; I don't want to be an idiot
Ritalin will make me smart
At least that's what my teacher said
All the other kids take them; I think I am the only one
I need something to slow me down
I talk too much 'cause I am dumb

Mommy, what's a deficit?
I think it means that I can't sit
Disorder of attention
And I don't learn the lesson

Mommy, please, help me see the light
Don't you know my teacher's always right?
Joey's starting on week four
He's not in trouble any more
Susie's ending up week nine
Now she's never out of line

Please, let me take them; I don't want to be an idiot

I'd really like to see you soon

",Damage,1997
Ten Foot Pole,"It's funny how a little truth can put things in perspective
Usually, I try to hide from all of life's un-pleasantries
Like corruption, lies, and users
Try to ignore all the abusers
But sometimes truth just slaps me in the face

And I can't hide
Try to deny deception, but now I see the other side
I can't hide
Try to regain my innocence, but something's changed inside

Funny how perceptions change when you know secret history
Suddenly, you see right past the thin veil of diplomacy
Like the smiles that invite glare at you
Like they're filled with spite
The warm handshakes just seem so out of place
And I can't hide

Every person has a dark side; please, don't show me yours
I don't really think I want to know you can't be trusted
They say the truth will set you free
But they don't say how deep the cut will be
Trust dies and paranoia takes its place
And I can't hide",Denial,1997
Ten Foot Pole,"It was the alcohol you said,
Took away your common sense,
You don't remember a thing,
Unconsiousness is your defense,
Its everybodys fault but your,
And now we must forgive,
How can you hold a grudge,
When you can't remember what you did?

but, its not so easy to forgive,
No matter what you said,
Its not so easy to forget,
It won't just go away,
It will never be the same,
You'll never drink that much again,
Those intentions sound just great,
And I'm glad to see you've learned,
I think its just a little too late



",Excuses,1997
Ten Foot Pole,"Life's so unfair, you thought
Then turned on your TV
Life's so unfair you sobbed
Then picked up the keys

You lock your castle door behind you
To go for a ride
Your shiny car roars as you think
Of what you've been denied
No one understands your mind no one ever tried
No one has a clue of what you are inside

And I lie
But I believe myself
And the truth hurts more than anything else

Drowning in self pity killing time
It helps me to write the words
To think about the grime
And if you piss me off

Please don't apologize
My anger drives conviction as I proclaim these silly lies
If you don't believe me
Just read between the lines
No one has a clue of what's behind these eyes
And I lie",Fiction,1997

I still think that you're just great
You need to wait in the right place

Aw, Ma don't you think I tried?
I think there's something wrong inside
I have no problem making friends
But that's where the story ends

I have no problem hanging out
Then I see a glimpse of doubt
And I don't understand
What makes them not like me?

I'm just trying to be myself
But it's so far from everyone else
And I don't understand what makes them not like me

Hey Pete I see from what you said
That the problem's all in your head
And if you want to make a change
You must let go of being strange

Yeah Mom the problem's in my brain
Sometimes I really think I'm insane
It goes much deeper than the beard
Deep down inside me I'm just weird

I have no problem hanging out
Maybe I'm just weird

You're not weird Pete you're just fine

Regardless of the strange things you've done

You won't remember me tonight

Someone will hold your hand tonight
Someone will sleep right by your side

I miss your piercing glare
I miss your fearless touch

And after all this time
I thought we would forgive

Ten Foot Pole,"John takes a seat so he can wind his watch
Not working anymore but it's so good to touch

It's the only solid evidence of what he's done and seen
It helps him to remember his past life was not a dream
It used to tell the time when he was young
But time means nothing now
He has a clear view of the sun

John stopped me on the street today
He didn't have that much to say
I said I had to get to work but he begged me to stay

There was a look in his eyes I'd never seen before
I couldn't walk away I knew I wouldn't see him anymore
He bummed a smoke looked off into space awhile
Then he looked into my eyes and unleashed a fleeting
Smile

Dennis it's so good to see you
You have no idea
Just how bad it's getting on the street
I try to hide away
But they find me every day

They sent me a letter
Said it was suicide
But I know better",John,1997
Ten Foot Pole,"Is there something more I just can't see?
I've been so busy trying every day to make ends meet
Been such a long time
Since I stopped to smell the coffee
Now I wonder: can I tell the forest from the trees?

I know that I feel pride and I know that I fear shame
I know I want you to smile when you hear my name
Seems like a silly game
But I know I play it harder than anything

I feel alone
There's people everywhere
Some of these people even care
Once in a while you find someone who really cares
But I'm too busy to give them what they need
It's not greed, it's the fear of failure
It keeps me going
But when tomorrow comes, there's always something more
And I can't stop working long enough
To wonder what life's for
What is it for?
Am I just a whore?
Who am I working for?",Pride and Shame,1997
Ten Foot Pole,"You heard: it's no use trying to make sense, it doesn't matter anyway
There's no one worth the pain, no reason left to stay
I try to turn it off; where did the old me go?
How did I get so far away? I just don't know

Every act of kindness boils down to lust or greed
No one acts from altruism; it all comes down to need
There's a monster inside my heart
He tries to tear my world apart
There's a demon inside my head
Tells me I'd be better off dead

I try to turn it off, get back to positive
Don't want to drag you down to the street where I live
I try to turn it off, get back to happy days
Pull this barrel from my mouth and look for better ways

No one cared about her shame
No one cared about her pain
And she could not accept that no one gave her time
She said, ""They will watch me
Yes, by God, I'll make them see.""

I still want to believe,

Another broken promise another time you failed us,
One more excuse to buy some time,
Another disappointment another dropped commitment,

To wake me from my sleep,

Another year goes by and I don't look the same,
The new gray hairs the smile lines I'm weathered now I can't deny it,

Today my future looked so bright,
All it took was one red light,
The sirens were close behind,
My brain said fight or flight,
So I ran from my mistake,
Not the best choice I could make,

That this time there' s no lucky break,
I always did things my own way,
Never cared what the experts say,
I thought they were so full of shit,

I wish you would calm down,
I wish you would remember just who you really are,
and I cannot forget you left me all alone,
Never bothered to pick up the phone,
I guess I'll hit the bar,
There's nothing you can say to make it go away,
There's nothing you can do I don't rely on you,
I thought that we could talk I thought I could forgive,
I thought that we could mend the fences",Still Knee Deep,1998
Ten Foot Pole,"I didn't notice that you cut your hair,
I didn't notice that it was blue,
I didn't notice that you pierced your tongue,
I don't recall the dress you wore the day I met you,
I almost missed your birthday once again,
Your sister called me just in time,
I forgot to wipe my muddy shoes,
You get so pissed when I track around the grime,
This is but a test,
This is just a trial run,
You can still push reset,
Trade me in for a better one,
Sometimes I'm a dick I'm a rabid hockey fan,
All I can promise is I'll do the best I can,
I forgot to pick you up on time,
And I forgot to pay the bills,
I forgot to put the seat back down,
Sometimes my drinking buddies take your favorite pills,
You can't say I don't bring you flowers anymore,
Because I don't bring them any less,
And I don't take you to your favorite store,
'cause I don't have the money to buy your favorite dress,
But I work and I try,
I'm not as big a jerk as every other guy you ever liked,
you ever knew,
Once in a while I go with you to buy new shoes,
But I work and I try,
I'm not quite as big a jerk as every other guy you ever liked,
You ever knew,
Sometimes I break down and take you to the zoo",This Is But a Test,1998
Ten Foot Pole,"The pedals go round and round, I'm low on gas
I've given up on going fast.
'Cause I've been here, and I've been there,
Not too much surprises me now
I've seen it all.
But I don't mind, I'll find the bright side one more time,
And I don't mind, I'll give it one more try.
Cause even if my legs are chopped off
As long as I have my thumb
I'll catch a ride.",I Don't Mind,1999
Ten Foot Pole,"I couldve lied
The truth a needle in your eye


The wound a band-aid won't heal
But I persist


And try to tell it
Like it is



what's the point if were not real?


[Chorus]


Riptide sweeps me out to drown
Flailing arms and aching chest the more

I struggle,the more it wears me down

how long can I hold my breath?


Another test

you used to say I was the best so
Proud to walk by my side



now you see everything that's wrong with me

can you accept it

will you try?



[Chorus]

Choking

still I'm kicking


Driftig farther out to sea
I won't let go of


My dim hopes somehow

you'll make it out to me

Ten Foot Pole,"So you think that it's over
That your love has finally reached the end
Any time you call night or day
I'll be right there for you
When you need a friend
It's gonna take a little time
Time is sure to mend your broken heart
Don't you even worry pretty darling
'cause I know that you'll find love again
Love is all around you
Love is knockin' outside your door
Waiting for you
Is this love made just for two
Keeping on (you'll find) you'll find love again I know [x2]
It's all around!
Love will find a way

But each new movement pushes up an old lie

One dream, one cause, one emperor,
One boss, one king, one dictator

Ten Mile Tide,"I went sailin' out to the farthest seas
I went lookin' for answers and she came to me
I said, I don't know what to do
She said just stay with me, stay with me

I'd been up and down and all around
I'd been in every little corner of every little town
I said, I don't know where to go
She said just stay with me, stay with me

Well, the sun was going down and it was getting late
And the winding road ahead held a winding dose of fate
I said, I don't know just where to turn
She said just stay with me, stay with me

I looked at her, and she looked at me
And the signs were all there, it was so easy to see
She reached out and took me by the hand
And said just stay with me, stay with me

So I dropped my pack and I sparked up a light
And the fire grew high and her eyes glowed bright
I said, I don't know what to do
She said just stay with me, stay with me

(Chorus):

Why don't you
Stay the night with me

Well she opened her basket and there was plenty to share
As my lonesome guitar soothed the cool evening air
I said I've got some places I've gotta go
She said just stay with me, stay with me

I started strummin' a tune and it went something like this
It was soft it was smooth like a velvety mist
I said I don't think I am what you need
She said just stay with me, stay with me

Well, as the fog rolled in she drew closer to me,
Until the fire and her was all I could see
I said I can't allow myself to fall for you
She said just stay with me, stay with me

Then she reached out gently and put her hand on the strings
Said I'm not lookin' for love, I'm not lookin' for rings
I know you don't got those to give
I wish you'd stay with me, stay with me

So I dropped my guitar and I looked in her eyes
And the charm that was there made me gasp in surprise
And as she drew me in, I knew I was falling fast
And she said just stay with me, stay with me

(Chorus)

I woke up at dawn, but she wasn't around
And though I looked so hard, she was not to be found
I said my girl where have you gone
Why didn't you stay with me, stay with me

I searched and I scrambled and I searched some more
But the wind was arisin' my ship was too close to shore
I said my girl where have you gone
Why didn't you just stay with me, stay with me

Then I found her note, and it said she was gone
And I understood then why she set off alone
It said I walked away, but I wanted to stay
And have you stay with me, stay with me

Well, I'm sailin' now across unknown seas
But when I listen closely to the evenin' breeze
I swear I hear a whispered voice that says
Just stay with me, stay with me

So I'm headin' back, but I'm not there yet
Though it gets so hard when I see the sun set
And a voice inside my chest cries out
Just stay with me, stay with me

So why does she feel so all alone
So many memories, that can't be shared

How can I learn to trust myself

When it's done I'm coming back to you,

Honestly, why can't we

Leave the nightlife for the lonely

And spend your evening right beside me


And when the drinks go down too fast

You slow down baby

It's time to come clean

Honestly, think clearly when conscious

feels unconscious

and black and white perspective

turns to gray

Honestly, sleep soundly but while you

Fall asleep I'm leaving

So enjoy all the things you're dreaming


And when the drinks go down too fast

You slow down baby

It's time to come clean

Tena Jones,"I got a question for you
When you see another human being who's being treated worse than a disease
On his knees, beggin' please, for egg and cheese
Or anything to eat do you see his test as a lesson for you
Or do you move on say ""fuck em"", ignore em
Can't do nothing for em, if this is true, let me count your blessings for ya
You could be fighting hunger, not the Gandhi type hunger strike fighting for something right
I mean fighting the type of hunger a little girl in the third world
Fights everyday 'til her stomach is nothing but something that her spine is hiding under
Only been alive 5 summers
Hunger pains, her heart beating like some live drummers
It's beating harder, then she drop, died
Momma lost a daughter 'cause they ain't have food and drinking water
God damn I shed a tear in the booth
'Cause when I say it I'm simultaneously hearing the truth
But do you care?

[Chorus]
I need to know if you care
We dying out here in the streets
Little kids, they got nothing to eat
But does anybody care?
(Are you there?
Who cares?
You need to see you in them out there, to care.)

Like Zero Dark Thirty we saw terror
Growing up in the hood, a small error
In judgement can make your parents become some pallbearers
For nothing, they saw Eric and he gangbanged, but they can't aim
So them straight shots caught ??? for nothing, do you care what
Get involved, get out of your chair, stand the fuck up
Do something, don't lie down and do nothin
Five rounds, hit him in his side now
Blood paints the streets of the Chitown since the news [?]
When is the truce coming?
Violence hit a new summit
And the view from it allows us to see the youth plummet
Gotta be sad, colostomy bags, shots got teenagers rockin' a new stomach
And I ain't saying that this rap was perfect
But I'm strapped with purpose
Trying to get past the surgeons in that emergency room
But if I don't get past the casket service
Just write this shit on my tomb
Nobody care

[Chorus]

We dying out here in the streets
Little kids, they got nothing to eat
But does anybody care?
Does anybody care?

Tenacious D,"A long-ass fucking time ago, in a town called Kickapoo
There lived a humble family, religious through and through
But yea, there was a black sheep and he knew just what to do
His name was young J.B. and he refused to step in line
A vision he did see-eth, fucking rocking all the time
He wrote a tasty jam and all the planets did align

Oh, the dragon's balls were blazin' as I stepped into his cave
Then I sliced his fuckin' cockles with a long and shiny blade
'Twas I who fucked the dragon, fuckalizing fuckaloo
And if you try to fuck with me, then I shall fuck you too

Gotta get it on in the party zone
I got to shoot a load in the party zone
Gotta lick a toad in the party zone
Gotta suck a chode in the party zone, aah!

You've disobeyed my orders, son, why were you ever born?
Your brother's ten times better than you, Jesus loves him more
This music that you play for us comes from the depths of hell
Rock and roll's The Devil's work, he wants you to rebel
You'll become a mindless puppet, Beelzebub will pull the strings
Your heart will lose direction and chaos it will bring

You'd better shut your mouth, better watch your tone
You're grounded for a week with no telephone
Don't let me here you cry, don't let me hear you moan
You gotta praise The Lord when you're in my home

Dio, can you hear me? I am lost and so alone
I'm askin' for your guidance, won't you come down from your throne?
I need a tight compadre who will teach me how to rock
My father thinks you're evil but man, he can suck a cock
Rock is not The Devil's work, it's magical and rad
I'll never rock as long as I am stuck here with my dad

I hear you brave young Jaybles, you are hungry for the rock
But to learn the ancient method, sacred doors you must unlock
Escape your father's clutches and this oppressive neighborhood
On a journey you must go to find the land of Hollywood

In The City of Fallen Angels where the ocean meets the sand
You will form a strong alliance and the world's most awesome band
To find your fame and fortune, through the valley you must walk
You will face your inner demons, now go my son and rock

So he bailed from fuckin' Kickapoo with hunger in his heart
And he journeyed far and wide to find the secrets of his art
But in the end he knew that he would find his counterpart
Rock!

You don't always have to fuck her hard
In fact sometimes that's not right to do
Sometimes you got to make some love
And fuckin' give her some smooches too

Sometimes you've got to squeeze
Sometimes you've got to say please
Sometimes you got to say hey
I'm gonna fuck you, softly
I'm gonna screw you gently
I'm gonna hump you, sweetly
I'm gonna ball you discreetly

And then you say hey I brought you flowers
And then you say wait a minute Sally
I think I've got something in my teeth
Could you get it out for me
That's fuckin' teamwork

What's your favorite posish
That's cool with me it's not my favorite but I'll do it for you

Hard fucking?

No. You feel like you're taking them to the limit.

We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon.
In the middle of the road.
And he said:
""Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul."" (soul)

Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
And we each said. ""Okay.""

And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
Just so happened to be,
The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three,
It was destiny.
Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow

Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
Whip-crack went his whoopy tail,
And the beast was done.
He asked us: ""(snort) Be you angels?""
And we said, ""Nay. We are but men.""
Rock!
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!

This is not The Greatest Song in the World, no.
This is just a tribute.
Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, no, no.
This is a tribute, oh, to The Greatest Song in the World,
All right! It was The Greatest Song in the World,
All right! It was the best muthafuckin' song the greatest song in the world.

And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
The song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound
Anything like this song.

Ben franklyn was a rebel indeed

He was a genious but if he was here today
The government would fuck him up his righteous aayyy 

Now let me tell you something about the government (uh huh)
They're fucking up the environment (say what?)
They're taking all the fucking beautiful animals (yeah?)
And making them fucking extinct (oh no!)

Tenacious D,"This is a song called the history of Tenacious D
And its not just a list of bullshit that we've done in the past
It's a chronicling of our rise....TO POWER

We ride with kings on mighty steeds 
Across the devils plain
We've walked with Jesus and his cross
He did not die in vain, NO!

We've run with wolves, we've climbed K2
Even stopped a moving train
We've travelled through space and time my friends
To rock this house again, ROCK!

We ride and we ride and we'll never subside
And we'll ride till the planets collide
And if you say that we do not ride
I'll tan you're fucking hide, RIDE!

Kyle's fingers be silver, Jacks voice then be gold
But lest you think we're vain
We know you're all robots and we don't care
Tenacious D, we reign!

We rei-eign, surpreme, OOOHH GOD!
Burrito supreme, and a chicken supreme
And a cutlass supreme
SUPREEEMEEEEE YEAAAAAHHH
SUPREME!!

Tenacious D,"A long-ass fucking time ago, in a town called Kickapoo
There lived a humble family, religious through and through
But yea, there was a black sheep and he knew just what to do
His name was young J.B. and he refused to step in line
A vision he did see-eth, fucking rocking all the time
He wrote a tasty jam and all the planets did align

Oh, the dragon's balls were blazin' as I stepped into his cave
Then I sliced his fuckin' cockles with a long and shiny blade
'Twas I who fucked the dragon, fuckalizing fuckaloo
And if you try to fuck with me, then I shall fuck you too

Gotta get it on in the party zone
I got to shoot a load in the party zone
Gotta lick a toad in the party zone
Gotta suck a chode in the party zone, aah!

You've disobeyed my orders, son, why were you ever born?
Your brother's ten times better than you, Jesus loves him more
This music that you play for us comes from the depths of hell
Rock and roll's The Devil's work, he wants you to rebel
You'll become a mindless puppet, Beelzebub will pull the strings
Your heart will lose direction and chaos it will bring

You'd better shut your mouth, better watch your tone
You're grounded for a week with no telephone
Don't let me here you cry, don't let me hear you moan
You gotta praise The Lord when you're in my home

Dio, can you hear me? I am lost and so alone
I'm askin' for your guidance, won't you come down from your throne?
I need a tight compadre who will teach me how to rock
My father thinks you're evil but man, he can suck a cock
Rock is not The Devil's work, it's magical and rad
I'll never rock as long as I am stuck here with my dad

I hear you brave young Jaybles, you are hungry for the rock
But to learn the ancient method, sacred doors you must unlock
Escape your father's clutches and this oppressive neighborhood
On a journey you must go to find the land of Hollywood

In The City of Fallen Angels where the ocean meets the sand
You will form a strong alliance and the world's most awesome band
To find your fame and fortune, through the valley you must walk
You will face your inner demons, now go my son and rock

So he bailed from fuckin' Kickapoo with hunger in his heart
And he journeyed far and wide to find the secrets of his art
But in the end he knew that he would find his counterpart

Tenacious D,"This is the ballad of Hollywood Jack and the Rage Cage
Nothing could stop them when Jables and Rage hit the stage
and Hollywood Jack hit the big time and when to make movies
Rage Kage was left far behind in the dust of his dreams

And he grumbled and growled and watched Hollywood Jack on Jay Leno
He bellowed and said he'd be nothing without help from Kage
he burned up the photos of Jables and Kage doing mushrooms
""Fuck him, I don't need no Hollywood jack anyway""

So Hollywood Jack lived up high on a hill in a bubble
and Rage Kage live deep in the broiling valley below

Yes, the rage Kage bubbled with rage
He looked at the ground
and he looked on the stage
The lava was throwing
and boiling inside the old Kage

As Hollywood Jack climbed the ladder of stardom before him
He watched as his indie credentials flew right out the door
He'd make millions and then he'd go out and he'd make even more millions
He'd screened KG's calls and snorked coke of the ass of a whore

No one respected him
They just rejected him
No one would represent Kage
Left on the streets of his dreams
He'd would cry, and he'd rage for the stage

Ahahaaa

Then Hollywood Jack got a message that Kage was in trouble
They send Kage away cause he had gone completely insane
So Hollywood Jack jumped upon a jetplane and flew all that night through
the rain
To be with his friend to see what remained of his brain
Then Hollywood Jack told the doctors: You got to retrieve him!
You've got the technoligy, use the techniques of your trade
He grabbed the Lapelles and he screamed ""BY GOD YOU MUST SAVE HIM!""
Because Rage Kage and I can't you see that were one and the same!

Aaaah!

OH RAGE KAGE!
There'd be magic inside that old name
And you know that you know
That you're going completely insane

Oh the Rage Kage!
Oh the Rage Kage!

And you know
Yes you know
That you're going completely insane

Yes the Roadie knows, what the Roadie knows, and the Roadie knows that he wears black clothes, and he hides off in the shadows of the stage.

Chorus

Because the Roadie, looks a thousand miles with his eyes,
And when the crowd raws, rains of tears drop to the Roadies eyes,tears of pride.
Because his watching the show, but you will never know,
His changing the strings, while hangin' in the wind,
No matter how hard, the show mustgo on.

When a beautiful girl come to me she say, hey can I sucka your dick,
And I'll say yes, I'm in love.
And then she quickly say I sucked your dick,
Now give me that backstage pas, I do not want you Roadie,
I want KG's chode.

Chorus 2

I'm standing at the fresh hole of your dreams,
Without me there would be no sound from those amps,
Without me there would be no light on the stage,
But you don't applause for me.

I I'm the Roadie, lonesome warrior searching for his soul,
I I'm the Roadie, I make the rock go.

message of one love)

My heroes catchin 3 or 4 through they corridor
They blast on em, hit the gas on em, last call
A bullet make a life shatter like a glass jaw
Look like the devil gettin just what he axe for when the gas draw
They want to blame it on the gangs but it's a bigger picture
'cause why we're steady dyin somebody gettin richer
Listen to what I'm spittin, who you think benefittin
while all these heads splittin they money-gettin
See the gangbangin ain't all about the red and blue
'cause some many's corporations is gangstas too
They rub you out in a minute gettin greedier and greedier
Buyin out major labels and pimpin the media
Orchestratin beef between the west and east
Kill a superstar, blow up his next release
We got to put them straps down 'cause if you let them stay dead
Every death in black America is gang related

Let me go so I can check up on my younger seeds""
To show em right so they won't reach these penetentiaries
'cause over the years that's what them folks want us to turn out to be, and
just release you
When I was young I wanted to be a thug
hang on the corner, smoke my weed and try to sell my drugs and show no love
In '97, all this had to change
So many murdered behind unnecessarily petty games, it's all a shame
Doin crimes as a past time
Tryin my best to stay alive is all that's on my mind
I hit my knees and drop my head between and ask the Lord
""Please let me make it through this struggle"" even though it's hard
Jealousy got us hatin it, wantin to kill each other though
What ever happened to the sayin that we are all bro's
Keep it up and best believe you, I will finally see it's gang related
So we best to let the killin cease, now rest in peace

Tell me how many Haiti bottles I gotta empty
before I wise up and stop lettin the devil tempt me
Usin materialism to jealousy to pimp me
Live by the gun, die by the gun, to put it simply it's gettin shady
They got me mad like rabies, headed for Haiti's
Sellin they soul for a Mercedes and fly ladies
All this dirt being done ain't gang related

And we'll dance
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away
And if I'm feeling good to you
And you're feeling good to me
There ain't nothing we can't do or say
Feeling good, feeling fine
Oh, baby, let the music play

Whoa listen to the music

Surrounding castles in the sky
And the crowd is growing bigger
Listening for the happy sounds
And I got to let them fly

Who ruled Babylon and all its land. 
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand. 
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind. 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God, 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood. 
Belshazzar asked him what it said, 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read: 

""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand. 
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your houses are built upon the sand.""",Belshazzar,1998

And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
I looked north, east and west and then a leadin' south
I saw a wide open road

there's a wide open road
It?s leadin? south from my abode

There's a wide open road

Well, the reason I was lookin? for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat is still around
And you left your weddin' ring when you went

How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll a dough

Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant woman 
He grew up in another small village 
Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter 

Then for three years he was a traveling minister 
But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born 
And where he did go he usually walked 
He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home 

Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big city 
Yes here was a man 
Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness 
He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world 

Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world 
While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him 
Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him 
One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies 

Then he went through the mockery of a trial 
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves 
And even while he was dying his executioners gambled 
For the only piece of property that he had in this world 

And that was his robe his purple robe 
When he was dead he was taken down from the cross 
And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends 
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone 

And today he's a centerpiece of the human race 
Our leader in the column to human destiny 
I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever marched 
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas 

All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever reigned 
All of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth 
So powerfully as that one solitary life

'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black.

One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years.

The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home.

Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong.

The transmission was a fifty three
And the motor turned out to be a seventy three
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.

So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an adapter kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on.

The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin.""

So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds.

I got it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

Why can't I let you know,

Oh I can see right through it all
Oh I can see right through
See right through I see right through you
Oh I can see right through
I can see right through you

I think I'm in residence
?? too it all
Oceans between the two of us
Every holiday
I know your face
Like the dark before the dream
I find myself in memory
Oh I can see right through
See right through you
Oh I can see right through it all
Oh I can see right through
See right through I see right through you
Oh I can see right through
I can see right through you.",See Right Through,2013
Tensnake,"Did you perfume in the dark?
Falling far from what you thought
When you’ll wonder if we had
All in all the reasons stop

Don’t wake me
I feel it
Our love sublime
Chemistry
Are you drawn to me?
Our love sublime

Keep your rhythm in the dark
Whispering words inside my head
Spoke that fire till it’s starts
Scheming thoughts of what you said

You’ll hear me say

Don’t wake me
I feel it
Our love sublime
Chemistry
Are you drawn to me?
Our love sublime

Don’t wake me
I feel it
Our love sublime
Chemistry
Are you drawn to me?
Our love sublime

Our love sublime
Our love sublime

Don’t wake me
I feel it
Our love sublime
Chemistry
Are you drawn to me?
Our love sublime

Our love sublime

Tensnake,"Sitting at work on a Monday morning
Spreadsheet files and coffee pouring
Office work can be so boring
But then there's the pressure, I'm under pressure

Hot as fire cold as snow
Deadlines come and deadlines go
But I wanna break free and lose control
But then there's the pressure, I'm under pressure

There's a revolution in my head
Give me a pallet, I'ma paint this town red
Oh baby baby, I'ma stand my ground
Demand will never ever get me down

Rain down with your optimism
Where I go is my decision
You and me, let's start collision
And release the pressure, I'm under pressure

Hot as fire cold as snow
Time has passed and I've lost my soul
This life can get so rock and roll, rock and roll
And it doesn't get better, it doesn't get better

There's a revolution in my head
Give me a pallet, I'ma paint this town red
Oh baby baby, I'ma stand my ground
Demand will never ever get me down

I'm under pressure, pressure
I'm under pressure
And it doesn't get better, get better
And it doesn't get better
And release, and release, and release the pressure",Pressure,2014
Tentasamba,"As malas arrumadas
Dei mais uma geral
Só pra ver se não
Esquecia nada
Ela se emocionou
Quando viu que a separação não era incenação
Ficou desesperada
Tentou convencer argumentar
Falar o que tinha pra falar jogou o telefone no chão
Oh não não
Falou que amar é perdoar mais só esqueceu
De se lembrar
O mau que fez pro coração
E eu desanimei
Eu fiz tudo o que podia fazer mais você não procurou entender
O nosso amor dançou
Eu desanimei
Joguei a toalha cansei
O que vai ser amanhã
Eu não sei
E eu desanimei",Joguei a Toalha,2004
Tenth Avenue North,"Love of my life
Deep in my eyes
There you will find what you need
Give me your life
Lust and the lies
The past you're afraid I might see
You've been running away from me

You're my beloved
Lover I'm yours
Death shall not part us
It's you I died for
For better or worse
Forever we'll be
My love it unites us
And it binds you to me
It's a mystery

Love of my life
Deep in my eyes
There you will find what you need
I'm the giver of life
I'll clothe you in white
My immaculate bride you will be
Oh come running home to me

You're my beloved
Lover I'm yours
Death shall not part us
It's you I died for
For better or worse
Forever we'll be
My love it unites us
It binds you to me

Now you've been a mistress, my wife
You're chasing lovers it won't satisfy
Won't you let me make you my bride
You will drink of my lips
And you'll taste new life

You're my beloved
Lover I'm yours
Death shall not part us
It's you I died for
For better or worse
Forever we'll be
Our love it unites us
And it binds you to me
It's a mystery",Beloved,2008
