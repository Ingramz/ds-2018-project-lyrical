Dré,"Deep in the steaming jungle
The eerie sound of the voodoo drums tell us that
This is the night

My confess
We sinners lord
Dez only 1

[Chorus]
Book you got cooked 
Book you got cooked 
Book you got cooked 
God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
Plus we tellers of the stories
Book you got cooked 
Book you got cooked 

Check it out, uh
If in this life 
I strive to please Him
In this day and night 
I'm not always right
Even when I'm wrong 
You should be afraid to anger Him
'Cause you could be gone
Him don't need us 
It's the other way round
Do you know what I'm talking about
When I say Him, clown?
You can't look at nobody 
And say that's Him
'Cause He's invisible 
Yet visible, this is critical 
Relying on our own abilities you lose
You need him 
To help make your bumpy ride a cruise
Ask Magic about him 
Or any strong believer
He's the quarterback 
We the receivers
Catching blessings 
Better than touchdowns
I seek him when 
Niggas want to buck me down
Him holds many holy titles
Him has many names 
Him has many bibles
The devil can't deal with Him, uh
He tempted me but you see 
I'm still with Him
Listen close
All brothers are men
Him is responsible for all colors and kin
I bust with Him
If only I can fully trust in Him
I'm glad to be stuck with Him
Rather have Him than money
I'm serious
He'll get you once you become curious
Lord, give me happy, long life
Real good sex with the wife
No traveling with bodyguards
It's just a real nigga godly entourage

[Chorus]

God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
Book you got cooked
Book you got cooked
Book you got cooked

See
My relationship with the God 
Is kind of odd
The nigga the B-I-G won't part
Feeling the presence up in my heart
But never no chicken to the nigga
In on that style like that
Talking about the way the Lord
Be lifting these burdens up off my back
Better that I bust raps
The way that I cut that
Ho you couldn't
You trying too hard, you better find Him
I'm hoping you understood it
Could it be (What?)
The niggas around the way
Don't really be thinking about the consequences
Under the circumstances 
Until you pinch them
Then a nigga be one to listen (Why?)
Cause you woke that ass up
Yoke that ass up
Proving the man in the sky
That holds that ass up
But it's over now
He cut off
Some niggas done broke you clean off
But got to get on your knees 
And praise the only
Now your soul lost

Now, OK, now
The sun shines 
The moon glows
The wind blows
The rain falls
But that ain't all
My heart thumps on a rhythm why'all
And birds call
And two can fall madly in love 
Oh, I think grow
They stop and stare in awe
Because we in his likeness
Hoping and praying that one-day
In the lab they might just
Stumble on some kind of way
To create human beings
So far
Human kind is the only thing I'm seeing

If a n**** disrespect me I'mma prove my s*** and dump
Blast ryhmes like I pump, turn your belly to jelly
Veteran MC, I don't think you rookies is ready

Three hundred and fifty pounds of pressure to deal wit
I run with Suave, always packin' something to kill with
Feel this b****, when I get rich I'mma still hustle
Go down in history, paper taller then Bill Russel

Kilo flows, I got 'em hid in the basement
Choppin boys up, on some puttin' it in they face s***
Eight Ball, F-a-t M-a-see-k, known for layin' it down
And doin' s*** the playa way

Callabo's of the dough ain't no secret
Space-age pimpin' means I don't do free s***
Time waits for no one, it ain't gon' wait for me
Yours truly, signed Eightball and MJG

[Chorus]
	All my hard core n****s, what you want to do?

I ain't new to this
Damn nice b**** that's true to this
Money ain't never been a thing to me
Always stack my dough, holla back (uh)

A** fat, thighs thick, titties perfect
Inhale the cheese from here to Tel Aviv
Y'all know it, s*** I don't bluff
And no dough? I don't f*** 'em

F*** I'mma fake for?
Make mine's, I'mma take yours
'Cause I'm no n**** like love be	'fore
Make b**** scream like, gimme some more

If a n**** broke, what'd you f*** him for?
Waste of time
It's like we playette minds
Don't stop, get it get it

B****es, take it from a real motherf***in' pro
Y'all get that dough, we don't trust these n****s
They gon' pimp if you let them
From NY to the dirty south

And them b****es' dime tight
I got my mind right
And my ice got the shine right
And if it don't blind b****es

You won't be sticking s***

[Chorus]

[MJG]
I'm the pimp motherf***er, baby
Ice cold, stories so high 
I pimp the whole village twice
So tight fold crease right on the president's nose

Pimp clothes, drinkin straight Henney'and Buckstrum
Touch toed, hoes take a centerfold pose
Break a treat, make 'em pay to enter those 
Pros, slam those

Game tied tight like bows, we never close
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four
Hand chose bithces a la mode, gettin' sold
Plus a load of killer, as Chronic gettin' blowed

Keep it froze, tucked up in a Tupperware bowl
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old
Forever flows, I take it down as deep as it can go
Burn rolls, braids tight, blazed afros 

We're pushin' hoes
Dicks get erect like poles, pay the toll 
MJG is in control

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
Peep dis', you and them boys need to slow down
Up in the morning in the court, it's 'bout to go down
There's no remorse now, better expose rounds
Them jackets be on the lose until the dope is found

Juvenile's my name, b****
I represent it to the end, the same s***
N*****s don't be wearin suits on theses blocks
All you see is your boys and reeboks

A thin hat to the back with a strap too
Willin' to bust a n**** a** if he had to
If you feel the same my n*****, you's a hot boy
Blocka, blocka, blocka

Better get up off the block, boy
Call for the cops, boy your mommy or pops, boy
Cash wasn't a million, never hit the spot boy
You want props ha, you sold to the cops ha
You in a cell block ha, 'cause you too hot ha

Where the real ones at? Be-atch...
Oh, you know how we feel

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I know at times you feel stressed out
But I'm tryin' to set you up so later I can buy you up this guest house
But for now I gotta hug the block
I know you sick of visits from undercover cops
Runnin' to the kitchen tryin to hide the box
Just give me a minute and I'm gonna flood you with rocks
I gotta wicked jump shot but let's be real
Ain't no scouts gonna give a sad nigga a deal
I gotta do what I gotta do that's what's up
What's with this new attitude you know bitch that is what's up
I'm a Bad Boy like 'Mike Lawry'
How you think you got that rainbow Louis
Not with a legal job's salary

Ma' we got you stuck off the realness
You know the infamous
You heard of us
It's your Bad Boy business men
Me and Joey Crack gettin' Benjamins
Sittin' in the Vanquish, the same color as cinnamon
Ma' I'm tryin' to be your knight and shinin'
To put you in the house on the Cayman Islands
Spend your whole life with stylin'
With that light that got me
Through it all you was right behind me
And ma' I know I gotta change
But right now a nigga is dealing with a lot of things
It's not the same
Girl with me you can achieve whatever
But I can't change, I'm a Bad Boy forever

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we livin' up in Jersey
In the t.v. in the car got the game on starrin' Marbury
And your ring gotta rock the size of strawberries
Everything that you want I got it don't worry
And I know it ain't about the chips
Just my way of sayin' thanks for the years you put up with my shit
I had to change like the chorus said
And I'm reminded why every time we do our thing in the waterbed
To me this is more than head
It's more than a crush
It's all about us
It's love and trust
Took the time out to make things right
It may seem nice
But I'm gonna be a Bad Boy for life

She want to take me home, lay me up inside her home
She want to turn me on, breakfast in the mornin'
She said ""daddy let me take ya home, papi let me take ya home""
And I said ""Mami you can take me home if you let the whole crew get on"" (bitch)

Verse 1:
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's whilin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin on Crential and cruisin for food when she pulled up beside me sat off in the lap
And I said ""damn girl you actin like you don't know, never seen me before,
never see the crins on MTV video? what you think TS stand for?""
She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no vitar
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX, now I'm rich got the world screamin Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go, every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin me....

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I was up in the club right as I'm Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin me....

[Chorus (phone call)]

[Verse 3: Armageddon]
Yous a big girl, eat it up, now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin up swervin the bumps
I'm trynna fuck but I ain't trynna fuck the 23's up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Trynna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just called the boat the front seat
And I think she's about to go down for a season
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
3 in the mornin and actin indecent
She so horny damn this shit seems like every other night I got a group of chicks beggin me....

[Chorus 2x]",Take Me Home,2004
Dré,"Yeah, look here, Trina
I mean, me and you, we been friends for a minute but
You know how we get down, you know late night
You know, we do what we do, we go our separate ways but

Shit, lately I been feelin' kinda different
Like, I been catchin' feelings for you and shit
You know when you call me Daddy and all that
Fuckin' with my head, for real

I never knew that I would fall so deep in love with her
Call me lover, friend, girl, we was just hushin' it up
You got me feenin' for more

When other niggaz used to call you after midnight
It never bothered me, girl, we was only friends, right?
So why does it hurt more and more?

Girl I get excited whenever you call my phone
I got a special ringer whenever you call me girl it goes
""I can't leave you alone"", remember that?

You got me feenin', yeah, feenin', shit, feenin'
So, baby, I'm pleading for you to bring your body home to me
And let me lay you down

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

I'm tired of the fightin', the fussin' and cussin'
Late night discussions of who you think I'm fuckin'
You puttin' me on guilt trips, like I can't see
You storin' his name for hers in your caller ID

Look I'm a Queen, the Don Diva
We should just flee in the lime green Seline two seater, you and me
My top down and yes, my hair is blowin'
Flashbacks of you and me, got me moanin' but

Who you lovin', who you wanna be huggin'
I seen her in your six hundred and you claim it's your cousin
Look, I know we agreed to, to see other people
But those feelings were shallow like my lingerie see through

We both played this game unfaithfully
See me with the next man and now you wanna play with me
Yo' I'm confused but I still wanna proceed
Without you I'm incomplete, you make me so weak
I love it when you say

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

I remember late nights, we would just kiss
I remember wearin' them girdles and takin' them trips
And I remember that we said, it would never come to this
Never let something come between our relationship

Now how can I leave you to be with someone else
Without finding out, how you truly felt
All the ridin' on horses and creepin' and abortions
Thoughts of marriage, all white playin' organs

It started from the rough sex on the deck of the yacht
Followed by Don Perion and the Canary watch
All the shoes from Italy, it was cool
Even a villa in Sicily but it wasn't me

But I should of made it crystal clear that I didn't really care
Whether you was dead broke or you was a millionaire
From our first date to our anniversary
My thoughts changed of leavin' when I heard you say to me

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

Bring your body home to daddy
Girl, I love it when you call me daddy
Baby, you're my sexy little mama
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

Put me in power when he threw me them thangs

Designer jeans, and a hand full of dough (Yeah)

[Rick Ross]
Way up in them Cali Hills, burnin' like the sun set
A nigga with a attitude, take it outta context
Riding with them big things, lookin' like a bomb threat
Bin Laden beard, afghan in a bomb vest
Ross, stranded on the death row
Makavali's on the Maybach, kicks retro
She wanna gaze at the stars
Through a panoramic view, pullin' haze out the jar
Rick Ross, I'm the best in the flesh
Getting blessed on the ?, it's a way to reflect
Hard work pays off, I'm a boss, you can tell
By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share
I'm in a realist state, and a realist state of mind
We came from trigger play, kill a nigga for a dime
I'm tryna chill today, I got a million on my mind
Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow your mind

[Rick Ross]
More trips, more whips, more money, I'm more rich
More haters, more clips, more jewels, more Chris
Half a hundred grand and some rubber bands
? off fast in my other hand
On the other hand, I'm still pitchin' underhand
All soft balls, all bases covered man
More trucks, more bucks, more freaks, more butts
I see the vision, from club vision to ?
I get brain, I bust nuts in each states
Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for
I sit up in that seat and cut em' off on them 24's, there it goes
Baby girl, come talk with the boss
I pop a Jose bottle, you can kick your shoes off

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Ever seen a fat boy in a big body
Know you wanna sit by me, all you do is think bout it
Lease apartments to get kicked out it
Next day, buy a condo to get a kick out it
We don't take you for the view, this is what I do
When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds are water blue (Ross)
Let's party like the pack jam, Pac Man
Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man
Get a lap dance (and if you get my dick hard)
This your last chance (to hop up in that big car)
With the Fat Man (certified Hood Star)
But he a millionaire (look bitch I'm going far)
This the movement, a few niggas you wanna move with
Gucci on my feet, see I'm only in that new shit
Ha, they say life's a bitch
But close your eyes for a minute, and just bite this dick, it's Ross

Scuff your shoes, wipe em down

Brand new tennis chain, fancy pockets on my jeans
Headed for the walk dude, fore' they win him on the stage

Stupid brain from a model

Hmm, Young Mullah, baby

She's askin' do you have the time
To listen to me whine
She's askin' who's on the other line?
You diss' me every time

I tell her, baby I'm a star
Shit, I'm above the stars
And now I done got so high
I did forgotten who you are

Uh huh, oh wow oh wow
Uh huh, oh wow oh wow
Uh huh, oh wow oh wow
Uh huh, oh wow oh wow

I tell her I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back
Up on the first flight
Right up out of town

Hop back in my spaceship
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off
'Cause I just come to take it
Then you know I gotta take off
But I'mma be here next week
So call your company and take off

And she say ""Wayne you ain't shit,
You got me all impatient""
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscience while I sail off

Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And Tunechi's gon' find someone to love
And you go by yourself, so all alone

One minute she love me,
The next minute she hate me
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted
She say she, pray she, have Weezy F's baby
And I be having seizures
But she say she can't shake me
And my homies say she's cuter than my other bitches
And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom-fitted
I swear I like her more than she think I do
Girl, when I think of you
My dick just start to jumpin' like a fucking kangaroo
I suck and fuck and finger you
But you want me to cling to you
And I ain't asking you to change
Cause I know I can't jingle you
I got my ways
And you have your days
And we gave it our best shot
But I just got grazed
I'm sorry

Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And Tunechi's gon' find someone to love
And you go by yourself, so all alone",Hot Revolver,2013

Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch

Fights break out when you wired and start joking

Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs

I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason

Trynna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend

See I went straight to the pros who done done it like me, 
Breakup the flow now they holla ""he a beast"", 
From the city where there's killers and dealas and street beef, 
And them crackers on the corner every avenue and place, 
And my homies servin' hard cause they livin by the day, 
See I do it for my family and hustled by the way, 
Now I'm back up on the block ya see I'm cooler than them others, 
Certified colored sneakers, keep a fitted for the club, 
When I step out on the scene all them hoes be showin' love, 
They know that I'm the dude that be ringin' through the block, 
Ace, ace, ace, ace, yeah fool heard it rite, 
I done been down to the bottom now I'm bound to see the top, my hood.

You gotta love ya hood, 
You need to love your projects, 
Hey get me, get me.

I got 'em, a couple triple beams, 
About an ounce of bakin soda, 
I got that revenue thats hittin' colda than Sammie Sosa, 
Ya see growin' up I seen a lot a things I weren't supposed, 
So growin' up I lost a lot a people that were closer, 
That's why I stay up on my grind and only roll with soldiers, 
I hit the block and serve em everything away from soda, 
Don't fuck with out the soda, 
Sellin' coke with out the cola, 
My clientele is strictly rock you can tell it by the odor, 
I keep that nino with the mac hid underneath the sofa, 
So if you ridin' slngin' tricks I suggest a coma, 
Them pussy niggas want me dead so I suggest and dopa.

Daddy on the porch with no remorse he sittin' still, 
This be the city that never pity they would rather kill, 
I wipe my eyes and check my clientele who by yourself, 
I grab the pots and bakin' soda yeah that odor smell, 
Dis be the hood I got connections like a phone cable, 
So watch where you work cause a mistake can be fatal, 
Cause crakers searchin' for that person tho I'm under table,

You can't look at nobody 
And say that's Him

Yet visible, this is critical

Better than touchdowns

Him is responsible for all colors and kin
I bust with Him
If only I can fully trust in Him
I'm glad to be stuck with Him
Rather have Him than money

Daily sounds banging loud, like a symphony
You fake niggaz trying to mack, it's just sense to me
I'ma keep it on the real, bout this Hogging life
Everyday we chasing scrill, trying to ball for life
Keep the money on my mind, number one all time
Other dummies gonna wine, when we come out shining
It's plain and simple, I'ma get this do'
Kick a nigga in his face, like I kick his do'
Spit a nigga in the face, like I spit this flow
Daily riding solo, known for spending his do'
I'ma hit this hoe, then change locations
Cause I'm hungry for the green, so I stay's impatient
Green light on the mic, I'ma change the nation
Sir Daily on the mic, so don't change the station

Now tell me, what are you gonna do
When we come at you

Killa nice with his hands, like Vince Dasene
Keep a semi with a light, that's named Prince Hakim
Get more respect than a king, and a prince you seen
I heard you nice with the mic, gotta convince my team
I wreck every beat I'm on, cause it's my duty mayn
Make a hit and don't say shit, like Putie Tang
I can hit a chick and don't pay shit, it's big pimping
Rock and handcuffing or saving a trick, you big sissy
So pay me what you owe me, on the block
I put this part up to your Cavaliers, I'm like Kobe with the glock
Or Obi-One-Kinobi, with the glock
Cause I put the beam to your head, and rob you niggaz blind
When you blink, and your bread in
Have you niggaz hollering, and scream
When you scared in, a hospital bed
And you dream that you dead, but you're not
Get you shot glock, shot when it's popped
Then it's cocked and unlocked, from the top

It's grind time, I'm feeling like this is my prime
I got a lot of shit on my mind, when I put it down
I'm trying to put seven circles, behind my dolla signs
And push a drop top, that's hand designed
With a be	 on the behind, floss like a boss
Valet park it, run up my penthouse
I'm hungry, tired of being Starving Marvin
Had to hit Interscope, and tell Jimmy let's bargain
The Dirty South Arching, belong to us
It's us Boyz-N-Blue, leaving boys in dust
In God we trust, cause he down with us
My whole team supreme, hot boys sped up
Slim Thugger, the Slim Thug that I am
So gangsta, cause that's how my brain was programmed
It's the Boss, niggaz best respect my fam
Or catch bullets in they flesh, till my Tech 9 jam

Dre Day,"Close your lips and open your ears, for a change
You just might, learn some thangs
I don't understand your plan, let me get this right
You broke, but you grinding all day and night

You on the block pushing caine, with Jordan's and a chain
I know, everybody want to have nice things
But man, you must think the dope game is a game
Fuck around and have yourself, catching a chain

Better stash you some cash, for a rainy day man
Cause only God knows, what tomorrow bring
Better listen, I'm trying to stop a lot of sorrow and pain
'Cause falling on your ass, is a horrible thing

You better listen, I talk too shit too raw explain
Better learn from the mistakes, of the Outlaw gang
I been there done that, fought that won that
Lost that and got it right back, you better listen

[Chorus: x2]
Quit being hard headed (yeah I hear you mayn)
Open your ears and just listen (yeah I hear you mayn)
Get off your ass and do something (yeah I hear you mayn)

It's more than one way out here, to get that do'
It don't take a rocket scientist, to get that bro
You can get that fast, get that slow
Hit licks with that grass, with that blow

Or with that pads, spit that flow
Or gamble with it, try to get back mo'
Uh-uh not me, I refuse to lose
You either got it or you don't, and I refuse to choose

And candy blue's I cruise, cause if I snooze I lose
And if I get out there bad, I just use my tools
My mind and muscle, that helps me grind and hustle
If it wasn't for this rap, I'd try to find a hustle

Why niggers sitting on they behind, steady trying to hustle
24/7-3/65, my time to hustle
I'd be a dealer out here, I got dimes and shuffles
Kyleon, is what really defines the hustle, just listen mayn

[Chorus: x2]

You need to quit talking so much, for a minute and hush
Stop trying to throw down boy, why you in such a rush
You play the game, as if you got a royal flush
But if you don't cool off, you just might get touched

I grind against the grain, and your brain like a crush
'Cause for me to get mine, is a plus and a must
But listen, hustling ain't for everybody
Especially if you ain't got the heart, and you's a scary body

Oh but I know, you don't hear me boy
It's goin' take something bad to happen, for you to feel me boy
But I'm so sick and tired, of teaching and preaching
You ain't even meet me half way, it's like I'm the only one that's reaching

While you keep leaching, you goin' find yourself smashed
Pumped up, wrecked and crashed
You must of forgot my nigger, your future's my past
You oughtta listen, 'fore you wind up on your ass

[Chorus: x2]

On how, I got this cash
I sold zones bled mics, moved rocks and hash
I click pro long, had to get on these blocks and mash
You want your do' long, try to hit these blocks and mash

Be careful though, you got niggers that watch your stash
And the second you slip get off his hip, goin' pop your ass
Get a connect cop a Tech, take your prize in the dash
We balling now, hit the lot put your ride on glass

You hard headed not heated, when you ride on glass
Left it at home, but you need it when you ride on glass
Knocked off your feet you looking weak, your boys slide on past
Had a high class bitch, now you collide with trash

Now you the hood rat plumber, pushing hood rat lil' mama
Laid up with the slut, and caught the high five from her
Now you lying like a plumber, sick broke and in drama
Should of listened",Listen,2004

{verse}
We can be just like a sandwich, like ham on rye
We eye to eye, we thigh to thigh, girl when I'm inside
I'm trying to work it and jerk it girl with all my might
And you know you're my favorite 'cause you keep it tight
Legs over my shoulder, hands in my hair
If you pull to tight 'cause Dre Dog don't care
Sweat from my neck is dripping on your cheast
And your sucking on my fingers as I try my best
To keep them lips up until they swell
As long as I be in you they should know me well
I'm about to get some honey so we can get sticky
Prince is in the tape deck the song is ""Darling Nicky""
I watch you as you moan and groan
Taking every inch of the new Jim Jones
Your eyes start to water, you bite your lips on your pretty face
You say ""Dre Dog Stop!"" but I don't stop the pace
I try to make it last, go ahead and grab my ass
You tell me dig deep, I try to do it fast
I'm trying to beat it up, baby in a good way
You're trying to keep up, you say you know Dre
Then she get on top and I grip you by the hips
And I can hear you say, ""I'm cumming"" these are your lips

Stone they all rejected
Still you did the unexpected
And stepped down from the throne
Oh Lord
Lower than the angels
No one else can save us
'Cause' you are God alone

I spend my days wondering where I belong
Any more these tears are memories
That are leaving me
I see a dim reflection in the mirror
And my lungs are filled with guilt
Effecting how I breathe
But time is diamonds
On the ring upon your finger
I've been married to this dream for so long
That I've forgotten what it means to remember
That I’m nothing on my own

Oh Lord

[Verse 2: Christon Gray]
I still don’t see the worth
That you see in me
But you would trade the world
Just to be with me
Now my hands are waiting
Just to touch your face
As the distance between us disappears
In the final hour I’m in search for the time
Just to capture this moment of forever
A thousand words later
The picture is worth so much more
And I know that I just can't explain myself

And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How ev'rything still turns to gold.

Dread Zeppelin,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

That makes me know there's a party somewhere

Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn

To my surprise, one hundred storeys high
People getting loose, y'all, they're getting down on the roof
Folks are screaming out of control, it was so entertaining
When that boogie-woogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

(Burn, baby, burn)
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down
(Burn, baby, burn)
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct

And burn, baby let the good times roll with me

On a cold and gray Chicago morn
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto
And if there's one thing that you don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto

People, don't you understand
That the child don't need a helping hand in the ghetto
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows in the ghetto

So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto
And then he buys a gun and he steals a car
And he drives away but he don't get far in the ghetto

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto
And his momma cries

Oh, baby, baby, burn that disco down
You're gonna burn, you're gonna burn
You're gonna burn, burn, burn burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Disco Inferno, burn that mother down
(Burn, baby, burn)
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down

(Burn baby burn)

Get us loose as a goose
Up above my head, I hear music in the air

Dread Zeppelin,"Spent my days with a woman unkind, Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king,
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.",Going to California,2000

It's down at the end of lonely street, that's Heartbreak

The bellboy's always crying, the ladies dressed in black
They been so long on lonely street
They'll never ever come back
I've been so lonely baby, I've been so lonely
I've been so lonely, baby, I could die

I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind, and it terrifies me too
The way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love to you

So if your baby leaves you, got a tale to tell

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...

When I was a very small boy,
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...

And it seems that the flames are laughing
Figures all around, they're reaching for me

'cause there is nothing I can do, nothing I could ever do

That I go when I dream
A place that nobody can see

I see someone who's waiting
Waiting for someone like me

Somewhere, someone for me

‘Till I'm not just dreaming
How long, ‘til somebody cares
How long, ‘til I meet an angel

When can I start
How long ‘till I fall in love

I sit every night
By my window just wishing
And searching for one perfect star
Can anyone hear me
Dunno if you're listening
Please send him right here
To my arms
He must be out there
Somewhere, waiting for me

Tell me just how long, will it be...

Tell me how long
‘Till I'm not just dreaming
How long, ‘til somebody cares
How long, ‘til I meet an angel
And give him my heart,
When can I start
How long ‘till I fall in love

That my dreams would come true
That one of these nights
He would appear
He'd be here in my arms
I see it all, so clearly
How it could be
I wish he was kissing me now...

この想いを抱きしめて
果てしなく続いてる
約束の場所へ行こう

いつも こんなものだと
自信が消えかけていた
君の弱い表情をはじめて見た
ビルの隙間に1人隠れて
いるんじゃなくて
少しづつ 夢へと走り出そう
離れているけど心はいつでもそばに
感じられる二人
涙と悲しみを強さにかえよう
どんな時でも 私らしく伝えたい
キミがいる それだけで
自然に笑っていられる
夢へと近づく時にきっと生まれ出す
守りたいモノひとつ
誰にもきっとあるから
君の涙の理由を聞くのが
怖かったけど
淋しそうに背中が震えていた
傷を負っても止まることなく
歩き出せたら
いつだって私はココにいるよ
どこかさめたような
気持ちで過ごしていたけど
君の一言が
心にやさしく温かく伝わる
どんな時でも
キミがキミでいられる様に
目を閉じて 祈ってる
夢のかけらを集めて
ときめくこの想い
風に乗せて伝えよう
ゆずれないモノひとつ
誰にもきっとあるから

離れているけど心はいつでもそばに
感じられる二人
涙と悲しみを強さにかえよう
どんな時でも 私らしく伝えたい
キミがいる それだけで
自然に笑っていられる

I'm here to hear my faith

I do not fear failure
Even when screamed in my face
So I'll adapt you to all my surroundings
And thank all who took my place

Will it be the same as it always was
Is it something that I always dreamt it could but never was
Too many things remain untold
Don't hide your tongues, don't hide at all

Could you see what's changed, it won't stay the same
And now you take away the things I always dreamt about
Too many things remain untold
Don't hide your tongues, don't hide at all

Take to the skies, with your brothers
Question everything, question everything
Sing to the lost, with each other
And you will love again, and you will love again",To the Lost,2011
Dream on Dreamer,"Did you ever feel that there's somebody else
Who controls our lives and guides our way?
Someone who would love a life of one or another
Perceiving smiles of faces with unfamiliar names
My blurred vision couldn't see what was right in front of me

What was right in front of me
Grey seemed matching to my frame of mind
Head full of clouds and angry eyes

We disregard the real heart
Choose elegance as a satisfaction
Where does it lead us? 
Tell me where it will lead us
Where do we go from here

Strangers come alive at night when colors try to hide
As long as we will fight for a new day, for a better day
Strangers come alive at night when colors try to hide
As long as we will fight for a new day, for a better day

Now the sky will lead the way
Even when you feel like running away
Or knowing that everything will be okay
To not follow what everyone says

I'll touch what you saw in color
But to me it's just a part of my path
And I'll make sure it's under cover
Cause you won't take this all in

I watched the blind see what other can't witness
Seen the eyes of thousands, broke and helpless
I heard the deaf listen to the change of tomorrow
What does it take to overcome the fear and sorrow?

Will we ever lighten up?
Will we ever comprehend our meaning in life?

Look a little spacey
Blowing kisses your way
Will you think I'm okay?

Set the sun on fire
Scream a little higher
Hold you in the moonlight

Yeah
Alright

I might not be special
Not like your superman
But living and loving
Well, that I super-can

It's not so complicated
Not reinvent the wheel
Just let me know how you feel

So if I get a little crazy
Look a little spacey
Blowing kisses your way
Will you think I'm okay?

Set the sun on fire
Scream a little higher
Hold you in the moonlight
I say yeah, if you say alright

Aha, yeah

If you say alright
Then I will say okay
I will take your hand
And we can fly away

No matter where we go
You will always hear me say
Yeah

I say yeah

This is going""

Feeling the ceiling and walls closing
In on

The guilt, your affliction
From preying on praise as you fed

I wondered what had really
Happened
Had I run out of time
Did I push myself too far

Him to fight

You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles

Was such an untimely religion
Maybe your life can explain
The reason for my indecision
Here is a poor man
The heart of this monster creation

Dream Theater,"The smile of dawn arrived early May
She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain
She'll never outgrow
Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be
Confined to this mind
I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love
That's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to
Call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

As a child, I thought I could
Live without pain without sorrow
As a man I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares from faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again
Deceit is the second without end

The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
Just keep your heart in my eyes and we'll stay alive
The third arrives

Before the leaves have fallen
Before we lock the doors
There must be the third and last dance
This one will last forever
Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taken you to your home

It can only take a place
When the struggle between
Our children has ended
Now the miracle and the
Sleeper know that the third is love
Love is the dance of Eternity",Metropolis,1993
Dream Theater,"Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase and then fall again

This world is spinning around me
This world is spinning without me and
Every day sends future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last

Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow then some other day

I'll take seven lives for one
And then my only father's son
As sure as I did ever love him I am not afraid

This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps spinning around me and
All life is future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last

Pull me under
Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is to set it right

Dust fills my eyes
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Centuries cry
Orders fly and I fall again

This world is spinning inside me
The whole world is spinning inside me
Every day sends future to past
Every step brings me closer to my last

Pull me under
Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in the sun
Only until your will is done

When angels waken with a kiss

But mine will never be the same

His shadow slowly fading from the wall 
And from an ivory tower he hears her call

When I heard the stained glass
Shatter all around me.
She whispers words to clear my mind.
I once could see but now at last,
I'm blind.

So many ways to drag him down
Some are fast and some take years and years

Breathes a cloudless mind
Fascination
Leaves the doubting blind
Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead
The faithful live Awake
The rest remain misled

Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears

Innocence faded

Fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain

Distant like brothers
Wearing apathetic displays
Sharing flesh like envy in cages
Condescending
Not intending to end

Sacrificed without a fight

And I've exposed this tragedy

By looking through her eyes

Just beyond the churchyard gates
Where the grass is overgrown
I saw the writing on her stone
I felt like I would suffocate

In loving memory of our child
So innocent, eyes open wide
I felt so empty as I cried
Like part of me had died

I'm learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes

And as her image
Wandered through my head
I wept just like a baby
As I lay awake in bed

And I know what it's like
To lose someone you love
And this felt just the same

She wasn't given any choice
Desperation stole her voice
I've been given so much more in life
I've got a son, I've got a wife

To grieve for her and say goodbye

To find out who I was at last

The blood still on my hands
To think that she would leave me now

He needs to know
I'll break free of the Miracle

Finally found my love, I've finally broke free
No longer torn in two

Their love renewed
They'd rendezvous
In a pathway out of view
They thought no one knew

One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away
One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
We fade away

As their bodies lie still
And the ending draws near
Spirits rise through the air
All their fears disappear, it all becomes clear
A blinding light comes into view
An old soul exchanged for a new
A familiar voice comes shining through

Dream Theater,"A single star behind me 
A red sky burns ahead 
A lonely light below me
Awake among the dead 
I can't hold on any longer
These feelings keep growing stronger
Echoes that deafen the mind
Will bury my voice in their wake
Caught in a Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning the lies devised in my head
Living out a constant deja-vu 
Keep your head up please be patient we will get to you 
Keep your head up just have some faith and you can see it through 
Keep your head up what they want from me ain't gotta clue 
Keep your head up swallow pride before it swallows you 
Keep your head up don't dare bite the hand that's starving you 
Keep your head up  
How can you keep your head and no got insane 
When the only light at the end of the tunnel is another train
Caught in a Web refused by the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning a cage denied and misread
I've got this feeling the tide is turning now baby 
Funny feeling everything's gonna be alright now.",Caught in a New Millennium,2001
Dream Theater,"I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow
Innocence caressing me

I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more
But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever

Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might
In my den of inequity

Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the sane
Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near

'Carpe diem, seize the day'
I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall
The sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall ticking away
'Seize the Day'
I heard him say
Life will not always be this way
Look around
Hear the sounds

Cherish your life while you're still around
""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,        
Old Time is still a-flying;              
And this same flower that smiles today, 
Tomorrow will be dying.""                
We can learn from the past
But those days are gone
We can hope for the future
But there might not be one
The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned

Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, 'I Love You...Good-bye'

""It's the most awful thing you'll ever hear.""                           
""If you're lying to me""
""Oh, you dearly love her.""               
""just have to leave, all our lives.""
""Seize the day!""
""Something happened.""
""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.""
""She was killed.""

So far or so it seems
All is lost with nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the T.V. screen
Another world where nothing's true
Tripping through the life fantastic
Lose a step and never get up
Left alone with a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up
I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky

A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why
Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see
I'm sick of all you hypocrites
Holding me at bay

And I don't need your sympathy
To get me through the day
Seasons change and so can I
Hold on Boy, No time to cry
Untie these strings, I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away
Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Now it's time for them to deal with me

I'm much wiser now
A lifetime of memories
Run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse, alive or dead
I realize there's no turning back
Life goes on the offbeaten track
I sit down with my son

Set to see the Crimson Sunset
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life, but now must move on
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
He's my only one

Now that my time has come
Now that my life is done
We look into the sun

Now it's time to say good-bye
Even though I'll be gone,
I will live on, live on.'",A Change of Seasons,2001

Invisible blood line that only you could see.

For all that you've done wrong.

And have the balls to blame this mess on me?

Oblivious to the damage he has done,
You're the rotted root in the family tree.

Don't you dare cross the crooked step.
Watch the way you talk,

Don't cross the crooked step.

Searching, fearless,where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial

Face yourself man!
Brace yourself and trace your hell back

You've been blinded, living lie a one way cold existence all the while
Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes you long lost child

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking and shaking and left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making a change to fix this dying soul

Born into this world a broken home
Surrounded by love yet all alone
Forced into a life that's split in two
A mother and a father both pulling you

Then you had to deal with loss and death
Everybody thinking they know best
Coping with this shit at such an age
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage

Family disease pumped through your blood
Never had the chance you thought you could
Running all the while with no escape
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate

Living on your own by twenty one
Not a single care and having fun
Consuming all the life in front of you
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue

Possessive obsessions selfish childish games
Vengeful resentments
Passing all the blame
Living out a life of decadence
Acing without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most

Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do
Ruling other's lives while the can't stand the thought of you

A living reflection seen from miles away
A hopeless affliction having run astray

I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking and shaking and left in the cold

It's time to take that step into the kingdom
All your sins will only make you strong
And help you break right through the prison wall

I'll help this torture end (Help to set me free)
Let your ego go (I can't carry this load)
You can't go through this alone (I feel so hopeless and exposed)
You'll find your peace of mind (Give me some direction)
You can no longer hide (Break out of this isolation)
Let humility (Openness, honesty)
And become what you can be (A healing tranquility)

Save me
Heal me
I can't break out of this prison all alone

Will vanish when exposed

Your fearless admissions
Will help expel your destructive obsessions

By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her
And she tried everyday
With endless drive
To make the grade

She woke up to find
The perfect girl
Had lost her mind

Once barely taking a break
Now she sleeps the days away

And thinks that she can fly
She will fall out of the sky

Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell
Hearing voices from miles away

Feeling strangers staring my way
Reading minds never read
Tasting danger with each word I say

Waiting for the light
The smell of pure adrenaline
Burning in the night
Random blinding flashes
Aiming at the stage
Intro tape begins to roll
Igniting sonic rage
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all

He seemed no different from the rest
Just a healthy normal boy
His mama always did her best
And he was daddy's pride and joy
He learned to walk and talk on time
But never cared much to be held
and steadily he would decline
Into his solitary shell
As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
Kept to himself most of the time
He would daydream in and out of his own world
but in every other way he was fine
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell
A temporary catatonic
Madman on occasion

When will he break out
Of his solitary shell
He struggled to get through his day
He was helplessly behind
He poured himself onto the page
Writing for hours at a time
As a man he was a danger to himself
Fearful and sad most of the time
He was drifting in and out of sanity
But in every other way he was fine
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell
A momentary maniac
With casual delusions
When will he be let out
Of his solitary shell

I'm invincible
Despair will never find me

I've got a new sense of elation
Boundless energy

Still it's hard to just get by
It seems so meaningless to try
When all I want to do is cry

Even though I get so high
I know that I will never fly
And when I fall out of the sky

She never wears makeup

Climbing endless stairs, leading to the choking room

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

Dream Theater,"Several years ago
In a foreign town
Far away from home
I met the Count of Tuscany

A young eccentric man
Bred from royal blood
Took me for a ride
Across the open countryside

Get into my car
Let's go for drive
I love the way I feel uptight
Just step inside

Maybe you'll recall
I kind of felt curious
A character inspired by my brother's life

Winding through the hills
Seeing far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads

And last we came upon
A picturesque estate
On sprawling emerald hills
An ancient world of times gone by

Now let me introduce
My brother
A bitter gentleman - historian
Sucking on his pipe
Distinguished accent
Making me uptight - no accident

I
Want to stay alive
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right

I
I don't wanna die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I
Want to say goodbye
This could be the last time you see me alive

I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candle light

Then viewing through the past
I saw which is believed
Still dressed in royal clothes
A saint behind the altar

History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Stuck inside these castle walls

Soldiers came to hide
With barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of old that's where they died

Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the angel's share
The end is near

Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines
Improve with age

I
Want to stay alive
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right

I
I don't wanna die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I
Want to say goodbye
This could be the last time you see me alive

I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone
No one by my side

I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand

Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again

It took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life

Now wait a minute then
That's not how it is
You must be confused
That isn't who I am

Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems
Please try to forgive

The chapel and the Sade
The soldiers in the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time

Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother
Tell them about me

Faithful ascent, through darkest fires

That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness;
That where there is discord, I may bring harmony;
That where there is error, I may bring truth;
That where there is doubt, I may bring faith)

Now that you can see all you have done
(That where there is despair, I may bring hope;
That where there are shadows, I may bring light)

It's time to take that step into the kingdom
(That where there is sadness, I may bring joy)

All your sins will help to make you strong
(That I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted.
That I may seek to understand than to be understood)

And help you break right through the prison wall
(That I may seek to love, rather than to be loved,
For it is by self-forgetting that one finds,
It is by forgiving that one is forgiven)

Keep all of me,
The desires that once burned me deep inside

And help to give me grace
To carry out your way

if you're not a friend of me I grow you like cannibus
make you give me a hand you can't handle this
crazy rampagous makin' team ages
walk through the getto with getto blasters playin' us
general entrance be part of the solution
you take it to your brain but your brain is confused
and confusion is the style that I send
don't think it makes your mind bend
just journey on


Chorus:

draw your mics men
and wipe the sweat from your dome
as we enter this battle with a fearsome rage
universal peace must be this outcome
dust and strife stricken
we have moral to the full
board your steeds my minions as we path on
tray me I slay the no mutiny


Verse 2:

take a picture of this 
you trying to dis
so much smoke you get choked from the microphone mist
aw shucks you're outta lucks
yo try to tax but get waxed
the song strong enough to carry you
and my rhymes strong enough to bury you
but I don't I make you jam until the jam is done
until the cash is cahsed unto me the nickelodeon
like that snap ??? back the style has hung you
buy a noose produce who
now this is the part 
mystics prevail
the critics wrong song goes up in a sail
the legacy begins check the store
you want more then tie up your boots and just journey on
pankgooes and scallowags vanish
MCs who talk about me vanish
when I'm on stage I'm kicking harder than a tidal wave
I'm making bootys like you memory save
cause when I entre pronto en delay
I hear on the dispatch
(mayday mayday)
an S.O.S. for a new bag of sess
and kick and shook you into nothing less
proceed on


Verse 3:

on your 12th daydream you try your best to control it
but the magic avoids you the stage is a street
and the wink of an eye you could fry in agony of defeat
now toothles ruthless and raw
looking for a way to get even but you withdraw
cause with no label you're disabled and handicapped
but you pledge allegiance to the life of battle rap
no choice now you must face your own fate
no straight path so is life nothing is straight
maybe one day you'll wake up and realize
you the live by the sword you die by the sword
surprise Dream Warrirors possesses intelligance
but you cry wolf but that's irrelivant
no what you must be now is simply
sit back and rock in your own inequity
city's the limit from when you finish your song
now you journey too but what you really must do is journey on

Outro:

Dream Warriors' noise is new discover-al
once again with a new blend so telephone a friend
(yo dude I just got this new song It's dope man)
compact disc to the prime is optimist
fans and friends I'm universally cosmic
concrete jungles abound
you stand by the speakers 
you're smothered and covered up in the sound
you stand strong as you pump your fist
I'm talkin' all that jazz
now what's my definition

Chorus:
my definition
my definition
my definition is this
my definition
my definition
my definition is this
my definition 
my definition is this
my definition

when I kick rhymes there's something said to do damage
hits so strong even superman needs a hand
so bob your head dread as I kick the funk flow
this rhyme is subliminal yet you don't think so
I walk with a gold cane a gold brain and no gold chain
behind the truth lies there lies a parafix
in the mix is where Dream Warriors go
define if you will but I know so
there is no definition

Chorus

rhyme thou I know it to flow it just like a poet
your definition of me is definitely wrong
why must I try to lie and build an alibi
when all you ask is just for me to be me
replace a replacable replacement with this
relax relax relaxtion boombastic
my name is King Lu
(mine is Capital Q)
bags of mostly water search to find my definition

Chorus

I sought beauty through the dust of strife
I sought meaning to my music addicition
arise awaken we have need to reverse
a plauge has befallen us no time to reherse
this rhyme speaks it speak and has spoken
this rhyme will not change things
it needs to be changed in a hurse
you find caskets in my rhyme baskets of rhyme
your definition can define
so what's my definition

In my sink
You wash your face in my sink
In my sink (sink)
You wash your face in my sink
In my sink (sink)
You wash your face in my sink

Simplicity with synchronicity make a mind meld
Revealed if possible like a walk in a mind field
Sadly, you get up to bat and take a swing thing
Should I
Shouldn't I try?
Too late
You sunk into the sink that I wash my face

You wash your face in my sink
In my sink

Tougher
That's what I'm getting
I'm getting rougher
And you beat me?
Suffer
The attempt of an attempt well tried
Well your side tried
But my side will never be denied
'Cause I'm swinging it stinging neglection
With an injection of truth
I've come to untwist the twisted youth
How does it feel now that I've got you all to think?
Yeah, and wash your face in my sink

You wash your face in my sink

Here I go I here I go I here I go again
I have a little place to send a little false friend
Who tried to mess me up with little negative thoughts
A little negative taught
Me to never ever leave my fame into the hands of incompetence
That makes sense
So now I change the tune for the tune allows changes
For you to take a breath while your brain rearranges
What I just spoke into a language called speech
You try to catch it but you just can't reach
For you leave a ring around the basin
When you wash your face in
In my sink

You wash your face in my sink

Now the basin is clean to the gleam of the eye
You constantly lie ""when dove's cry""
Out that you are not about what you say
The image of the field you reveal and portray
For never ever will I fall fall to the effects of bandwagonism
So please listen
Up not down
For down is the devil
So roll like a boulder and not like a pebble
You roll like a rock, you roll like a rebel
For this is pure pain
Pick ax and a shovel
Hear no command
Hear just warning
If you wake up in the morning
And wash your face in my sink

You wash your face in my sink

Swing on the grounds of the play ground
The wire to the amp to improve the sound
I mean give me an M-I-see that is clean
And witness the warriors of the dream
For the bigger the orange
Is the bigger the peel
Thieves who steal
Get a wheel for real
A spin to infin or until I give a pardon
Me, I never promised you a rose garden
Or nourishment just punishment for a fink
Who thinks he can wash his face in our sink

You wash your face in my sink

Open up the door
Step across the wet floor
You can make it
You can tape it
This rhyme forevermore
Peer into the drain as the water goes down
Why do you frown is the end of the sound

But bring back the rhyme
For the rhyme is evaporated
And all of the sucker MCs
To the Jones is saying
They would
They could
They think
But never ever never dare try
To wash their face in my sink",Wash Your Face in My Sink,1991
Dream Warriors,"[Chorus:]
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
But eventually everything becomes a dirt pit

In a showroom frame I attract another hit
If you run to the sun, call Lu, then you trip
I think it's time for you to retire, you skipped
That's what you get when you suck too much less
You get penis end, like the girl in the tight dress
A mess hall, we all in your balling
There's no where to run when the roll is calling
May it be me, cause I flow from within girls
Tell me I'm a hoe, drop the stereo and we can flow
Loop like cause this might be magic
Watch it might engulf you and catch your snatch
There it is, what it is
A house is in the middle of the street
To swallow my gift is a feat
But I hate to see without eyes
When people try to sabotage
But I'm quite successful at espionage
Try harder man, come on harder
Cause if you don't, then come on, why bother
You're in my air evaporate at a rate greater than wait
I'm changing fate
Hey, look
I made ya look
Who's in the kitchen cookin' chicken, mama
Excuse me baby I don't mean to interrupt
But my mind's corrupt now that you got my interest up
You're best I edit the wish bones before I credit
Cause I must show my versatility facility
Peep me like tom
Must you, I bust you
I smash you into dirt and leave your crew laughin' at ya
I'm coolin' like Laverte
You're hurt if I'm leavin' you

[Chorus]

Plot thickens
When reflects is flex like the sex faces
Into private places
It's me baby
(Is it you Lu?  Really really you?)
Touch me and tell me if it's true
Did ya miss?
(Yeah, I miss.  Did you?)
Yeah I miss
Then commence to kiss kiss give me sugar
Cause you be the bona fide baby booger
You know, we go together like a gun and a trigger
(Yeah right, then who's this?  I can't believe this.  
I thought I was the world to you.  Shit, what is this?)
Come on baby, you're trippin' to illusion conclusions
You think I would want that old broken down car
Now who picks me up when I'm down
Come on, who puts a smile on my frown
Come on who makes mmmm
(You crazy)
So then let's blow this joint with God speed
Cause you know, I've got the remedy for what you need
Twelve inches of steel, spinning wheel
Cause you can't fight the feel when I'm in
Better turn the volume up to ten, and dim the lights
Cause tonight, you're takin' flight

Ah, but the next day somethin' went wrong
Huh, she slipped
Found a note, must've fell from her coat
Said I'll meet you at the Eaton Centre at a quarter to eight
And don't be late
Okay, so I thought about the shit that my mind was going through
Took two pills and then called the crew
My crew said ""Chill King, we'll fix it, don't sweat it.""
""Bother you? Don't let it.""
I got it

[Chorus]

But that's what you get
Like a need a mostly dream
Like a dream, you sit inside a pit and you fiend
Now pain, pick ax and shovel, I digged and
I gotta get out, I gotta get out, gotta get out
Of this pit, I'm bigger than her
But my chest is crushed turned to mush
For real
If I ever shot myself it was just to get the feel
So suicide was out of the question
Did I mention
I didn't get a tricycle, thanks to Mr. Trojan
I'd be walking around like these other brothers, trippin'
Aimlessly, like a record skippin'
But once bitten twice shy (dry your eye)
Once bitten twice shy (dry your eye)
Once bitten twice shy and I won't lie
MC's that think I didn't evolve got something comin'
I sleep with words and verbs is my pussy
Fattened like a cat, got your tongue you dirty rat
There's some wisdom in retreat, think of that
Your impact is hollow and you follow and submerge
Now people pull your card, you're livin' on the verge

the life you is walking through 

such a bitch 

day in to day out the same old thing kid 

[Verse 1   Spek] 

bring me to the end and I'll be me 

open up your eyes wide so you can see 

it's thick to be me 

how I kick my rhymes down pat 

within the circle how we do 

when we kick that fact 

but where's the meaning? 

I take it one night by one night 

but where's the meaning? 

I take it one day by every day 

I pick a rhyme I chose and put it number one inside my placement 

so look to find the signs inside my basement 

no tears 

sell us full of samples with ample time to loop 

it's just the beats from the dead from my head with my troop 

and it be cool if all the time was like studio time

in the middle of my nights I check my late night flicks 

I'm up at night trying to write and late night I get my kicks 

that is I'm out to get my main feature 

the low budget picture in my room and in between I write scriptures 

picture this the day's just a claender's notch 

and every kid becomes the one who want to ride it on the crotches 

and when I'm finished when my flick is almost done 

when my rhyme is half done 

when I check a late re-run 

I lose to the groove soul sounds soothe me well 

sometimes my mind wonders sometimes heaven could be hell 

I pass the fools who has never known my name 

when I think about the deal sometimes I need someone to blame 

I add members to the show who knows a fan 

for the ones that want to capture the essence of level 

to the hip-hop their directions they groke 

who's representing us? the critics holy smoke

documents displayed as homemade

but can't plan it like my screens appearance is translusive

control key available to only keyboards you can't afford

so I search (search) furiously 

I've lost my ignroance and don't know where to find it 

yet I search (search) furiously

getto is the grip so the beat won't slip 

or slide or do a dive into an ocean of lyrical audio 

and here's a plate of video 

I search and disperse so verse rehearsal is universal 

like nova is nobel when I am flowing over ruffell and boulder 

I admit my style and wit is a homicidal tool 

I'm seeking knowledge like a student in school

we don't know 

we don't

I venture through darkness with power eclipse 

soul for my guidance my conscence equipped 

opens my thought my neighborhood compels me 

the contract swells the head 

I feed on my own so here we go into a cool down 

the fool found a sound but there's not enough to go around 

so we searchers and searchers we searches in ignorance 

the outcome of distortion is the evidence 

pre-dominant pre-dominance is how I stand 

phenomenon one phenomenon two (come come) 

I seek and I prosper my journey is endless 

keen is my eye sight analyze 

reality fantasy fantasize

But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match 
To win a brown eyed handsome man 
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

He hit a high fly into the stand 
Rounding third he was headed for home 
It was a brown eyed handsome man 
That won the game, it was a brown eyed handsome man",Brown Eyed Handsome Man,2011

When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty

So go downtown; things'll be great when you're
Downtown; no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown - waiting for you tonight
Downtown - you're gonna be all right now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

On a mountain in Switzerland,
Yo lo lo lo,
There lived a fair young maiden,
Lovely but lonely,
Oh oh oh oh.

Day after day,
She'd pine her heart away,
Yo lo lo lady ya,
But no love came her way.

Some day papa said,
Some day we'll go,
Down to the village in the valley,
Then you'll meet a nice young man,
Ask for your hand,
Then you'll be happy

Every day she grew unhappier,
On a mountain in Switzerland,
Yo lo lo lo,
Every day a little bit lonelier,
Which way to turn and which way to go

Day after day,
She'd pine her heart away,
Yo lo lo lady ya,
But no love came her way.

Some say the maidens dream,
Never came true,
She never got to go to the valley,
If she did or not,
I really don't know, Oh oh oh oh.
Did she die unhappy?

I'd rather think she found her love,
Wouldn't she be better if she did find love?
Somewhere, 
Some way.

Could be the rain in the Gulf of Mexico

I'm still an angel when I get back to home

Pass away like sand through and hourglass

Into sea they descent

[Music: KerÙ?nen]

Beautiful bride
And undaunted knight
Are lying in bed, holding hands
Side by side

They started their life
As husband and wife
And now it's time to show

How much they care for each other,
How far they're willing to go?

He moved on real nice
And made her come twice
But then he wanted
To put on some spice

Please hear me prey
I want you to stay
As still as you can be

[Chorus:]
I gave you a taste and you want for more
Let me come to your garden through your back door
Is there anything sweeter in whole wide world
Than ride with this magical wild horse

Oh, I'll taste you in my mouth
My hunger for you makes me howl like a hound
Shout, shout, shout, shout for more
I insist for another round

Back in the days (3X)
Back in the days (2X)

Back in the days of eighty-three
Breakdancin at the crib with my man Dupri
When the Saturday nights was LIVE in the West
When honies were fly, the flavor was good but
on the burnt side, was where it took place
On the cheap sound system without no bass
Coolin with my man DayDay, the DJ Machete
I want a record deal, but I knew I wasn't ready
But back then I still had more fun
I even rode around my guy the rookie named Michael Jordan
Long before Tag Team and 95 South
Real Planet Rock shit used to funk the house
But the schoolyard Crips and PPD's were too rowdy
Some of them started rollin to the ?dotua? parties
My dance group called the Frat Boys was winnin
The parties was live cause General Lee was spinnin
When the summer came I was off to the Ridge
With my pen and my pad, I met new kids
Marty Mar, a.k.a. the Big Mo
Big Ben, Af Rock, yo we stole the show
Makin tapes all the time, it's like I couldn't quit
But when I listen to em now I'll admit
That it wasn't alla that in fact we was wack
But every now and then, huh, I want to go back

Back in the days
I want to go back in the days (4X)
I want to go back (2X)

Spring eighty-seven, down with the four man crew
cool Kat, Disco, and my man Steve Blue
No record deal, but I was still rhymin
Big Mo hooked me with a kid named Diamond D
Not the one from the East he went to school in Arizona
said he liked the way I rocked the microphone-a
We knew our, producer, but he was a flake
That lived in the projects, said we had to wait
Sittin in the car for hours at a time, buckin bullets down
But that's how bad I wanted to rhyme
Back when the hip-hop shit always had the airplay
The best station in nation which was KDAY
I got serious about my flow
Hooked up with a brother that they call Domino
And Diamond quit and left the twelve, over at my crib
I hooked it up to my cassette player, tell you what I did
I would pause mix breaks, whatever it would take
I only had three records couldn't dig in any crates
And there was times when I wanted to stop flowin but my
best friend and lover Ajay, yo, she said to keep goin
When all we had to eat was cup of noodles in the six pack
Cause I went and spent all my ducats on the six track
On the real, no food in the fridge
But when I won the rap contest at Northridge
Everybody flipped, yo we didn't know how to act
Daaam, I want to go back

I want to go back
I want to go back in the days (6X)

Bill Duke, a well known deep brother
Hooked me with the soundtrack on Deep Cover
That's how I met Belial, from the Bronx
He had more beats that house niggaz got conks
Showed me all kind of beat makin tricks
Just like Machete showed me how to pause mix
and I was married to the shit like a husband to a wife
But when I tried to rhyme up at the Good Life
Yo I got dissed I couldn't buy no respect
But in two years I came back to catch wreck
On the set and jet, cause that's how it had to be
And my man Tragedy became amazed at me
So he put me inside, the Cadillac
The chaffeur drove off, and now I can't go back
Hahaha, back in the days

I want to go back in the days (6X)
I want to go back (4X)",Back in the Day,1994

Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving mc's is waitin for the editin
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smokin exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessin
Give crazy shouts son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in bed-stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thievin mc's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushin fast
Like runnin rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

Duel of the iron mic, it's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
When the gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causin the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stingin somethin while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombin your barracks, with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damagin lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testin the murderous master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seekin for a serum, to cure em

Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, dependin if you're passin the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's livin heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, findin it confusin

Chaos outside of Sparks Steak House
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga missed a wedding, late a fucking half hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contracting bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, bitches raise a grand to a finger
In the garment district, got it sewn like Singers
Cause all that talk blasphemy this kid after me
For the heist, in a Burlington coat factory
Fuck it, he turned state's on my nigga Castro this co-pilot
Who used to drop like stacks of blow
On this remote area we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles South from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got luxurious custom made yachts
Burial plots, for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man Muhammad from Afghanistan, grew up in Iran
The nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern, bomb specialist
Initiated, at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork, niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker, tried to smuggle a half a key
In his left leg, even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the feds rushed him, coming through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singing, a well known soprano
A smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand
Half time at the game blasting niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent
Photographs of they wives taking baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether
Two hundred pounds of reefer and fifty immigrants with fake Visas

Throw em on a auction block, CEOs bidding
Highest price paid, for them wack rhymes made
It's over rated, cut off, never reinstated
I be fruitful, and multiply with marvelous tales
Feed the hungry MCs and be starving as hell
I laid the first verse and quenched a dry ass niggaz thirst
Who drank my wisdom up like water, till his stomach burst
Full tank, with the premium quallity raps
Mickey mouse niggaz get caught on the trap
Ya cottonelle kids from scottsdale cleanex
Looking like rockwell wearing Vnecks
Ya learn from this earn from this
Niggaz getting tossed and turned for this, burned for this
Extort from a thousands degrees of live MCs
I melt ya niggaz down to the size of fleas

Dredg,"Here we go down that same old road again
Sympathy unfolds the shell that holds all the beauty within
Here we go down that same old road again

All you need is a modest house in a modest neighborhood
In a modest town where honest people dwell
Making the cleanest energy for the greenest plants to grow
Richest soil that is drenched with the freshest rain
Then you should sit in your backyard
Watch clouds peak over the tallest mountain tops
Cause they unveil honest opinions about the stars

Dredg,"I can't even concentrate on this,
It's over thought, anticipated,
The pen ink is running dry,
It's been thrown to paper and wasted,

Creativity has been blocked and over tasted,
Maybe in time, I'll appreciate it

Hold on, hold on, we'll be with you soon

These papers are stuck in this book,
'till they're torn out and pasted,
To inside of my memory, 
Where I can later look and see them in a new gallery, 
Where they can later be 
Viewed and appreciated.

Hold on, hold on, we'll be with you soon,
We'll be with you soon

Longing for what has been lost,
And longing for what hasn't been obtained,
It's a small cost, forgot the past, lost the future,

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly

Questioning and saying
Our opinions, they're failing
They're constantly changing
Our ignorance, remaining

We're hoping and waiting
We're living, but dying

My meaning isn't planned out

Come to the conclusion
Might as well be an illusion
We're trying to find out
I did nothing, but shut out

Not the death of the song but the D-E-P-T-H of the song

Look my word is bond as fuck
My life is hard enough
They not rewarding us
They disregarding us
And if I go to D.C, I'm tryna spar with Trump
I'm not a politician, just can't ignore the stuff

This really just a free verse, I put my life in reverse
I dug up out my old pain and put it on a t-shirt
So many sides to this shit, not here for the popular shit
Your own people will laugh when you on positive shit
Before I die, I'ma teach, I light a blunt and I preach
Ain't no facade you can see, that I can only be me
I got a daughter to raise, one day she gon' be a queen
I'm tryna get shit together, so she can have anything

Might do the race 'fore a nigga catch me
Damn if it be another R.I.P
It's a black/white world but I only see green
Killers gettin' off innocent, when the clip showin' that he did the shit
Try to talk and they ain't listenin' but they'll point it out when you get ignorant
Fuck with you if you a benefit
That's why I pay 'em cash at the dealership
And I got money stashed for the bail and shit
But I'ma write it off, good penmanship
Can't say we representing when half the office White Supremacist
This can't be, ""Land of the free""
If kneeling might cost your position
I'm supposed to respect the system
They call our brothers, ""Sons of bitches""
And when my Unc' came home from prison
For the same shit y'all tried to turn into a business
Take our culture, our blueprint
Pay the knockoff to come model us
Hurricanes come and swallow us
Opp niggas tryna put the dot on us
We pourin' Henny, cause we all bottled up
Granny said, ""Scratch ya lottos up""
But the bible says it goes full circle
I'ma tryna find me a good purpose

I'm not a politician, you can't ignore the stuff

Ain't old enough to hit the club to fill my cup with rum
But I can go die in the army or go to war for them
Ain't old enough for marijuana cigars, spark my blunt
But old enough to spend my life behind bars, that dumb
Told magazines that got me in articles
When I'm in Washington D.C., I'm doing fraud n' stuff
Ain't worried 'bout Donald Trump
Ain't worried 'bout seeing no monuments

Yiha! Skål i skideskuret!
Ja, vi skal bælle øl
Og ønske glædelig jul
Merry Christmas!
Ja, vi skal bælle øl

Dres,"Ya go beats, meats, son sheep
I can't cook, but being a cook I'm servin' much to eat
I got multiple stabs of jazzy
Sassafrassy as I caught the fame of soul
Years after mama had me tell ya gladly
I plugged for the tunin'
Which cause eyes to zoom in

Which put your person into focus

No longer kelvin mercer but the posdnuos
Plug one yo I found fun
In the scribblin' of speak
On a naked white sheet
Most recognized by my dark brown self

Yo you found some wealth?

More in my mind than in my pocket
But I's got every girbaud that ever sagged
I met some hoes, met some girls
Did a tour that took me all around the world

Did a tour that took me all around the world

I hit the shines but I'm shooin' it now
Remember when the floor might have had a spine
Well it's all bent over
The dayglo nigga gets the red door mat
It's a roller coaster
When your shit's burnt toast
Now Mr. club owner knows your jam
When your jam is tha jam
And there's a tab at the bar
My mindstate's great
No thanks I don't drink
I sip the bobo
Then I kettle it quick
I felt the heave in the jeave
Tap it in the basement
Diggin' my own understanding quick
Let me get the single out
Think mr. radio say the starlight
Is the same star bright
I'm thinkin' how a nine and a blunt is a switch
But turn out the lights and some will go bitch
It was one mc after one mc
Play the lamp post do the blow wit dynomite
Well it's okay and it's alright
Cause our birthday cake's external light
It'll all get graphic
People made of plastic
Look at the shine wit my 50 watt eye
But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch
I fame it to a name from denver up to maine
And lovin' deluxe
She won't catch me in no tux
Nah, man I won't honor the style

(Curious, curious, curious, curious)
Dres: how you doing, my name is dres, listen
Shorty: isn't that posdnuos? oh, my
Dres: baby, what's wrong with me?

Funny funny how time flies
When you have some light on the face
Cause the focus is the fickle
'stead of fusin' I'm a use it
To the utilize the trickle caught the rush
But I play hush
While andres titus is the grabbin'
As a fan will put the hearts to mush
Lush dalea would hear the public beat
The same way for titus when he blacked the sheep
But as the knee went deep
To deeper off the charts
The album faded to black
That's when the amnesia starts

(Curious, curious, curious, curious)
Shorty: aren't you dres from black sheep? 
What are you doing here? who
Are you here with?
Dres: I'm with my man pos, you know pos
Shorty: oh yeah, positive k, I like him

(Stickabush, stickabush, stickabush, stickabush)

Hey boy, I watch that star man, shit's all in
Should I shot it or begin
I saw bootleggas no shinin'
I saw big 4 go get shinin'
A typical flick was the moment
When the man said
""Ain't you?"" yeah I is 'im
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog
Caught the light being true dog
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen
In the scene or in between
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight
I mail my ass to the darkness
I dig it, I dug it
I dig it, I dug it
I wiz it, I was it
I wiz it, I was it
Oh lord let me switch it off
Because ya find some'll do it all
For the light

Dres,"I am Posdnous 
I be the new generation of slaves 
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
The pile of revenue I create 

But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 
Product of a North Carolina cat 
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie 
Who departed life just a little too soon 

And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame 
As we go a little somethin' like this 
Look ma, no protection 
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay 

And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough 
So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay 
I am an early bird but the feathers are black 
So the apples that I catch are usually all worms 

But it's a must to decipher one's queen 
From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ 
I cherish the twilight 
I maximize, my soul is the right size 

I watch for the power to run out on the moon 
(And that'll be sometime soon) 
Faker than a fist of kids 
Speakin' that they're black 

When they're just niggas trying to be Greek 
Or some tongues who lied 
And said ""We'll be natives to the end"" 
Nowadays we don't even speak 

I guess we got our own life to live 
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? 
Every now and then I step to the now 
For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool 

Now I won't apologize for it 
This is not a bunch of Bradys 
But a bunch of black man's pride 
Yet I can safely say 

I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside 
I've always walked the right side of the road 
If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs 
But a man with a plan 

And if I was a rug cleaner 
Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am.  
The Plug Two brand with the flavour 
In the flute watch the sniffin' 

So a sack of shows in demand 
I read the diction from the second page 
I got the one-two gauge 
Baritone to the izm fan 

Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink 
So let me need ya to my ems go 
I push the infinite and carry it 
My carrier's the three over one 

So my pluggins already know 
Lick shots with moo 
Catch the boo 
From a ghost in the heckling crowd 

If I give a foot 
Jack Ville caught a spill 
When a still came from my mouth 
I brought a head down south 

I don't check for the noose and the neck 
So I never tell my ems 
That finesse is knocking at my door 
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun 

And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore 
I bring the element H with the 2 
So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade 
It's just mind over matter 

And what matters is 
That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade 
I keep the walking on the right side 
But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong 

'Cause that's how he wants to be 
No difference, see 
I want to be like the name of this song I am 
I am Posdnous 

I be the new generation of slaves 
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
The pile of revenue I create 
But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 

The deeds of a natural 
Are seeds that are no longer planted 
So the famine in the mind is strong 
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane 

Sane enough to let you know from within this song 
I stabilize many cableized viewers 
So my occupation's known 
But not why I occupy 

And that is to bring the peace 
Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am",I Am I Be,1993

Like Mr. Long, my brother from another mother
Yo check it out

(Bounce, make it bounce, make it bounce, see'mon!)
Speak to your speaker, cause it's the time of day
Something new for the mass, people 
Tribe hard, die hard, shit, harldy ever

Not never, but whichever your pleasure whatever's clever
We're deeper than the ports in the back of your cerebellum
Dres, Dre, and Showbiz is rippin this shit, so tell them
We came, we saw, we broke the fuck out

You play, you lay, but if you give good hay you can stay
Hey, what's wrong with the world today?
Brothers busting brothers for less than time of day
The pay for Hammer's, proper, ain't no

Sunshine, and whitey's got your mama
So do you want to change for the children with a comma?
For who? Me, I, myself, you know the one
Doing what I gotta do when I do, come

I just get off, not just that, yo I say I
Do it good and Chaka Kahn knows that we be in Hollywood
Don't get jel if we cash large checks
'Cause we skiddly-dip-dip-do-dep dip dip for effects

Brothers think I'm dissing, but I'm really on the dicks
Look into my album, kid, you'll see all the flicks
But no! You'd rather feel my movie just to cold me
So I was boning mama and your mother fucking told me

I'm playing, I really got no time on the real
But yo, the shiek be unique, so do what you feel
Don't think I'm live? Then take a swigga

If you're hitting up some skins (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
If you're cooling at a club (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
No matter what you're doing, no matter what you're doing

They say more bounce to the ounce, well a Giant weighs tons
Stepping to the two, but we're not the ones
Brothers are flipping, some other suckers are tripping
Yeah, you gotta take a whipping to see that I'm live and kicking

I'm the A to the G-I followed by the A-N-T rolling with the Show be	-I
Black boots, black hat, slick like a black cat
Flip like a fat cat? Never none of that, black
But I got techs for those who want to flex

Jazzy's getting jazzy, Big L is raising hell

Ice Water, Deshawn, and Long is getting longer
Gary Gator got the lethal

Infinite, Today, yeah they are my people
Act like Dres, because he's living fat
And say ""You can bounce to this, or you can bounce to that""
My respect, and all that dough is all that counts
I'm out, and yo Dres let's make them bounce

If you're chillin on the ave (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
If you're cooling in your house (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
If you're rocking in a waterbed (Ya gotta bounce ta this)

Escaping from the phrasing of each line

I never learned to spell
At least not well.

A great amount.

To use what learning I've got.

I won't waste any time,
I'll strike while the iron is hot.

If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look.

I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget.

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot.

Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers a friend.

Use to hate to go to school
I never cracked a book;
I played the hook.

Never answered any mail;
To write I used to think was wasting ink.

It was never my endeavor
To be too clever and smart.

Now I suddenly feel
A longing to write in my heart.

Trapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on

I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
Just in case I ever need em again someday
I've been setting aside time
To clear a little space in the corners of my mind

All I want to do is find a way back into love
I can't make it through without a way back into love

I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
I know that it's out there
There's got to be something for my soul somewhere

Not somebody just to get me through the night

I could use some direction
And I'm open to your suggestions

All I want to do is find a way back into love
I can't make it through without a way back into love
And if I open my heart again
I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end

Or if anybody feels the way I feel

Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

Drew Holcomb & the Neighbors,"Sometimes I feel like a criminal
Feel like a castaway
This world keeps changing and I can’t keep the pace
It’s like a race, I didn’t know I was running

But there are some things like rudders in a storm,
Someone to keep you warm,
A friend to raise a glass, to take off your mask,
And tell the truth and just be you

Oh yeah alright, trying to make sense of it all tonight
Oh no, here we go, it won’t be the last time

Shouting and struggling and feeling like you’re nothing
Trying not to give in, not to take it on the chin,
Trying to wear your thickest set of skin

Music, it makes you feel good, makes you feel understood,
Like you’re not alone, you’re not a rolling stone,
Not the only one on the road.

Oh yeah alright, trying to make sense of it all tonight
Oh no, here we go, it won’t be the last time

It all seemed pretty plausible, but it became impossible,
The promises you made, the ones you got betrayed,
And all the things that you still don’t know at the end of the day",Here We Go,2015

I know it seems like I hate you, but I don't
I never should've loved you but I do
Could never figure out what I want
It makes it kind of hard to tell the truth and uh
And I know I said that we should pump the brakes

The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
We bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone (uh, yeah)

Shit, the world is in flames
We worry 'bout materials and the simplest things
When cops are killing people, then they can't take the blame
They get acquitted, then you wonder why all the people rage, stupid
We all keep praying for peace, praying for progress
If you live in the hills how you stay in the projects
So folks won't listen if they think what I'm saying is conscious
They'd rather hear me turning up on some simpler topics
Yeah so what's my place, am I out of line
For speaking what's going on, and saying what's on my mind
This shit is fucked up, plus it's happening all the time
My job, as a rapper is to entertain, we tryna shine
I'm not no politician, but they listen, somebody informal
All the kids gotta find out whats really important
I got a platform and a voice and a stage to perform on
Music could be a good escape, but outside it's been storming

As I sit in the studio, guess the thinking this
If the statement's too crazy then should I finish this
Or if my image is pretty, don't wanna blemish this
Or ever split up my fans, reduce my relevance
Pay attention and understand what the premise is
Everything not gravy, we can't pretend it is
So I salute YG, fuck the president
'Cause he a fucking racist supported by white supremacists
Fuck Donald, go back to just running businesses
We all wishing somehow we could've prevented this
Until we all love each other nobody benefits
Minorities and feminists, trans, gays and immigrants
The government mix politics and religiousness
So a man's body's more free than a woman's is
The anger is real, the riots are limitless
And nothing's gonna change 'til we killing off all this ignorance

Drew Sarich,"Endlich Nacht, kein Stern zu sehen
Der Mond versteckt sich, denn ihm graut vor mir
Kein Licht im Weltenmeer
Kein falscher Hoffnungsstrahl, nur die Stille
Und in mir die Schattenbilder meiner Qual

Das Korn war golden und der Himmel klar
1617, als es Sommer war
Wir lagen im flüsternden Gras
Ihre Hand auf meiner Haut war zärtlich und warm
Sie ahnten nicht, dass ich verloren bin
Ich glaubte ja noch selbst daran, dass ich gewinn
Doch an diesem Tag geschah's zum erstenmal
Sie starb in meinem Arm

Wie immer wenn ich nach dem Leben griff, blieb nichts in meiner Hand
Ich möchte Flamme sein und Asche werden und hab noch nie gebrannt
Ich will hoch und höher steigen
Und sinke immer tiefer ins Nichts
Ich will ein Engel oder ein Teufel sein
Und bin doch nichts als eine Kreatur
Die immer das will, was sie nicht kriegt
Gäb's nur einen Augenblick des Glücks für mich, nähm ich ewiges Leid in Kauf
Doch alle Hoffnung ist vergebens, denn der Hunger hört nie auf

Des Pastors Tochter ließ mich ein bei Nacht
1730 nach der Maiandacht
Mit ihrem Herzblut schrieb ich ein Gedicht auf ihre weiße Haut
Und des Kaisers Page aus Napoleons Tross
1813 stand er vor dem Schloss
Dass seine Trauer mir das Herz nicht brach, kann ich mir nicht verzeihen

Doch immer wenn ich nach dem Leben greif, spür ich, wie es zerbricht
Ich will die Welt verstehen und alles wissen und kenn mich selber nicht
Ich will frei und freier werden, und werde meine Ketten nicht los
Ich will ein Heiliger oder ein Verbrecher sein
Und bin doch nichts als eine Kreatur, die will was sie nicht kriegt
Die zerreißen muss, was immer sie liebt
Jeder glaubt, dass alles einmal besser wird
Drum nimmt er das Leid in Kauf
Ich will endlich einmal satt sein, doch der Hunger hört nie auf 

Manche glauben an die Menschheit, und manche an Geld und Ruhm
Andere glauben an Kunst und Wissenschaft, an Liebe und an Heldentum
Viele glauben an Götter verschiedenster Art
An Wunder und Zeichen, an Himmel und Hölle
An Sünde und Tugend und an Bibel und Brevier
Doch die wahre Macht, die uns regiert
Ist die schändliche, unendliche, verzehrende, zerstörende
Und ewig unstillbare Gier

Euch Sterblichen von morgen, prophezeih' ich heut und hier
Noch bevor euer nächste Jahrtausend beginnt
Ist der einzige Gott, dem jeder dient

That we're worlds apart

Guess I'm ready, ready, ready as I'm ever gonna be

Don't have the answers
For the questions yet
But if the dream is real
How bad can it get?

You'll never forget

It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash

To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

And get on back to school.

And make a living out of playing pool.

But I gotta let her go

Drew's Famous,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Drew's Famous,"Well it's been a long time, glad to see your face
I knew we'd meet again another time, another place
Can't believe it's been so many years
We better grab a chair and a couple of beers
You're lookin' good in your three piece suit
You know I always knew you'd take the business route
You were always the one who followed the light and
You look like you're doing alright

I've been singing for my rent and singing for my supper
I'm above the below and below the upper
I'm stuck in the middle where the money gets tight
But i guess I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, oh I'm alright
Got a good ole friend here with me tonight
So I guess I'm doing alright

Well we raised a lot of hell when we were younger
They thought we were crazy but we had the hunger
We kept a lot of friends and skipped a lot of class
Been on top of the world and knocked on our ass
Lost touch, we lost in love
And lost our minds when things got tough
But beating time is a losing fight
But I guess I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, oh I'm alright
Got a good ole friend here with me tonight
So I guess I'm doing alright

Well I hate to see this evening end
God only knows when I'll see you again
Send a fax or send me a letter
Or give me a call that will even be better
Give the wife a kiss for me
And say hello to the family
Tell them all my future's looking bright and I miss them
But I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, oh I'm alright
Got a good ole friend here with me tonight
So I guess I'm doing alright",I'm Alright,1999
Drew's Famous,"Got a little story for you
(bet it's about a woman)
Listen up

Let's begin with the day I met her
And how fast this good ol' boy's world got better
The sky got bluer the grass got greener
In just the first few seconds after I first seen her

Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and broke-in sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect
She's right on the money

She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump-shot that's nothin' but net
She's a handful of aces when the dealer's done dealin'
And I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feelin'

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect
She's right on the money

She's the best cook that ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect
She's right on the money",Right on the Money,1999
Drew's Famous,"And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am",Iris,1999
Drew's Famous,"You could've heard a pin drop
When they walked through the door
Had to turn my eyes away
My heart fell to the floor
Someone whispered, ""Where's her halo?""
'Cause she had an angel's face
He stood there smiling, holding on
To the one who took my place

So tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine, 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me

I wonder if he told her
She's the best he's ever known
The way he told me ev'ry night
When we were all alone
She'll find out when the new wears off
He'll find somebody new
She'll learn what heartache's all about
And what I'm going through

But tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine, 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me

But tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine, 'cause the hurtin's all mine

We're goin' for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go

I'm about to lose control and I think I like it!
