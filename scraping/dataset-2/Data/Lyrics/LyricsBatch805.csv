Oscar Peterson & the Very Tall Band,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1999
Oscar Peterson & the Very Tall Band,"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

Oscar Peterson Big 4,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round Midnight,1982
Oscar Peterson Four,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1983
Oscar Peterson Quartet,"We're sitting out here on the runway
Waiting for the plane to leave
And the captain says, ""There'll be a short delay
Bear with me, please""

They gave us the usual hassle
""You can't take those guitars on board""
But the boys in the band just smiled
Heard it all before

And as they're starting to serve champagne
To the folks at the front of the plane
I can hear the engines roaring
We're on our way

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight

The movie reminds of my lady
As she waits, ""Where are those guys?""
Yes, it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky

And now the sun is beginning to rise
It's like looking down on Paradise
There's a ball of fire that's burning
Giving life

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight",Flying Home,1952
Oscar Peterson Quartet,"You hold your arms open wide
You say come and lay by your side
If this is just another ride you're taking me on,
Then leave me alone

I'm not your part-time man
Love is more than now and then
I've enjoyed as much as this, as I can stand
So, love me or leave me alone

Love me or leave me alone
Love me or, baby,
Believe me, I'm gone
This time I'm gonna be strong

Maybe once upon a time,
I was young and love was blind
I thought I had finally made up my mind
It's sad, but

Love me or leave me alone
Love me or leave me alone
Love me or, baby,
Believe me, I'm gone

Love me or leave me
Girl, don't deceive me
Love me or leave me alone",Love Me or Leave Me,1957
Oscar Peterson Quartet,"I look at you and suddenly, something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love.",Old Devil Moon,1957
Oscar Peterson Quartet,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Oscar Peterson Quartet,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1957
Oscar Peterson Quartet,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1957
Oscar Peterson Quartet,"I was just minding my business
Life was a beautiful song
Didn't have a care nor worry
Then you had to come along
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue

Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'

You'd better watch them if you're wise

They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em

Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
Maybe you think I'm all lies
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in

Oscar Peterson Quartet,"Here in a moment of darkness 
Remember the sun has shone 
Laugh, and the world will laugh with you 
Cry, and you'll cry alone 

No tears, no fears 
Remember, there's always tomorrow 
So what if we have to part 
We'll be together again 
Your kiss, your smile 
Are memories I'll treasure forever 
So try thinking with your heart 
We'll be together again 
Times when I know you'll be lonesome 
Times when I know you'll be sad

Don't let the blues make you bad

We'll be together again",We'll Be Together Again,1957
Oscar Peterson Quartet,"You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you;
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything
From the five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own.
But after thinking it over and over,
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me.",You Turned the Tables on Me,1957
Oscar Peterson Quartet,"It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit before the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So goodbye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things",Just One of Those Things,1994
Oscar Peterson Quartet,"Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away

Please give me one little kiss

Oscar Peterson Quartet,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Oscar Peterson Trio,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,1959

I hope you'll forgive and forget
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
 
You made me glad, I made you sad
I made you lonesome and blue
And who ever knew 
Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you

And luscious lips, as red as wine

I left her and threw away the key to paradise

Oscar Peterson Trio,"Say, have you seen a Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye

I hear you say forever more

Been talkin' to the shadows
One o'clock 'til four

When all ya do is pour

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry.

You know a man is born to love a woman
To work and slave to pay her debts
Just because he's only human
To drown his past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
Not much heart to fight
Black coffee ...

Feelin' low as the ground
I'm waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around.

Gonna drown my past regrets
In some coffee and a few cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight

It's driving me crazy!

To maybe come around.
Please come around
Please come â?¦

The black cloud had drifted away
And, baby, this is what I heard her say, she said

[Chorus]
Without love, there's nothing you can do, oh, oh, oh
Without love, you're not really you, oh, baby

All night long she spoke to me
She whispered in my ear
Beneath that sweet, soft melody
She said, ""Don't you know that a rich man
A rich man that might be poor
If money is all that he has""

[Chorus]

And all night long she spoke to me
She whispered in my ear
Way beneath that sweet, soft melody
And this is what she said
She said, ""Hey, baby, don't you know that a rich man
A rich man that might be poor
If money is all that he has""

And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her; 
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;

Oschino,"[Chorus]
I know it's hard in every hood I know
Struggle in every ghetto I know
But not like the one I know
I see the law in every hood I go
They throw metal in every hood I know
But not like the one I know

[Oschino]
We all started innocent
Eating Reese's Pieces
I was young, then wearing 5 star Aleses
Bullet in ya gut a have a bag catch ya feces

20 months, vision quest, sleeping in a tepee
Since my dad died, attitude worsened
That's why I stole cars before I could write cursive
Thousand miles from being rich, stuck on my grind

Try to sale nickel bags like Louie Baton
I'm young, I'm good, best shape of my life
One shot from big shit a blow you out of ya Nikes
Only a dick head wouldn't want to be rich

And do his car like school and drop out in the 6
You could look at my wrist, It wasn't shit on it
But I was determined to get a little gliss on em
The 40 ounce bottles done turned to Cris on em
And every bitch that was fronting, I'ma piss on em

[Beanie Sigel]
My hood dog
Like any average one
You know the dirty kids on the block having fun
Hand to hand is how the grams is slung

In tanned Timberlands and [unknown] until them vans a come
It's all good now
But you remember those latter days
Them tubleware, soul food platter days

That was ya mom little hustle on a Saturdays
Back then, when it really didn't matter days
You would take that beating
'Cause you wasn't trying to be

The only one who missed the house party on the weekend
Knowing that them project chicks was in there freaking
Grinding off ""As We Lay""
Walk with me why'all

Back in the Day, you and ya man slap tapping away
Pitching chains, playing craps everyday
Getting high on the block
Green bottles of private stock

2 dollar 40's
Sparks tell ya story

[Chorus]

[Sparks]
I come up fragile and timid
Pressed to the limit
12 years old, no household
From the start I was finished

Disowned by the biologicals
And adopted by rolling stones on corners, sipping Thunderbird
Banging needles and pushing stolen Regals
And with no hoe and no money, layered my hunger pains daily with rice and gravy

Stuck between a rock and a hard spot as a juvenile
Just made me want to holla ""Lord help me""
But I had will power
Stole a burner from Uncle Lester

And that .22 long blossomed to wild flower
Now when I enter rooms the conversation stop
And them cock suckers whisper
These faggots ain't got no cahunas

So if they so much as touch me
I cock back and put like bananas on them mokey motherfuckers
Show no love for these cock suckers
Weeping

Who can't deal with life situations cause that's money to me
Uhh
Murder

[Freeway]
Now who am I
Little nigga named Free from the hood
What I do
Make a living, make a killing in the hood

What I'm trying to do now
Get my children out the hood
Before the ATF start coming
Plot, plot on

Now who am I
Little nigga named Free from the block
What I do
Make a living , make a killing on the block

What I'm trying to do now
Get my children off the block
And my real niggas, if they coming, clique come on
In my hood, F-are-double uh

Cock back, double pump
You rapping, I just happen to have some space in the trunk
89' dough, space in the front
Will ya hoe fit?

Beef come, we be dumping the whole clip
Having lunch, while you be fronting, be fucking ya hoe sick
Send her home, can't hump
Send my nigga's through ya block, can't pump

Grind, watch for the cops
Shit tucked
I'll be watching them lady CO's if I slip up
Uh Uh

Yo, I'm saying Mac, I know I'm young and all
(Yeah that's what's up?)
But I been through a little struggle too
(What you been through?)
Lot of crazy shit dog, ya know?
(Shit Don't tell me, you got opportunity to tell the world)
Feel this dog
(Speak ya story, Yung Gun)

[Chris]
Yo I was brought up in the wildest streets
Where niggas pack everyday, and everybody crowd to eat
24/7, no time to sleep
A g and up, reign up, 3 times a week

Throwing numbers on the strip
The youngin' out the clique
Moves like Carl Lewis when it's coming out the clip
Uh, Still in school, all the learning I can get

Focused, trying to purchase all the burners I can get
I know plenty niggas fell, trying to chauffer through this shit
These niggas tell, then a murder gon exist
It's no joke in the hood

Especially when the boat ain't make it across
And we ain't got no coke in the hood

I come from scrambling and gambling men
Starving stomach touching I hustle with the hand of hand men
But the ambition got the tables turning
'Cause now I coach coke up for the post
I let seven go like Chicago did Tony Kukoc
Let them falls revolve through a ski coat
Keep in mind this nigga ain't got no dough
Committed crime and all he did was switch coke
And that's gangsta
In the hood that I know 4 niggas at least 7 dead
And 3 injured and that's danger
Enough to put the cops under pressure
That's why we never listen to mami's lectures
The techs the only thing that can protect ya
That's why we scream fuck these coppers
And tote gats big enough that as soon as they poppin
Have you screaming louder then the opera
Now roam through the streets of Philly 
With a nigga so you can understand a lil betta

Yo my song is like Louis Armstrong's but instead of blowing the flute
I was blowing glocks of the roof
I've seen a lot of my friends in a box in a suit
It happens so often you don't get a chance to regroup
My life is like a song and I'm singing this sad ballad
Wearing that same weared sweater like Fat Albert
One thing about O you can't call him a snitch
Been shot nine times and never approached the bench
Remember us struggling like it was just yesterday
Matter of fact it was yesterday
Welcome to the ghetto this close to a hearse
At a funeral the first time I went in a church
But I pray to Allah to panewat the aisle
I can't crack down man I got to be a fighter
The song don't change 'cause we signed to a lable
We still caught bad breaks like Hardaway ankles

Yo now Jeremiah stay madder then a muthafucka
Till he had 40 money champagne wishes
Argues on corners with hood rat bitches
Looking at what he had for role models bunch a alcoholics and junkies
Riding in 77 caddies smoking on Woollies tote on long rusty revolvers
Sticking up young workers for they packages
Like fuck coppers 'cause basically the Rolling Stones be homeless
So when the cops catch us they don't run from em 
They figure three hots in the cops it'll be alright with em
Plus niggas they ain't seen in a while they be uniting there
Making home made wine shooting the breeze
Smoking squares at the chi chis 
Self-made whackers razorblades tape and toothbrushes
Life is school to the new comers
Shit the closest they come to the bricks
Is dialling gunya books
Life's a bitch in the beginning

But I won't fold you know how I roll
I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code
Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun
Go all out but I think of my sons
Then I look where I was at how far did I come

You see lady's prostituting wearing tight leopard
My sneaks was dogs like Pit bulls and German shepherds
Fuck where it came from I needed money fast
White boys bangin' Led Zeppelin went in twenty bags
So I got my first pack on fifty first and Market
I ain't want clothes I just wanted some boss to mark it
No moms to call no dad to be
Stuck on the streets stomach growlin' like a dog showin' his teeth
Life ain't sweet life ain't a game
I know life is more real then Slick Rick chain
Everybody get a hand so play the hand you dealt
And there's nobody to blame fuck it blame yourself
You can go all out and try to reveal
Like a nuclear staying how you write in a cell
You just better pray a liar and hope you prevail
I know living in the hood is hell, come on

[Chorus:]
My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand
But I won't fold you know how I roll
I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code
Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun
Go all out but I think of my sons
Then I look where I was at how far did I come

Yo right now I'd like to take the time to thank my family members
And phoney homies for turning they backs on me
Make me stronger help me deal with snakes and side guys
Going but I was grooming like a rodent
And I swear these streets will turn us boys to men
I'm the pain with juice and gin try to stack them Horace Grants to a million
Playing Caesar how I blessed them bitches
Excuse my arrogance but baby clone me
This petty world a kill me slowly take away my grandma mami hold me
Life obstacles is getting stressful that's why I don't come around
Written between the paper line examples of my lifestyle
So read inside the guidelines ain't no sunshine
Until you break the chains and fly freely 'cause I know for a fact
Somewhere out in the world somebody need me
To make em smile and appreciate em believe me
But main'tain in the main while baby
Omilio'll be there for you knahmean shit I'm a trouble man

Leave two outside, bring two inside, just don't bring that bullshit
'cause we all gon time and get caught for this shit
I know your number, 'cause I once got caught for shit
In court for shit, like look Ian, I don't feel what I done was a crime

My life as an adolescent, said I'll go through something
Other guys try to stand in my way like brick walls
So I kept guns in my palm like Messiah scripts in Psalms
I should fear no man but God
So, Lord knows we could get it on
Guns baptized guys testing my pride
Clearing my conscience in the liquor store
With a fifth of Thunderbird, but I be guzzling hard
Playing the corners with a washed-up old-head
Chant tunes by the Whispers
Same corner where I banged at with niggas
Cops drive by and grin on us
If they grabbed then 
One of them nosy neighbors done snitched on us (Again?)
Hey, this game juicy got me puffing loosies
Every two days interrogated by the police
See, this life I live cost more than your Roley's money
It cost my homey Nook his whole life, ya heard me?
When he was here, it was easy to love him like a brother
Now that's he's gone I find it difficult to talk to his mother
I mean, what do you say to a woman
That's just lost her only son to the game and the gun, except 
""Mami, I'm a ride for him.""?
The look that she gave me like, ""Sparks, you got some nerve.""
'Cause most of these niggas don't keep their words
Now I'm under pressure
And I can't even break that type of promise 
And y'all niggas paint that picture
Risking your freedom
On the strength of memories of him
The time he made you laugh
The time he bust his gat when them other niggas ran
How real is that?

I know I ain't too far from hell
I'll spit the devil these bars in hell

Catch Mac in a Chevy truck slightly tented
No excuses on who might be in it

Crack the window, the indo slightly scented
Splash of haze and hash lightly blended
Put the pressure on niggas who might be timid

We still not promised tomorrow
Takin the bitter with the sweet up in these cold ass streets
We got lifestyles through our scars
We ride hard til our numbers get called
The lifestyle of a hustler...

[Sparks]
I'm feelin like deaths in the air
Got me back to back buckin my squares
But I ain't bitchin I ain't scared
I ain't budgin, in fact the thrill alone turns me on
Got me smiling, laughin...Clutchin
My toast and confrontin mother fuckers
Cock-a-roaches will not catch me laughin
Skinny and slim fram why'all get it the same
Cool niggaz that'll spin out they waves
Grimey niggaz that'll spin to they graves
Justifyin my foul ways
I got kids to raise
But motherfuckers rather see me sprayed
Than to see me pair (fucker)
Or see me on the front page like Sig
Or stay rolled DC with B. Sig
You bitch niggaz stay PC when why'all see me
Until the day that they
Fit me in the grave and the city wreak of me
We got the city under siege
S-P or are-O-see
Poverty is a movie starrin me
Ride with no play the passenger seat
So why'all can see how my life so real
So why'all can see how my life so ill
(I came to chill..)

[Chorus]
[Oschino]
Tales of a hustler that's me in the flesh
Got a Jag and a Caddy sellin dimes of the step
Niggaz want to take my block I had to earn my respect
So I put his cerebellum on his grandma's steps
You know Oschino he'll probly kill
Got the soul of Huey Newton nigga Bobby Seale
Nigga prolly take the stand he'll prolly squeal
But I got four lawyers I ain't takin the deal (Nigga)
We could strap without scrap or put the semi in it
Gun fully loaded like the Chrysler with the hemmy in it
I keep it ghetto like a 40 with the Henny in it
Went to school broke loafers on no pennies in it
Stood the coldest winter with the bummiest coat
Need food need shoes sold dummies of soap
Got tired of bein broke man life was a bitch
They bring you flowers when you head but no soup while you sick
So I switched my whole picture get involved with the bricks
Not the ones made of semen but the ones who sniffs
Tales of hustler, niggaz come for your jugular
If you sell one bag to they mother fuckin customers
State P we got the city on smash
Got every boulevard every street every ave
Got sneakers got clothes nigga you do the math
Push to hustle but the point is just to stack that cash

Ossie Scott,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1994
Ossie Scott,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
Ah, I'm walkin' on a cloud
I can't understand, Lord
I'm misty holdin' your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your ""hello""
That music I hear, Lord
I'm misty the moment you're near
You can say that you're leadin' me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't ya notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm followin' you
Ooh, on my own
Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now
Never knowin' my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove, Lord
I'm misty, and too much in love
You can say that you're leadin' me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't ya notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm followin' you
Ooh, on my own
Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now
Never knowin' my right foot from my left

Ossie Scott,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2008

For you're now about to hear, the ballad of Cat Ballou-ou
It's a song that's newly made and Professus and The Shade

It's a hangin' day in Wolf City, Wyomin'
Wolf City, Wyomin', eighteen-ninety-four 
They're gonna drop Cat Ballou-ou
Through the gallows floor 

She killed a man in Wolf City, Wyomin'
Wolf City, Wyomin', killed a man it's true 
And that is why they're a-hangin', hangin' Cat Ballou

She has the smile of an angel (Fights like the Devil) 
The eyes of an angel (Bites like the Devil) 
The face of an angel (I say she's the Devil)
She's mean and evil through and through

Cat Ballou, Cat Ballou-ou-ou 
She's mean and evil through and through 

With her outlaw band, they're now tellin' a story
Now tellin' a story, how she rode the plain 
The wildest gal in the We-est, since Calamity Jane 

And today's the day, that she's goin' to glory
She's goin' to glory, for the way she sinned 
They'll be a-speedin' her sou-oul, on the wayward wind

On the night she born the lightning flashed and the thunder roar 
But when they heard her cry -the clouds rolled back and the full moon fill the sky 
Shinin` down in her eye 
Can you hear her cry

She always look so pale 
The things she wear and the long white veil 
She wrapped it up so tight -your mind come loose and you drift on out of sight 
She`s a child of the night

Otep,"I had this dream...
Where I woke up
To a grand commotion
And um... I just jumped from the blankets
And whipped the door from its lock,
And rush blindly into the blackness of the hallway
But there, on all sides
Lying next to each other
Were rows and rows of executioners...

Some were shirtless
And throbbing with anticipation.
Sweat delicately sneaking through their body hair
All were hooded
Some like seventeenth century guillotine henchmen
Others had crudely made hoods
Like scarecrows or ripped ski masks
With slobber from their clenching jaws
And some had burlap masks that looked like they were made of human skin.

Each one held a weapon.
Large mallets
Crudely fashioned axes
And large clubs
Pipes

But I wasn't compelled to retreat.

No

I was forced to move between them.
Past their swinging weapons
The clubs
The bats
The slicing tools
The shovels
The large and small axes
Boards with nails, staples and razorblades embedded in them
Taking the beating,
Falling down,
Getting up,
Again and again and again and again
Driven to make it out...

At any cost

And next,
I stumbled into a... this strange marshy world
Where I was oddly drowning in squirrels and other large, starving rodents.
From above, out on the treetops,
Several dolls fell from the branches
And they were hanging
With nooses made of human hair
They started biting and sucking and trying to feed from me...
Trying to enter my belly and some pushed large needles into my veins and...
And as I looked back, some had nails through their hands, torsos and throats.

I was froze
Dead eyes...
Carbonized...
As I kicked them away
I could see all around me...
Of piles and piles of dead sea life
Large fish, smelly crustaceans

And their soulless empty bodies whispered
A secret language I couldn't decipher but somehow understood.

And their cries were
""Feed me... Feed me...""

They wanted me to devour those around them
Chew them up into pieces
And smear them inside their mouths
And as I turned around
I could see the shape of a woman
Perfect...
Perfectly erotic
Squatting over a pile of these dead things...
And as I ran to her and said ""what the fuck are you doing?!""

And she had no face
And she turned to glass
And suddenly cracked
And then exploded into 1000 pieces at my feet

And just as I took a quick breath,
This world was shoved and decimated
But an intruding tidal wave
Of microorganisms, exploding atoms...

And suddenly moon rose...
Frightened, aching, and alone...
And that's what I remember most...

...The ache

I can't escape
The ache.......",[Untitled Hidden Track],2002

Riot gear, the slaves are here
Piling corpses high
Its the rich man's war
But its the poor that fight

More enemies than allies

Just kill em all, watch em fall

Challenging everything

More deception & greed
More wars & disease
More lies from the hive mind

A weak nation of need
Like silent thieves in the night
Its a rich man's war
But it's the poor that die

And the perfect wife
And the perfect kids
And the perfect life
I will finally be somebody...)

(Let's play born-again American, resistance is the game!)

Two pigs wearing suits
Brought the news
That I'm wanted by the bank

They say the rent is due
Caesar's onto you
So you better remember your place

Then they outsourced my job
And gave a raise to my boss

Bailed out the banks
But billed me for the loss

They say we must submit
And be one with the Machine

Because the Kingdom of Fear
Needs compliance to succeed

So waterboard the kids for fun
It's all the rage

And play born-again American
Resistance is the game

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Happy little slaves for minimum wage

(The revolution will be monetized
And streamed live via renegade WiFi)

The clinic said I'm sick
Toxic..... and impure

But there isn't any cure
For the poor or uninsured

So we live our digital lives
On multiple screens

And we forget that
The blood of the workers
Grease the machines

In the Psalm of the Fiends
Love ...... discriminates

While the fat cats feed the rats
Their daily dose of cake

So waterboard the kids for fun
It's all the rage

And play born-again American
Resistance is the game

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE

For designer clothes

For the perfect lips
And the perfect nose

The winner in the end
Always owns the most

Money changer!
Greedy bankers!

This is the Peoples House!

My minister has a sinister plan
To save my soul with a credit card scam

Exploitation is contagious
For the selfish & self-inflated

Start a war, use the poor,
Watch our profits soar & soar

We've become a nation of wolves
Ruled by sheep

Owned by swine
Overfed & put to sleep

And while the media's elite
Decrees what to think

I am wide awake
On the edge
And on the brink

So when Atlas shrugs
And The Fountainhead bleeds
And when Walstreet Apostles
Preach a gospel of greed

I'll renounce the fame of this gluttonous age
And be a Born-again American
Resistance is to blame!

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Work, buy, consume, die

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE
Haters, betrayers, liars, and thieves

SMASH THE CONTROL MACHINE

Otep,"The soft sound of snow crunching
Underfoot gives me comfort.
Her building is at the end of the block. 
She lives on the north side.
Bottom floor. Middle apartment.
I see her, one, two, three, four, five steps.
Wrong key. Lock clicks. She drops her
Coat and scarf in the entry and
Kicks off those, vexing shoes.
She shuffles to the kitchen and pours
A glass of scotch. (I am inside)
She lights a cigarette and blows
The smoke over the match. (She doesn't notice)

The gray smog rises from her
Lips like a cremation furnace.
The simple elegance of this quiet
Moment is almost irresistible.
(But, I wait)

She slugs back the scotch,
Finishes her smoke and ashes it
In the sink. She unties her hair
And enters the hallway, past the
Childless bedroom with the empty
Crib, past the altar coated in wax
Like a wedding cake, and the tiny
Packages of meat, dead flowers,
And baby's breath.

She enters the bathroom, where 
She undresses. She sits on the 
Edge of the bath. Her naked body 
Folded in half, heavy tits hanging
Like mushy stalactites over her
Lap. (Oh, precious) She closes her 
Eyes and holds her head as if it
Might float away.

For a moment, my thoughts drift
Again, this time to the hammer 
I am holding. The handle is
Smooth as bone, the forged steel
Head is heavy, and I feel powerful. 
She reaches for the faucet
And I snap back to the moment.
Bubbles brim the edge of the 
Tub. Her fingers check the water
Temperature and I am ready.

I move behind her. She doesn't
Hear. I swing the hammer. She
Doesn't see. I crack her skull.
She's in the tub. Face down. I am 
Drowning her, mashing her head
To the bottom, knifing the claw of
The hammer into her spine and
Ribs over and over and over and
Over and over and over and over
And over and,

Her body stops pretending to
Care and surrenders as it is supposed
To. just to be sure, I press
Hard, keeping her head beneath
The bloody water a few moments
More. Her neck snaps, her nose
Breaks, and her face collapses
Against the bottom of the tub. I 
See my reflection in the mirror
And soapy foam has formed a half
Smile over the black nylon mask 
I am wearing

I lean to her. The water glistens
Like glass. I hover over the 
Surface, soft breath causing tiny 
Quakes, and whisper, ""I have done
To you what nature has done to me.""

She doesn't reply.

I stand and turn off the light.
The room is dark and empty.
Just like I am now.",Baby's Breath,2011
Otep,"There are nights, so vacant and hushed, 
I can feel the texture of my tattered soul moving within me.
Black tar, dripping, sticky and thick.
A soft, slow secretion of indifference
Slopping through the hollow suit I use as a body.

They say these are the words of a damaged mind.
But not I
To me, this is insurgency.

I used to dream of being inside the womb.
Fetal universe, black holes and emptiness.
Orbiting the màssive planet of my mother's booming heart.
Tiny yolk body, tethered like an astronaut, 
Adrift in the tranquil spume of desolate bliss.
Tiny fingers inching from chubby stems,
Reaching for that great thumping whoosh of blood and power
That wobbled like a snarling god above me.
My fibrous head translucent as a bell jar,
Would search with great staring eyes deep into the godless dark for a light,
For a sign, for anything other than indifference.
But the universe would never oblige.

Look upon me, a daughter of a child and a monster.
Frozen without cold feeling nothing unsure, 
Uninspired, veins full of air, soul fading into the umbra

Who are they to say what is moral when they are broken?
Who are they to say anything about us?

All this, all this,
And I want to sledgehammer
And leave nothing but dust

To dust
To dust
To dust

I was born to be broken

Calling, gagging, spitting, 
Falling, bleeding, begging vermin
I exist without purpose

I'm sick of this shit
Not gonna flinch
If I gotta go down, it'll be swinging
You will see you can't break me
I'm not gonna take it anymore

Keep your knuckles bloody
No more tears
No more fears
Strike the anchors
Use your anger
Defy the master
Break the rules

Keep your pride locked up inside
It belongs to you
They think they're stronger, bigger, better
But they're just jealous cowards
Fuck what they say
Fuck what they think

What is so terrible about a child screaming?
Why should it disturb us?
Just because we happen to be there to hear it?
What about the child who comes from an inadequate home
Where he gets no encouragement from his parents
Where he doesn't have enough to wear, he doesn't have enough to eat, he comes to school hungry

Otep,"I remember black mascara painting your face
I remember dark sunglasses when clouds were grey
Remember silence
Remember tears
Remember still
I remember black cars pulling up to take you away
The smell of the fall and the endless rain
Remember shivers
Remember cold
Remember still
Now I hesitate
Levitate between memories
Elevate, was it hate?
That got through to me
My mistake, was it fate that brought you to me?
Now I’m losing

Why can't I see any color at all
When I dream about those days?
How did I let these images drain away
When all I do is suffer?
No color

As I shouldered the blame
The gunmetal grey on that trembling day
Remember thunder
Remember fear
Remember still
I remember biting my lip to stifle a laugh
I tried to say your name
But all that came out was a whisper
“Hell is empty, the devil’s here”
Now you disintegrate
Levitate into memory
Elevate, was it hate that got you to see?
My mistake, it was fate that brought you to me?
Now I'm losing

I think I think too much
I have a problem for every answer
Striking at the ocean with a broken hammer

Against the slow weight of the night
These little lights burn like lighted fires
Along the jagged walls
Somewhere out there a fresh face is cutting lines
On a heated plate
Somewhere out there she just sacrificed her life

Over a fading flame
Something's wrong with me
For thinking something's right with you

Choking on the shame

Singing their siren song
They mesmerize
I forget to fly
Somewhere out there I just sacrificed my life

We chew into passive mammals
In cold blood!
In cold blood!
My fingertips touch her lips
To quiet the sins she commits
In cold blood!
In cold blood!

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Othello,"Give the band a round of applause join the cause 
As me and Man child flap our jaws and rap raw, huh
Got to be optimistic 
We twist it different your paradigm is shifted 
And it's positively terrific audibly 
We flipped it awkwardly 
How do we did it done it dang it or do I mean do it 
Keep it fluid let's move it 
I make people music, music sweet music 
Every now and then you have to renew it 
Still the formula stays the same we just like to mix the elements 
And watch them rearrange because change is good 
It keeps perspective keen 
But trying to be different don't really mean that you're doing anything 
That hasn't been done still 
The style is identical to none 

[Chorus]
Oh yes and the band plays on 
Every where we go it's the same old song
See I know there's really nothing new under the sun 
But yet I want to do it like it's never been done 

I'm not even sure what's next 
I'll let my thoughts collect and do my best to connect 
Without begging for your respect 
Or maybe just a little what the heck 
Now, you enter in new mindset 
Yup fresh water gets the mind wet 
Are we there yet 
On point yet 
All that I am or all I can 
Until there's nothing left

My gift of gab is sort of sweet a summer night's dream
Capture the elaborate colours that life brings 
Paint a vivid picture put the pieces in their places 
Ain't many saying A through Z to make their statements 
To get your point across in 8 bars is a task 
To make them wanna hear more of your point of views advanced 
We're up until all hours of the night
Dropping the science that drives us in life
Christ and opportunities to rock the mic
