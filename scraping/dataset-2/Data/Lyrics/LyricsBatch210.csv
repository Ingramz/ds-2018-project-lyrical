Emmet Swimming,"Look the streets are cold tonight
The cops are looking for another fight
Fairfax is a dirty town
Spent six years here after movin' around

Maybe I gave you a scare
Outside the coffee shop with all your friends there
I can't be alone tonight
Throw your coffee in my face that's right 

[Chorus]
You're so pretty
You're so pretty
You're so pretty
Pretty

I saw you at the Planet last night
On the dance floor 'neath the crimson light
He was dancing walls around you; you can be a prisoner on the outside too

He was starin' at that mirro put there
At the highlights in your deep breath red hair
Do you like your shell green eyes?
Just rub your hands against a girl's white thigh

[Chorus]

I saw you on the back deck last night
I could tell you two were havin' a fight
Look into those shell green eyes
He's beggin' you to change your mind

I know you really like your red hair
'Cause he was cryin' to the thin black cold air
You had a certain glow last night
Laughin' with your friends as you drove outta sight

[Chorus]",You're So Pretty,1995
Emmet Swimming,"Took him away when I was four
Indian wrestling partner
Played cops behind the moving trucks
Ran around, around
And as they drove away
Went back inside to play
Took my toys scattered them around, around

[Chorus]
(Like yesterday)
Boston's not that far away (Oh, the things we say)
To make life just pass on (Now it's gone)
So far away (Oh, the things we say)
Just pretend nothing's wrong (Now it's gone)
So far away (Oh, the things we say)
It helps us carry on (Now it's gone)
So far away (Oh, the things we say)
To make it through til dawn
It got a little harder
Split up when I was nine
Divvied up the furniture
Went back in the house one last time
Just to walk around, around
What could they say?
""It's not your fault
It'll be OK""
All my toys were scattered around, around
(Chorus 2x)",Boston,1996
Emmet Swimming,"I'll sleep by the phone if you call me up I'll drive you home
I don't just disappear I need to be where you are
I see it now when you're working a crowd
And you keep me around because I help you stand out
But you're pushing me down because it makes you feel proud
You take the soul from me

[Chorus]
That's me all I want to be is the bullet in your hand
When you're weak that's me
I want to be the bullet in your hand
Less of a man

Kiss on the chin all the while you're staring at him
Tug on my leash
Please, please
Don't do this now don't you need me around?
Don't I make you stand out?
Don't I make you feel proud?
I'm falling down and I can't feel the ground
I'll be whatever you want me to be
It's all I can see

[Chorus]

You touch his hand am I less of a man
You're moving down and he's pushing you're head down
And you look like a child but you don't kill like a child
You've ripped the soul from me

[Chorus]",Bullet in Your Hand,1996
Emmet Swimming,"Never lit a fire in your eyes
That's what he said to me
It should really come as no surprise
I bruise that easily

Can't stand living
So we wait for another day
I'll pull through
I know you can't stand me
But we're stuck here anyway
A motel room in nowhere Nevada

We're just lost on the motorway
I turn to you, you've got nothing to say
And we're just wasting days away
It's fifty miles to Reno
And we're staring at the desert

Never felt a pain that hurt too much
That's what you said to me
Lately it seems you've been out of touch
We both break so easily

Can't stand living
So we wait for another day
I'll pull through
I know you can't stand me
But we're stuck here anyway
A motel room in nowhere Nevada

We're just lost on the motorway
I turn to you, you've got nothing to say
And we're just wasting days away
Something is lost on the motorway

I guess our dreams sort of got in the way
And strung us along for another day
We'll kiss when we drop off the car in L.A.
But something was lost on the motorway

",Motorway,1998
Emmet Swimming,"Am I the only one who's never had fun
In the twelve years we've gone steady?
Put down the parasol, that isn't you at all
When the whole thing crumbles I won't be there

I'm going on a big vacation
Cause I deserve some fun
Got the top down swimming in the ocean
I got the sunblock on

And you feel so elite with me below your feet
And always at the ready

I'm going on a big vacation
I can't escape the sun
Got the top down swimming in the ocean
And where the Go-Go's trod

I'm there with a cheap beach blanket
The kind you don't take home
No cheap wine, I've got a jug of lancers
I got the sunblock on

Soon the walls around you break
And there's no one to make you feel safe
And all the problems that you fake
I won't be there

I'm going on a big vacation
Cause I deserve some fun
Got the top down swimming in the ocean
And Flock Of Seagulls on

""I Ran"" and a ""Photograph Of You""
That singer's haircut's sad
I think I found the perfect occupation
I got the sunblock on

I'm going on a big vacation
And I will not come home
My new address is sitting by the ocean
I can't be reached by phone

When I'm gone you can climb the social ladder
Respectable at last
Turn your back on all the things that matter
I've got the sunblock on, on, on, on
On, on, on",Sunblock,1998
Emmett Berry,"I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront
In search of my love
An I'm covered

Here am I
Patiently waiting
Hoping and longing

Emmett Berry,"You said someday you'd turn the tide,
And I'd be laughin' on the other side,
And you was right, baby,
Baby, you was so right!

You said someday the worm would turn,
I had some lessons that I had to learn,
And you was right, baby,
Baby, you was so right!

I gave you a story, you gave me the gate!
I wish you'd come back but you say it's too late.
I look kind of silly,
But I guess I'll hold it until you come back.

You said someday you'd pass me by,
That I'd be tellin' you just one too many lies,
And you was right, baby,

Emmett Berry,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Emmett Berry,"How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
Why do you try to make me feel so blue?
I've done nothing to you.
Do me right or else just let me be.
'Cause I can beat you doing what you're doing to me.
How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?

Emmett Berry,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,2004
Emmett Berry,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2004
Emmett Berry,"Islands of Hawaii
Where skies of blue are calling me
Where balmy air and golden moonlight
Caress the waving palms of Wai KiKi

Valleys with their rainbows
Your mountains green, and deep blue sea
Your fragrant flowers and dreamy music
Unite and sing a aloha-hi to me

Emmett Carls,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
How can you face them?

What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

It's the talk of the town.",It's the Talk of the Town,1999
Emmett Carls,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999
Emmett Chapman,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came

From his hands as he walks from the grave

Emmett Dennis,"No one to talk with

Emmett Dennis,"Usin' the phone booth,
Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,
""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""

""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,
""Do you doodle all night?""
Told the waiter he was right,
""In your doodlin' way-""
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""
""Are you thinkin' things right?""
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""
""Don't know what I can do,""
""Ain't nothing you can do,""
""With old doodlin' you,""
""Doodin's all I want to do,""

That's for true!

Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,

When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away

We just doodle all day!",Doodlin',1957
Emmett Dennis,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

Emmett Kelly,"On the way to California
And I don't mean California literally
I was thinking, it's so comforting, quiet
You read so softly over my head
It's late but I'm maintaining interest in the things that you say

In the silence dripping wet with
Kisses running down my lips
Could be just a good friend
Who knows at this point anyway

There's just something about the way you surrender your eyes
Without this barrier of bodies, we'd already be inside

I'm not dreaming
I'm not dreaming

I've got a feeling buried deep down

Buried so deep down

Emmett Miller,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.","(I Got a Woman, Crazy for Me) She's Funny That Way",1996

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1996
Emmett O'Hanlon,"When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

Emmett O'Hanlon,"I've met some folks
Who say that I'm a dreamer
And I've no doubt
There's truth in what they say
But sure a body is bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away

And precious things
Are dreams unto an exile
They take him o'er
The land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Innisfree

And when the moonlight
Peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city
Wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter
I'm once again back home in Innisfree

I wander o'e r green hills
Through dreamy valleys
And find a peace
No other land could know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow

And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home
And tenderly behold
The folks I love
Around the turf fire gathered
On bended knee
Their rosary is told

But dreams don't last
Though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back
To stern reality
But though they pave
The footways here with gold dust
I still would choose
The Isle of Innisfree

I still would choose
The Isle of Innisfree",Isle of Inisfree,2016
Emmett O'Hanlon,"The moonlight dances among the trees.
The campfire glows in the autumn breeze, and I am
lost in my thoughts of you.
Remember me, recuerde me.

A comrade strums on sad guitar.
My mind is drifting to where you are
I'm holding you as I used to do
Remember me, recuerde me. Mi amore.

So long ago, so far away, each night I pray
""volvero los dias passados""
I promise you that come what may
those days will stay ever in my memory

In all this world I could never find, the love that I had to leave behind.
But duty calls, so whate'er befalls
Remember me, recuerde me, mi amor.

God only knows what tomorrow brings
You're in my heart so my spirit sings
and I'll be strong just as long as you remember me, recuerde me, mi amor.",Remember Me,2016

Do you wonder who&acute's inside
Inside your head making all those sick dreams
And when you close your door at night
Push it against the wall real tight

See me sleeping like an unborn child
Hear me breaking my hand in the cradle
Dancing like a butterfly

Scared to open your eyes in the dark
Moving shadows, they come from the wall
Rapped up in your sheets waiting, you see them crawl
Finally drifting away, till you sleep
Hair moves down to your face, real sweet
Reaching arms, they tried but did not get ya

Don´t introduce me as you think you know

Don´t even think I know myself just yet

Days fall in to waste
Keep forgetting what is old or new

I lock on the target where I want to go
Talk about your complications now
Everything is fine but I scream to show
So it is you think you know
But I don´t even think i know myself

Make way to the facts and even up the scores

There she goes and there she goes
Hiding away from the rest of the world

Hiding away like a scared little girl

Thought I was breaking the bank.

Emmy Rossum,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to

To nights that never end?

To be cursed
And to do the very worst you can do.

And I knew yer.

At the museum display,
And you outshone the light
Under which you were bathed,
You could outshine the sky

To look back and wave,
Now that waving is all that you do.

Now, if I lose

I guess I will some day 
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way 

You ask me if I'll get along 
I guess I will some way 
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way 

God gave me that girl to lean on, then he put me on my own 
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone 
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way 

You ask me if I'll miss her kisses 
I guess I will every day

Emmylou Harris,"Hey pretty baby are you ready for me 
It's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee 
Well I'm just outta Austin bound for San Antone 
With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on 
There's a speed trap up ahead South of town 
But no local yokel's gonna shut me down 
Cause me and the boys got this rig unwound 
And we've come a thousand miles from the guitar town 

Nothin' ever happened round my home town 
And I ain't the kind to just hang around 
But I heard someone callin' my name one day 
And I followed that voice down the lost highway 
Everybody told me you can't get far 
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down 
And a rockin' little combo from the guitar town 

Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault 
Love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt 
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop 
Stumble in the restaurant, wonderin' why I don't stop 
Well I gotta keep rockin' while I still can 
Got a two-pack habit and a motel tan 
When my boots hit the boards it's a brand new hand 
Put my back to the risers and make my stand 
Hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight 
I'm loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight 
One of these days I'm gonna settle down 
And I'll take you back with me to the guitar town",Guitar Town,1992

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down
[Chorus: 2X]
Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something
[Chorus: 2X]
Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

For many long years I've played a lone hand 
I rode my horse in many strange lands 
Until one day I stopped for awhile 
For two blue eyes and a sunny smile 

So howl away you old coyote 
I hear your sad and lonesome song 
You're calling me back to old Montana 
Back to those hills where I belong 

One day I rode away from home 
I'm a' traveling back and it won't be long 
I'll see you again in a little while 
You're my darling sweet, my welcome smile 

So howl away you old coyote 
I hear your sad and lonesome song

One day the train was passin' 
I caught it comin' by 
To look this old world over under God's blue sky 
My darlin' stood there weepin' as I was looking back 
I kissed my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track 

Goodbye so long until I come back home 
You'll be my dream 
Goodbye so long, there's lots of places that I've never seen 
I'll always be a drifter but I'll be driftin' back 
To where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track 

I like to keep on goin' it helps me when I'm blue 
I get the urge to travel that's all I want to do 
I just can't settle down because I like to roam 
And when I hear that whistle blow I've gotta move along 

Goodbye so long there's something down the track keeps callin' me 
Goodbye so long I guess that's just the way I'll always be 
So when I get that feelin' don't try to hold me back 
I'd only leave you crying in that smoke along the track 

I know my baby loves me I love my baby too 
But he don't understand me when I'm feelin' blue 
And when I hear that whistle blow, I hurry home and pack 
And leave my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track. 

Goodbye, so long, I hate to leave you, but I've got to go 
Goodbye, so long, It's coming down just hear that whistle blow 
It'll be here in a minute, you'll wave and I'll look back 
I'm gonna leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track. 

Goodbye so long until I come back home 
You'll be my dream

And take him to that home on high

And come to you when I die

It calls and whispers through the pines
I know it's my sweetheart a calling
I hear him through the walls of time

And take him to that home on high

To be free

Of what she loved had all been sold

To the echoes that she holds

How could I tell her when she's fading
She run out of a place to be

And when I die I'm a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou

We went to church every Sunday we had a French speaking preacher man
Joked about the preacher man 'cause we thought he wore a dress, yes
After church we had a party we played the music on the phonograph
We had a man singing Jole Blon oh made a sinner out of me

I'm a Cajun born, I'm a Cajun bred
And when I die I'm a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou

Someone sort of like my Mama
'Cause I ain't know other kind, don't know other kind
Wherever fortune takes me, if it makes me or it breaks me
It's memories will forsake me, Louisiana on my mind

She arrives in all her splendor 
Each night at nine o'clock 
Her chariot is the crosstown bus 
That stops right down the block 
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in 
And the Queen of the Silver Dollar's home again 

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar 
She rules this smokey kingdom 
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne 
Now the jesters flock around her tryin' to win her favors 
To see which one will take the 
Queen of the Silver Dollar home 

Now her royal dress is satin 
It's shabby and it's torn 
The royal jewels are rhinestones 
The shoes are scuffed and worn 
Of the many roads she's been down, 
And the places that she's seen 
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen 

Now the Queen of the Silver Dollar 
Is not as haughty as she seems 
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams 
But there's a man who found her 
And he brought her to this world 
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl 

Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar

This run down mortaged Oklahoma farm
Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my mama
That he finally saved enough for us to go
California was his dream a paradise wall he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so
California cottonfields
Where labor camps were full of worried men with broken dreams
California cottonfields was as close to wealth as daddy ever came

Almost everything we had was sold or left behind
From daddy's plow and the fruit that mama canned
Some folks came to say farewell and see what all we had to sell
But some just came to shake my daddy's hand
The Model A was loaded down and California bound
And a change of luck was just four days away

Out with the gamblin' crowd

Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him and he blames her
Neither one is really quite sure which way it is

And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that takes a little ring
And breaks into pieces that'll never go together again

Cheatin' is a part of lovin' that starts
When true love isn't what lovers are lookin' for
A stranger here, a stranger there
You turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more

And lyin' at night when you're holdin' him tight
Somethin' that a cheater's heart is bound to learn
Cheatin' is the thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two unhappy people to the point of no return

And the worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids
Hangin' in the middle while mummy and daddy kiss

And the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose

Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee

With your hair messed up and your clothes don't fit you right

Emmylou Harris,"Come in as you tread life's journey 
Take Jesus as your daily guide 
Though you may feel pure and safely 
Without Him walking by your side 
But when you come to make the crossing 
At the ending of your pilgrim's way 
If you ever will meet our Savior 
You'll surely meet Him on that day 

Now look at that cold Jordan 
Look at these deep waters 
Look at that wide river 
Oh hear the mighty billows roar 
You'd better take Jesus with you 
He's a true companion 
For I'm sure without Him 
That you never will make it o'er 
 
That awful Day of Judgment 
Is coming in the by and by 
We'll see our Lord descending 
In Glory from on high 
So let us keep in touch with Jesus 
And in his grace the Love of God 
That we may be ever called ready 
When He calls us over Jordan's Tide 

Now look at that cold Jordan 
Look at these deep waters 
Look at that wide river 
Oh hear the mighty billows roar

When all the flowers were in bloom 
And like the flowers our love blossomed 
We married in the month of June

It warmed us as a golden glow 
We had sunshine in December 
And threw our roses in the snow 

Now God has taken my darlin' 
And left me with a memory 
A memory I will always cherish 
Are these last words he said to me

This morning is Monday where are you now 
Teasin' my memory teaching me how to lay low 
When I don't want to 
Well love is elusive this I know now 
It's making me crazy leaving me out 
In the open when I don't want to 

The moments of pleasures Never do last 
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past 
Long gone and in a hurry 

Baby, I can't go through this again 
I don't need to go down more then I've already been 
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town 
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now 

The second street beggars alone in their life 
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night 
Like I am They're just like I am

I don't need to go down more then I've already been 
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town

Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I'm gonna blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street

We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
>From the fire roads to the interstate
Now Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
And go racin' in the street
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I'm gonna blow 'em all out of their seats
Calling out around the world
We're going racin' in the street

He met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
He blew that Camaro off his back and he drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around his baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When he comes home the house is dark
She says 'Baby did you make it alright?'
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares out alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels

Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight tonight the highway's bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
Cause summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street",Racing in the Streets,1984

Too late now I find I care

Raised with a proud but a wandering heart

On the side of a mountain where her forefathers roamed

Last night I dreamed that I was a child 
Out where the pines grow wild and tall 
I was trying to make it home through the forest 
Before the darkness falls 

I heard the wind rustling through the trees 
And ghostly voices rose from the fields 
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path 
With the devil snappin' at my heels 

I broke through the trees, and there in the night 
My father's house stood shining hard and bright 
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms 
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms 

I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart 
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts 
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride 
From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light 

I walked up the steps and stood on the porch 
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door 
I told her my story, and who I'd come for 
She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore"" 

My father's house shines hard and bright 
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night 
Calling and calling, so cold and alone 
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned

Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die

There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there

Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us

I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough

I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked

And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me

I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me

Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep

Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me





",My Dear Companion,1987
Emmylou Harris,"This is how I learned it from a Time-Life Album in about 1958.

There's a little rosewood casket
Lying on a marble stand
And a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand

[Go and bring them to me sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes] I did not know this verse--Thanks!

Last Sunday I saw him walkin'
With a lady by his side,
And I thought I heard him tell her
He would never be his bride.

When I'm dead and in my coffin
And my shroud's around me bound
And my narrow grave is ready
In some lonely churchyard ground.

Take his letters and his locket
Place together o'are my heart
But the golden ring he gave me
From my finger never part



",Rosewood Casket,1987
Emmylou Harris,"Go to sleep you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rail humming
That's a hobo's lullaby

Do not think about tomorrow
Let tomorrow come and go
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all the wind and snow

I know the police cause you trouble
They cause trouble everywhere
But when you die and go to heaven
You won't find no policemen there

I know your clothes are torn and ragged
And your hair is turning grey
Lift your head and smile at trouble
You'll find happiness some day

So go to sleep you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Don't you feel the steel rail humming
That's a hobo's lullaby

",Hobo's Lullaby,1988
Emmylou Harris,"Just as far as I can remember
She'll remain the rose of my heart
Mama fell sick along in December
February brought us broken hearts

The reason we've not called a family reunion
We knew that she wouldn't be there
But now that we've thought it all over Mama
We know you're spirit is here

Oh no I can't forget the hours your the only one Momma
And sweeter than the flowers
Oh no there's no use to bother
To speak of you now would only hurt Father
Oh no momma we'll never forget you
And someday we'll meet you up there

We all gathered round and I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But this was one time we all had to face it
Though it hurt us so badly you know

Well it looked so good to see us together
But I had to look after dad
Oh no Mother when I passed by your casket
I didn't want to remember you dead",Sweeter Than the Flowers,1988
Emmylou Harris,"Every night it's the same
I feel your heart turn cold as rain
And know that you'll be gone again

You say you got to go downtown
I guess there's someone else you've found
So why you're still coming round
Heaven only knows

Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows

I've heard it said that talk is cheap
But still your words they cut so deep
Lay me crying in my sleep
And the pain just grows
I don't know who's right or wrong
But all we had is dead and gone
So why you keep me hanging on
Heaven only knows

Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows

I'm going to turn and walk away
There's nothing left for me to say
It wouldn't change things anyway
Though, I suppose
The love I gave was always true
Well, I don't know what else to do
And how I'll ever get over you
Heaven only knows

Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die

Where broken dreams and memories meet 
Where's this place called Lonely Street

Well I couldn't blame my darlin', and who could help fallin' 
In love with my darlin' so sweet 

Well it must be the fault of the Tennessee Waltz 
Wish I'd known just how much it would cost 
But I didn't see it comin', it's all over but the cryin' 
Blame it all on the Tennessee Waltz 

She goes dancin' with the darkness to the Tennessee Waltz 
And I feel like I'm falling apart 
And it's stronger than drink and it's deeper than sorrow

Emmylou Harris,"He was born in the Bitterroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water heading north and home again
Bringing a warm wind from the south
Bringing the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way

His mother's brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

On the eve of his 21st birthday he set out on his own
He was 30 years and running when he found his way back home
Riding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start

Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a John
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
And there was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

Now some say he was crazy and they're glad that he is gone
But some of us miss him and we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on

Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes

And the longest bridge I've ever crossed over Pontchartrain

We used to walk down by the river

I can hear my zydeco
And laissez le bon ton roulet
And take rides in open cars
My brother knows where the best bars are
Let's see how these blues'll do
In the town where the good times stay

Emmylou Harris,"I've been running low on inspiration
Tired of that physical intrigue
There's nothing left to imagination
Living in a world that treats love so carelessly
 
Don't want no smooth talkin' lover
I can't play the role
It just leaves me cold
 
I need a high powered love
I wanna feel that lightning streak
High powered love
Got to be down in the heart with me
 
Sometimes it's hard to keep believing
Too many pretty faces all skin deep
Is there anyone left with teeth just a little uneven
And won't spend more time with a mirror than me
 
If you're just looking for a good time
A notch on your gun
I ain't the one
 
I want a high powered love
Got to have intensity
High powered love
Don't start the fire if you can't take the heat
 
I can't turn back I'm on a mission
I know there's someone out there for me
 
I need a high powered love
One that'll defy gravity
High powered love
Got to be strong and keep on lifting me

Higher, higher, higher
High powered love
High powered love
 
Higher, higher, higher

I could tell a tale, I could make a spin
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night
Not only that I could tell you why

Back then I could really tel a lie
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick

I was takin' everything they had to give
It wasn't all that bad a way to live
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell
But no one's byuin' what I got to sell

I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day
But everyone just turns and walks away
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time

So I head across the road to drink some wine
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street
You're pretty good if I do say myself
But the guy that come through here last month he was sometin' else

Instead of allin' out for fire from above
He just gets real quiet and talks about love
And I'll tell you sometin' funny He didn't want nobody's money
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means

But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen
Well since that time every town is the same
I can't make a dime, I don't know why I came
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him

He has everyone convinced that he's for real
Well I figure we can work us out a deal
So he offers me a job and I say fine
He says I'll get paid off on down the line

Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done

And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul

There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost

Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear

And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I use to ride it like a rolling stone
Now just carry it alone

There's a highway risin' from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side

Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me home",Prayer in Open D,1993

But to sit next to you Lord I shiver and shake 
And if I knew love, well I don't think I'd be here 
Askin' myself if I had what it takes 
To melt your icy blue heart 

Should I start to turn what's been frozen for years 
Into a river of tears 
These days we all play cool calm and collected 
Our lips could turn blue just shooting the breeze 
But under the frost, wee thought he detected 
A warm blush of red, and the touch of her knee 
He said you're a beauty like I've never witnessed 
And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air 
I've felt the cold that can follow the first kiss 
And there's not enough heat in the fires burning there

The dirt was clay and was the color of the blood in me
A twelve acre farm on a ridge is southern Tennessee
We left that sweat all over that land behind a mule we watched grow old
Row after row trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't
Grow
There was one old store in the hollow we all called town
It belonged to a gentle old man named Henry Brown
He gave us credit in the wintertime so we could live through the cold when the
Wind brought snow
Trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
The one I loved walked through those fields with me
She was a hard working woman true as one could be
But then one year death was going 'round and swiftly took it's toll
Janie had to go
Now she lies asleep under ground so poor that grass won't grow
As I stand here looking over this part of Tennessee
The fields are bare as far as the eye can see
And over the grave where Janie lies there's a beautiful sight to behold
And no one knows why there's flowers blooming on ground so poor that grass
Won't grow



",Where Grass Won't Grow,1994
Emmylou Harris,"In the twilight glow, I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages, I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting

Emmylou Harris,"A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labour camp
Stand out in this memory I revived;
Cause my daddy raised a family there, with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes.
He dreamed of something better, and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just to young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below;
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try.
She only wanted things she really needed;
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size;
Just a little loss of courage, as their age began to show
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes.
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try.

You know they have fallen on

Never see a spark burn bright

Kept the names they've known

Soft as music, light as spray
Was a girl he learned it from
Living down Sonora way

He don't look much like a lover
But he says her love words over
Mostly when he's all alone
Mi amor mi corazon

On the nights that he would ride
She would listen for his spurs
Throw those big doors open wide
Raise them laughing eyes of hers

How those hours would get to flying
All too soon he'd hear her sighing
In her little sorry tone
Mi amor mi corazon

He ain't seen her since that night
He can't cross the line you know
They want him for a gamblin' fight
Like as not it's better so

Yet he's always sort of missed her
Since that last sad night he kissed her
Lost his heart, left her own
Adios mi corazon
Lost his heart, left her own

Well I work the double shift 
In a bookstore on St. Clair 
While he pushed the burning ingots 
In Dofasco stinking air 
Where the truth bites and stings 
I remember just what we were 
As the noon bell rings for 
Blackhawk and the white winged dove 

Hold on to your aching heart 
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips 
A small town hero never dies 
He fades a bit and then he slips 
Down into the blast furnace 
In the heat of the open hearth 
And at the punch clock he remembers 
Blackhawk and the white winged dove 

I remember your leather boots 
Pointing up into the sky 
We fell down to our knees 
Over there where the grass grew high 
Love hunters in the night 
Our faces turned into the wind 
Blackhawk where are you know 
Blackhawk and the white winged dove 
We were Blackhawk where are you know 
We were Blackhawk where are you know 

Do you still have the ring I gave you 
On the banks of Lake Bear 
Where I felt certain that I knew you

Another cup of muscatel 
Wrapped in the strong arms of the Union

Burned so hot I thought I'd died 
Thought I'd died and gone to Hell

I fell to my knees, and I looked to the sky 
I looked to the sky, and the spring rain fell 
I saw the water from a deeper well 

Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well
Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well

I was ready for love, I was ready for the money 
Ready for the blood and ready for the honey 
Ready for the winnin', ready for the bell

Found I had a thirst that I could not quell

Emmylou Harris,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet, flood every newborn seed
There's a dyin' voice within me, reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair

Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand

Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay

I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey, I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand

I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face

I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

And that tears are only rain to make love grow

The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and dreary

You make up your mind, you choose the chance you take 
You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks 
Out on through an open road you ride until the day 
You learn to sleep at night with the price you pay 

Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies 
And then with their last breath 
They built the roads they would ride to their deaths 
Driving on through the night unable to break away 
>From the restless pull of the price you pay 

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay 
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay 

Now they've come so far and they've waited so long 
Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong 
Where the dark of night holds back the light of the day 
And you gotta stand and fight for the price you pay 

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay 
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay 

Little girl down on the strand 
With that pretty little baby in your hands 
Do you remember the story of the Promised land 
How he crossed the desert sands 
And could not enter the Chosen Land 
On the banks of the river he stayed 
To face the price you pay 

So let the games start 
You better run you little wild heart 
You can run through all the nights and all the days 
But just across the county line 
A stranger passin' through put up a sign 
That counts so many fallen away 
To the price you pay,

I ran down Division Street

Down to the railroad track

There's four of them and I can't fight

I cut that boy and I never did look back

Like a bullet from a rabbit gun
Back home to my bed

Emmylou Harris,"I will twine and will mingle my raven black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with an emerald hue
The pale emanita and hyssop so blue
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
A blossom to cheer him through life's weary hour
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He left me no warning no words of farewell
I will dance I will sing and my life shall be gay
I will charm every heart in the crowd I will sway
Though my heart is now breaking he never shall know
How his name makes me tremble my pale cheeks to glow
Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And cherish me over all others above
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour

Emmylou Harris,"[Chorus:]
Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low as low can be

If I had a nickel I'd find a game
If I won a dollar I'd make it rain
If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfied

Legs to walk and thoughts to fly
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to die

So tell my baby I said so long
Tell my mother I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own
And tell my friends to mourn me none

I'm chained upon the face of time
Feelin' full of foolish rhyme
There ain't no dark till something shines
I'm bound to leave this dark behind

Underneath the silver maples, the balsams and the sky

Rested on the riverbank
And grew up by and by, and grew up by and by
Frail my heart apart
And play me a little shady grove
Ring the bells of rhymney
Till they ring inside my head forever
Bounce the bow, rock the gallows
For the hangman's reel
And wake the devil from his dream

Oh will they come back home some day

I'm lonesome for my precious children
They live so far away
Oh may they hear my calling, calling
and come back home some day

I gave my all for my dear children
Their problems still with love I share,
I'd brave life's storm, defy the tempest
To bring them home from anywhere

to guide them through this world of strife,

I stand with arms wide open
I've run a twisted line

I could not feel for the fear in my life

From across the great divide, In the distance I saw a light
Of Jean Baptiste's he's walking to me with the Maker
My body, my body is bent and broken by long and dangerous sleep
I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the Maker

Standing there with broken wings
I have seen the flaming swords
There over east of Eden

Barely noticed, hardly known
One day you´ll say my situation´s locked away
But by tomorrow you´re all alone

It seems so sudden, but it´s not, it´s only grown
From a scene that long ago was left
Forgotten in the snow
And has a way with slow surprises all its own

It´s hard to show, but like a boulder rollin´ slow
Or a rumble, deep in the ground
Things whisper low, and by the time I really know
What´s been movin´, they´ve settled down

Too late to see the way they´re shiftin´ round
Too late to say there´s bound to be another way
It´s all been said and done without a sound
This comes to me, and now that I begin to see

It´s not dramatic, it´s nothing grand
I used to be half of thje whole of you and me
Now I´m the limit of all I am
It seems so simple, nothin´ much to understand

For a break that would make it okay

And maybe empty
Oh, and weightless, and maybe

From this dark, cold hotel room

You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie

May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back

The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don't make no difference
Escape one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

And a siren wails in the night

And I can almost see through the dark there's light

And how long I've waited for your touch
If you know how happy you are making me

And hides his pain by acting proud
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him?

Let us dance beneath the moon
I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'
The morning always comes too soon
But tonight the war is over
He speaks to me in schoolboy French
Of a soldier's life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him

He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me 'neath the Paris skies

Tomorrow's soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard, too fast
He falls asleep, his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes, and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him

They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belgium and France the dead are everywhere
They die so, so fast there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory, old world fame
The old world's gone, gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh, I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing, nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them?

You who've been traveling so long
Yes, you who must leave everything 
That you cannot control
It begins with your family 
But soon it comes 'round to your soul
Well I've been where you're hanging 
And I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy 
Your loneliness says that you've sinned
Well they lay down beside me
I make my confessions to them
They touched both my eyes 
And I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf 
That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love 
That is graceful and green as a stem
When I left they were sleeping 
And I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights 
You can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous

And to answer the distant call
At the Western Wall
I've got a heart full of fear
And I offer it up on this altar of tears
Red dust settles deep in my skin
I don't know where it starts and where I begin
It's a crumbling pile of broken stones
It ain't much but it might be home

I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder
You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children
Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago
Michelangelo

Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning
And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing
And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So Far below
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk about you crying
For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago   
Michelangelo

Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender
And could you hear me calling out your name
Well I guess that I will never know
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping
And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago

For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair 
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers 
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair 

She left me a note that cried ""Do not weep for me 
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars 
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me 
Behold I am with you wherever you are""

They're circling low and inside tonight
It's another round in the losing fight
Out along the great divide tonight

We are aging soldiers in an ancient war
Seeking out some half remembered shore
We drink our fill and still we thirst for more
Asking if there's no heaven what is this hunger for?

Our path is worn our feet are poorly shod
We lift up our prayer against the odds
And fear the silence is the voice of God 

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

Sorrow is constant and the joys are brief
The seasons come and bring no sweet relief
Time is a brutal but a careless thief
Who takes our lot but leaves behind the grief

It is the heart that kills us in the end
Just one more old broken bone that cannot mend
As it was now and ever shall be amen

Emmylou Harris,"Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian.

She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.

She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound

She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian

She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in.
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't know end.
At least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only twenty seven and she had five kids.
Coulda' been the whiskey,
Coulda been the pills,
Coulda been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Names Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian.

Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt ground",Red Dirt Girl,2000

Your vow to let nobody near was your trinity

Now that you're gone another just won't do
I had my heart set on you

We were so young when we met
Sweet memories linger yet
You were the one who made my dreams come true
I had my heart set on you

As the years come and go does your heart mind
When you think of the girl you left behind
I still wear your ring 'cause when I said I do

I can be bad or I can be good
I can be any way that I feel

Might be a woman that's dressed in black
Be a hobo by the railroad track
I'll be gone like the wayward wind one of these days

One of these days it will soon 
be all over cut and dry
And I won't have this urge to go all bottled up inside
One of these days I'll look back and I'll say I left in time
'Cause somewhere for me I know there's peace of mind

I might someday walk across this land
Carrying the Lord's book in my hand
Goin' cross the country singin' loud as I can

But I won't have trouble on my back
Cuttin' like the devil with a choppin' axe,
Got to shake it off my back, one of these days

Are empty as your promise was

Emmylou Harris,"Was in the merry month of May
When all gay flowers were a bloomin',
Sweet William on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Said, ""You must come to my master's house,
If your name be Barbara Allen.""

So slowly, slowly she gets up,
And to his bedside going
She drew the curtains to one side
And says, ""Young man, you're dying.""

""I know, I'm sick and very low,
And sorrow dwells within me
No better, no better I never will be.
Til I have Barbara Allen.""

""Don't you remember last Saturday night
When I was at the tavern,
You gave your drinks to the ladies there
But you slighted Barbara Allen?""

He reached up his pale white hands
Intending for to touch her
She turned away from his bedside
And says, ""Young man I won't have you.""

He turned his cheek into the wall
And bursted out a crying
""What I do to thee I do to all
And I do to Barbara Allen.""

She had not walked and reached the town
She heard the death bells ringing
And as they rolled they seemed to say,
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen.""

""Oh Mother, oh mother go make my bed
Make it both long and narrow
Sweet William died for me today
I'll die for him tomorrow.""
Sweet William was buried in the old church yard

And Barbara there anigh him,
And out of his grave grew a red, red rose,
And out of hers, a briar.
They grew and grew to the old churchyard,

Where they couldn't grow no higher,
And there they tied in a true love's knot.
The rose wrapped around the briar.",Barbara Allen,2001
Emmylou Harris,"We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
He love like the leaves now has withered and gone.
The roses have faded, there's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry.
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand.
Oh, where has he gone to, oh, where can he be
He may have forsaken some other like me
He promised to honor, to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that he threw away.
The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance is starting to ""BAY""
I wonder, I wonder what he's thinking of
Forsaken, forgotten without any love.

With each new bridge you burned
I know you squandered some
But then from some you learned
And the point of rescue well
You passed that long ago
O but to hear you teil it was
Just another part of the show
O Evangeline your faith shone blind and true
We raise our glass and sing
Of you Evangeline

O Evangeline you with no kith or kin
The nights so hard and mean
You shed them like a skin
For you were always strong
When the bad slid down to worse
You still had that song
It was your blessing and your curse
But in your tongue
There is no word for home
There'll be no one
To roll away the stone
O Evangeline you have been a prisoner here
Bread and roses we shall bring
To you Evangeline

O Evangeline what are you fighting for
You stayed out in that ring
When nobody's even keepin' score
But round by round you earned
Your stumble into grace
Still with every turn the world
Becomes a sadder place
It swallows up the ones
You have loved the most
So you sleep with none
You wake with ghosts
O Evangeline
You have salted with your tears
Every lonely mile you've seen
through the years Evangeline

It's a fatal shore
You now wash upon
So weary of the war
And no longer young
O Evangeline your voice
Risin' sweet and clear
We close our eyes and dream
Of you Evangeline",O Evangeline,2003

Emmylou Harris,"He was a tall man
Raised up from the fields, out pickin' cotton 
In a hard land where the ground was poor and the wood was rotten 
But when he saw her 
All those bad times were forgotten 
And he believed, he believed

She was the strong hand
A good sister and a daughter
Lookin' for one man
To love the way that her mama'd taught her 
And when she saw him 
She thanked God for what he'd brought her she believed, she believed

And it's a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle 
Is all it took my brother
For I have seen them
As they walk this world together
And I believe, I believe

It's a sad thing
When one must leave the other 
And fly up where the voice rings 
Out with all the multitudes that gather 
But for a short while

Down here no song ever sounded sweeter 
And we believed, we believed

For it's a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
And I will see them
Someday they'll walk again together

For 15 years or more
He was still marching up and down that street
Just like he was a-walking a war
They called him the chief because he was Indian
It was a name they said behind his back
In the summer he'd march without any shoes 
Until the soles of his feet turned black 
'till the soles of his feet turned black

His hands wouldn't work the machinery
Cause his brain told him what to say
It's a hell of a life
But its somebody's life
Up and down the street all day

Honey have a look at the places 
Like a dog running on a track
The wheels keep on going as fast as you get there
You don't ever get to go back
I don't really know what I'm doing
Just watching myself in some play
And the actress looks like she wants to go home
And lie in bed all day
Yeah lie in a big bed all day

Her hands wouldn't work the machinery
Cause his brain tells him what to say 
It's a hell of a life
But its somebody's life
Up and down the street all day

Well I wish that you could see me when I'm flying in my dreams
The way I laugh there way up high
The way I look when I fly
The way I live

Beating close to mine
Pounding up against the stone and steel

With all this rain falling down

Strange how hard it rains now
Rows and rows of big dark clouds
When I'm holding on underneath this shroud
Rain

Its hard to know when to give up the fight
Two things you want will just never be right
Its never rained like it has to night before
Now I don't want to beg you baby
For something maybe you could never give

I just want another chance to live

To be Cinderella in an Alice movie

Can you still believe that life's a cabaret 
And fairy tales will carry you away
It's closing time and you're left on your own
And only you can find a way back home

You look for an answer in anyone's eyes
Reach out for lovers in too many beds
Reach for the needle but can't hold a thread 
Whiskey and roses fill your loving cup 
Leaving you empty when the sun's coming up

And you still believe that life's a cabaret 
And fairy tales will carry you away
When loneliness is the world you've ever known 
And only you can find the way back home

When they asked for volunteers
He got picked out by default
He was the only daddy there

Who stood right there and said

Not me, not me
No way with this job of mine
I could never find the time

Emmylou Harris,"If you walk away I walk away
First tell me which road you will take
I don't want to risk our paths crossing someday
So you walk that way I'll walk this way

And the future hangs over our heads
And it moves with each current event
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
Just stay in when it's lookin' this way

And the moon's laying low in the sky
Forcing everything metal to shine
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store case
They argue ""Walk this way"", ""No, walk this way""

And Laura's asleep in my bed
As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
""I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Baby, don't go away, come here""

And there's kids playing guns in the street
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up I say
""Enough is enough, if you walk away I walk away""
(And he shot me dead)

I found a liquid cure
For my landlocked blues
It will pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon

And the world's got me dizzy again
You'd think after twenty-two years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away

I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
If you love something give it away

A good woman will pick you apart
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
But you may be offended and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away

We made love on the living room floor
With the noise in the background from a televised war
And in the deafening pleasure I thought I heard someone say
If we walk away, they'll walk away

But greed is a bottomless pit
And our freedom's a joke we're just taking a piss
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
If you're still free start runnin' away
'Cause we're comin' for ya

I've grown tired of holding this pose
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Sayin' let me walk away, please

You'll be free child once you have died
From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away

So I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoes
I just want to make a clean escape
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where to",Landlocked Blues,2005

Clocked up beneath the clouds

Clocked up above the clouds

I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder

You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children

Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago
Michelangelo

Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning

And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing

And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So far below
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you laid dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk above you crying

For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago
Michelangelo

Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender

And could you hear me calling out your name
Well, I guess that I will never know

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping

And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago

Too long baby too long
Checking out of Donkey Town
So long, so long, so long

Her pretty eyes are pretty still
But Jim's got a kind of a squint Yeah
I dug up my last check from out of the mine
Now I feel like I've done my stint
Jim got an army pension
When he walked from the military court
No body ever mentioned
The medical report

She does little things for me
She likes to get the both of us high. Yeah
She says I'm a tender-hearted man
Prince charming,yeah, sure, I'm the guy
He likes the wrecker's dogs on chains
And the smoke from the company fires
Diesel oil in the trucks and cranes
And the smell of burning tires

But I've been around in Donkey Town
Too long, baby ,too long
Checking out of Donkey Town
So long, so long, so long

There's a purple heart in a silver tin
And a grey .45 in a drawer
Most of the time you can drink with him
But some other time he's just sore
On days when she says she can't think straight
Or she feels like she's getting the jumps
She'll go shoot off her .38
At cans on a Donkey Town dump

It was Friday late and she crossed those legs
She told me flat out she would. Yeah
If I could pull up my trailer pegs
We could get away together for good
I sure wish her the best of luck
She's going to need it thinking of Jim
I don't like to leave her stuck

And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin' on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin' every song the radio played
Waitin' for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town 
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian.

She loved her brother I remember back when 
He was fixin' up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin' there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin' somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.
	
She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl 
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing 
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound

She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian

She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in. 
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't know end. 
At least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only 27 and she had five kids.
Could'a been the whiskey,
Could'a been the pills, 
Could'a been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world 
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Names Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian.

I can't do everything but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

All I do is keep the beat and the rock 'n' roll company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme

And with all the invitations sent
The young bride went away
When the groom saw people passing notes

Not unusual, he might say
But where are the flowers for my baby
I'd even like to see her mean old mama
And why ain't there a funeral, if you're gonna act that way

I hate to tell you how he acted when the news arrived
He took some friends out drinking and it's lucky they survived
'Cause he told them everything there was to tell there along the way
And he felt so bad when he saw the traces of old lies still on their faces

So why don't someone here just spike his drink
Why don't you do him in some old way
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day

The Reverend Dr. William Grace
Was talking to the crowd
All about the sweet child's holy face and
The saints who sung out loud

And he swore the fiercest beasts
Could all be put to sleep the same silly way

She only knew she loved the world

And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you

'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do (pick for me James)

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh but I remember something you once told me

Like a scene from a costume hall
Decked out in the colors in Europe
And on fire with the hope of it all

There stood my father's own father stood huddled
With the tired and hungry and scared
Turn of the century pilgrims
Bound by the dream that they shared

They were standing in lines just like cattle
Poked and prodded and shoved
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom
Some were were torn from someone they love

Through this sprawling tower of babel
Came a young man confused and alone
Determined and bound for America
And carrying everything that he owned

Sometimes when I look in my grandfather's immigrant eyes
I see that day reflected and I can't hold my feelings inside
I see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life
So don't take it for granted say grandfather's immigrant eyes

Now he rocks and stares out the window
But his eyes are still just as clear
As the day he sailed through the harbor
And come ashore on the island of tears

I was once a broken fool

I could work on any line
I could tend and make any diesel sing

Well I met my wife to be
Through my mother's best friend's son
She had been a bar room singer
She was as good as anyone
But I ask her to stop singing
And the girl she did not flinch
Next day she went and bought that man
A brand new crescent wrench, ohh
A brand new crescent wrench

We had three fine children
As eight years went on by
And earned a silver visor
The knuckles stayed bone dry
But after supper I kept hearin' her
By the kitchen radio
Singing sweet but desperate harmony
A little bit to low, ohhh
A little bit to low

She left three months later
I'd just come home for lunch
Note said ""easy come, hard go""
I still love you so much
She said I don't know if I'll be there
Or if you'll want me when I come
But if and when that Abbott steer
You better

And the stars have lost their shine
And I have been forsaken,
By everything I thought was mine
For in the darkest hour,
When the final story's told

No matter how bright I glittered, baby,
I could never be gold

You gave up your finest treasure,
For the one you saw in me
But how could I know the measure,
Of all you needed me to be
Though I came with sweet intentions,
More my pockets could not hold

No matter how bright I glittered, baby,

The ways you said I let you down
When I fell into that river of no return,
And you watched me drown
Oh I could sparkle like a diamond,
Have silver line my soul

I could never be gold

I tried so hard to show the way

How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
The orphan girl he would love so long
In the end he knew she'd been his finest hour
And all he has left of her is a song

He first saw her
Standing by a cabin door
Her song was ringing
Out in a voice so strong and sure
To the lonesome valley
He bring her there to be his bride
Where they would live and work together
Side by side

She was his sunshine
She was his moon and morning star
His words would ring to
The chords of her guitar

He was driven
And lost to her for days and days
'Til the lonesome valley
Finally drove her far away

I'll never swim Kern River again,
It was there that I met him,
There that I lost my best friend.
Now I live in the mountains
I drifted up here with the wind.
And I may drown in still water,
But I'll never swim Kern River again.

He grew up in an oil town
But that gusher never came in.
And the river was a boundary
Where my darling and I used to swim.
One night in the moonlight,
The swiftness swept his life away.
Now I live on Lake Shasta,
And Lake Shasta is where I will stay.

There's the South San Joaquin
Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found.
And theres a place called Mt. Whitney
From where the mighty Kern River comes down.
Now it's not deep nor wide,
But it's a mean piece of water my friend.
And I may cross on the highway,
But I'll never swim Kern River again.

Goodnight old world
Old world goodnight

You fell from the heavens 
Right into this sad place
Remembering God for a while in your dreams
And you look to me now 
And I greet the new day
With the eyes of a child 
At the wonder you bring

So goodnight old world
See you tomorrow
We rise with the sun
Fall with the sparrow

Just feel like callin' it a day

Doomed and determined to go there
It seems I never get far

Emmylou Harris,"I live out here in the wind and the pouring rain
Somewhere between 14th Avenue and Main
In the summer heat, the winter's freezing snow
You see I got nowhere else to go

Got no home sweet home
Into this world, some are bound to roam
And it's long hard road we've known
On the way to home sweet home

People pass by, they don't see me here
And if they do they wish I would disappear
I guess they know way down deep in their bones
It could be them out there lookin' for a home
For a home

Oh to have a place to lay my head
A crumb or two for my daily bread
Perhaps someday
A kind soul will come along

The days are growing shorter
The years are going faster
And time is flying by 
I wake up in the morning
And before I even notice
The sun is going down
And I'm left to wonder why

I'm a lonely girl in a lonely world
I never thought my life would be like this
To have no one to hold my hand
And feel once more a sweet caress

I'd give it my best effort
Love is always worth it
But even if I try
I might still end up alone
It may not be in me
To take what love could give me
Some of us are better off
To make it on our own

As a lonely girl in a lonely world
And though my life has been so blessed
I have no one to hold my hand
And feel once more a sweet caress

I've had my share of lovers
And cared for many others
I always thought there'd be
Another one to come along
But if love can't find me again
I'll put it all behind me then
I'll just go and learn to sing
Another sad love song

About a lonely girl in a lonely world
She never dreamed her life would be like this
To have no one to hold her hand
And feel once more a sweet caress",Lonely Girl,2011
Emmylou Harris,"I was born a black boy
My name is Emmett Till
I walked this earth for fourteen years
Then one night I was killed
For speaking to a woman
Whose skin was as white as dough
That's a sin in Mississippi
But how was I to know

I'd come down from Chicago
To visit with my kin
Up there I was a cheeky kid
I guess I always been
But the harm they put upon me
Was too hard for what I done
For I was just a black boy
I never hurt no one

They took me from my uncle's house
Mose Wright was his name
He'd later stand and without hesitation
Point the blame
At the ones who beat and cut me
And shot me with a gun
Then threw me in the river
Like I was trash when they were done

I was sent back to my mother
At least what was left of me
She kept my casket open
For the whole wide world to see
The awful desecration
And the evidence of hate
You could not recognize me
The mutilation was so great

There came a cry for justice then
To be finally fulfilled
All because of me, a black boy
My name is Emmett Till

But I'd have rather lived
'Til I was too old to die young
Not miss all I left behind
All that might have come
The summer clouds above my head
The grass beneath my feet
The warmth of a good woman
Her kisses soft and sweet

Perhaps to be a father
With a black boy of my own
And watch him grow into
A kinder world than I had known

Where no child would be murdered
For the color of his skin
And love would be the only thing
Inside the hearts of men

They say the horror of that night
Is still haunting heaven still
Where I am one more black boy
My name is Emmett Till",My Name Is Emmett Till,2011
Emmylou Harris,"My Lord how the rains came down
The waters made a mighty sound
When the levees broke that day
Washin' all those souls away
The whole world stood to watch us drown
But we took it to a higher ground

It takes more than a hurricane
To empty out the Pontchartrain
Long ago we broke the chains
In New Oreleans New Orleans
When Brother Bill and Sister Nell
Are singing like a ringing bell
Then you'll know all is well
In New Orleans New Orleans

Bring it all, fire and flood
Fill the rivers up with mud
To cut and run ain't in our blood
We are New Orleans

So baby let the life roll on

Emmylou Harris,"Ridin' on her bicycle to school
A little girl out breakin' all the rules
She don't care about the birds and the bees
She's too busy skinnin' both her knees
With the arms of a loving childhood
Wrapped around her
All the wonders of the world surround her
And with the angels up above her soul to keep
In her bed down here below she falls asleep

She don't need nobody
She don't need nobody
She don't need nobody now

All grown up and livin' on her own
She goes to work and then comes home alone
But she believes someday her prince will come
There's a lot of life to go at twenty one
With nothing but her faith in love to guide her
She'll follow the young heart that beats inside her
Walk right through that door and bet it all
Confidant she can take the fall

She's ready for somebody
She's ready for somebody
She's ready for somebody now

As the years go by
The woman's not so sure
She feels an ache inside
That seems to have no cure
How did life get so long
Does no one ever stay
Was the dream of one true love
Just lost along the way
But she believes she has so much to give
Is there any other reason why we live

She stills want somebody
She stills want somebody
She stills want somebody now

Now that little girl is growing old
All of her sad stories have been told
But there are no regrets, she'll place no blame
She knows for everyone it is the same
Even when the well runs dry and the bread's unleavened
And she wonders if there really is a heaven

And wraps her empty arms around the world

Emmylou Harris,"I can still remember 
Every song you played
Long ago when we were younger 
And we'd rock the night away
How could I see your future then 
Where you would not grow old
With such a fire in our bellies
Such a hunger in our souls.

I guess I probably loved you 
When those words rolled off your tongue
It seemed that we were travelin'
Under some ol' lucky sun

I know I couldn't save you 
And no one was to blame
But the road we shared together once 
Will never be the same

Hey, hey gonna fly away
Won't be coming round today
Hey, hey with a song I pray
And on the wings of a song I'll fly away.

I wandered in the wilderness 
For a while I was so lost
To everything there is a season 
And every blessing has it's cost
So I took what you left me 
And put it to some use
Went looking for an answer 
With those three cords and the truth

I come down from the mountain 
I come walkin' in your shoes
I was taken for a gambler 
When I had no more to lose

'Cause you put me on that pathway 
How could I refuse?
And I spend my whole life out here 
Workin' on the blues

So I carried on. 
You can't be haunted by the past.
People come and people go. 
And nothing ever lasts.
But I still think about you 
Wonder where you are
Can you see me from some place 
Up there among the stars

But down here under heaven 
There never was a chart
To guide our way across 
This crooked highway of the heart
And if it's only all about 
The journey in the end
On that road I'm glad I came to know 
My old friend.

Beale Street was jumping the day you were born
W.C. Handy was blowing his horn
From the bluffs to Mud Island
The music grew quiet
Mystery train put a hush on the night
Fireflies made light of the hot summer breeze
And the wind was a whisper through the tops of the trees
Rain started falling
The river grew lazy
Bring it on home child you're making us crazy

We've got hot buttered biscuits
And dewberry pie
White-flour gravy
In an endless supply
Cucumber salad right out of the ground
And cold soda water just to wash it all down
But down on the Delta
Where cotton is king
We only want to treat you like a homecoming queen
Tomorrow comes early
It's never too late
The whole damn town is gonna open the gate

And sat down in the grass by the old homestead
I listened to the song of the cicadas
And thought about the one whose hair was red

This is where she gave birth to my father
Back when she was just a newly wed
You wouldn't know it looking at this picture
That her eyes were blue, hair was red

You wouldn't know she traveled far and wide
You wouldn't know she lived here all her life
There is so much you'll never know about her
So much left to say that's left unsaid

But I have got this picture in my memory
And her eyes are blue, her hair is red

Were baby blue, and was hair

Higher mountains
Deeper valleys
Longer rivers
Stand between us now
I could climb that jagged peak
I could cross that great divide
If I knew that you'd be waiting
For me on the other side

The days pass by my window now
Oh, but nights like these are rough
I can feel you in my heart
But that's not close enough
If I could hear you breathe again
The comfort of your sigh
I'd gladly trade tomorrow in
On one more last goodbye

You'd never know that it was christmas eve.
The billboards and the neon took the place of silver bells,
And the temperature is 84 degrees.
I can hear the traffic on the crowded strip below
As the palm trees poke their heads above the scene
There's not a single reindeer and it hardly ever snows,
And santa drives a rolls royce limosine.

But all along the rockies you can feel it in the air
From telluride to boulder down below
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere
Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow

I remember christmases when I was just a boy
In the morning I would run to see the tree.
And the carolers on the hillside sang their songs of christmas joy
Well, I always thought they sang them just for me.
Now the sun is setting in the california sky
And I can't find the spirit anywhere
So I think it's time for me to tell los angeles goodbye

Emmylou Harris,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago

Maybe death awaits me in El Paso
