 A nuff a dem deh pussy deh nuh like we cause we nice

 And fire fi di man weh eat di pussy like a rice,

 And if dem think wi done wi ago give dem a surprise,

Dropping lyrics like some waiter, I was sitting on the shitter
Hit you right in the kisser, popped like a blister
Making moves on the track, check mate Bobby Fisher
You mad at me
Mad at me, like I valeted your sister
Drove her like a weapon
And I tipped her, just picture
This a vicious one, I'm on a mission son
This my kitchen stop you bitching 'till the dishes done

Ward Baxter,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2006
Ward Marston,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

You were mine, and we were rare

I give, I give, I give you never take
I bend, I bend, I bend so we won't break

I've been doing cartwheels anything to save us
Anything to make you notice me
I've been running circles always getting nowhere
Putting on a show, but you won't see
I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels

Bright as a sparkler light
I write our names across your night
It's only me who sees it fade away

Into shame that I can't keep you honest
Blame that you don't even want this
Love is not enough to make you stay

I give, I give, I give you never take it
I still, I still, I still believe we'll make it

I've been running circles always getting nowhere
Putting on a show, but you won't see
I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels, oh

After everything I've done you still run and disappear
Maybe all I've got is hoping I can show you how it feels

Ward Williams,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When You're Gone,2006

This society don't care about nobody else
I've got to be strong

Even if I know this world is meant to share

Wait a minute, this is wrong
Even the birds still sing their faithful song
And your beauty lies within you
Look in the mirror baby
Look in the mirror baby

What you gonna do when your friends have gone away and deserted you
You'll have to be strong
24 hours can seem so long
You're taught to not care
And then not realize this world is meant to share

Wait a minute, this is wrong
Even the birds still sing their faithful song
And your beauty lies within you
Look in the mirror baby
Look in the mirror baby

We've got to stand up for ourselves
Even if a leader so cold wants to glory himself
We've got to be strong
Even if our reasons seem wrong
We've got to not care
Even if the world we know may not even
Be here

Hold it! It's wrong
Even the birds still sing their faithful song
And your beauty lies within you

Look in the mirror baby

You know I'd do almost anything you want
Hey, I try to give you everything you need
I'll see that it gets to you

Warda,"You've got that look again
The one I hoped I had when I was a lad
Your face is just beaming
Your smile got me boasting, my pulse rollercoastering
Anyway the four winds that blow
They're gonna send me sailing home to you
Or I'll fly with the force of a rainbow
The dream of gold will be waiting in your eyes
You know I'd do most anything you want
Hey I, I try to give you everything you need
I can see that it gets to you

I don't believe in may things
But in you I do

Her faith is amazing
The pain that she goes through contained in the hope foryou
Your whole world has changed
The years spent before seem more cloudy than blue
In many ways your baby's controlling
When you haven't laid down for days
For the poor no time to be thinking
They're too busy finding ways
You know I'd do most anything you want
Hey I, I try to give you everything you need
I'll see that it gets to you
I don't believe in many things
But in you I do

You know I'd do most anything you want
Everyday I, I try to give you everything you need
We'll always be there for you
I don't believe in many things
But in you I do","Ya Saeedy (Oh, My Master)",1997
Warda,"How could I fall for someone so superficial

Funny how the things that you can never have
Need you more
Tired of standing in the rain
Praying for sunshine again

I remember your eyes
Wish I could see through them
How could I fall
If I could

Our love was like the wind
We blew it away
Tired of dealing with your games
Praying I'll never need you again

I remember your eyes
Wish I could see through them
We could have loved so much
Why didn't we try make it right
Would it have been enough
If I could

I remember your eyes
Wish I could see through them
How could I fall

With weapon in hand the manhunt begins no rest til the job is complete
No right and no wrong only dead or alive a target a prize to be won
If the money's enough then there's no place to hide just one more notch in a gun

Bullets and blades the tools of your trade
The weapons of death surround you
Your reason your rhyme your partners in crime
Your hands are still stained with their life
All it takes is a twist of your knife

For women and children you hold no remorse your price is the same for them all
No guilt no fear no time for a thought no name just a face no one saw
The last one was easy a woman of worth no charge for a lover's revenge
A slug in the skull and its over for her but for you there is never an end

The body was found in one week's time her legs in an alley downtown
Head with a bullethole still in the side in a cardboard coffin was found



",Bullets & Blades,1986

Twisted mess a tortured soul
Mutant brain a does not lie recording fear in your eyes
Future shock from the past

It's coming for you it's waiting for you
It's hiding on you don't want to know what for
To penetrate you a seed inside you
To produce through you ten thousand more
Breathing poison dripping slime abomination living crime
Reeking evil glowing eyes
Tracking blood scent of man prehistoric neuro-scan
Inbred weapons he relies

Feeling strange deep within, can't remember where you've been
Bruised and bleeding sore inside
Feel your body's about to burst ravaged by a deadly thirst
Breaking out in sickening sores



",Humanoid,1986
Wargasm,"He's on a rampage he's on the run more hell bent than you've ever seen
Tryin' to hell him that he's got no right is like putting out fire with gasoline
Crystal clear in his own warped mind hears voices screaming in his ear
Explosion in a nest of nerves satisfaction lurking ever near

Til he wound up knee deep in blood

The wound up spring inside his skull snapped and left him numb
He's at the end of sanity's rope the time to collect has come
He feels the need to right a wrong revenge is what he hungers for
His choice of weapons his own bare hands he's out for blood to even the score

Eye for eye tooth for tooth do or die seek the truth
Conscience clear your wires crossed won the war but the battle's lost

He's plotting his crime with stealth and care his mind is humming and
Spinning 'round
He won't fail he was driven insane his enemy deserves underground
A crime of passion turned to pain pushed him over the edge
His eyes show him only one thing flashing blades exploding lead

Eye for eye tooth for tooth do or die seek the truth
Conscience clear your wires crossed won the war but the battle's lost
Fulfilling his goal his vision clears the scream in his head subsides
One thing left to complete the tale to take one more life he decides
A suicide of stealth and care his mind in humming and spinning 'round

Cannot buy another hour or bargain for a day

It doesn't matter that I've lived my life like I knew I should
In the cards before my birth did me no good
There is no light now up ahead no open arms wait
To live long and prosper was not my fate

The line that holds you tight to life is a thin one indeed
The hand the blade it's cut in two with terminal speed
A step to turn his eyes move in from out of sight
No name no face the time is now to shoot out your lights

Never gave a warning sign just appeared there
No time to understand body cold with fear
I'm being dragged down a gaping hole they're clawing at me
Smoke fills my aching lungs my eyes cannot see

Now the walls are coming down I'm losing my grip
Colors fade they run and bleed I'm on a bad trip
Cannot move cannot make a sound the foul stench of death
Now inhale the ancient air feel the reaper's breath



",Sudden Death,1986
Wargasm,"Without warning without name tearing through the ground they came
No tomb will hold them coffins crack earth is spewing bodies back
Cemeteries once were filled ancient curse is now fulfilled
One thousand years of tortured screams

Corpses fill the city streets the walking dead their sleep has ceased
Claiming souls the undead march they're marching on with undead hearts
Human targets living flesh tied and chained they die best
The dead they don't stay down for long

Tonight man's fate is sealed tonight the end is revealed
Invincible they will prevail immortal armies will not fail
Weapons will do no good they don't die like they should
Invincible they will prevail immortal armies will not fail

As darkness falls across the world the undead disease cannot be cured
Building armies burning down seizing cities all around
Smoke and dust and bodies rise victims taken by surprise
The living must be made undead

All hope is gone no chance to win we're now undead we're giving in
Memories of life before waking dreams an all out war
Death is not the living end to die is to being again
We will not stop we know no pain



",Undead,1986
Wargasm,"Soldier punches the code opens the airlock with ease
Sealing himself from the world turning computerised keys
Nuclear missile a top secret course a target no one will know
Climbs down the ladder a cold iron rail

Watching the clock on the wall ticking the seconds away
Reading emergency codes reads the same ones every day
Checking his firearm to see if its loaded it is but what the hell for
Nothing and no-one under the sun could ever get through that door

Guardian of the great war machines keeper of pain destroyer of dreams
Watching the screens silently screams

There's someone else in here with him now he feel's he's no longer alone
Although no one's able to get in but him ""I swear I just heard someone moan""
The smell of a burning jungle now is starting to fill up the room
You recognize the figure of the captain now
A shambling shadow of doom
You fought together in the forests and fields and fields only one of
You made it to the hill
His voice is like dirt and dead rotting leaves ""this is not a drill""

Pull the trigger push the button
Flip the switch it's all or nothing
Light the fuse pull the lever
Set the snare it's now or never

Send the bastard up get moving now I order you to start the war
We will be the spark that sets the world ablaze mankind is on the edge no more

Leaning over his shoulder the casualty stares through black holes
Watching the video screens vengeance burns hot through it's soul
Starting the sequence by punching the code the password is just one word-burn
Time to abort is fading so fast from now on there is no return

Rumblings started below shaking the base to the core
Smoking the missile is ready to start the procession of war
Holding the gun to his own throbbing head his hands find it hard to keep still
Looks his dead friend in the eye and screams ""you bastard this is not a drill""



",Wargasm,1986
Wargasm,"Nothing lives nothing breathes a silent wind will blow
A darkness lies upon this land sent to us from below
A nothingness no one will see a terminated sky
A deadly pall of glowing grey nothing left to die

War after war in the homeland bomb versus bomb in the sky
A curse upon the earth itself a planet too can die
A race for control of the planet idiots ordering war
Multiple megaton pile-up knowing too well what they're for

A mutant race of tortured souls of warped flesh and bone
Inhabit this dead planet now a lifeless slab of stone
A stinking cloud lingers here we cower in our caves
We care not where the future lies atomic zombie slaves

Do you remember long before your mutant mind was born
Your memories are a murky mist from your mind they've been torn
Kill them all survival first your instincts taking hold
Protect what's yours collect some more a circle now unfolds

And centuries of pain
And hopelessness and misery

Forgiven when you cross yourself

Hart zerschmettern, Junge, glaub mir!
Es wird nicht lustig, wenn der Spaß einmal begonnen hat
Ich fliege über dein Bataillon, Junge, und lasse meine Bomben ab
Nenn mich Achilles, weil ich alleine die Schlacht schlage
Gegen deine komplette Stadt
Der letzte Samurai im Dschungel des Asphalts
Junge, nenn mich Ghost Dog, ich mach jeden von euch kalt!

Wrapped in mother's wine and sheets

Dreaming of forbidden treats

When uniforms on night time beats ask me
Where I'm going and what I eat
I answer them with a voice so sweet

I can't come down till it's plain to see
I can't come down, I've been set free
Who you are and what you don't
Make no difference to me

Well, someone trying to tell me where it's at
And how I do this and why I do that
With secret smiles like a Cheshire cat
And little wings like a vampire bat

I fly away to my cold water flat
And eat my way to a bone of fat
And I say to the man with the funny hat

They say I'll be good to lose my grip
My hold on reality is starting to slip
To tell me to got off with this trip
The say its like a sinking ship

Life is sweet it's too warm to sip
And if I drink, I'll chuck and flip
I'll just say as I take a nip

Oh, I dream of cotton seas
And granite walls and redwood trees
And ugly eye that only sees
Endless mirrors and infinite me's

And drank from the chalice they shared

Prepare for the time it has come
Look to the heavens! a crack in the sky

Deliver us from all the hatred
Deliver us from all the sin
And we who believe will eternally sing
These words in which we call the battle hymn!

",Deliver Us from Evil,1993
Warlord,"She came to me I thought I found her
The girl of all my dreams
And until then I did not know what
Happiness could bring
We laughed we cried side by side
The summers turned to years
But winter came the skies have grayed
From happiness to tears

She said she would never leave me
Never let me go
But now she's left with me this feeling
So sad and so alone
She went away I tried to find her
I cried aloud her name
I realized it was goodbye
The heartache and the pain

Why did she go away and leave me with the heartache
Why did she leave me with the pain
If I could tell her so I'd tell her that I love her
And all my dreams have gone away
These Lost and Lonely Days

If you could feel the way I feel about you
Hear the things I say
If you could see the way I am without you

",Lost and Lonely Days,1993
Warlord,"It comes through the heavens, on a mission from hell
A force of destruction, that nothing can repel
A story is born that no one will live to tell

The obliteration of man, now encased in its shell
At the push of a button, we all will go to hell
Who will be left to toll the funeral bell . . .

The Hammer will Fall on you!
The Hammer will Fall on you!

Devastation, destruction of all the nations
Annihilation, clouding of all the skies
Raise the dead from their graves, and throw in yourselves and hide

Save us - from ourselves
Save us - from ourselves
Save us - from ourselves
Save us - from ourselves
Save us . . .

But times have changed for this old man, the story makes you cry

Now the nights are getting colder, can you lift a hand
Soon to die, I'm growing older, help me if you can

Just a Penny for a Poor Man
A poor man, yes I am . . .
Just a Penny for a Poor Man

An honest man with a heart of gold, stricken by his luck
All alone, not a single friend, and no one to love

If you had no food or shelter, just a place to stand
Would you ask for some assistance, would you need a hand?

Just a Penny for a Poor Man
A poor man, yes I am . . .
Just a Penny for a Poor Man

Will he live until tomorrow, or will he die today?
Can you feel the grief and sorrow that this song portrays?

Now you say you are a rich man, well show us what you have!
If your heart holds any riches, lend a helping hand . . .

Like a knife it tears me apart
My tears they shed I have no one

Nobody with love they can share

I lock the door and I cry!

She lay in white like a dream unending, the saddened clouds they cried . . .

Tears for all the joy we had
Tears for all the pain
All the years I have to live

Showed me what love could bring

I begin to sing . . .

Warlord,"The morning has come with the dawn of the sun,
And the masses arise to the day.
They meet their despair in pointless travail,
Lost in the eyes of the world where Death is the stage.

For Mammon they live, to themselves they will give,
Of treasure and gluttonous pride.
To Self they bow down, they worship their crown,
Alive in the eyes of the world, but Death lives inside.

Arise, my friends, arise!
The sword is the spirit of life,
Awaken your souls, that you may never die!

And almost stop the earth

To see the silence break on New Year's Eve
We're only 17
So if love exists I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Just one more kiss
To soothe the pain exists
In a world of lies
Misery take my shame and life

And everything fails a violent death
The smile you gave
Visit me in hell tonight
And say, ""If love exists, I will fall?

When our lips collide
Almost stop the earth

Must it be forever inside of me,

Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would, would you?
And so all else above

To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Entr'acte (Look to the Rainbow) [*],2004

I would give you the world right now on a silver platter

But there's one thing I want you to know

You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about

When I awoke this a mornin' the rain was a pouring down
I was gonna wed the little river girl just over the bridge across town
Now I'm a runnin' up and down the river and my nerves are driving me wild
Cause the bridge washed out I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
Oh rain oh rain stop fallin' dark clouds hurry from the sky
The preacher and my bride are waitin' and the weddin' bells are startin' to chime
I can't kiss and hold her and it's drivin' me out of my mind
Cause the bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side

Yeah I got one foot in the river one foot solid on the ground
I try to swim that ragin' ol' river but I know if I try I'd drown
There's not a boat around me they walked on out with the tide
And the bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
Yeah rain oh rain stop fallin'...

Late into the night you wore off that fever.

Turned by the seasons and long days gone.
Too many minds in my, I don't know

Colored into a color never seen
A sun so full arises

True feeling runs across my chest
In my silence there's a color I never see

Dance above the clouds
Hold my world to something (hold my world to something)
Better make a sound

I found it, moved it alone

Her heart, her heart, her heart believe in love

Is getting caught up between myself
But it's destroying me
Into the color that you're making me

I'm sinking in your sea
Of insecurity

And do I love you, yes I do
But I love my own life too

As I lay here, holding your hand
I can't help but fell you don't understand
The tighter you hold on
The more that it's feeling
Like quicksand

You're holding too tight to my heart
It's gonna burst and leave an empty space

Because I don't talk in cliches that people try to use to stroke us

If you want a place in this rat race I say run out and join the circus
If you look inside my head
You will see things that you probably shouldn't see
Because my outside is off-center
But I guarantee it's stranger inside of me
Have you ever felt like pulling your insides out
Cause they're burning
You feel caged like an animal that wants to fuck
And you're yearning for something strange, unexpected
Unexplainable to happen
That either kills you, leaves you hurt or makes it hard to stop from laughing

There's a bottomless hole
I wish I could get back
An ounce of control

We bear no scar in our conscience
Clean and smooth

As our eyesight fades with age
We put on horn-rimmed glasses
And we work our lives away
Buy the pearl
Sell the world

Warrant,"Just for the record
Lets get the story straight
Me and Uncle Tom were fishing
It was getting pretty late
Out on a cypress limb
Above the wishin' well
where they say it got no bottom
Say it take you down to hell
Over in the bushes
And off to the right
Come two men talkin
In the pale moon light
Sheriff John Brady and Deputy Hedge
Haulin' two limp bodies
Down to the water's edge

I know a secret down at
Uncle Tom's Cabin, oh yeah
I know a secret that
I just can't tell

They didn't see me and Tom
In the trees
Neither one believing
What the other could see
Tossed in the bodies
let 'em sink on down
To the bottom of the well
Where they'd never be found

CHORUS
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin
Know who put the bodies in the wishing well

Soon as they were gone
Me and Tom got down
Pray' real hard
That we wouldn't make a sound
Runing throught he woods
Back to Uncle Tom's shack
Where the full moon shines
Through the roof tile cracks

Oh my God, Tom, who are we gonna tell
The sheriff he belongs in a prison cell
Keep your mouth shut
That's what we're gonna do
Unless you wanna wind up
In the wishin' well too

Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Leave me standing here
Act like I'm not around
The coast will probably never clear
Can I please go home now?

I had that dream
About you again
Where I wait outside
Until you let me in
And there I stayed

Lay beside me
And listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying
Until the summer comes

I had that dream
About you again
Where you drive my car
Right off a fucking cliff

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her

Let me kiss you one last time

Make me promise
That I will never tell
All I remember is
The way her bedroom smelled

Our mother sleeps in silent peace because your love was pure
But brother, you were never there for me
When my father died I thought that you would take my hand
You said I was just too young

I'd throw away everything, even fame
If I could play God do you know what I'd do?
I'd swim through your blood and kill the cancer in you

Warrel Dane,"And the parasites
That call themselves the pretty ones
Licked their lips acknowledging the suffering
They had created and yet felt no remorse

In between the quiet space
Of cold defense and misplaced selfish rage
I blame defiantly not like the others that came before
We are the ones who can change

I love to let you down
I love to wear this foolish crown
Of suffering and empty dignity
For your deity has abandoned me such is vanity

The withered parasites are slandering
The walls of truth, the wise can see them fall
To attain enlightenment
The change is whispered on the winds of unjust war

I love to let you down
I love to wear this foolish crown
Of suffering and empty dignity
For your deity has abandoned me such is vanity

Not like the others that came before
We are the ones who can change
Not like the hatred that falls away
Treading the silence again

Of suffering and empty dignity
For your deity has abandoned me such is vanity

We look hard, we look through
We look hard to see for real

The end is near, we're all insane

The end is near, the drug is fear

Puppets play your game
Useless faith or poisoned veins
Follow me blindly into oblivion

Useless faith and numbered days
The end is near, we're all insane

The doom sayers, the clock-watchers
Control your fate for their needs
When bullets are a legal drug
Murder is the ultimate rush
Society will punish you, is it wrong to execute?

When will the powerful learn to understand?
When we slit our wrists the same blood
Falls into the sand

The end is near, we're all insane

Just look at how far that we have fallen
I am a slave, I feed the fire, I am a pawn
Within this world gone so wrong

If your enemy looked you in the eyes
Would you pull the switch?
Would you suffer for your chosen victim?
Or justify your will to feed the rich?

The world is ruled by fools and thieves
With a flair for power and a taste for greed
Now ask yourself do you feel betrayed?
Because nothing ever changes when we pray

Look at the game that we have chosen
Is it so wrong that we all want the death bombs?
I am a slave, I feed the fire, I am a pawn
Within this world gone so wrong
If your finger was above the trigger would it itch?
With eyes cut out the path is cold and resistant

The world is ruled by fools and thieves
With a flair for power and a taste for greed
Now ask yourself do you feel betrayed?
Because nothing ever changes when we pray

The world is ruled by fools and thieves
With a flair for power and a taste for greed
The world is dark and the world is gray
Because nothing ever changes when we pray

There were times when I was feeling down
And I was on the edge

The world is ruled by fools and thieves
With a flair for power and a taste for greed
Now ask yourself do you feel betrayed?
Because nothing ever changes when we pray

Warren Barfield,"I know my shady little shadow
Would've left me long ago
If he wasn't tied to my feet

he's always been a scared one
Turn off the lights and he runs
Nowhere to be seen
Well I am lonely only when I'm alone

so I need more than a shadow
Someone that won't go
Whenever life grows dark
You're the only one I know
Whose love never lets go
Oh we'll never be apart
Never be apart

You and me
We've got a good thing
We move so smoothly
You lead and I will follow
You're closer than a brother
I'm a book, You're the cover
You surround my soul
With You only my lonely is gone

You're so much more than a shadow
Someone that won't go
Whenever life grows dark 
You're the only one I know
Whose love never lets go
And we'll never be apart
No never be apart
Never be apart

This life will pass
And only what is done for God will last
With the time we have

Let every heart beat

Lord take my life and use it up
Spread it thin like a blanket of love
Over the world 
That You gave Your blood for
Take my life
Take it all Lord

Lord without You
Nothing makes sense 
Down here the grass dies 
On both sides of the fence
So all my vain searching 
Will never amount to much
Here's my life Lord
Use it up for the cause of love
For Your cause

take my life and use it up
Spread it thin like a blanket of love

Warren Barfield,"I bought into all the hype
Yeah I believed a lie
And I hoped that they were right
And I could not fall
But I fell so far

maybe that is why
I've always been afraid of heights
Cause when you're up that high
It's easy to see how small you are
And I'm just a raindrop
In Your ocean

You have unleashed Your love on me
And it fills me up oh 
You have unleashed Your love on me
And it fills me up

it's impossible to drain
The gospel from these veins
Oh Lord You knew my name
Before this world was

and I am not afraid
I'm immune to what they say
Cause my perspective has been changed
By the passion in Your touch
And I'm just a raindrop
In Your ocean

You have unleashed Your love on me
And it fills me up
You have unleashed Your love on me
And it fills me up

You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Gettin tired of mothafuckas sayin' ""Warren I told ya""

With these funny-bunny niggaz, ain't shit changin
Got my mama wonderin if I'm gang-bangin
But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine, and I'm rollin with my niggaz
Off to the VIP, you see, Snoop Dogg and Warren G

And I knew it, There really ain't nothin' to it
Thinkin' every fool's gotta go through it
Now let's go back - (How Far?) Back in time
Draggin to these hookas tryin to mack for mine
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock (huh)
It was all so clear

You make me want to holler, get out the game
Too many muthafuckas know my name
While Snoop Dogg's servin' time up in Wayside
I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
We'd talk, and him n Nate'd conversate on the phone
He kept sayin, ""Nigga, it won't be long
Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home""
I said, ""Snoop, things done change, it's not the same
We need to get about the game
'cause we can get paid in a different way
Wit you kickin' dope rhymes and I DJ""
Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
But things are gettin hectic, I just can't take it
Should I A: Go back to slangin' dope?
Or should I B: Maintain and try to cope?
Or should I C: Just get crazy and wild?
But no I chose D: Create the G-Child
It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
This shit is gettin so hectic that I can't even trust him now

Would you act the fool and nut the fuck up?

And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches

Off your knees and then start juggling

Now I told you once before its the mad punk 
Kicking rough stuff, quick dunk
Nigga back the funk up yeah
Give a nigga room yeah
Give a nigga space
Throw your hands in the air, westside's in the place
Word up, I got the formula, I'm mixing up the brew
Take the 40 to the head now what you gonna do
Deuce tre is in effect, like Keith don't Sweat
Don't need to break necks just to gets my respect
I stay smooth, until you try to get on my rough side
(what side) westside, fool try to take mine
Ya start to wonder, I know your name is Stevie
Don't think about it fool, 'cause you know you can't see me
23, the number's on the tip of your tongue
I got ends, and you can't have none
So a, slow ya roll deuce tre is in control
Listen pay attention and do what you are told, as I flow

Tickity tock, don't stop, yeah the clock is still ticking
Ya booty chicken rhymes, mine's a finger licking
Blooding, cripping, I hear ya body calling
I caught it with my banging 'cause my skills are into balling
(Mary J) ain't the way for me
I gets high off my jumpers and my dunks you see
So when the fans start to scream with the ooh and the
I like the bop bop, bop bop baa
(Its like 3 into the 2 and 2 into the 1)
Big balla 23 and my job ain't done
I get started like the hammer, I finish like Shaquille
When ya think ya heard my best well fool look a here
Look a here no fear, rap crystal clear
Flossing in my Chevy with the wind in the air
But its a westside thing, mic size thing
Winning battles ain't nothing but a chicken wing
I eat em one by one, good clean fun
No need to bring a gun, come and get some
Of this lovable, hugable, my skills are so incredible
Stay like Jodeci, I don't know its time to go, as I flow

Now a verse 3, I think its time to wrap this thing up
Warren G flex the cut, make it go bumpidy bump
In my speaker, my sneakers go sqeaker, damn
Look at honey over there with the nice smooth features
She's on my nuts, oh no here she comes
(How's about a 68 and I owe you one)
I ain't wit the slipping, tripping, forget about honey dipping
I'm too caught up with my ends to be spitting and dripping
Not Teddy, but I had the 1, 2 checker
(She know you got the money stacking high) yeah I betcha
(Do I know you from somewhere, boy you look familiar)
I'm the Snoop Doggy Dogg in ya life so can I hit ya
Later, cause its my time to wreck it
Say my praire, rock the crowd, bring home the checkered
Spend a little, save the rest another show again
No complaints from the dog 'cause I love them ends
Got some fools trying to break me off proper like
See me bouncing in my fo yeah I'm hopping right
No need for the noise, what you shouting about
Check my rear, three wheel motion, peace sign and I'm out

Warren G,"Hey, nah ya goin miss up on the G-Funk era,
Ya know we said things won for Warren G, and soon turned superstar

11-10-7 D that was my intro
But now in 94, I'm rollin a 64
'Cause things get shady where the grass is greener
Niggaz throwin up sets in hoods like they neva seen a
Young mack daddy do his thing 'cause I pack right
I got 44 ways to make you act right
And its a shame how the game must be played
It was told never fold by the niggaz you can't fade
So raise up off this young hog
'Cause I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me y'all
I got my own thang 'cause I let my nuts hang
If you want to bring it, bring it on no pain no gain
So as I creep can you peep what I speak
Techniques unique, so what you sayin is obsolete
So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad 
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em

It's all plain and simple
I roll just to serve a lifetime wit my niggaz
Idiotic fools can't figure
The way I display or should I say more than that
Its crucial when I name how many niggaz got my back
Neva lack, the skills when its time to handle mine
You can't front if you want to but you still know the time 
I'm, the nigga that they call Wayniac (what that mean)
I'm the nigga stayin down for the home team
So if you didn't know let me slow ya roll
This pro is on the go with some shit you ain't heard before
So recognize game in your face
A touch of the bass then I'm gone without a trace

[Chorus]

I stay true to the game
But some stay blind to the fact
That if I don't look good, you don't look good
So please rearrange and change the shit you doin'
You fuckin' yourself 'cause you the one gettin' screwed
As I, ease on down the rick road
As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So blaze up the Buddha
'Cause I got drink, and don't think
We don't roll without a full tank
Of that bomb ass shit called the funk
'Cause I am the G and the funk is what you want
Now, lets take a trip to the other side of town
Niggaz flip flop and they neva stay down
Want to be all they can be, but gettin' held back
Tryin' to take what is mine, (what) what type of shit is that?
So, this is for the homies stay down for your pay
I can't only bring it to you like this in so many ways

Warren G,"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G. is on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin all alone

Just hit the eatside of the L.B.C.
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of skirts ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the 21 to Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said""what's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brothas and said ""damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I besta pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""ooh I like your size""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,""
""would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the east side motel

I'm tweaking
Onto a whole new level

Stept towards

Yo, oh no, grab a hold of fadeables, gettin' her flows on

Smooth like chocolate, so call me Big Mamma Kane

A superfly mackadocious one you never seen a 
Soulful, cause I got a bowl-full of soul 
Strollin' because I have no vehicle to roll 
But bring it bring it back to the topic of the solar mind 
I can flow upbeat, to a slow beat, and be off beat and still on time 
I rhyme, and swim waves of soul like Billy Ocean 
Never ashy, lyrics that soothe ya like some lotion 
'Cause I can Krush any Groove bust on any move ya make 
I keep my rhymes attached, like trains to a freight 
Break ya Achey like Billy Ray, I'm fuckin' up the industry

approachin the wrong way, with no delay I blast your ass 

draw for the gat but the Scoop is much faster 

you can't miss me with that, step in my path 

I let the AK ripper cut that ass in half 

I dwells, I bells, in the LBC 

the real menace to society 

packin up alrighty 

a flow, but watch the one I used to abuse this track 

we in front of that ass and you still can't see the shack 

so pack up your gear and run and hide

I guess that's how we act when we chillin in the shack

This is the shack, this is how we act 

Caps I peel, flex my steel

to something to smoke herb 

to sunk we and we serve

Warren G,"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the eats side of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the two one to Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said, ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats so I said, ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin' me I'm glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers and said, ""Damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
They gonna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I could fly let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin' it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N A T E and me the Warren to the G

Just like I thought they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell I said, ""Ooh I like your style""

She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the East Side Motel

I'm tweaking onto a whole new era
G-Funk step to this I dare ya
Funk, on a whole new level
The rhythm is the base and the base is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody G-Funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm

If you know like I know you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era, funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster 213 will regulate",Regulate [Remix][*],1994

You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark
You can never fade thee G they're so crazy
When they start to blaze after dark

Now I can take you on a maze of thangs but all I know is street life
20 some years and all I lived was the urban life
Shootin dice smokin weed gettin my hustle on
Makin anybody raise up that try to do me wrong
Me and the homeys on the move tryin to make a grip
Bumpin OGs in zone when we dip
Not to trip, unless you trip
Automatic will release
Dangled as peace
I'm stayin soldier to the streets

So tell me how do you feel 'cause I can't deal wit the anger
You niggaz be givin I'm keepin one in the chamber
The pressure is thick so I don't quit shootin game
And peepin our enemies violatin in my range
They say it don't change and here's a fact you should know
That niggaz don't hustle no matter where yo ass go
So when you think wrong
I'm thinkin right, are you prepared to meet
Gotta be wise 'cause everythang ain't what it seems to be

In 6 before out shacks, cruisin each block
I'm lookin for a space with my 40 glock cocked
Temple, Salt lake, 21st Lewis
I hits MLK 'cause I know I gots to do this
Some people say Warren would you please stick to rappin
But this fool's pressin me so I gotta start capping
187 now I'm stuck out of luck
In the high powered module lookin crazy as fuck
LBCing to the fullest 21, dominoes
Buck wheats, french braids and naked four doors
Its my city, my city's all good

Press up if you want to, believe that you'll get your feelings hurt
All you hear is the chirp, along with my wheels as I skirt
You shouldn't of tried to fade the Locc there ain't no get back
I meant that, get ready for combat its like that
Prayin that my homeys don't flip as I elevate
Bringin nothing but heat stayin away from the weak links
Be your own man survive
Make that money grow
Whether it comes fast or it comes slow

[Wayniac]
Either way it goes we step so I stick and move
Refuse to lose I choose to get the blues
Paid dues for years, but where were you niggaz then
Out flossin the boulevard being hard wit your friends
While I was at home puttin in work
You think you goin jerk
And take what's mine get me twisted with a skirt
I notice the difference 'cause I been back
On niggaz they true
But now I see it and its on since its like that

Warren G,"Ooh, yeah, yeah, what's love got to do
Warren G rap for me, yeah, mmm

When G-dog, the hog, come up in the place
There's dollar signs in your eyes and a smile in your face
You want to live fat off of my sack
You got more drag than a low lo-do, cut the act
'Cause back before '92 and '93
You didn't give a damn about Warren G
But now that I'm slingin' platinum LP's
All of a sudden you on my N.U.T's
Ain't nothin' you can do to make it stop
'Cause money makes the world
Go 'round and the panties drop
I ain't in love though, I don't need the pressure
I just want to dig it like I'm diggin' for treasure
Some of y'all had a good thing that you couldn't keep
Thought you was TLC, you had to creep
You say you had love, I said you bullshit
It's all about the dough, so what's love got to do with it

What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it
If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it

Now, I'm the type of brother that's down for mines
Before I made beats, I was down to grind
Back then, every single homey had my back
Now they're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' bout jack
But I'm the same brother day in and day out
And I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out in a casket
It's drastic 'cause homies is plastic
Break 'em off some bread
They want the whole damn basket
If you's a true homey, you would wish me well
Not plot to make a brother fail, jealous as hell
We used to get the same riches
Now your trigger-finger got the itches, schemin' on my riches 
Which is not a surprise, my eyes peep game
211's, 187's it's all the same
It's all a shame, homies'd jack you for your grip
Ain't no love involved, because it's all about the chips

What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it

Now for these labels tellin' fables
Makin' the fucked-up deals under the tables
You think that you smart, but fool, I'm the smartest
You canÂ´t make no money if you can't keep an artist
Sign the dotted line, put 'em on the shelf
Break 'em off some crumbs, keep the rest for yourself
I know how it goes, treat an artist like a ho'
Fly cars, gold, clothes, but no dough
Since it's all business, I'm-a handle mine
Keep track of my stack down to the very last dime
'Cause in this rap game, it's all about the buck
You bend over for the label, and you will get fucked
Like how we run up in a trick, and then you're through
The record label do the same shit to you
90% business, 10% show
Ain't no love in this game 'cause it's all about the dough

What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it

I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop
Spot us some hos, tooted my horn at the bitch
The riviera ever skaty, my team ya's the shit
Fifteen's humping, dropped the top, she moaned
counting my dough, purchased a 50 of some bomb indo floss
In South Central I'm on my way to the East Side
We high, blazing like crazy, we don't know why
feeling good as fuck on a hot ass day
and it's a pujam right around the way
Niggas got hos but ladies in the world
they want to play wit their minds like little girls
I twirled my fingers in the air
rubbed my fingers through my hair
Red bones to black bones
dark bows to red bows
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
but I play hos like plenty-leany cause I get greedy
It's all about game 'cause when the game
is hard to maintain for so long, man
From Long Beach, California, from Tulsa, Oklahoma
Tonight ""warning the award is"" from Mississippi, I know ya
hold the key to unlock the door
From long clothes she rolls with gold things we riding for sure
So tell me how much money can one player make? (make)
and how much o' ya ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (you know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (you know)

I was off in Vallejo
pulling hos like Idaho potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
being from where I be, DPG
It's manifico
ran into this pretty ass skirt, Mexican-Puerto Rico
mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'ma approach her like that
and let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone the place that I call home
is the Wall from Philadelphia, the room
Picture me ay
entrepreneur with my nigga D-A
Rockin tours and we still young boys
They got bitches, they got some bomb ass niggas
She used ta put em on his bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick

That's right
Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?
Someone wants to score and get laid by the D-O-double G
Hey girl, what's your name? Ya want to go a couple rounds with me
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same but she kept screamin out Snoopy

[Warren G & Snoop Dogg]
What's up baby, my name is Warren
I'm down with the Pound
'cause I get around
So let me scoop you, swoop you and take you
Gimme a chance and I'ma break you
down to the very last compound
with my homies from Tha Dogg Pound
Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash
You got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos
I bust a brand new ho in every video
That's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow
I pass a ho to my kinfolk
and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
Right before she do me, I blaze up a lupi
then turn on some Snoopy and, heat up jacuzzi
and later on I might just turn on a movie
so you can re-groupie and redo me just for Snoopy

G and Snoop, homeys from the jump and the get go 
Devoted and quoted back in 84 
Growin' up in the LBC 
Platinum city, where the big gamers be 
Involved in everythang from Pop Warner 
To what's poppin' on every corner 
Find a skirt if you want to 
Tryin' to come up in this world 
Where everything is drama 
Beverly was like my mama 
W-A-double are-E-N 
Tryin' to get in where I can fit in 
Catchin' a bus with a homey I can trust 
3 homeys from the hood straight kickin' up dust 
Enjoyin' my days and everythang is fine 
15 years old Snoop d whoop on the grind 
Tryin' to find ways to make it, dice shake it 
Young, havin' fun, like me Snoop and Nate did 

We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 

I remember all the scams we been through, together 
Nobody does it better on which you do the weather 
The days we used to call first year playin' get like me 
Gettin' in fo of zines, I loved em 
Long Beach was the hometown 
And every spot that we rocked, you know we got down 
Outside at the club just spittin' raps 
And every busta that ran up was gettin' cracked 
Underground tapes used to be the claim to fame 
Long Beach Was A Mutha was a classic mane 
Tellin' tales about how we was strugglin' 
And surrounded wit tha homeys that was all clubbin' 
Tryin' to make it in this music 
Quick fast, quick cash, and hittin' on the quick dash 
We in this game to make hits 
And make everybody respect the G-Funk click 

We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 

We went from young G's 
To sellin' million overseas 
Rollin Dees 
And makin' money by the trees 
To killer Bees, evading all enemies 
Catastrophies, young GFC's 
We made it now, livin good wit no hassles 
But still a lot of problems dealin' wit shady acts doe 
Its all a part of makin' hits doe 
See our careers take off like a US missile 
Break out the crystal 
I spitted it, and now its g funked out, transmitted it 
So you can call it what you want 
We still goin bring the funk 
G's up put it down, and ya weed to float 

We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 

We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 

We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do

A long time ago I met Annie Mae
She was killing me softly like everyday
Penetentiary steel, was stickin for real
Blockbustin' through the walls
Now I'm makin housecalls

I thought I'd met a lot of scandalous women, and then I met Annie Mae
Got a thin big butt like steel
But she didn't have a place to stay

She was shackin' at mine and shackin' at his
Blowin' my socks, tellin' his biz
Nate Dogg this and Nate Dogg that
213 skirt, and we stay intact
So I told the homey Nate don't be mislead
Ain't no fun if the homey can't shake a leg
So I went to the house and knocked on the door

With just one look, the pussy was took
'Cause I make music that you adore
Now I'm not sure and I might be trippin'
But in 94 I heard a song
It ain't no fun unless the homeys can come
So Warren G put a condom on

Long Beach City G's Funkin
and its a pity who many we's punk and drunk
in a hotel lobby at a town near you
housekeeper's high, and drinkin beer too
cleared through the night
my niggaz movin with the skirts
in the boxes, houseshoes, and slingshot t-shirts
its gettin late, I'm runnin out of gas
so Warren G tryin to see what's up on some ass
really doe, y'all enjoyed the show, good
but what you know about these Long Beach boys in the hood
should anything go wrong and niggaz act shitty
remember fool this is Long Beach city, punk

(Chorus)
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Well it was boring until Warren G came on the scene
put the G-Funk with the gangsta lean
its been about 2, is he comin through?
I dropped this one just to show you I'm true
People say Warren where'd you get that speech
in the sandy city right down by the beach
speak, don't speak on, if you want to speak on
if you want to get yo groove on, LOC on

so playa hate if you want to, I don't give a fuck
I'm still G-dubb and I'm subbin in my truck so good luck

we got y'all town locked down like a vice grip
I'm on the dice tip, shootin see-notes

I shot the sheriff
--Chorus--

Verse One:

I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
he mistaked me for somebody who was liable
for all tha many murders l.a and war fields
we keep makin war shields
streets keep souls
young brothers loose control
I seem to maintain through this
watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist
and it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie
and tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools 
they do crime and it attracts cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in

--Chorus--

Verse Two:

They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do
you know who
the boys in blue
there they go with they assumpitons
slaverys over let us have somethin'
why you want to pull me over?
'cause I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
my profession is music
your profession is protection with gats

then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in

--Chorus--

Verse Three:

I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
'cause in this game they always tryin' to blast you
and leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
they harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
the hommie day-dog got strapped but that's okay
'cause I'm gonna work for life
so he can see another day
a hommies a hommie
a fake is a snake
straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in",I Shot the Sheriff,1997
Warren G,"I don't know why they mad at me
They can't catch me but still they after me
When we deal face to face, is a tragedy
You ask why i got my gun they might blast at me

Who gives a fuck if you niggaz is mad at me
Fuck around with Warren G its a tragedy
Real niggaz, real shit, reality

Warren G top dog
Patrollin the beach
Niggaz say they as hard as bitch
But they're as soft as a peach
Claimin the G of all G's
Please
I come blowin through like the breeze
Sittin on threes
Post it
Coastin mashing down Pacfic Coastin
The bomb chrome rims black on black Yukon
With nuts hangin' from the city
Where the bangers is being banging
it don't seem like shit is changing
I holla'd at the homey the other day
G'ded up at the park sippin alisah
One of the homeys took a beaten
So now we spend at being a gang
of checking at the meetin like cycles repeatin
It's just another sunset fall in sea
I can here the homeys in the past callin me
And you know what i discovered
What they keep saying
Keep your mind on your money
muthafuckers and shake busters

Chorus

Have you ever sold millions
But yet you niggaz persist to talk shit
Get of my dick
You never catch me slipping
Rollin with the heat
Slap the clip in
I never thought the world would started trippin
My life is a trip, though
Hit the crip though
Blow the whistle
They think i banged
So i packed a pistol
Warren to tha G is a G
I don't fuck with you nigga
So don't fuck with me
Let's ride to the east side
Slide like a fo
I packs a fo-fo
When i'm steppin out doors
To the bang to the buggy
If i speak then i spoke
Warren G do it every time to you Locc
Get the party beat like blaze and smoke
The east side and the beach
West side of the coast
You know the niggaz that i ride with
Hogs, attack dogs
the same niggaz i'm down to die with muthafucka

Chours

Who's the man
I've been from London to Japan
Stomp land to land
To the Egyptian sands
You can't check me
Dis-respect me
Or mop me up
With the base bumpin' out my truck
And all these police trying to lock me up
Money rules the world
And I made the loot
So don't make me shoot
'cause trying to mash
Will get you done every time
I ain't trying to hurt nobody
But i'm down for mine

But it ain't even happenin like that

And get mine, you know I'm genuine

I had to relax your mind, I thought you knew
Ain't nothin but a Long Beach party

All the homeys around and the slingshot t-shirts
Skirts wit the baby fat it'll work
Pass me the indosmoke and get locced
From the beach to the bay, makin them sway

Throwin' licks for grits, steady stackin' our chips,
The money clips don't fit, now is it the way we dip on,

Lurkin' like a cat on the deal with my sack,
I know somebody watchin' the Locc,
Can't stop 'cause it just start poppin' please,
I gots tah have it like Mickey D's,
Over 60 billion served rollin on the daily,
Can't tell me shit put it in and I won't notice,
Me and my niggaz nothin' but that top notch,
Long Beach postin' up the road blocks,
You can't go through, or around, you gotta turn back,
I'm gettin' turned back, ridahs and killaz that don't play that,
Known to bring it on when it pop, missions to clock,
Stages to rock, when I'm done lounge at the spot

Warren G,"Whats up Warren G?
Whats happenin? I'm just chillin, you know
Checkin my game you dig, you know
Trippin off these fools around this situation here, you know its like that

I went from hustlin and slangin' to bustin and bangin
I got to keep it real, so fuck not cursin when I'm sangin'
Now let me tell y'all about this shit, went down the other night
Me and the doggs see some niggas, just caught up in the hype
Tryin to ride and get by like the FBI
Cause we know bout them hk's, they right outside
But we never knew y'all had a clue bout what we go through
So tell how the fuck could you speak on my crew

I went from dirt to large work like boatloads of keys
It's hard work and it hurts to live life on ya knees
So God please have a lil' mercy on my soul
What my eyes see, my mind think, my hand should hold
The outcome of these actions warm hearts turn cold
Lil' snake tryin' to blast me with the gun he stole
We hang out, banged out, same route as the day before
Blessed with perception, but don't know how my days a go
Could see my nigga hittin' with some pay, a few days ago

Blaze up a flow, sit watch my paper grow
Cautious, in case niggas wanna cross this
But they can't cross me, I'm way too flossy
Out here making millions
All in with the villians
Let's turn these millions to trillions
I've seen it all pop slow unfold, and go
Now it's time to get mo' dough, ya know
I play under the wrath of thunder
Electric shocks hot as the summer
More foul than funner, gun ya
In the open range, man it seems strange
Even sometimes deranged inside my brain
I hold the key, identify then flee
Every MC close to me
Cause I'm supposed to be all in with my chips (nigga)
I'm all in with the crips and bloods
Grips for thugs, I nudge
The homie on his shoulder, cause every day I'm getting older
As the world turns and gets colder
Laid back I shot me sumpin', Perfec from dynamic, banging G-Funk

Now I blew from the East to the West
Word on the street, niggas wanna test
But these MC's, is scared to buck
Plus they talk too much and smoke too many blunts
You fucking rookies
Sweet as Mr. Smith's cookies
Ya hate me one minute and the next ya wanna buck me
He sent a ho, in the back seat of my fo'
While ya Going Back To Cali, watch how you flow
Now ya know, about this Warren G Era
G-Funk terror, look into the mirror
And what you see is the don of the company
That nigga, (Warren, Warren, Warren to the G)
You still see, what I see
All of the homies in the LB
Sittin back, and we makin the cash
Warren G, Perfec, Hershey Locc and Bad Ass

And we never knew you had clue of what we go through
So how in the fuck could y'all speak of our crew
Ya thought this, ya thought that, we thought y'all should laid back
Yeah it's like that, for me it's like that
And we never knew you had clue of what we go through
So how in the fuck could y'all speak of our crew
Ya thought this, ya thought that, we thought y'all should laid back
Yeah it's like that, for me it's like that

Sittin back, and we makin the cash
It's Warren G, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Ass
Sittin back,and we makin the cash
It's Warren G, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Ass

Ya know what I'm sayin Warren G
With my homeboy from the pound Hershey Locc
And the homie Perfec, ya know what I'm saying and Mr. Badass

I hit the 21 blocks each and every day 
Niggaz peepin' they shoulders in each and every way 
No sweat, 'cause if I sweat it 
I stay true to the game, so I'm not gonna let it 
Take control of me, fool you can roll with me 
From OG to OG you can reminisce with me 
About the hutch, about the milk bowl, 
Two dee took a bank left knockin' fools out on 
It was me baby boppa and the homey tic 
All my folks locked down, gotta make it legit 
So I'm a spit, and keep my spittin' straight real 
I know that you can feel penitentiary steel 
Locked down all around for the homies touchin down 
When my rags get out you walk a safe ground (walk a safe ground) 
'Cause I'm a let them ride killah 
You betta stay inside and keep yo shit on yo side nigga 
Set trippin' wit me 
Because what I see is greenery, and that's all I see 
As the day gets older, don't tweak, take a look over your shoulder

Young, dumb, full of fun 
Dumb diddy dumb diddy you'll get done 

Livin' this life 
I can't help but dis my dream 
Maybe since West anthems I want to roll a beam 
Clean, but only had to be a mex 
Now hopefully that 850 lookin' spiffy, will come next 
I bounced to 120 and Figueroa 
Yeah, my house posted across from the store 
Just like that hit by the drive way and park in the back 
1986 fools is known to jack 
Around this click of the hood you found no punks 
Many gang bangers, dope fiends and drunks 
I learned, bunny hops, still rocks and cops 
I ran out of boys with toys 
And nights sees on hot days 
Just apple sticks on death 
RC cola to break a sweat 
Now I bet that everybody's comin' up 
If you turnin' the wrong street 
Lie you bout to get stuck 
Now what 

[Chorus] 

I ain't no muthaufuckin' murdera (nigga) I'm a killah 
'Cause murderers get life nigga and killaz keep killin'
I'd ratha die with my eyes open 
So I can see how these muthafuckaz want to do me 
They set me free bullet loco head with the beat what 
And these niggaz know they have to retreat when I speak 
The younger dumb want to have some fun 
And drinkin' liqour way before the age of 21 
So how you figure that'll never put in work for that hood he love 
You never paid him no attention so who should he love 
And to keep a strap on him or a phat sack on him 
And some bomb but be patrollin' the hood 
Ran a hoe's name through the mud 
And these crooked's stick a strap in your mouth, without a doubt 
That's the reason got lost and turned out 
He shoulda keep patient 
But you was still money chasin' 
A double life is what that young nigga facin 
And all because he was",Young Fun,1997

When all of us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids
Times are different now, but you still get stuck
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck

Keep this is mind: nobody does it better than me

What cha want to do?
What cha want to do?
We're the Legion of Doom.
We're the Legion of Doom.
We're the Legion of Doom.

Fourteen seventy-two is the same cut throat and locks,
And plenty dopes can you cope.
You can call me Count Chocula.
I control all the bitches, Chi-Chi control the riches,
And fly surf the snitches.

Look up in the sky as the fly,
My herion wip, clip on hip, now trip on this.
A bunch of outlaws try to take my town,
Set up shop, run me out, and cut me down.
And how that safe, when I'm the illa-superhero,
Born and raised on that muthafucking underground.
Brrrrbrrrrbrrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em.
Try to catch me, slip 'em, but now you about to be my victim.
I'm not Aquaman, but a aqua-boogie.
I'm sorta like a monster, chasin' cookies,
And I spin a web any size, you can call me to fly.
I walk walls and this is for all my dogs.
(Woof!)
I'm like the wonder twins, my style activates.
The many niggas get in it, and try to playa hate.
It's fly, the rider Maine and Ri, (man, man.)
I do it like a muthafucking rider,
And I represent all the time and
I represent the mad ass fuckin' eastside.
(Eastside,) look out, look out, come out,
'Cause here comes the rider man,
(Rider man,) nigga.

I rock the blue cake on 'em, drop the weight on 'em.
The more they hate, the more I elevate on 'em.
I swerve and collect, serve and protect,
Never hit the streets without the ice on my neck.
I'm all about partying, hos, and getting paper.
They call me Chi-Chi and do it up, caped crusader.
Contact through the frame, no mistakes.
To bank rules, back in town and it's on us to shut 'em down.
Now fly what cha want to do, (nigga what.)

Let's put this shit down my lil' homey, Mr. Turner, with the murder.
He got my back, you know he put me up on game.
When they get up, they getting lit up, heat that shit up.
Enough said, don't tell it, jus' sell it.
We blowin' in the wind and we gonna ride till we win.
Young soldier, stickin' to it, we put the Folgers. 
It's your turn gone get on up and get the light,
And don't forget to grab your strap.

[Chorus x 2]
Look up in the sky.  It's a bird; no it ain't.
It's the Legion of Doom, ain't a damn thing changed.
Keep it safe and sound, get it locked down,
And you don't have to worry when we in your town.

Just a young muthafucker from the street,
Forced to be a G-angsta, knock-knock with a glock, pump-pump answer.
Throw your hands up, nigga, yeah, death's a callin'.
Went from petty deaf bank robber, straight to ballin'.
Stop with us, walk with us, as we bust through,
The doors, forties fallin', like parts in us off in dust.
Stereos got many holes in, plenty dope, plus we fly as fuck.
Duct tape while room up, toe tag 'em.
Have him feel the strength of a black magnum,
Body bag him, nobody is as bad as them.
As shown as them, set kissed like FM.
Life in 1-4-7 to the deuce, right then.
I slipped in the bullet-proof suit,
And swoop down on the bank ruler with the gats.
Waiting for the permission to cancel his ass,
Handle his ass.
I love to see his guts and his blood spill,
And cracked up as I drugged, as I rise flying up high with a forty-five.
If a red demon in it from the sky,
Drop and I put the barrel right between his eyes,
And said you fuck with the Legion and now you must die.
We serve and protect all the hustlers,
And G's from the west to the north, south and back to the east.

[Chorus x 2]

Look up in the sky, (in the sky.)
No it ain't, (no it ain't, no it ain't,)
Mean a damn thing changed, (changed, changed, changed.)
Got it locked down, (locked down, locked down,)
When we in your town, (in your town.)

Look up in the sky, (in the sky.)
No it ain't, (no it ain't, no it ain't,)
Mean a damn thing changed, (changed, changed, changed.)
Got it locked down, (locked down, locked down,)
And you won't have to worry when we in your town, (in your town....)",Protector's of 1472,1998

Riggers say they hard as bricks 
But they soft as a peach 
Climbin the G of all G's 
Please 
I come blowin through like the breeze 
Sitting on the threes 
Post it coast it and mash it down 
Pacific coast in the bomb chrome rims 
Black on black Yukon 
With nuts hangin from the city 
Where the bangers be bangin 
It don't seem like shit is changin 
I hollered at a homey the other day 
G'd up at the park 
Sippin Alisay 
One of the homies took a beatin 
So now we'll start to be a gang 
Checkin at the meetin 
Life cycles repeatin 
It's just another sunset fall and see 
I can hear the homies that pass 
Calling me 
And you know what I discover 
What they keep sayin 
Keep your mind and your money

And shake busters

Stomp land to land 
And to the Egyptian sands

And all these police tryin to lock me up

Don't sweat, but check the tecnique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fuckin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin
I wanna see some panties droppin
I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs
and I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
but it's manditory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog

Tell when (till the early morn)
It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)
The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)

Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Till I die I'm still screamin that (bitches ain't shit)
Now i'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about

As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk

I turned to her, and say that I'm
infatuated, concentrated on cuttin it up
Body bustin out your blouse, don't button it up
Me and you could make a getaway, up in the cut
I'm just a squirrel in your world, bustin a nut
Slide in the passenger side and creep to the tilt
And maybe you could get a chance to sleep on my silk
because you come with, that A-1 shit
The kind I wouldn't mind havin a 20-year run with
I'm done with these games, played by these dames
I could exit the drama the same way that I came
'cause I gotta put it down for my sons
so you, skanless scuds gets none of my funds
'cause I can't be in love with my pockets on fee
Get the money, the power and the rest come for free, you know

in a Rolls, Royce? Make it real moist
Take the Rolls to the jet, take the jet to my yacht
Letcha kick it for a week in my Caribbean spot
Coconut milk bath (bath), private beach, first class (class)
Water clear like glass (glass), waves ticklin' your ass
Cut the act baby, you need a change of pace
I deliver you a whole new world of taste
Guaranteed to put a different timid look on your face
Put the arch in your back when I'm grippin' your waist
Warren G keep flippin' the bass on key
'cause you rollin' with a G when you're rollin' with me
Easily I spit game to make it hot
Headed straight for the motherfuckin G-Spot, you know

See now look at the picture
You got a lotta women out there preaching about
how they ain't a bitch or a ho but now
if you carry yourself in a fashionable matter
game can be matched both ways by a player

Do ya triple somersault fools will be flipped I'm sure
Long Beach, right by the water
Respect is due when you walk through the border
Line, if you don't you might find your face in a gutter
Long Beach will get ya wets

The homey just whistled, gave us the signal
To act the fool with the pistols, pierce the gristle
One way out homey, in the cut
Heat cocked, beef for weeks, heat for block
Techniques to rock, the blocks socks
Unorthodox, cannon cocking bandit nigga
I daily rock the planet nigga
Scope out the vicinity, start seperatin(what?)
those that's cool and those hatin
Every nigga in between
Got 5 seconds to evacuate the scene (yeah)
Hit the stash (nigga)
Nigga what the fuck you want to do

Hit a nigga wit a little gangsta love
Gangsta love
Hit a nigga wit a little gangsta love

Lets go to war, no, not with guns
Blast you with heat, original beats they run
Fast and faster, Master like P
Or you can just say, Master Warren G
I'm bout it bout it, highly touted
And I doubt it 
if I let another nigga take my tracks and re re-route it
I truck more styles, like my Yukon I puke on
The rest of these niggaz, trying to contest

Hold up, who's speaking of contest, no, none of that
We get gats beats technique rat tat tat tat
Splat, and ya flat, pure satisfac
X marks the spot of the brutal venacular
You drinks down like dracula
Listen here buddy you'll be found left bloody
Its the beach nigga, straight up
Before ya hate, get ya weight up 
Or get wet up now what up

Yeah, yeah OGs
My nigga Warren G, uh huh

My nigga Nate Dogg, my nigga Snoopy, my nigga RBX
They're my OGs, my real OGs

You up against the aces nigga
It all takes place in many places nigga
Several different faces nigga
The streets can watch me nigga
But the streets is up against Kurupt Momar Khadafi nigga
OG, juggernaut, jagged edge, homey two to the head
As the sprinkle spread
Death will kiss ya, fuck around with the Militia
Stalking till the big homey Nate walked in

Same old niggaz in the same old place
Long Beach city is where I was raised
I keep my heater right by my side
Won't stop mashin till I get my prize
Even if you blind we can make you see
The perfect combination Nate and Warren G
When we bust we hit em everytime
Ain't no secret its about that time

What's up? 
This Warren G chillin' with the home boy Mack 10 
We gon' lay a lil' sumpin' down for y'all 
Let y'all know what time it is 
Show you how we keepin' it real wit' it 
You know, 'cause this world is built on material thangs 
But we ain't trippin' off that 
We want y'all to know this, check it 

[Chorus- Warren G] 
I want it all; money, fast cars 
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne 
Shit, everydamn thing 
I want it all; houses, expenses 
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's 
I want it all; brand new socks and draws 
And I'm bawlin everytime I stop and talk to y'all 
I want it all, all, all, all 
I want it all, all, all, all, all 

[Warren G] 
They say, 'There go Warren G with that envious stare' 
I love this game too much, I wish these haters wasn't here 
It's a shame, we came too far to turn back 
It's a cold world, it gets so hard, you learned that 
Won't fall tryin' to walk from crawl 
Tryin' to hustle up from broke to ballin' 
And, yeah, y'all in effect that's all me 
The jiggy G-Z, all my niggas that keep it real and do it easy 
Believe me, young nigga, fat meat is greasy 
And shit stink, so if you plan a lick and hit a bank 
And get away, or get gaffled the very next day
Don't cry, hold your head up high 
And remember what you told yourself 
I said remember what you told yourself 
I said remember what you told yourself 
I said remember what you told yourself 
Ha ha 

[Chorus] 

[Mack 10] 
I want it all, so I got to wake up and ball 
And thanks to y'all, I got plaques on the wall 
Mack 10 laced with the know how to paper chase 
Crushed ice, throw my Rollie face in the platinum fan base 
>From net workin' and hustlin', no doubt, I got slout 
And live the lifestyle that Robin Leech talkin' about 
Slow down, player, don't hate 'cause you can't relate 
The Bentley Coupes and kickin' gears on Harley's with the straights 
I got more lime light than Vegas on cable 
Willing enable to shoot, seen nervios at the craps table 
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high 
Fuckin' fly and fly, with desire to build an empire 
I strapped up and took flight like a missile 
Told them loud and clear as a whistle 'Hoo Bangin' is official' 
Handing out gold medallions at roll-call 
I'ma ball and never fall 'cause Mack 10 want it all 

[Chorus] 

[Warren G] 
Me and 10 get paid escapade to the spot 
We hots like rocks served on hot blocks 
I notice money make the world circulate 
So we gon' stack and stack and take a sip in ?Perkle Lake? 
Bump, let the woofers sub (sub), show the homies love (love) 
Warren to the G (G), and Little G-Dub (Dub) 
Surface on the low, slide or don't slide at all 
Ride or don't ride at all 
Ha ha 

[Mack 10] 
Warren, I couldn't be more serious about my 'fetti 
I stay tight on the mic and keep the pen movin' steady 
I want it all, dawg, and it might be greed 
I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed 
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect 
Or somebody bein' zig with they Daddy's royalty check 
And at that point, I'm through talkin', dawg, enough said 
So, if you owe Mack money, then I suggest you break bread

Warren G,"Yo I want to take this time out to dedicate this song 
to one of the most beautiful ladies in the world
could never imagine
Yeah, Ole Mae, that's my momma, why'know
To one of the most beautifulest ladies in the world
I love ya momma, keep it strong for ya

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
My momma, used to tell me quit smoking weed
My momma, gave me everthing I need
My momma, said keep faith in God
My momma, momma, momma, momma, momma

[Warren G]
From the beginning, soon as my feet touched the earth
For what it's worth, she loved the boy from birth
Kept me fed, combed my head
and tapped that tail when I didn't do what she said
Through the years comin up momma always provided
And when the times got rough momma always tried to hide it
Divide it among us, but pardon the youngsters
Told us never to lie, smoke dope, and cuss
She stood tall and proud like a supermodel on a catwalk
And momma didn't take no back talk
She's the main reason why I roll today
That's why I dedicate this to Ole Mae
That's my momma

[Chorus]

[Warren G]
As a young teenager I started to clown
My momma did all she could to try to slow me down
Tired of her son be brought by the cops
Sent to go stay with my pops
He taught me to be my own man, and when I disrespected 
he put me out on the streets to find my own land
Now I'm servin on the urban street corner
Smokin bud, sippin Coronas in Long Beach, California
But I promised my momma I would make it to the top
And use this rap to put her in the drop
She the main reason why I roll today
That's why I dedicate this here to my Ole Mae

[Chorus]

[Warren G]
As I grew up, blew up in the G-Funk Era
I see my momma everytime I take a look in the mirror
I'm thankful she gotta chance to see me shine
My momma's in my heart and my soul and mind
Controllin mine, so I can stand strong
For ya grandkids to let em know that ya spirit lives on
I really miss you, but I know ya looking over
Lead me on the right track, the angel's on my shoulder

[Chorus]

[Warren G]
So I want why'all to treasure ya mom
Ya know, so if why'all got a bad relationship
or why'all on bad terms, patch it up
Ain't nothing wrong with that
that's a precious jew-el
Remember that, we all gotta go through it
So stay strong, down dis, dis road, ya know
But I can't forget about all the poeple
Out there that I love, and got my back
So I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna shoot a shout out
My daddy, my sistas, my brothers, my girl, my kids
my cousins, my aunties, my uncles, my grandmomma
my granddaddy, all my homeboys, all my homegirls

While you on the grind
Getting yours
Hell yeah! I'm getting mine
I take trips and dips just to recline
I blaze up the orange weed 
To relax my mind
Spend time with my kids on the weekdays
And I holla at my momma and my 
Grandma on the threeway
She say, If you do right 
Baby boy I promise you live 
A long life
I can't argue
I try hard to
Not blast niggas
I walk past niggas

And the code on the street

So I'ma keep it strong
As long as I got my feet in the game
And make this beats
And bring heat to the game

And him without me 
Is like me without you

Knew him just a short time
But he's stuck in my mind
My nigga lived perfect
Said the streets wasn't worth it
If you don't die rich in the game
Then what's the purpose for this struggle?
We stay piece to puzzle 
Invest half the wealth
And pray to god it double

Trying to get rich at the interest
Keep it pimping
Stay with niggas that's relentless

I was wondering why my homie baby momma was blowing up my beeper
You's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel
Tellin them broads about my furniture and jewels
Work on my table and how holding my clientel
Damn do it hit the spot
As pretty as you is no more blessins for your trot
But I might for the sake of my swipe
Hit it like it's supposed to be hit if the vibe is right tonight

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Ain't no big deal until that hoe squeals
Now I got to keep my fuckin woman from around that hoe
Take a fuckin rubber everywhere that I go
Keep her from her family cause her cousin know
She say she fuckin Nate but she can't prove it though
Next time you can't come if you got a loud tongue
I know I got a big dick, shouldn't loaned it to a trick
This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got your ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side

Warren G,"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G. is on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin all alone

Just hit the eatside of the L.B.C.
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of skirts ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the 21 to Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said""what's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brothas and said ""damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I besta pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""ooh I like your size""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,""
""would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the east side motel

I'm tweaking
Onto a whole new level
G-Funk
Stept towards
I dare ya
Funk
On a whole new level
The rythmn is the base and the base is the treble
Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
Where rythmn is life
And life is rythmn
If you know like I know
You don't want to step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate",Regulate [Edited Version],2000

Warren G,"Waiting around a crew of thugs
That parade in blue and yelling 'cause
(Whats up? 'Cuz)
Ate by selling drugs
'38 snub in the waist, in case fools lose love

These days still the same
I can steal the flame, eyes kill with the pain
So I advise y'all to chill with the games
Entertain for the cheddar and the change

So fuck whoever in the fame, forever a man
Around my dogs, banging the pound, swanging the town
How we choose, now I'm aggravated and assault is my next move
Success means issues, so I guess it's time for me to disclude

Handle mines, we use pistols
G's move with the conscience
When we disaprove of that nonsense
Ex-cons with that gangsta gangsta gangsta shit
Here come another hit

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination in the industry
Here comes another one

I can see us smashing up the shore past laws that's lost
2000 Ucon Excel, duel exhaust, TV screen, DVD, e-mail
Passenger, bad female, what the hell
Stash spot, with the hollow head shell
Niggas start trippin', I'm on the next tail

Hands free, callin' up my nigga Warren G
I pull strings, like Mya Landske
Bulletproof, emotint you can't see
Mr. G rollin' up weed, Afghani sense
Bad MC, Mike Fiend, you the know spinage

Like wintergreenmint, talk shit
Sleep with the fish, you cement
New residence, with no hesitance
It gets tints on the floor, staple center chick
Next to Denzel and Nicholsen, Phil Jackson whistlin'

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination in the industry
Here comes another one

Mean mugs in the club, mean nothing to us
In South scene, me and the team trying to fuck us some sluts
Dying to fuck, I chuck us when we step through
Poppin' our collars with our nephews

Next to you, you got millionaires moving
Hitting the dance floor, stealing their groovin'
Doing they damn thing and ain't worried about a damn thing

But man, that's the celebrity ways
Poppin' a litty got some rappers scared of these days
Industry ways, that's how Hollywood pays

Uh, top dollar when I dip my Impala
In front of the club, make your woman wanna holla
(Holla)
At a playa though, what's your dude yo?

I keep it gangsta, I ain't trying to be rude hoe
Oh, you know how that shit go
Or give when cats get fed off the four or fifths

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination in the industry
Here comes another one

[Warren G]
I once knew a girl named LaShonda
Short little cute thing
With a pinky diamond ring
She was iceless
My game was so priceless
Givin her a facial
I was G'd up
From the feed up
Pushin the bent
With the midnight tint
Huh, heaven sent

[Mista Grimm]
I once met a girl in the valley and
Half black half Italian
Ass like a stalian
Coke bottles shake
As she likes to watch herself on tape
Breakin nuts shake, but wait there's more
She keeps my nuts in her mouth like a squirrel
Pranksta with a pearl
Held my balls so long
I call trouble when I'm with my girl

[Warren G]
There's a law for that
We ain't trippin, we hogs for that
Uh

I met this Puerto Rican named Sehonnie
She was as bad as Carmen
Chillin in New York and I cracked her in Spanish Harlem
Straight dime
Body bangin like a baseline
And the face fine
I had to spit dip waste time
Mr. Passionate
Everything her body was immaculin
The presence like a gift to men and got packaged

[Boss Hogg]
Fuckin fabolous
She say ""damn he fat""
Then I still fuck the ass (how you do that)
Push up on 'em till they fall to the plot, damn it
Uh, hog 'em while they fuckin roll, goddamn it
Call me fat boy with a fat dick to mash
To lick me baby and I might lick you back

[Damone]
Lickin you back
She's gaggin with a dick in her trap
And stickin is fat
I'll pull it out and tickle your cat

I put the smash on her like Shaq
She want the cash on her
I ain't havin that
You need to check yo' trap
I got rose cap
G'd up, 213, please believe that

[Mista Grimm]
I stay pimpin in a bubble I Benz
With hoes stubbled up and cuddled in the back with my friends
I slide up on 'em like a cross fader
The hook up later
And serve this dick like a waitor
I ain't tryna date her

[Damone]
When it comes to bitches
I got more game than the olympics
I get up in their mind and analyze and twist this, psychology
For no reason I'm recievin apologies
Break her down mentally
Have her stockin and follow me

[Boss Hogg]
Trick be swallowin me
For a nine on the vein
'cause I'm the fuckin boss, she's my employee
I ain't hatin, I appreciate you freaky ass style
Yo nasty ass ?, eat a dick and smile

[previous Chorus - 2X]",It Ain't Nothin' Wrong With You,2001
Warren G,"Been such a long time since I held you
All the while you used to talk to me
All the things you said made me so strong
You know what, I would say I would keep movin' on

Sometimes I sit back and think about how it was
When I was young, I used to think it was you I couldn't live without
Somehow, life took a sad route
Sometimes the wind blows bad enough to take a plane down
Your straight bullets killed children on playgrounds
Bullshit got me about to smoke a whole pound

Meanwhile, I smile, hoping I can rebound
Somehow the LBC streets ain't the same now, without you
Things ain't been the same since you ain't around
But I stay strong game tight, hold it down
Warren G, I never played a blackground
This song is fucked up, because you gone

Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again

Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again

Nothing means more to me, than family
When one lost, it's sad to see, damn it's me
A friend you will always be
Above all things, you taught me to pursue my dreams
With joy it brings, at times when I sit and think
I know inside you smiled down, proud at me
I just need one more drink, damn

At night I can't sleep, I admit that its hard to eat
It's all good, I ain't trippin'
Tried to show me the right laws and guidelines
But I ain't listen, I'm sitting here lavishing and living
And I'd give it all back because you still missing

Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again

Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again

Lord please hear me, ease my soul
I woke up one day and my mom was gone
I'm in the zone wishing I could call your home
Sing your song, tell ya that I'm out on tour
All alone, I just needed to hear your voice on the phone
Mother and son, though I'm grown

Life moves on, I need you Mom, a quiet storm
Differences and right and wrong
As I move on, since Warren G ain't gone
The stitch is on, set the tone, the page I'm on
Is having fun, having a ball, living life
I'm still here, wishing you was home

Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, again and again

I still see you standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
How it makes me reminisce
Over and over, over, over, over

Again, again, I miss you
Ohh Mama, don't know, Mama, don't know
How I keep it strong, keep moving on
Keep it strong, movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, movin' it on
Keepin' it, oh Mama, keepin', oh Mama

The things she told me
I promise I'll be the same to your grand children
What you worded me
Don't worry

I still feel you mama
The things you say
I feel your arms around me everyday
Oh, Mama, oh I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know

I know you're there
Smiling down at me

Girl you got that good chocolate pudding
The best in hood, what's goodin'
She got the wizard of west wood, like old John Wooding
But how could I need that
I'm looking for feedback, because I can't believe that
I fell into a little tree sap
I got a woman at home, ain't fell in love where the weeds at
Started off with a dime, but by the time I was thug
She was less than a duece, I'm telling the truth
Confessing with you, I'm just messing with you
Because on the real baby girl, you put in the S in Snoop

See I rock baby, nonstop baby

I see you picky lady, you be tweaking lady

You put the G in the dub, we hot fuckin' in the tub
I ain't trippin' off baby, so why you trippin' off 'cause
I'm trying to get my money right
So you could kick it with baby, but get your mind right
What the fuck is up, you messing with a G
Warren to the L to the be	 and the see

Warren G,"Take notes young locs, I advise y'all to slow down
Glocks, K's, and eagles trying to put a murder down
Watching fools servin' found
Put your eyes on the prize, hitting switches
And getting bitches with plenty riches
And if you bang homie, do that
But when your ass gets slapped with that 25, handle that
And all you see is the glamor and gold
Don't know the other side of the game is where it's scandalous and cold
Your destiny is in your hands, you got control
Wasting time with your life until your ass is old
Trying to be bold, a hog and a pimp
Eighteen years old, HIV in the limp

Can't fuck with, what you asked for
Sometimes you just should let go
Get what you need and not want

I just had to have

Bangs with me, nigga let me swang with you
Hop in this cut dog, and split this game to ya
I see them niggas that got ya tatted and called it paddering
A clutch and a glock, banging on niggas at the bus stop
Putting in work, leave you broke, cloke white shirt
Doing dirt trying to gain strikes for the turf
Loc, what up, shit I knew your brother
You used to bang with him, when you was a little motherfucker
Until they amputated both of my legs, circled the block

When I wake up in the morning, when I get up out of my bed
At all times I remain a hustler, at all times I be chasing my bread
Since this one's for my people, I'ma make sure you heard what I said
Daddy say speak loud and clearly, daddy say aim for the head
I think we all to cool to lose it, I say we all stay leveled instead
I say still we tame the hookers, I know we still eluding them feds
We make this one for the Negroes, and for the Caucasians who care
They say they treat us like we equal
I say they treat us like we just don't care

I will always chase my bread

I'm gon' speak so loud and clearly
I'm gon' aim straight for yo head

Yo, I wake up late but still got currency
Dreams, snooze button no I'm trying to sleep
I got bill and the ends ain't trying to meet
So I'm pressed for cash and I'm out of my league
Ya' see, times ain't the greatest and I ain't Ali
So my hours are nine to five and my job's the street
I'm in a low position trying to hope these mission

And the block West stat and the spot we sure have
Rallies on Manchester, Inglewood on Saturdays turn to night
Shade always been the type to show love to those whom always doin' right

Yo, it don't matter where you from
Not knowing not where you been
Can't go to sleep a child expect to wake a man
Yo, life is a lesson niggas who don't study
End up failing test and blame it on me
But see Sheist only gets what he claiming to be
A real quiet motherfucker with his heart in the streets
Hot in these beats, flow sell a lot in a week
So even Billboard couldn't drop my highest of peaks
I'm with the breaks so you knowin' what they saying to me
I'm impressed how many people end up hating on me

Yeah, Warren
LA indo, gangster and mack mo
Bullets at your window, dangerous

Ruthless, hostile, unforgiven, who gave you permission
To try to stop me from livin', huh? Try again faggot
You've gotta ride better than that
To move out in front of the pack, it's two thousand and two

My backpack raps got my backpack
Strapped and filled with plaques
I ain't relaxed or laid back at home with my feet up
I drop Pravda, lock and load, heat the streets up
You weak fuck

Shakin' and dancin'
Y'all takin' pills, we takin' penitentiary chances
I'm too advanced is
Never the same when I hit it and quit it
You want it come get it, I'm wit' it

When I say that I'm wit' it
That means I got a main defense team that's gon' get me acquitted
G's is walkin' out the courtroom like George Jefferson
Stop the interviewin', the faggot had it comin' to him

Warren G

What y'all thought, I wasn't gonna return with a hit
Too much smokin' that Sherman shit
I learnt this from the best that got y'all sprung
The, the doctor Andre Young

Compton, LB, ain't nothing y'all can tell me
Goin' hard on the yard till my dogs bail me
They tells me I can't proceed wit' it
I came back and got Warren G wit' it

West coast, still smoking on that indo
Smoke, oh no, don't pretend, oh no
I woulda came but I was dead broke, no mo
I'm rollin' on some real, oh no

'Bout to get it, but niggas trip though, let's go
I'm the realest and they all know real dope
You need a filter or you will choke, indo
That's all a nigga will smoke, oh no

Now, niggas better get between their door, door
I'm shakin' all your shit onto the floor
And niggas don't get it
But be careful what you ask for you just might get it

Yo the undisputed middle weight champ runnin' like Hopkins
Clap six to ya shins niggas start hoppin', Shiest never stoppin'
In other words, if your click full
Can't press mute and it don't apply now

I'm feelin' funny in the tummy
And a nigga ain't been eatin' for weeks, I'm sick
I ain't trying to get no better but rather
Infect the world leavin' Vicks in a old sweater

Knoc's landin', tell me if it ain't me, who got the best planin'?
Who got your ears tuned it and who keeps you listenin'?
Who gots your undivided attention?
Who makes your panties wet, girl?

Hold up, pause, which nigga on TV
That you see makes you wanna give up the draws
At parties and shows, I mash regardless
Yo hardest flows couldn't stop this bombardment
I clench the vision till there's no room for expansion

All prepared for war it's Knoc's landin'
A nightly stalker, in shadows I walk
Mindin' my own while haters throw soft
The more I succeed, the more bitches clock

Through my peripheral vision, I watch subconsciously
Waitin' to introduce you to tragedy see it's Knoc's landin'

Every since I could remember
I had friends I could depend on
Clothes to lend 'em
But as time went by
My life got a little strange
And the rules of the game seem to change
Trust, honesty and devotion
And money, money, money is the poison potion
There's no way that I can even say
That this game has been good to me
Or even bad to me it had to be
Cause tragically the way this shit
Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically

Byt how could she do what I
I mean I'm do or die

Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me the spy who loved me 
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
 
Nobody does it better sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Did you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin' but just keep it comin'  
How'd you learn to do the things you do?
 
And nobody does it better 
Makes me feel sad for the rest

Warren G. top dog 
Patrolling the beach 
Riggers say they hard as bricks 
But they soft as a peach 
Climbin the G of all G's 
Please 
I come blowin through like the breeze 
Sitting on the threes 
Post it coast it and mash it down 
Pacific coast in the bomb chrome rims 
Black on black Yukon 
With nuts hangin from the city 
Where the bangers be bangin 
It don't seem like shit is changin 
I hollered at a homey the other day 
G'd up at the park 
Sippin Alisay 
One of the homies took a beatin 
So now we'll start to be a gang 
Checkin at the meetin 
Life cycles repeatin 
It's just another sunset fall and see 
I can hear the homies that pass 
Calling me 
And you know what I discover 
What they keep sayin 
Keep your mind and your money 
Motherfuckers 
And shake busters 

Uletaj na kryl'jach vetra

Have you ever sold millions 
But yet you niggas persist to talk shit 
Get off my dick 
Ya never catch me slippin 
Rollin with the heat 
Slap the clippin 
I never thought the world 
Would start trippin 
My life's a though 
Hit the crypto 
Blow the whistle 
They think I bang 
So I pack a pistol 
Warren to the G. is a G. 
I don't fuck with you nigga 
So don't fuck with me 
Let's ride to the East Side 
Slide like a fo 
I pack a 44 
When I'm steppin out dough 
To the bang to the boogie 
If I speak then I spoke 
Warren G. you do it every time 
Till ya low 
Get the party lit 
Like blazin smoke 
The East Side of the beach 
West side of the coast 
You know the niggas that arrive 
With hogs 
Attack dogs 
To say niggas are down to die 
With motherfucker

I've been from London to Japan 
Stomp land to land 
And to the Egyptian sands 
You can't check me 
Disrespect me 
Ya mock me up 
With the bass bumping out my truck 
And all these police tryin to lock me up 
Money rules the world 
And I made the loot 
So don't make me shoot 
Cause trying to match'll get you down 
Every time 
I ain't trying to hurt nobody 
But I'm down for mine

You ready Eiht?

[MC Eiht]
Yeah, c'mon

[Mack 10]
I was born to ride, banging, pack heat
Got turned out early by them scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pulling jewelry licks
Moms said, ""Mack, baby watch for danger""
I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gang banger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twisting triple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""
Get the eighty eight skate, ang get your slide on
Throw the Hoo-Bang plack in the back and your ride on

[Chorus: x2]
Ride for me, I'ma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo ride on, get yo slide on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west

[Eazy E]
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
Eazy motherfucking with a chrome to your dome
Cruising, in my 6-4 rag top
I got a lot of juice, a lot of fucking block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncing
More bounce to the ounce and I'm clowning
Keep the gat in my lap cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps cause I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep, nigga I don't sleep
Bury motherfuckers in the concrete
You try to creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I'm peeping niggas out in my left window
So I blast, and I blast, so I blast no more
Yo, they call me motherfucking John Doe

[Chorus]

[MC Eiht]
Real thugs roll cause the Westside's sick
Which enemy depicts to catch the 9 clip
Slick, but not like Rick, the gang story
G's kill and ain't shit funny like Joe Corry
Don't make me laugh cause I""m on the wrong the path
Catch the blood bath, it's the aftermath
Slang strike to make money, now ain't that simple?
That silly nigga's wearing vest's but we aim for the temple
Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo
So and so gets blasted, to the casket
Never seen these west side G's face, we masked it
Y'all best be defeat and be discreet
Catch the hot heat from across the street
Take me in the dump schools that, wanna push me
Retaliation, straight better than hitting pussy

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren g was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Some brothas shootin' dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""what's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""

Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said ""damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly
Let me contemplate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin'
It's a tad bit late
Nate dogg and warren g had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up cause it's on

Just like I thought 
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the g-child
Were in need of something else

Platinum city, where the big gamers be 
Involved in everythang from Pop Warner 
To what's poppin' on every corner 
Find a skirt if you want to 
Tryin' to come up in this world 
Where everything is drama 
Beverly was like my mama

Tryin' to get in where I can fit in 
Catchin' a bus with a homey I can trust 
3 homeys from the hood straight kickin' up dust 
Enjoyin' my days and everythang is fine 
15 years old Snoop d whoop on the grind 
Tryin' to find ways to make it, dice shake it 
Young, havin' fun, like me Snoop and Nate did 

We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 
We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do 

I remember all the scams we been through, together 
Nobody does it better on which you do the weather 
The days we used to call first year playin' get like me 
Gettin' in fo of zines, I loved em 
Long Beach was the hometown 
And every spot that we rocked, you know we got down 
Outside at the club just spittin' raps 
And every busta that ran up was gettin' cracked 
Underground tapes used to be the claim to fame 
Long Beach Was A Mutha was a classic mane 
Tellin' tales about how we was strugglin' 
And surrounded wit tha homeys that was all clubbin' 
Tryin' to make it in this music 
Quick fast, quick cash, and hittin' on the quick dash 
We in this game to make hits 
And make everybody respect the G-Funk click

To sellin' million overseas 
Rollin Dees 
And makin' money by the trees 
To killer Bees, evading all enemies 
Catastrophies, young GFC's 
We made it now, livin good wit no hassles 
But still a lot of problems dealin' wit shady acts doe 
Its all a part of makin' hits doe 
See our careers take off like a US missile 
Break out the crystal 
I spitted it, and now its g funked out, transmitted it 
So you can call it what you want 
We still goin bring the funk 
G's up put it down, and ya weed to float 

We be havin' fun, no one could do the things that we do

Warren Galjour,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it

From the scene of yet another murder mystery 
It seems that entertainer Snoop Doggy Dogg has been murdered 
We have no information at this time 

(I won't be insulting and try to transcribe it)

As I look up at the sky 
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye 
My body temperature falls 
I'm shaking, and they breaking, trying to save the Dogg 
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming 
I stop breathing, damn I see daemons 
Dear God, I wonder can ya save me 
I can't die my Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby 
I think it's too late for praying, hold up 
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
""Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better"" 
And how long will I live? 
""Eternal life and forever"" 
And will I be, the G that I was? 
""I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of 
So relax your soul, let me take control 
Close your eyes my son""

I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner 
It's gonna take a miracle they say 
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway 
I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet 
And everything that nigga said, came to reality 
Living like a baller loc 
I'm having money, and blowing hella chronic smoke 
I bought my momma a Benz, my Boo-Boo a Jag 
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad 
""Just remember who changed your mind 
'cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine"" 
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed 
Never have a want, never have a need 
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo' 
Cause my eyes want to journey some more, really doe (check it out) 

Now I lay me down to sleep 
I pray the lord, my soul to keep 
If I should die, before I wake 
I pray the lord, my soul to take

""Murder was the case that they gave me"" [Repeat: x2]

No more indo, gin and juice 
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the gray goose 
Shackled from head to toe 
Twenty-five with a izz-L, with nowhere to gizzo, I know 
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face 
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care 
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair 
Niggas stare as I enter the center 
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay 
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor 
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off 
Cause you can't tell what's next 
My little homey Baby Boo he took a pencil in his neck 
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two 
I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Fallen down, just like a shooting star
With no fallen angel standing by
To carry you away

Hit a few right between the eyes

Long as your're playing, boy, you're bullet-proof""

Saddest sound that I ever heard
The bluest note that nobody could play
Ravens sang with us that night on the stage
Tears of sadness, tears of rage
But nobody spoke, we all felt old
And in the way

So walk beside me
Or above me, I don't know
These days it sure seems
I'm lost where ever I go

God, how could you, I heard someone say
And what do we do with our lives now anyway?
Now that our North Star can no longer be found

But there's a banjo moon in a tie-dyed sky
Hippies dance and babies cry
Church bells ring as a silver-haired angel look down
And the blood of his music runs through the veins of our guitars
Bright lights, Dark Star

I never knew you
But then who really did
If you were at all like me
You managed to keep yourself hid",Patchwork Quilt,2004
Warren Hayes,"He wore a song around his neck
Like some medal of honor
He carried his wisdom like a knife
An empty pocket was a temporary chain
Knowing you've got it coming
Ain't no crime

Every blue note that rolled off his tongue
You could feel his soul twisting right in two
Nobody knew where he came from
Ah but everybody knew, everybody knew

He was the real thing
No doubt about it
The kind that you remember when they're gone
The real thing
Put here for a reason
We knew someday the whole world
Was going to know his name
He was the real thing

She whispered in his ear, and he heard the thunder
Singing 'bout a world he never knew
Head spinning round, he began to wonder
Was he made to love her, or born to sing the blues

He searched inside him for an answer
But all he found was a troubled mind
He left her somewhere on the blue highway
Oh it wasn't just another love that he left behind

It was the real thing
No doubt about it
The kind that you remember when it's gone
The real thing
Not like passion's fire
But a burning, smoldering, eternal flame
It was the real thing

And sometimes at night he longs for her whisper
But he hides from the dawn, 'cause he always wakes to find her gone

In some broken down dressing room in some major city
The thunder plays an old familiar tune
He spies a face of a distant angel
Outside, beneath the halo moon

Finger on the trigger, needle in the vein
One more bullet, it might be your last ride
This is ain't no no-show, this ain't no nervous breakdown
And it sure as hell ain't the time to let the fool decide

This is the real thing
No doubt about it
Who cares if they love you and you're gone
This is the real thing
So you were put here for a reason
But what gives you the right to quit when you're tired
Anyway boy, this ain't no game
This is the real thing

He wore a song around his neck
Like some medal of honor
He carried his wisdom like a knife

Last night was a world I've never known 
Parallel universe in one small room collided 
Now the seed is sewn 
Time, time, my friend, we've been through so much, it seems 
Alone together till the end

And, now, though I find this all so threatening
I can feel it, sinking into my skin 
The gods must be nervous, can't you feel it shaking inside you
World must be trembling like I am

Clouds must be breaking, blood raining down from the heavens 
And it feels like gold, tastes like wine 

Strength has always been my enemy
Solitude I've known like my own name 
People, by now, know what to expect from me
Nothing, and I will do the same

And you're back out on the street
And you're tryin' to remember
How do you start it over
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man

You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time

The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no
You just loved the boy to well, farewell

So you live day to day
And you dream about tomorrow, oh
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To make them go away
I could have done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wonderin' what I left behind
And from worrying 'bout this wasted time

Ooh, another love has come and gone
Ooh, and the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me before you went out on your own
Sometimes to keep it together, we got to leave it alone

So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time

On your soul

So please forgive me
For putting you in my song
But the spirit she moves me
In fact she pushes me along
It's a patchwork quilt of a life
Can't stop the river
Just let it roll

We were at Jones Beach
When we got the word
Saddest sound that I ever heard
The bluest note that nobody could play
Ravens sang with us that night on the stage
Tears of sadness, tears of rage
But nobody spoke, we all felt old
And in the way

So walk beside me
Or above me, I don't know
These days it sure seems
I'm lost where ever I go

God, how could you, I heard someone say
And what do we do with our lives now anyway?
Now that our North Star can no longer be found

But there's a banjo moon in a tie-dyed sky
Hippies dance and babies cry
Church bells ring as a silver-haired angel look down
And the blood of his music runs through the veins of our guitars
Bright lights, Dark Star

I never knew you
But then who really did
If you were at all like me
You managed to keep yourself hid",Patchwork Quilt,2003
Warren Haynes,"People say that you're no good,
But I wouldn't cut you loose, baby, if I could.
Well, I seem to stay down on the ground,
Baby, I'm too far gone to turn around.
Oh, if only you would make up your mind,
Take me where you go, you're leaving me behind.
Lord, you got those come and go blues,
Lord, you got those some and go blues,
Yes, you do, oh and you got me feelin' like a fool.
 
Round 'n' 'round, 'round we go,
Don't ask me why I stay here, I don't know.
Well maybe I'm a fool to care,
Without your sweet love, baby I would be nowhere.
Here I'll stay, locked in your web,
Till that day I might find somebody else.
I don't know just when that would be,
I don't know, I can't say as I can't see.
Lord you got me feeling like a fool.
 
Sail on, darlin', sail on
Woman, you go your way, and I'll go mine
Seems to me, that I once heard
That everything is finally cured by time
So sail on, darlin', sail on
Lord, I wish you good luck
And I'll see you when you come next time.

Warren Haynes,"Tim he was a good friend
Yea was a brother of mine
We were imaginary comic book superheroes
Kids wasting time

We were prisoners of our youth
We were growing up strong
'Till the day he was taken away
For something he did wrong

Tim came 'round just the other day
And boy he had some stories to tell
His mama kept him locked up in a rehab
Although the doctors said he was well

He said yeah I been through the anger
And the hatred towards my mom
And I put all that behind me
Just tell me what was it like to go to your prom

He said thank you mom for fixing
My clouded broken mind
But excuse me if I seem a little rude
While I was missing my childhood, 

My brother and my prime
You enjoyed the convenience of my solitude
Well growing up these days just ain't easy
And the kids they're doing the best that they can

So mama you better think twice
Before you lock your kid up 
And throw away the key
'Cause soon your little boy is gonna be a man

He left me with these words

But my childhood is gone
And I'm not afraid of dying
I'm gonna grab the world by the horns 

And learn how to live

Can you see the tears roll down the street.
The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
I've been looking for my baby
And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more

That my baby she don't love me no more
You know the sky's been crying
Can see you see the tears roll down my door",The Sky Is Crying,2004
Warren Haynes,"Mysterious, blown in with the night
All this beauty captured in a frame
Visibly shaken, but never stirred
Drives them insane
I see the way she plays her men
And I know I've got to know her name

She's so beautifully broken
Shaped by the wind
Dangerously twisted
Here I go again

I see the way she cast her spell
It's like drowning in moonlight
Discards them she's done
They're lost in her twilight
I watch her move from star to star
And I wonder why, why it feels so right

She's so beautifully broken
You can barely see the flaw
Especially from a distance
Which is always how I fall

Why do I fall for the dangerous ones?
The ones that never learned to let go
And why do I lie to myself
And pretend that I can break her
When she's already been so

Beautifully broken

Warren Haynes,"I can' save you, but I can talk you down 
I can hold you, but I won't watch you drown
In my life, things have a way of growing downward
And I don't know if I can watch myself be a coward
Again

I don't know you like I thought I did 
But I will show you things that I kept hid 
In my life, I've always been the one that had to ruin things
So I don't know, like some dark angel pulling on my heart strings 
Again

In my life, things have a kind of ragged beauty
And I don't seem to know right from wrong 
Or so they say, unless it's happening to me 

People change, I don't know what for
Strangers walking in and out my door
Something's got to change, the past just hangs here to remind me 
One of these mornings, I'll reach for you 
And find me

I have told you, I won't watch you drown
I can't save you, but I will be around",In My Life,2004
Warren Haynes,"Hey, are you still here in the morning light 
Last night was a world I've never known 
Parallel universe in one small room collided 
Now the seed is sewn 
Time, time, my friend, we've been through so much, it seems 
Alone together till the end

And, now, though I find this all so threatening
I can feel it, sinking into my skin 
The gods must be nervous, can't you feel it shaking inside you
World must be trembling like I am

Clouds must be breaking, blood raining down from the heavens 
And it feels like gold, tastes like wine 

Strength has always been my enemy
Solitude I've known like my own name 
People, by now, know what to expect from me
Nothing, and I will do the same

Wash our struggles away

Shine down on a brand new day
Yeah, we're gonna rise up singing
Like a bird on the wing
A million hearts beating
To the rhythm that the new day brings

I might need some company
Someone I can relate to
Someone other than me
I'm tired of these conversations
I keep on having in my head
But it's a long way home once you've made your bed

I'm sick of my shadow
Want to shed my skin
Sick of my shadow
What a shape I'm in
Sick of myself, and everything I do
I'm sick of my shadow since I lost you

Oh yeah so I got some problems
What else is new?
I spend too much time in my black and white world
Trying to paint it blue
But we cant all be like you, dear
With your million dollar smile
Some of us don't bounce back
We stay down for a while

All I need is that one shot
One big lucky break
I can finally wipe the slate clean
Pay for all my mistakes

Lose this chip on my shoulder
Keep my demons at bay

She's a teaser and she's got no heart at all.
She's a teaser and she'll tempt you 'til you fall.
Yeah she'll tempt ya 'til ya fall.

She sips gin from a teacup, wears those fancy clothes.

Seem like a long, long while
Sometimes the thoughts of you
Bring tears to my eyes

While the times that bring a smile
I remember what you told me
We would always be close in our hearts
Must be easy to sleep in another man's arms
We're so damn far apart

On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
Just making me a fool
I can almost see your face
On a real lonely night

There's a picture of you hanging on my wall
Such a lovely girl
Sometimes I feel like breaking into pieces
Like you did to my world

Oh, and other times I wanna hold her in my arms
Like a ball in chain
I look till I'm through loving you
I can never love again

On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
Just making me a fool
On a real lonely night
Just no way to pass the time

I walk around and I talk to myself
Pretending that it's you
I can almost see your face

I can't hold you
Like we used to do

I can almost hear you laughing
And feel your warm breath on my skin

Warren Haynes Band,"I never knew you
But then who really did?
If you were at all like me
You managed to keep yourself hid
A patchwork quilt of a life
Memories embroidered
On your soul

So please forgive me
For putting you in my song
But the spirit she moves me
In fact she pushes me along
It's a patchwork quilt of a life
Can't stop the river
Just let it roll

We were at Jones Beach
When we got the word
Saddest sound that I ever heard
The bluest note that nobody could play
Ravens sang with us that night on the stage
Tears of sadness, tears of rage
But nobody spoke, we all felt old
And in the way

So walk beside me
Or above me, I don't know
These days it sure seems
I'm lost where ever I go

God, how could you, I heard someone say
And what do we do with our lives now anyway?
Now that our North Star can no longer be found

But there's a banjo moon in a tie-dyed sky
Hippies dance and babies cry
Church bells ring as a silver-haired angel look down
And the blood of his music runs through the veins of our guitars
Bright lights, Dark Star

You managed to keep yourself hid",Patchwork Quilt [Soundtrack] [*],2012

That the people still have a choice
And we don't want violence
Until there's no other choice

Wash our struggles away
The sun is gonna shine
Shine down on a brand new day

Bells will be ringing
Flames reaching to the sky
Higher and higher
Fueled by the winds of change
Sweet taste of freedom
Fresh on the tips of our tongues
And the dust of the past is all that shall remain
Echoes of our voices
Ringing all through the town
Will drown out the memories
Of the days when we were bound

The river's gonna rise
Wash our struggles away
The sun is gonna shine
Shine down on a brand new day
Yeah, we're gonna rise up singing
Like a bird on the wing
A million hearts beating

What else is new?
I spend too much time in my black and white world
Trying to paint it blue

With your million dollar smile
Some of us don't bounce back
We stay down for a while

One big lucky break
I can finally wipe the slate clean
Pay for all my mistakes

Keep my demons at bay

Gonna make it on my own

And make him feel so alone

Blowin' through my aching bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said, boy, in the darkness before the dawn

He used to say the soulshine

Hey now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine 'til the break of day

Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
A woman too, god knows, she can feel like this

Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.

When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.

It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide,
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Jazzman take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.

He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Had wings

I have done

I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.

Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all","I Surrender, Dear",1994
Warren Vaché,"Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Warren Vaché,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1995

Warren Vaché,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all

For tender words that harmonize with love

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings

And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Every treasure on earth to be young at heart

It's much better by far to be young at heart
