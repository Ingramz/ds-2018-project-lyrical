Justin Hayward,"You don't need to ask me if I'll be your friend
I am
I am
You don't need to ask me if I'm sure my friend
I am

I am your friend
You must remember me
I'm the one who saw through the world's disguise
Took away its cloak and I made it hide
From me
Remember me?

Walking on this earth finding you
You, you
Walking on this earth finding you
You, you
What can I say
You don't need to find the words to say what's on your mind

If you need a reason to begin again
I am
I am
You will find an answer at your journey's end
I am
Waiting there my friend
You must remember me
I'm the one who knew you when
I'm the one you call your friend
Feel free
Remember me

Justin Hayward,"Billy left home one morning, he walked right out the door
He said goodbye to his former life and he never came back no more
Oh Billy, there's anger in your heart
Oh Billy, there's madness in your eyes

He took his favorite handgun, with his rifle he felt free
He cleaned them all the night before, he was armed as he could be
Oh Billy, there s anger in your heart
Oh Billy, there's sadness in your eyes

'Cause it's a sad world where there's no one
Who can reach out to the source of your pain
Yes, it's a sad world, such a sad, sad world
When only peace comes at the end of a gun
Oh, woh

He found the tallest building, like a bird's nest in the sky
He shed a tear as he took his aim at the people passing by
Oh Billy, there's anger in your heart
Oh Billy, there's sadness in your eyes

Well it's a sad world where there's no one
Who can reach out to the source of your pain
Yes, it's a sad world, such a sad, sad world
When only peace comes at the end of a gun
Oh, woh

Before he pulled the trigger he knelt as if to pray
And at the top of the church he will never be found
Since he took his life that day
Oh Billy, there's anger in your heart
Ah Billy, there's sadness in your eyes

'Cause it's a sad world where there's no one
Who can reach out to the source of your pain
Yes, it's a sad world, such a sad, sad world
When only peace comes at the end of a gun

Yes, it's a sad world when there's no one
Who can hold you when you just need to cry
And it's a sad, sad world when there's no one
Who would care if, if you live or you die

And it's a sad world
Such a sad, sad world
It's a sad world
",Billy,1996
Justin Hayward,"One more illusion shattered, one more broken dream
Oh, that the morning brings the sun
Gone are the days when I could bounce right back again
See how the tears flow down like sweet summer rain
Where does it leave me now?
I find myself so free again

Even the smallest traces of your sweet perfume
Open the floodgates and I'm helpless
Now, as the moonlight shadows, cast across my room
Only the whispered words are heard in the night
Only a silent prayer, I love you still, I always will

Out of the dark, I stumbled into the light
Only my fear has tumbled, I think, I always knew
That I would run to you

Somewhere there's children playing, somewhere far away
Running with open arms to greet me
Over the hill, the sunset dies and fades away
I turn and I close the door with one last goodbye
I will return no more, I'll take my heart and let it fly
",Broken Dream,1996
Justin Hayward,"I was driving down a lonely highway
As the sun went down
I pretty a voice right beside me saying
Why don't you turn around?
Why don't you stop feel the wonder
And listen to the sound

And I heard it I heard it
I heard it, I heard it

Have you listened to the bell at midnight
On the still night air
It sets you dreaming of the strangest journey
Across the great somewhere
Then you start the brave adventure
Dreams without a care

Well I heard it I heard it
I heard it I I heard it

Like leaves borne on the wind
Our words will fade and die
Only to return
As new life by and by
The passions that we feel
Like lovers wild and free
Are footsteps on the sand
Holding back the mighty sea

There's a place a secret garden
And when the day is done
We'll lie among the grass and flowers
Underneath the sun
As we look up the sky is turning
With the earth we're one

Well I heard it I heard it
I heard it I heard it

Passion that we feel
Like lovers wild and free
Are footsteps on the sand
Holding back the mighty sea

There's a voice that calls us onwards
Down the lonely street
When we tread the path no longer
The clrcle is complete
A million souls scream in anguish
And others rest in sleep

Well I heard it I heard it
I heard it I heard it
Yeah yeah

Well I heard it I heard it
I heard it I heard it
",I Heard It,1996
Justin Hayward,"You say to me, why can't it be
Just like it was once before
Well you lead the way and I'll find the tree
And you catch the leaves as they fall

Don't you know that it's not too late
The time's not past
Don't you know it's not too late
And even though I tell myself, all is lost
Somewhere there's a spark of hope
Somehow the world keeps turning
Promising a better day
Somewhere the spark is burning, away

If we were free to do as we please
What would we change, you and I
To hold back the night, to do what is right
To live under bright blue, blue sky

Don't you know that it's not too late
The time's not past
Don't you know it's not too late
And even though I tell myself, all is lost
But somewhere there's a spark of hope
Somehow the world keeps turning
Promising a better day
Somewhere the spark is burning, away

As we look to the horizon
Way out on the sea
See the sun still rising
Just for you and me

When we were young, life was so strange
So complicated, we would cry
But when we grow old
Will mystery hold us both in its spell as time goes by

Don't you know that it's not too late
The time's not past
Don't you know it's not too late
And even though I tell myself, all is lost
Somewhere there's a spark of hope
Somehow the world keeps turning
Promising a better day
Somewhere the spark is burning, away

Don't you know that it's not too late
The time's not past
Don't you know it's not too late
And even though I tell myself, all is lost
Somewhere there's a spark of hope
Somehow the world keeps turning
Promising a better day
Somewhere the spark is burning, away
",It's Not Too Late,1996
Justin Hayward,"They came from nowhere, with nowhere else to go, 
They came with nothing but pockets full of dreams, 
They came in hope, looking for The Promised Land. 
They brought their faith, believing in their hearts, 
They brought their children, searching for a new start. 
They came looking for The Promised Land. 
And all the rumours said it was Heaven there 
And all the signs were pointing to a new world, 
Someway, somehow there's got to be... a place for us, 
Somewhere... there's got to be. 
A better way, a new beginning, a second chance... 
It's all in the new world. 
Equality, liberty, freedom... 
It's all in the new world. 
A better life, a brighter future, the right to believe... 
It's all in the new world. 
For you and me, it's going to be... freedom... 
It's all in the new world. 
Through the ages, all through history, 
They braved the deserts, sailed the raging sea, 
And left their homes, looking for The Promised Land. 
They brought their culture, pride and prejudice, 
All they wanted was a reason to exist 
And still they come, looking for The Promised Land, 
And all the rumours said it was Heaven there 
And all the signs were pointing to a new world, 
Someway, somehow there's got to be... a place for us, 
Somewhere... there's got to be. 
A better way, a new beginning, a second chance... 
It's all in the new world.

Justin Hayward,"Everywhere I go, I see our shame
Everywhere I go, all I can see is pain
I see it on the pavements, it's lying in the streets
I see it on the faces of the people, I don't meet

And everywhere I go, I hear the sound
Crying in my head, it just goes round and round
I hear it on the airwaves, it's coming down the wire
It's starting to consume us like a fire

But I'm only dreaming, as you can see
I don't expect, that you should follow me
The road is lonely, I don't complain
It's such a shame

Everywhere I go, I feel the love
Washing over me, I just can't get enough
I hear it in the music, that's coming down through me
I know there's love between us, if we only set it free

And everywhere I go, I feel the joy
Hold it in your heart, don't let it be destroyed
'cause all we need is freedom, and all we ask is peace
All we ask is no one on their knees

But I'm only dreaming, as you can see
I don't expect, that you should follow me
The road is lonely, I don't complain
But it's such a shame

'cause all we need is freedom, all we ask is peace
All we ask is no one on their knees

But I'm only dreaming, as you can see
I don't expect, that you should follow me
The road is lonely, I don't complain
But it's such a shame

It's such a shame
The road is lonely, I don't complain
But it's such a shame

Hey, it's such a shame
I'm only dreaming
I'm only dreaming
Hey, it's such a shame
",Shame,1996
Justin Hayward,"Little brother's got a habit 
That he thinks he's getting under control 
And he's selling all our love 
And best wishes as the hunger grows; 
Living by the scripture on the subway walls 
He wants to be a rebel but he can't find a cause. 
He needs something to believe in, 
He needs something to believe in, 
All he ever wanted was to get away. 
Little sister's getting serious 
With a fella nearly twice her age 
And she's aiming to move in with him 
As soon as they can find a place; 
There's no getting through to her there's no other way, 
You can't learn from mistakes that somebody else made. 
She needs something to believe in, 
She needs something to believe in, 
All she ever wanted was to get away. 
Caught in the void of no hope and o choice 
It's a 'nobody win' situation. 
What can they do? It's a Catch 22, 
It's a breakdown in communication. 
Mum and Dad are so confused, 
Little wonder they don't understand, 
Little wonder there's a wind of change 
Blowing through this land. 
Nobody's guilty it's a sign of the times 
But we won't see the future till we open our eyes. 
We need something to believe in. 
We need something to believe in. 
We need something to believe in. 
We need something to believe in. 
All we ever wanted was to get away.",Something to Believe In,1996
Justin Hayward,"This time I'm not gonna go so crazy
I'm not gonna let it faze me
I'm building my resistance
Bound to keep my distance

Slowly, determined to take it slowly
Refusing to let it throw me
Feeling every feeling
Staring at the ceiling

And if it's real, a heart will know
All the time
And come the spring, it will grow
Or die upon the vine
But if it's love, love will come
Knocking at my door
I do believe it now
Sometimes less is more

This time I'm not going to stoke the fire
I'm not going to walk the wire
Oh heart you've learned your lesson
Love is not obsession

Easy, I swear that I'll take it easy
And passion you won't deceive me
I'll hear the music playing
Hear the songbird saying

That if it's real, a heart will know
All the time
And come the spring, it will grow
Or die upon the vine
And when it's love, love will come
Knocking at my door
I do believe it now
Sometimes less is more

And if it's real, I will know
Know this time
And come the spring, it will grow
Or die upon the vine
And if it's love, love will come
Knocking at my door
I do believe it now
Sometimes less is more
",Sometimes Less Is More,1996
Justin Hayward,"I was only a little boy when I heard the call
Like a voice in the wilderness, that calls to us all
So I took to the gypsy life, in the city of love
And I walked with the troubadours
And flew with the doves, in the city of love

In the garden of paradise, I heard a voice sing
I can still feel the thrill of it, the chills it would bring
Far away in the western sky, over the sea
There's a land that we dream about
Peaceful and free, waiting for me

Hold my hand, let me take you there
Let's go walking in the morning
As time goes by, love will wash us clean
Let love bring to us our freedom

And we will sing of the heroes
And fly on the breeze
Love with the lovers of the world
Oh! Oh! Oh! We'll be free

In the dark of the mystic night, music is born
In the hands of the troubadour, the piper of dawn
And it's heard on a foreign shore, over the sea
In the land that we dream about
Peaceful and free, waiting for me

Hold my hand, let me take you there
Let's go walking in the morning
As time goes by, love will wash us clean
Let love bring to us our freedom

And we will sing of the heroes
And fly on the breeze
Love with the lovers of the world
Oh! Oh! Oh! We'll be free

Hold my hand, let me take you there
Let's go walking in the morning
As time goes by, love will wash us clean
Let love bring to us our freedom

And we will sing of the heroes
And fly on the breeze
Love with the lovers of the world
Oh! Oh! Oh! We'll be free

We'll be free
",Troubadour,1996
Justin Hayward,"I took a walk
Down by the prison wall
I didn't know
I couldn't see
The side of the wall
I needed to be

I Looked at the sky
I looked at the clouds still rolling by
Worshipped the sun
Giving it's life to everyone
Yeah I watched the clouds roll by
'cause we are all equal underneath the sun

That's the way
That's the way of the world
The way of the world
That's the way
That's the way of the world
The way of the world

I took a ride
Over the ocean wide
I didn't know
I couldn't see
Who I could trust
Or who trusted me

I travelled the earth
Trying to find the good and the kind
I had to choose
If I should win, or if I should lose
Yeah I had to choose, the way
'cause we are all, equal underneath the sun

That's the way
That's the way of the world
The way of the world
That's the way
That's the way of the world

A turn of the page
Can read like before
Can we ask for more
Each day passes by 
How hard man will try
The sea will not wait
You know it makes me want to cry, cry, cry

Wish I could be in your heart
To be one with your love
Wish I could be in your eyes
Looking back there your were and here we are

Isn't love strange

With no thought or care
Maker of despair

With love we must weave

Justin Hayward,"Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war?
'Cause when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door
Because the truth is hard to swallow
That's what the war of love is for

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way that you mean it
When you tell me what will be
And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me through

Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me
But in the Grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me to

Justin Hayward,"The summer sun is fading as the year grows old
And darker days are drawing near
The winter winds will be much colder
Now you're not here.
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn

Oh how I love you

Gazing at people, some hand in hand

Repeatedly defeated I've been messed about
Kicked in the head and out of the bed
Kicked into believing it was something that I said

But tonight I think I'll drown in my sorrows, again

They say I'm to blame, it's all my fault
And take the things I say with just a pinch of salt

And then I spend a lifetime trying to make it right

But oh tomorrow things will change
But tonight I think I'll grow up, get out of my brain

'Cause one day, someday our love will change the world and you'll come back to me

We put our faith in God and man
And one of them betrays us every chance he can
We stumble on in wind and rain
And even in the sunshine we get burned again

But oh tomorrow things might change
But tonight I think I'll drown in the music that's keeping me sane

There must be truth, there must be love

The world is full of lovers underneath the stars above
And I'm still here, still rolling on
Trying to get our love into every song

But oh tonight I'll dream of you
I'll dream I'm lying there in your arms dreaming of you

He said I'm goin? to west Texas

I said hell you've gone crazy

Ain't nothing? out there but coyotes and Comanches

But he headed out anyways as far as he could

He'd finally buried his roots


He sold whiskey and cigars to passing through settlers

But nobody wants to settle where there ain't no damn water

Then they figured out a windmill could pump it from the ground

And up sprang a tumbleweed town



Where the lonely wind blows like it's angry for being there

A flat piece of stone in the middle of nowhere

The town never grows cause nobody can keep their roots down

It's just a tumbleweed town


They came in like gypsies to steal the black gold

The town's population increased a hundred fold

But they scattered like quail when the oil wells ran out

And left no trace of the riches they'd found


Then some big shot from Dallas built a factory out here

Gonna put us back on the map

But hell that was back a few years

Now weeds have grown up and the buildings falling down

You'd think they'd figured out by now

It's just a tumbleweed town


Where the lonely wind blows like it's angry for being there

A flat piece of stone in the middle of nowhere

The town never grows cause nobody can keep their roots down

It's just a tumbleweed town


A few hayseeds and ranchers still hanging in

Too old to start over to damn stubborn to quit

And their kids all get restless waiting for a Greyhound

So they can get the hell out of this tumbleweed town

No matter where in this country I might roam
It's where the corn grows tall and the moonshine still flows
It's the only place that I call home

A word is good on a handshake

People gonna stop when a funeral passes by
We say yes sir and say yes ma'am
Answer the call from Uncle Sam
And a boy really knows change to hit a bully in the nose

A hundred yards from the spot where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand on the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peelin' peaches if it was twenty years ago
What I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him

If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talked
Find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Tell 'em we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch him wave
And losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away

I'd hug all three of those girls we lost
From the class of ninety nine
And I'd find my bird dog Bo and take him huntin' one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in fifty three
And Janis to sing the second verse of ""Me and Bobby McGee""
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile

Over and over I hear you in my head
Over and over I wake up with you not in my bed
Oh baby when you coming home
A day without you is a day without the sun 

[Chorus]

It's killing me, killing me
How I can't get no love without our combination
Killing me, killing me how I get so choked up with every conversation
Killing me, killing me how I'm left in the rain, while you are on vacation
Baby please let me know when you're coming home
And I will meet you at the airport station [x3]
Baby when you coming back

Justin Nozuka,"I threw a bottle in the air and it smashed into a thousand pieces on the concrete street,
Where the children play in bare feet
We ran as fast as we could, cause I might have woke the neighborhood
Oh I don't feel too good, no I don't feel too good at all
'Cause when the sun comes up and the children wake, get on the street to play,
I'll be the one to blame

I'm a criminal, I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal, I'm a criminal

It didn't last too long, no I passed out, woke up and the guilt was gone
Without a care I walk down the stairs, into the kitchen eat my breakfast there
Turn on the television screen,
Emergency News Team
Little girl crying on the street saying ""glass made my feet bleed""
Oh tell me what am I gonna do
I'm for sure done
What am I gonna do,
I have no choice but to run

I'm a criminal, I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal, I'm a criminal

Change my name and move to Mexico
Dye my hair red and get surgery on my nose
Buy a small condo, stay low in Mexico
Don't it sound so sweet, get a wife and raise a family
Start my own limousine company
Stay low in Mexico
It never snows in Mexico

I'm a criminal, I'm a criminal",Criminal,2008

Down in a cold dirty well and I cannot climb out
Can't see no light
Can't hear no bells
They walk right over me
Can't hear my yells 

They state me missing and search all over the town
Look left and then right but don't ever look down
Dig me my grave, I won't be saved
No I won't be saved, so dig me my grave

Cold and lonely

The deeper I sink

Would you go or would you stay
Would you go or would you stay

Here in this cozy room just me and you
Cuddling and kissing, making sweet love,
Shooting star wishing and watch the sun come up
And then we'll sleep all day
Meet in our dreams and live life our way
Drop it all off and we'll fly away,
Dip through the stars and wake up slowly

Justin Nozuka,"I fell in love with a voice in the midnight air,
Gliding across the room she was studying me
Such a simple thing to do
The touch of her hand,
A question 

[Chorus]
If I gave you my life,
Would you let it slip,
Through your fingers like water in the dessert
If I gave you my heart,
In the deep of the night,
Would you hold it like a candle giving you light 

Days fell away into years
Sunset memories
Standing on the edge of it all she was worrying me
Such a typical thing to do
The reach of her hand-
Connection 

[Chorus]

Life fell away from her voice in the midnight air
Lying on the moonlit ground she was looking up at me
Such a simple thing to do
Just as simple as the way she fades away

And through the flames
My baby left me
Without a trace

She took my money
And left the ring
And she didn't leave one clue
Of where she was going to

My baby up and left me alone
She signed 'Goodbye' on the letter that she wrote
My baby up and left me, now
Mr. Therapy Man, I need to ask you how can I live on?
Live on

Hey, hey
How could she do it? Break my heart away
When she used to be the one crying when we were apart?
I gave her all of me, gave her my soul
And that was exactly what she stole from me

Well my baby up and left me alone
She signed 'Goodbye' on the letter that she wrote
See, my baby up and left me, now
Mr. Therapy Man, I need to ask you how can I live on?
Live on

Took my money, she left the ring

Remind me one last time that you won't ever go

And birds won't fly without the stars in the sky

I can't feel without your touch
I can't dream without your smile

Justin Nozuka,"She loves him more
He loves her more,
Seems like they won't ever let each other go,
Laughing and kissing it's a match made in heaven
Behind the rings on their fingers
Imprints the ink deep in the inner
That has stained their souls together now
Stained soul mates forever now
Seems like they've made it to the other side where the grass is greener
And the sky is always blue
And it goes on forever and ever but there is only room for two
Deep at night I'm awakened from my dreams,
Next door, yelling cries mercy she is begging please
""Don't end my life you're all I need and darling I will never leave""
And then she prayed on her knees, she said 

[Chorus: x4]
""Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on"" 

Dark clouds cover her paradise,
She covers her eyes and hides behind enemy lines,
And she walks through the night with her child in her arms
She's thrown back hostage'd
See twenty years ago when she was just ten years old
Lost in imagination she was left alone
And pops had nothing to let his anger on oh he beat her cold
She used to pray on her knees, she said 

[Chorus]

Deep at night I'm awakened from my dreams,
Next door, yelling cries mercy she's begging please,-
""Get up, get up"", he brings her to her feet,
And smacks her down till she falls to the ground
And over and over again,
He brings her to her feet till she can no longer stand -
And still the beating never ends
On and on and on it goes
Until he brings out a gun
And says to her ""stop crying and bring me my son""
She cries harder and harder
He cries harder and harder
She says ""baby please don't do this""
Two shots to her chest
And a blow to his own head
She quickly loses breath and blood rushes to their bed 
And baby cries his eyes out

And only you can lift my spirit

A thousand tears every time I think of you
Lock the pictures away,
Hide the letters too,
Anything to get my mind off you

You just walked by me like nothing ever happened
When you said you would rescue me if I was ever falling
Well now baby there's no way that you could have forgotten all of the memories
I thought we shared
We were supposed to grow old

Mississippi, you're on my mind, 
Mississippi you're on my mind.

Specked with dirty cotton lint, and below the
Field runs a little shady creek, and there you'll
Find the cool green leaves of mint.

I think I smell the honeysuckle vine, 
The heavy sweetness like to make me sick. 
And the dogs, my God, they're hungry all the time 
And the snakes are sleeping where the weeds are thick.

The southern sun just blazes in the sky. 
And in the dusty weeds, an old fat grasshopper jumps. 
I wanna make it to that creek before I fry.

Before I slip and fall, and fall again

We're just afraid of where we've been

If I could say your name it wouldn't come to this
And if the timing's right we could be just fine

If you could find a way to wait then I could stall
And calm back down before I slip and fall, and fall again

You wouldn't try to mess with me
And though we've been here before

The way you feelin on the outside
Reflects how you feelin' on the inside
Tell me now have you really ever stopped tryin
So many people killin
Kids still dyin or multiplyin'
I ain't lyin here's my testimony
The shit I kick is real never ever phony
You spittin cheesy lyrics like macaroni
Call me if you only want to sit down and write a jam
That stands for Somethin'

Because my passion and rage are highly concentrated
This underground music movement is way too underrated
Pop music done came
Had its five seconds of fame
Now it's time to throw a wrench all up in they game

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters quitters, cowards
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

I know you feel the pain I conceal
Hip hop flip flopped to gain pop appeal
Upon the backs of MC's with integrity
Rap music made wack a celebrity
I ain't worried why be in a hurry
Giant steps are made in inches and snakes tend to scurry
When my steps are taken no room for move fakin'
Your titles exect your visions blurry so hurry hurry
Catch the force of all my fury
I'm growin leaps and bounds from the mound which you been buried
Feed off yo energy
Two times infinity
MCs are meant to be controllers of mics

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

We trek this battlefield life

but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

Ese habla como yo
why habla muy lindo
why no es cierto lo que dice

Now the slick text in this here context
is just far too complex too far out to be fetched
So as I sketch check my patterns, my shades and tones
Freak in the microphone is yours truly saucer
The dope rhyme flosser
I got something for all you wankers and tossers..
With dollar budget pushing low grade quality
That's like ghost face sportin some no name walabees

Now I be damned if I sit on my ass
While these MCs tresspass cross my grass
Time to landscape
Reshape the garden for growth
Spread the message overseas, via remote

We got different types of flavas but they taste the same
All biters no writers in this hip-hop game
I blame myself plus you for things we do
It's not wonder why we stay under and don't bust through because..

Check it out
The way you feelin on the outside
Reflects how you feelin' on the inside
Tell me now have you really ever stopped tryin
So many people killin
Kids still dyin or multiplyin'
I ain't lyin here's my testimony
The shit I kick is real never ever phony
You spittin cheesy lyrics like macaroni
Call me if you only want to sit down and write a jam
That stands for Somethin'

Because my passion and rage are highly concentrated
This underground music movement is way too underrated
Pop music done came
Had its five seconds of fame
Now it's time to throw a wrench all up in they game

I know you feel the pain I conceal
Hip hop flip flopped to gain pop appeal
Upon the backs of MC's with integrity
Rap music made wack a celebrity
I ain't worried why be in a hurry
Giant steps are made in inches and snakes tend to scurry
When my steps are taken no room for move fakin'
Your titles exect your visions blurry so hurry hurry
Catch the force of all my fury
I'm growin leaps and bounds from the mound which you been buried
Feed off yo energy
Two times infinity
MCs are meant to be controllers of mics

Tu eres mi nena, mi nena, las demás se me envenenan 
Cuando yo salgo contigo, porque ninguna te llega 

Oh oh! 
Dile que le pongan para ahí 
Por que yo estoy para ti 
Y tu para mi

Llegó el fin de semana 
Y ella ya no aguanta las ganas 
Lleva esperando toda la semana 
A que yo llegue y le haga 
Lo que quiera, a mi manera

Quiero que estés dispuesta a dar lo mejor de ti 
Como esa noche que te conocí 
Que te pusiste fresca conmigo, me decías cosas 
Que ahora me hacen sentido 

Como: Maltratame pero no de abuso 
Enloqueceme, haz algo confuso 
Si yo se lo que quieres, que no haga pregunta 
Que te bese toda, es lo que te gusta 

Llegó el fin de semana 
Y ella ya no aguanta las ganas 
Lleva esperando toda la semana 
A que yo llegue y le haga

Total, dejemos la noche terminar 
Quien sabe lo que pueda pasar 
No quiero asumir sin preguntar 
Si te puedo llamar 

Adiós 
Dile a tus amigas que te vas 
Que del baile no aguantaste más 
Que se te subió la calentura 
Por la cintura

Llegó el fin de semana

Quería una nueva aventura 
Nos pasamos de copas y le cuento que ella es una dulzura (una dulzura)
La llevo pa' mi casa, nos besamos e hicimos travesuras (travesuras)

Pero habita el frío en mí (vacío, vacío)

Dicen vivir día tras día 
Pero no creo en esa poesía 
Estoy planeando mi futuro para siempre estar al día 
Si caigo me levantaría hasta más fuerte todavía 
No hay nadie que me detenga 
Como el tren que está en la vía 
Hay muchas cosas que diría y me las callo observó analizó 
Y te apunto todos los fallos 
Quiero que seas mi polla 
Pero ya tienes tu gallo 
Y te canto del corazón, pa' ti no existen los ensayos 

Pero habita el frío en mí (vacío, vacío)
Todas las tardes pienso en ti (lo envidio, lo envidio)
Pero habita el frío en mí (vacío, vacío) 
Tú con él ya eres feliz (lo envidio, lo envidio) 

Quisiera en la mañana ver la profundidad de tu mirada 
Callarte con un beso para que no digas nada 
Cafecito con tostadas el desayuno hasta la cama 
Que sientas como es que este hombre te ama 
Lo que es mío lo reclamó 
Si llega el día y juntos estamos 
Quiero que grites mi nombre y que sepan cómo me llamo 
El vino ya me tiene raro 
No una flor tú eres un ramo 
Vamos hacer algo espontáneo 
Así nunca nos olvidamos

Que hace que me la coma completa
Le quité la ropa y ella no me dijo nada
Al igual que yo, yo sé que se siente elevada
Se dio un trago atrás de otro y como si nada
Me dice que cuando se lo haga mire su cara

Y me llama su monstruo
Por la manera como yo la rompo
Todo empezó con un baile
Y ahora la estoy virando al revés

Y me llama su monstruo
Por la manera como yo la rompo
Todo empezó con un baile, con un baile

Voy calentándote
Son las tres y cuatro 'e la mañana pa' ser exacto
Voy calentándote
Tocándote, donde no habías sentido 
Temblando y no de frío 

Y me llama su monstruo
Por la manera como yo la rompo
Todo empezó con un baile
Y ahora la estoy virando al revés

Y me llama su monstruo
Por la manera como yo la rompo
Todo empezó con un baile, con un baile

Her lips are dark
Her ankles thin
Oh my dizzy ballerina, won't you give us a spin?
My country's cold in autumn's chains
Every time I think of her it rains
When she breathes upon the morning
She shakes all the weather vanes

Now I try to keep a steady hand
Because I'm living in a shaky land
Lord I try to be an honest man
But it's tougher than I ever planned
In the westbound air tonight are those centuries
My tongue-tied beheaded bride
The Alberta breeze

Oh David drive like you've never done
Oh Sarah sing like you've never sung
Oh my dizzy ballerina spin like you've never spun
Now I'm sending you a telegram
About my days in the caravan
With the steers and the bleating lambs
Took the money and away I ran
I recall how the dress you wore rose above your knees
As the thrush flew from the mouth of the Alberta breeze

The summer's turned it's back on me with a sorrow-laden symmetry 
With a highway kind of robbery
Like my life was an apology
Now I don't think about you all the time

I'll see you at the station.

There's a beast inside of me,
And he's not bad company
But he speaks in tongues I can never understand,
He says it's one more show and a penny for the band.

Keep everybody dancing,
Keep everybody spending,
I know I am not a good man,
But I can keep pretending.

I made it in a doorway,
Your dress is like a dark vale,
But I'm not going your way,
I'm going back to heartache.

Where she waits on the balcony,
With a northern wish and a daisy in her hand,
To send me all her love and a penny for the band.

In places we used to belong they're playing our song
I hear them playing our song long after the embers are gone

It took the kindness of strangers to bring you in

Because home is wherever they take you in

When I was younger, I never went too far
Held my feelings, I never even wanted to start
Til when I met you, I didn't know
What you were gonna do with my heart

When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do

And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
In my world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl

When I'm not with you, wherever you are
Baby,I'm counting the moments til I'm back in your arms
All I want is to have you here with me every night, every day

I kind of noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face will change

Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'

Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids ask ""how the chain glow?""
Point to her they say, ""wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me I say, ""yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a alike
You have me sleepin in the same bed every night

Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots let it burn in your chest
We could ride down pumpin N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number 3, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your, brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track

And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life
And all you had to do was apologize
You didn't say you're sorry

You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me

You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me again

Sadness has me at the end of the line
Helpless, I watched you break this heart of mine
Loneliness only wants you back here with me
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me

You picked a perfect day to bump into me
Probably should've watched the stars in the sky the night before
But for some reason we still met at your store

And I have my whole life and I listen well
Look, I'll be your confidant
Tell me anything
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings

There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between

Except you're not green

And all my meaningless friendships should be done
You had a friend but he did you wrong
But I'm a God sent sign that reads
Please move on with me
You taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes
And that's the way to His kingdom of eternal life
Since you're an angel, baby your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 9-1-1

You should know that

The beautiful lights, the star-filled nights
They don't mean a thing
'Cause you are my star, so it don't seem right
Without you here with me

Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know
It's hard for me to say
You were my soul

Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same

'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal
When someone's broken your heart, it changes how you feel
I thought that you would never do me that way

But even after all I still think of you that way
Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways

But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain
Now love is a game that we both like to play
When I win or lose, if I go or if I stay

Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside
Girl, you know me inside out
And I can't get you off of my mind
And I could say that I don't love you no more

You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny

Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport
'N told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door
The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for ??
Some scared at first, but usually those demand more

Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutterbug
A horny little parasite that all the women love to love
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was
Bubba fixin' to get it done, I put that on my brother ??

Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, justa whisperin'
Bubba so psst psst knowing that I'm listening
I ain't gotta chain, boy my peck[?] is all that's glistenin'
What you steamin' on folk, y'all ain't even disciplined

I ain't leaving nothin', this the house me and my people built
Huggin' me and dappin' me, buddy I can see your guilt
It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin' like you need a quilt

Get some show money from UGLY and buy a keg of beer
And another pig to give my other pigs some company
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary

In due time, but there's business left to attend to
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to
And another ? before my great aunt Missy
Yea, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy

Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about
He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good
Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could

I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy
Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop
Man I think you right, it ain't nothing but some hen??

Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally
I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be

An uncanny whit plus a time that is impeccable
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual
Confused them all at first so this time is understandable

Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now
Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown
Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds

But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Badness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Now, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt can you hear them cryin'?
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?

Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love?
The love, the love

Why are there pieces of love that don't belong

And when my waist go boom

See, girl, you stronger than the strongest drug I ever had
You could mix 'em all together, you still be twice as bad
'Cause you the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to kick than cigarettes and green bags

Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, ""How you do me this way?""
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah

They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab playa on these streets, I'm tryin' to holla at ya
Quit playing games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town

I just want to pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
(Is it good, is it good?) And have a little smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessey

Hi, my name is Bob, and I work at my job
I make forty-something dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Till I started to lose my way

It all goes back to when I dropped out of school
Having fun, I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See, I can't put down the pipe

And it's breaking me down
Watching the world spin 'round
While my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

It is breaking me down
No more friends around
And my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself

Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?

Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?

Now you gotta understand I was a family man
I would have done anything for my own
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See, I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is
I'll probably never know the color of my daughter's eyes

And it is breaking me down
Watching the world spin 'round

You spend your nights alone And he never comes home
And every time you call him All you get is a busy tone

That he's doing to you what you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

You cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case scenario
Tale as old as time girl, you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody That could come and make it right

But girl, I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy

When you wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't seen wit a man so fly
Friends so fly I can go fly private, 'cause I handle mine
B.I., they call me candle guy, simply 'cause I am on fire

I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try, you don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it, when I ain't so high

Justin Timberlake,"Dear mom, Alana's in her second trimester
Stressed out 'cause I'm gone, she acting all extra
We're happy 'cause she knows it's a girl
But we doubtful if we should bring another one in the world

An' the pic you sent with you, and the kids is da bomb
I'm keepin' all my photos in my 23rd Psalm
My best friend Armani lost her arm at the border
Just tryin' to restore a little peace and order

An' it's strange 'cause she reads the Koran
Torn between what side she needs to be on
Haven't slept for days, I squeeze Visine
'Cause no man's eyes should see what I've seen

Soldiers lost their mind, robbin', pillagin'
Tomahawk missiles into civilian villages
And they ease the pain with narcotics
I'm scared but I'm tryin' to remain patriotic

My father, forgive us
'Cause we know not what we doin'
And my brothers, how we gonna tie up
All these loose ends'

And my mother, tryin' to use
Ev'rything you taught me to keep it movin'
And my brothers and sisters, how we gonna tie up
All these loose ends'

New message from mom, at Bringbackthetroopsdot.com
At home they 'Nam, so sad you had to miss Shavonne's prom
Just some songs off the Marvin Gaye 'what's Going On' album
And her smile lit up the room

She asks me if at night when she stares at the moon
Is it possible at the same moment of time
You're starin' as well' 'Cause you two were in tune

Your dad's Purple Heart now hangs over his ashes
An' Trini's alive and wake up with hot flashes
They say the disease's gastric
Have yet to explain the migraines and rashes

And have you seen what the price of gas is'
We can't afford the property taxes
We just want you back at home
Where you belong with your family
You're the backbone

My father, forgive us
'Cause we know not what we doin'
And my brothers, how we gonna tie up
All these loose ends'

And my mother, tryin' to use
Ev'rything you taught me to keep it movin'
And my brothers and sisters, how we gonna tie up
All these loose ends'

Tell me how can we live this way
We've gone so far astray, no one knows what to say
We got young peoples lives at stake
What is it gonna take for us to find a way'

The world is changin', we in danger
'Cause we ain't changin our behavior
We behave like calm is nothing
Ain't concerned with repercussions, ain't that somethin'

Check 'em out now, pointin' fingers
When they know how we got to this point of terror
Precaution could have made the road clearer

But we stuck with mediocre leadership
So we'll just suffer
Who knows what the hell is going on
With conflicts they keep on growing

It's a fucked up situation
When you ain't got no education
On the problem or know what it's about
You gotta help me out",Loose Ends,2006

It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, I know a city that's surrounded by a beautiful beach
The economy boosted by the drugs they move in the streets
More clearer than the crystal sky, blue as the beast
The people ain't got shoes for they feet or food to eat
So they hurtin' but what's for certain
Is that you can get you some heat
And over beef you laid to rest like you was getting some sleep
Where the little kids get they rendition, you cant get no nutrition
Or any type of suitable living condition, listen
They shoot you over that paper, its just survivalist human nature
That put you out of your misery like youth in Asia
Don't let them fool you we ain't different

Than the youth in Asia, Africa, Europe it's a small world
we truly neighbors,
If they the third world then who the first to get to heaven
I know its hard but who does God choose to go through it worst
Usually it's the prophets asking a cat what really matters
Nowadays its his pockets

[Chorus:]
We gotta get back to what really matters
We gotta search our soul to find out what we after
The more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder
Mom and Dad don't forget to warn your sons and daughters
About the nature of the world today
The nature of the world today
The nature of the world today

[Verse 2:]
Don't nobody talk no more they on text message
Driving and typing not paying attention
Missing they next exit depending on navigation
Never knowing where they going they staying stuck
On one spot they not growing I'm so over crying waiting
And hoping playing the blame game
The game changed me into a
different world like Dwayne Wade
Getting high just to maintain
Take my music like a drug and drop the
Needle in the same vein
I get a rush like I'm tweeking off blow
Except it ain't via the nose it's from deep in my soul
The street slang I be speaking in code
Kicking the door, freaking the flow till they speakers explode
We in control the people know I speak the truth
The power and my roots
Is thicker than sour _ and I'm strongly busting out the flower pot
Family tradition is to tell them you love them
While your family living from granny and the kitchen _

[Chorus:]
We gotta get back to what really matters
We gotta search our soul to find out what we after
The more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder

About the nature of the world today

When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do

When everybody turns they back on you
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back

You spend your nights alone And he never comes home
And every time you call him All you get is a busy tone

I heard you found out
That he's doing to you what you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

You cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case scenario
Tale as old as time girl, you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody That could come and make it right

But girl, I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy

It's how we do what we do, man, when we do what we do

I know you see me looking, girl go on and act right
A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight
Now turn around, and let me see just what ya curved like
Go grab your friends, and y'all can come to the back, oh, oh

Why don't you take a sip upon this champagne?
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hour glass shape you got upon that frame
I like the way you talk your game, we might be one and the same

Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all of y'all
Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call
I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, oh, oh

And when I call, don't give me the run around
I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl
There ain't nothin' to think about
'Cause you got me feigning, but, girl, you don't hear me

Baby, are you new in town?
My name is Tim
Aka Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost
Do you know your way around?
If you gotta problem, baby, I can hold ya down

I can be your navigator or your compass
Better yet a genie, baby make your first wish
You the party, baby I'm just the guest list
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless

So grab your friends and let's take it back to my house
Let's watch Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives
Simon says touch yours while you touch mine
(Parental discretion is advised) Oh, oh

Y'all can be the star in my freaky spotlight
Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit, a little bit of act right
Y'all looking shy, but ya act like y'all don't hear me

You could mix 'em all together, you still be twice as bad
'Cause you the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to kick than cigarettes and green bags

Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, ""How you do me this way?""
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah

They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab playa on these streets, I'm tryin' to holla at ya
Quit playing games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town

I just want to pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
(Is it good, is it good?) And have a little smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessey

Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team (tell me would you)

I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try, you don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it, when I ain't so high

And after all the sky is falling down
And after all the waters washed away

When your doubts have got you thinking
Thinking
Nothings ever really sacred
Sacred
And you're afraid you might believe it
Believe in me
And I'll give you a reason
Cause the world around us keeps on moving
Moving
And there's no doubt that
I still love you

Let me see them big titties
Don't act as if you ain't pretty
Break bread if you wanna get wit' me
All I wanna do is dig off in them kidneys
Tell ya boyfriend he better mind his business
'Fore he end up in the trunk of my Bentley
I am still a boss; he can't hit me
He ain't got enough paper to deal wit' me
Baby girl, wanna two step wit' me
Turn around rub ya ass up against me?
Whoa, lil' mama done got tipsy
And then tonight, tomorrow you're history
All you haters wit' that ho shit miss me
I stay strapped, security don't frisk me
Set it off till this muthafucka empty
I turn around, do the same shit next week
Come on

Oh! There she go, just what the Doc's been lookin' fo'
She just what I need, black and Chinese like some young ho
I got a bungalow; we can disappear for a week or so (yeah)
I got a steady young flow, super bowl wit' it like I'm Dungy, yo (oh)
Yes, congratulations
You won a millionaire invitation
Sorry I'm so demandin'
But save the dancin' for back at the mansion, and
Ain't this money handsome?
Ain't, that a panty anthem?
I kill me, just like you
From the back you'll see

Hold up! Hell naw!
Like Britney Spears, I wear no drawers
In the club I drink it up, gulp, gulp, drink it up
Got Patron sippin' in my cup
That's ya man; I bet I can make him look
When he see the jugs, he wanna rush and get a quick touch of the big ol' butt
Mhm, big ol' butt, thick legs, big ol' jugs
Legs stick like rims on the truck
Take him to the crib; yep, we gon' fuck
You can call me a freak; I like to get buck
I don't have to do much to make you get it up
Some young ho - she worth two dollars
I'm worth more dollars than major beauty parlors
I pop collars, c-c-c-collars
I don't buy shots, I only buy the bottles
Only rich girls - we only buy the bottles
And, like a porn star, I'm best when I swallow

I'm a real producer, and you just the piano man

Sitting on the top; it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV; just let me clear the air
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it

Ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ooh, I've been travelin' on this road to long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone

Ever had one of dem days, you wish woulda' stayed home
Run into a group of niggas, getting they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong you reply
Then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you'll get jumped
That next, they don't wanna stop
There now they bussin', now you gushin', ambulance
Rushin' you to the hospital, with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit four times, plus it hit ya
Spine paralyzed waist down, now ya wheel chair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive,
Just think it all started you, fussin' with three guys
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way you
Could fuck around, get shot die any day
Niggas die, every day all over
Bull shit dope money dice, game ordinary hood shit
Could this be, 'cause of hip hop music
Or did the ones, with the good sense
Not use it, usually niggas
Don't know what to do, when their back against the wall
So they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blo' I guess,
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take time to think,
Before I make mistakes, just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say, the old me dead and gone away.

[Chorus]

I ain't never been scared, I live through tragedy
Situation coulda been dead, lookin' back at it
Most of that shit, didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it, when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit didn't, next thing ya know we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn, what a life I had
Most of that shit, look back just laugh
Some shit, still look back just sad
Maybe my homeboy, till be around
Had I not, hit the nigga
In the mouth that time, I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga, walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see, Philant no more
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
Ida took that ass-whoopin', now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there, talk shit all night
Cause I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight,
Now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes
Just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away.

I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north,
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone,
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight

Justin Timberlake,"Once was a man who consumed his place and time
He thought nothing could touch him
But here and now it's a different storyline
Like the straw he is clutching

Why has the sky turned grey
Hard to my face and cold on my shoulder
And why has my life gone astray
Scarred by disgrace, I know that its over

[Chorus]
Because I'm falling down
With people standing round
But before I hit the ground
Is there time
Could I find someone out there to help me?

Howl at the wind rushing past my lonely head
Caught inside its own motion
How I wish it was somebody else instead

Howling at all this corrosion

Why did the luck run dry
Laugh in my face, so pleased to desert me
Why do the cruel barbs fly?
Now when disgrace can no longer hurt me

[Chorus]

You see I'm falling down
With people standing round
But before I hit the ground
Is there time
Could I find someone out there to help me?

Hey Jamie, J-T
(Ooh)
It 'bout time to get back hot again man,
You know I'm fresh out this thing
Lets go

You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
I'm so up there and so out there
Your so not here
You see we so up there and so out there
(Let me get it right here first)

I'm wakin'
Up in the morning
Hustlin' to the stage and fuckin' performin'
Bustlin' in through the hate and bustin' the door in
Lately nothin' misses I must have been scorin'
Speakin' of the misses
I'm watchin' 'em pourin'
Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin'
And don't mean bottles you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin'
Feelin' like Jordan

(Aah ah) hold up I ain't finished yet
On top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut
I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands
Lemme say it again
(aah ah) you ain't heard I'm the shit
On top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

I'm stepping out in the evenin'
Keep women screamin'
He gotta be cheatin'
But I'm so breezy
I make this look easy
No fakin' I'm seasoned
You gotta believe me
I went from TV's
To screens to D-V-D's
To C-D's,
To M-P-3's overseas
I got no time to talkin' its borin'
Just look at me soarin'
Feelin' like Jordan

(aah ah) hold up I ain't finished yet
On top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut
I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands
Lemme say it again
(aah ah) you ain't heard I'm the shit
On top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

That's right,
You see the Porsche Panamera
Got em in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier
Hear me turning corners burning rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof
I don't run the money, money run to me
In this economy guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugatti's, Maserati, new Ferrari's I've got one of each
My future bright tight like picture guy in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection to failure I'm an exception
Fuck, if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessin'
You couldn't die in the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best no auto-tune
Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom?
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back money long as an old Cadillac
Ha ha

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball (its the King bitch!)
You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

Hey man you thought a little vacation could hold me back homeboy,
Man I'm back man
Brighter than ever, you understand that,
If you didn't like me then (ha) you gon' hate me now nigga",Winner,2010
Justin Timberlake,"Let's go,
Baby I gotta have some more,
(Turn the track up)
What's it gonna take to get a score,
(Turn the beat up, yeah)
Got me like a fiend banging on your door,
(I think I want some of that)
Why don't you meet me on the floor?
And then?

Step into my office won't you try to sample, a taste of my stuff
(JT: yeah c'mon))
I've got a million different flavors all the boys say they can't get enough,
Once I'm under your skin you're begging me for more,
You'll get addicted to this but baby you've been more,
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you when I'm on the floor, the floor, the floor

[Chorus]
'Cause I could be your dealer,
I can be your only friend when you need her,
I'll keep you coming back again,
You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine,
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix,
Then I'm your dealer, hey!
Love love dealer, hey (check it out)

All those other pushers they say
They got that good stuff that you already know
(You already know what it is)
That they can't do what I do, oh no,
I'll take you places you never thought you'd go,
I can get you so high with the things I do,
You get a rush in your veins and we start to move,
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you when I'm on the floor, the floor, the floor,

You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine,
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix,
Then I'm your dealer, hey!

JT: Baby I gotta have some more,
ED: Eyes roll back and you feel dizzy,
JT: What's it gonna take to get a score,
ED: Now you got me in your system.
JT: Got me like a fiend banging on your door,
ED: So now you know what you've been missing,
JT:Why don't you meet me on the floor?
And then?

You ain't gotta say that you like it,
I can tell by the look in your eyes,
Won't you give it a try, you'll be mine,

Justin Timberlake,"It's 11 o'clock and the last time that we talked
He said he's busy and he'd call me but he never called me back (no)
And now I feel like somethings going on
But I feel crazy every time I bring it up so I don't
He told me there's no one above me
And all my friends are telling me different and something seems funny

tell me do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love
I can still hear voices in my head like

I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on ya
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
Coz he's playing a part

Why didn't I see it from the start
How was I to know
It would bruise my heart
So fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see
Like a wave you took me under now it's so hard to breath

[Esmee Denters] (Justin Timberlake)
And I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know hey)

Verse 2:
I shoulda never given into his games
Shoulda only been the type that treat me the same
And it ain't fair coz I gave him all I had now there's nothing left
(these tears wil dry and you'll move on, on and on and on)
This songs the same thing
Can't keep fallin'
No more heartbreak

tell me do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love
Coz I still hear everybody's voice like

I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on you
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
Coz he's playing a part

Why didn't I see it from the start
How was I to know
It would bruise my heart
So fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see

Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know, hey)

I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know, hey)

Ask myself why why why

She'll be so disappointed.
Damn I forgot it too.
This could have been avoided.
What the hell are we gonna do?
My moms been so forlorn ever since my daddy left.
Cold.
No one to hold her tight.
Life has put her to the test.
I know just what you mean,
My moms been so sad and gray.

My dad can't satisfy her in the bedroom ever since he passed away.
Hold up!
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I'm thinkin' I'm thinkin' too.
Slow up!

Show 'em how much they really mean
'Cause

To me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover

I'm layin' in the cut waitin' for your mom
Clutchin' on this lube and roses

They will be so surprised
We are so cool and thoughtful
Can't wait to pork your mom
I'm gonna be the syrup, she can be my waffle
Sho nuff!
My mother loves bubble bath with chamomile
Straight up!
Give it to my mom d d d d d d doggystyle
This the perfect plan
For a perfect Mothers Day
They have to rename this one
All up under the covers day

'Cause I'm a Mother Lover
You're a Mother Lover
We should fuck each others mothers
Fuck each others moms
I'm pushin' that lady
Where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt that shit is crazy
Fuckin' each others moms

Break it down

It would be my honor to be your new step-father
It would be my honor to be your new step-father
While your in my mother make me another brother.
And I'm in your mother I'll never use a rubber
Oh!

'Cause every Mothers Day needs a Mothers Night
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin' on you cause I can't do it myself

The choice can be no other

Justin Timberlake,"Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on

Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out it's glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, I’ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor

If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass, I'm here trying to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren't you something, an original, 'cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare 'cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh I can't ever change without you, you reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I would look at us all the time

Louis, Gucci or Chanel, I'll buy the store
You and me on a nude beach, sippin' champagne
Making love on a island resort
No need to pack luggage, hope on the jet like ""fuck it""
I got everything you want and you need, I guarantee you'll love it
She the baddest woman you ever seen, she belong with King Magazine
You might seen her on a movie screen, she's so dope now I'm her fiend
Just thinking about her I don't need a buzz
We party hard, we don't need a club
Bring your passport we're making love in Persia on a Persian rug

When we go walking in the woods
Nobody can hear us
And you could be as freaky as you should
I love you at your weirdest
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call
I want you to be fearless
When we go walking in the woods
A natural experience
Go ahead

I got a Rolls-Royce baby that's yours
I got a private jet baby that's yours
I'm balling baby, what's mine is yours
You can have all that and even more
I got a black card, go on a shopping spree
I buy you so much ice, girl you can ski
Your old man tryna lock you down
Come with Juicy J and you'll be free
She got her own, she independent
We at the lake, she skinny dipping
In the hotel we wake the neighbors
They knocking like Jehovah's Witness
Girl we can kick, ever tried karate?
Out on my yacht we go island shopping
Back to my suite, ten grand a night
Just me and you, it's a private party
She's sent from heaven, mayne
She needs wings on her
I might have to put a ring on her
Damn she so bad, damn she so thick
I wonder how she fit jeans on it
For me she unleash her inner animal when we meet
And she a lady off in the streets
But a beast when we in the sheets

When we go walking in the woods
Nobody can hear us
And you could be as freaky as you should
I love you at your weirdest
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call
I want you to be fearless
When we go walking in the woods
A natural experience
Go ahead",The Woods,2013

I don‘t, but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type
Amnesia that’s over
I can see your breathing, girl, is colder
I can see you need me but I don’t care
My whole memory of me and love
Gone so far from me girl
It’s not fair
I could feel it almost start to change (almost starts to change)
But then it hurts too much
That’s when it starts to fade

So cold baby, now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?
Don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No we anymore, she’s a stranger that I used to know

Peaceful for those of us
So happy, so in love
Tell me what happened
Who are they? Where did they go?
And when was enough, enough
When did all the fire turn colder?
When did your heart start to beat slower?
My whole memory of me in love,is gone so far from me, It's not fair.
And I can feel it almost start to change (almost start to change)
But it just hurts to much, I let it go away

Come on
We are having too much fun right here

She's got a secret but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low
Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major

Now can we discuss
How fast you just got undressed
Girl if sex is a contest then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow
No I can't lie, I'm impressed
And no impatient encore
When love curtains close

It's a cabaret
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
Cause even though I'm a professional
I like to do my work at home

(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got
All I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)

Fantasy play the role
And all these new moves that I'd like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
Cause I got you saying Jesus so much its like we are laying in the Manger

Okay this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long till you get off from work
But listen I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya
Girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know
I’ll keep a secret for ya
I'm trying to ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep it soul stripping things slipping like a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O.
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

Don't stop 'till you run too far
So what's a man like me to say?
With a bullet laying in my heart
Damn girl, we go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do about this damn love
Is that shit in sync or insane, love
I guess that's the way we play it

She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away

What's that, baby, what you say?
You the one to light up this torch
'Cause I'm burning down all the way
Burn it down 'til there ain't no more
Damn love, how did the sound get so amped up
Turn off and silence this damn love
Is that shit insane or in sync, girl
I guess that's the way we play it

She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away

Baby when I finish what you start
but I can't hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Damn love, how did this shit get out of my hands love
I laid you to rest you said damn love

Justin Timberlake,"Red was the color of her eyes
And she put me in a meditation state
Her skin was white so white
Looked like it had no expiration date
Black is the color of the night
And it's time for feeding and her body waits
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me
When we raise hell I can't stay away

Aw, give it to me now
So evil in your dress
It circulates you start to feel it
Devil in the flesh
Once you start to invoke her spirit
Got you on the floor
She comes alive when your appearing
Hungry for some more

I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon, it's so mean, that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes me say

Now I feel my fever on the rise
In my bones and my body starts to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don't want to escape
All the other ones that have tried
Find out that they have made their final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type
She told me that she found her perfect blood mate

So evil in your dress
It circulates you start to feel it
Devil in the flesh
Once you start to invoke her spirit
Got you on the floor
She comes alive when your appearing
Hungry for some more

Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes me say

Your pheromones invaded my instinct
I start to seem like an animal
Roast me in your perfection, I'm mad, I don't wanna think
'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle
It feels like
The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle
Ooh sometimes it feels like

I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you

Make me wanna build a coffin for two

Tell me what your gonna do with me

That I met last week at the Payless (Shoe Source)

I also have a cutie to call
Who loves the way I knock on her boots

Well, it's time to mack
Let's handle that
In 2 to 6 hours
We'll meet back and regroup

Now let's shop!

Roll up to the crib
With some Bartles and James

Hop off the bus
With the Alizé

Now hold up, playa
What you diggity-doin here?

I should diggity-ask you the same! (Then she says)

Hey, boys, I want you both
I hope that you think that's cool (Say word?)
I know most guys won't freak together

But she forgot about the golden rule
Ah-hah-hah

It's okay
When it's in a 3-way
It's not gay
When it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle
There's some leeway
The area's grey
In a 1-2-3-way

Normally, I don't get down with dudes

But tonight is a special exception (Great)

See, you're my best friend
Through thick and thin

Now it's time to make a triple connection (Lights off)

Here in the dark (Here in the dark)
It's hard to tell (So hard to tell)
Where her body ends (La la)
And my homie's begins (Hoo-Wee!)

To ancient Greece (Talkin' bout Caesar)

To impress a chick
Helicopter dick, Go!
Helicopter dick (Uh!)
Helicopter dick (Alright!)
To impress a chick
Do the Helicopter dick! (Wow)

And all of that was okay
Cause it was in a 3-way
It's quite clear

But we'll say ""Hell no""

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

Walking the lost way of those who lived in loneliness 

Think of the joy and the endless days
One step aside and the skies were gre
why Is this a life or just a game to lose or win? 

Cause a day will turn into night
And the spirits will rise
There will come then a time to understand...
Deep inside 

Blessed by the rain falling from above
Could you imagine where life would take you 
Now that you're praying for everyone you hurt so bad? 

Still, don't you go, got to make a choice
Crying in silence, crying with no voice
Dare you to stay now and keep your strength up till the end?... 

Cause a day will turn into night
And the spirits will rise
Hold your breath, keep your eyes wide open 

Now you see: the night is so clear
And you feel: the spirits are here
Running free, running free without fear
You'll find a way to the brightest light... 

And now
Here I am, open arms
Thought your life was over when
There you saw in the sky
A ray of light,
So here I am 

Will the stars keep shining bright
Till one day they may ignite?
When you gaze at the sky above,
I'll ever come down
To ease your solitude... 

And now
Here I am, open arms
Thought your life was over when
There you saw in the sky
A ray of light,
So here I am

There will come a time to understand!!",Here I Am,1997

Well you say you love me and deep inside hell I know you do
So stop your crying now 
I'm already convinced that someday I'll be forgiven for this

Yeah, and if I know you
You won't have nothing to say
You'll just clear the tears from your eyes 
Long enough to watch me walk away
You won't curse or scream, no nothing that obscene
You'll just tell yourself you never loved me anyway

So tonight when you leave
Put the light out on the porch
Take anything that you want to keep and leave your key in the door
And I don't want to hear you crying no tears that show regret

Cause someday you'll be forgiven for this

Riding on a tanker, and feeling mighty low

If only I could only carry out my notion
Id hit the trail for Texas right away

I had a home and fam'ly when they locked me in this cell
I've been in here eighteen years a long long time I know
But time don't mean a thing to me cause I've got life to go
Well I went one night where the lights were bright just to see what I could see
I met up with the old friend who just thought the world of me
Well he brought me drinks and he took me to every honky tonk in town
Then words were said and now he's dead I just had to bring him down
Well it's been a long long time now since I've heard from my wife
I know I'd be there with her yet if I hadn't used the knife
Well I'll bet that little girl of mine don't realize or know
Her daddy's been here eighteen years and still got life to go
Well I'll bet there's not one man outside that's spent this long in jail
I'll be here in this prison till my body's just a shell

This is eternal life
We can see You, believe You

Living out its shame

There's a name for all our hoping out there

'When you feel betrayed you know they hated Me before
And when they leave you out, I will be the open door
And when you die inside, I will cause your heart to sing forevermore.
I am the Risen Lord, and I will go before.'

'Cause the world is not enough to fill the empty space that only You can know so well
So I wait to hear You once again

I will go before the darkness with a light that leads you home
And I'll raise up every valley that had once laid so low
And I'll make the path that lies ahead as straight as any path you've ever known

Justin Warfield,"Uhh! Check it out, yo; it's called, uh, well, uh
""K Sera Sera,"" whatever will be will be
And the track is kinda in there, so lemme bust a li'l
A li'l rhyme...

Check it out on the one, two, three...

Standin' 5'11"", and I'm almost 6 feet
18 years old, rock a new beat
Got no nickname, stay the cool sane
Kick the same rhymes, play the same games
To watch my back, but ain't no vics here
Bring in the new--that tune was last year
In strode the baby brother, comin' from the mind school
Flow from blue Bic, and paper's wide-ruled
If I had a penny for every note that I played
Or if I had a dollar for every bar I create
I guess that I would reckon, ""By golly, I'm gettin' paid""
Or better yet, ""I reckon it's time to be gettin' paid!""
So I sit and think, ""Well, should I pull my Plan 9?""
I'll leave it up to the powers and the stars
Since I'm from the cosmos of another planet, see
I believe my karma will guide me to my destiny
So I flow, not on the rhymes
But related to my shade of mind, or, rather, vibes
Que sera sera, what will be will be
Whatever's kinda clever, what the future holds for me
I guess it's just a thought, though my mind is kinda hazy
My name is Justin, baby

I got my skullcap on, then the flow from my mind starts
As I rip for days from the land of the mic arts
Cream of the crop, a cool, blue beatnik
Blessed with the gift, and now it's time to kick the ill shit
Love to eat the scallops, and quit with the doo-doo raps
Stay away from ill crack, listen to the Fatback
Smooth on a rough track, time to catch a catnap
If you are my brother, I'll be sure to give you much dap
Ya bound to get your head smacked, if you try to illjack
Get your kit from Acme, set yourself an ill trap
I used to talk of vickin', would step and finger-lickin'
But now my mic endeavors have improved over time
Oh yeah, I'm still the same brother who has got to pickin'
So listen to the moody groove, piano, and the vibes

Ahh, and ya don't stop. Yeah, ya know, yeah
And we the sure shit, guaranteed to be the ultimate
Ya got to keep it on to the break-of-dawn
To the rhythm, y'all, ya don't stop
And ya don't quit, ya don't stop
Ya gotta keep on, keep the flow on
And, baby, ya know you and the rhythm is always on
And I'm out...",K Sera Sera,1993

So you could call me black and tan when I'm a wreckin' a crew 
I'm like Bill Lee whacking when he's in Tangiers 
And now I'm out on the sole surviving with my Beatnik peers 
Analog reel and a little distortion 
Smokin' on somethin' s'you could say I'm scorchin' 
I never been the type to rap up a well 
Make a man burn his draft card like it was hell 
Send ya up the river like you lookin' for Kurtz 
I got the mugwump jism up in every verse 

(Refrain 2x) 
Bug powder dust a mugwump jism 
And the wild boys runnin' into some trippin' 
Led into control about the Big Brothah 
Try like hard to not blow my cover 

Who's that man in the windowpane 
Got somethin' on his tongue and it's startin' to stain 
Sho' nuff equip so wop n'get dancester 
Butt bond my ladder and you'll get beat down 
Hash bond style so I'm singin' day glow 
Wakin' up the dead like serpent and the rainbow 

Kick off the shoes and relax your feet 
Now roll up your sleeves for this lyrical treat

This is a sad day
The saddest day we've ever known
No, I never thought we'd come so far
Over means that fall so fast

Another car crash by the side of the road
We'll take one more glance till the story is cold
Draw the lines of whats real
Re-imagine the truth
Every fiction turns fact when its running with you

Any hint of trouble there's a camera awaiting
Every way you turn there goes another flash
We cling to the wreckage it's our guilty pleasure
And once you get the hunger then you can't turn back

This is a sad day
The saddest day I've ever known
We swore to hold our heads up high
We swore we'd look away

Another breakdown more fuel on the fire
Its just another bad dance of the sick and the tired
We memorize these lines, pretend that we're friends
With no consequence so we know how it ends

Any hint of trouble there's a camera awaiting
Every way you turn there goes another flash
We cling to the wreckage it's our guilty pleasure
And once you get the hunger then you can't turn back

This is a sad day, this could be the day we say 
I will not be a part of this at least just for today
Its hard to pick though, the reaction is mixed
I gotta get some bad news gotta get me a fix
Blur the lines of whats real, re-imagine the truth
Every fiction turns fact when its running with you

Any hint of trouble there's a camera awaiting
Every way you turn there goes another flash
We cling to the wreckage it's our guilty pleasure
And once you get the hunger then you can't turn back",Kling To the Wreckage,2009

Anything but empty rooms.
There's so much in life to share --
What's the sense when no one else is there? 

Anything but lonely, 
Anything but only me.
Quiet years in too much space:
That's the thing that's hard to face, 
And ...

You have a right to go, 
But you should also know
That I won't be alone for long.
Long days with nothing said 
Are not what lie ahead --
I'm sorry, but I'm not that strong.


Anything but lonely, 
Anything but passing time.
Lonely's what I'll never be,
While there's still some life in me, 
And ...


I'm still young, don't forget, 
It isn't over yet --
So many hearts for me to thrill.
If you're not here to say 
How good I look each day,
I'll have to find someone who will.

Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters, and a streetlamp gutters,
And soon it will be morning.

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me!
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day

In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there,
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

My/your spirit and my/your voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my/your mind

He's there
The phantom of the opera
Beware the phantom of the opera

In all your fantasies you always knew
That man and mystery

Were both in you

And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the opera is here/there

Inside my/your mind

Sing, my angel of music!

Somehow near

If I just dreamed,
Somehow you would

Never would

Cold and monumental,
Seem, for you,

Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Somehow here again

Say goodbye

Teach me to live
Give me the strength

No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years

I did try, but that's not how I live

I'm going crazy
Wondering how I'll go on without you

The scent of you
Reminds of the night that we became two

I burned with desire, when you touch my face
When you call my name, I burned with desire
But you left me in the rain

For every sleepless night, forever in your arms
For every hour spent, lost in the reverie
You broke your promises, no shame and no regrets
You burned the bridges too an endless mystery

When you touch my face, so beautiful
When you call my name, my name
I burned with desire, when you touch my face

And I'm really gonna spend it right 
Been a-doin' my homework all week long 
now the house is empty the folks are gone 
C'mon everybody
Well my baby's number one 
But I'm gonna dance with three or four 
And the house'll be shakin' 
From my bare feet slapping the floor 
When you hear that music you can't sit still 
If your brother won't rock then your sister will 
C'mon everybody 

Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside 
If the folks come home I'm afraid they gonna have my hide

I would love to get crazy in your body heat
But I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet

When you leave you leave no clues
So I reinvent the things you meant
All of this undeclared charade
Keeps me so unsure, always wanting more every day

I don't wanna burn for you
I don't wanna yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat (Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet

You stay to say the things you say
A long embrace, you walk away
And now my eyes are full of light
As I pretend that it's okay

I don't wanna burn for you
I don't wanna yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat (Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet

Coulda stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more

Where them sharks at nigga, down in the deep water

Mixin' up with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem

Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No releasing me, I got the beast in me
I gotta holla, keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer

I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)

Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro,1995
Juvenile,"[Juvenile]
I bust you in your motherfuckin mouth for talkin
The beast of beasts is in here, and 1 or us ain't walkin
Hope you got your boys and you straped tight
'cause this bout to be some shit you won't like
Picture this, a fome hot, to your dome hot
I was a bitch before I drew down, now I got a new sound
You found a nigga that you though was a hoe
He's probably from your family, you married the most
Who's the be, what's the beef, my lady she's pregnant
She's already 5 months, so we lookin at oh 3
My baby bout to touch down, man I can't do this with a frown
Bustin that niggas dick over my pops corner
All my people are probably wondering what's going on
Playin a chess game, gotta keep my eye on this mate
All the way from Adam and Eve, not fuckin Steve

Chorus:
I take It off your shoulder
Nigga I'm thuggin in the magnolia
You better do what I told ya
Unless you want to get fuck over

[Juvenile]
Watch yourself, it's getting bad and dangerous
We makin niggas so it's scared to hang wit us
We show them large and they stumble back
Ridin around every water in the chat
It used to be like that, till the driver drowned
That's niggas is doctor p, knock the niggas door down
He hit his head on bed, 24/7
I gotta deal with these niggas and bitches till 2:11
What are them niggas that are duckin the law
Who them niggas who just shot up your car
What you call them niggas that are ready for war
What you call them niggas that go too far
Hot Boys running with kerosene running through everything
All the way to shit, you never seen
To Magnolia and back
Niggas talk bout me but then they never seen
Seeing them niggas in the cages, duckin stages, thinkin they courageous
I'mma bust you in the head, my enemies trying to fled
See-Murder trying to come up here and murder
Some motherfuckin claim to representin
He ain't from the magnolia, so this shit ain't reminiscin
This is my system
Like an addiction that's like fiction
My victums can't see 'cause they bitchin
Don't worry, I'll make them believers
When my blood pressure get high and over steamers
This week will not be cut
'cause it's in God we trust
You niggas trying to check wit us
We'll make it so you respectin us

Chorus

[Juvenile]
If I was in the dinker, I probably be dead right now
One of these niggas tried to bust my head by now
I'll be ridin tonight, ain't no survivin
Now I got my enemy drivin, and ain't despising
This nigga be seeing the bright light
And when he gets in park, end his life
2 or my people, look nigga I'm planning
And when I see 200 keys of that sand
I'm a marked man, so I'll put that shit in your hand
I'mma be shacollin, all my niggas ballin
Juve you buyed it
Wayne you buyed
Turk you buyed it
Slim you buyed it
Baby you buyed it
Fresh you buyed it
B.G., ballers you buyed it
You and you, you buyed it
This motherfuckin investigation on me?
Saying they got shit on me
I'mma be kissing these alligations
They tried to torture and question me at the police station
They keep playa hatin, they keep statin
Niggas gonna be waiting, fuck that, I'd rather take my chances
Bitch in a minute, I rearrange shit

First Verse: [Juvenile] 



Scraped my elbow jumpin' the fence 

Creepin' through the grass camoflauged lookin' for them 

Cowards, non-believers, contradictors, I'm comin' to get ya 

You try to frame me without the picture 

Shit, I'm obligated, to be a Juvenile for life 

It don't change robbin' shit in this game 

I know you heard about that 7th ward, 9th and the rest 

But who's down to knock a head off and wear a vest? 

Take a flight through that Nolia and then see who represent 

Not with them thugs ridin' wearin' them black reebok tennis 

Niggas fifteen, sixteen, seventeen 

Slangin' iron from that Josephine through that Melphanine 

And would do almost anything to prove himself relentless 

Like, a murder job and forgettin' the consequences 

Hustlin' through the brick walls avoidin' the feds 

Pushin' the dope steady duckin' blue eyes and curly heads 

And he got caught and then start, runnin' with yo peers 

Got swole and been home and now you back out chea 

And that boyd that cha shot, brothas hangin' on the block 

You don't know him but he know ya look you bout to get got 

BOW!!!!!! Laid out in cold blood on the Ave.

Juvenile,"[B.G.]
UPT baby, this how we do around my way
Niggas struggle, they struggle and they hustle
But you can't knock the hustle, feel this

Nigga, I be comin wit dat drama that you can't even duck
Buck, buck, off the top, nigga you can't even duck
Baby Gangsta, heart stopper, car stopper
I tote this chopper, I'm quick to stop ya
You heard that I'll drop ya
I'm runnin wit some killas, we'll break it on down
Yo click think they an organization, we'll take it on down
Uptown in '97, it's the place to be
They packin M-11's nigga and 223
Erase faces all day, AKs get sprayed
That's how it be goin down around my way
V.L., UPT, The ward? 13th
I represent no matter what, respect or check me
Let me live through round 1, and it's all on you
I retaliate, you think the statue of liberty fall on you
Valence snort so much 'til they nose get sore
It's time to graduate, bags ain't doin the job no mo'
Now a needle and some dope, tap dat green vein
Smoke blunts sometime, it's all about that bank
My heart don't pump lemonade, it pump battery juice
Make me pump the trigga finga up when I'm after you
Now I strap a big dick by the Girbaud sign
You heard I'm fuckin yo bitch, so you grabbin yo 9
Movin up like you got it on yo mind
Flexin up for that pussy, you must don't mind dyin
I leave ya folks cryin, you won't take out the policy
It's 50 G, it's accidental so it increase to hundred G
And when it come, proper
I'm louder, popper
Around my way

[Juvenile]
Nigga, you must be real in the UPT
You would wanna be packin that steel in the UPT
I know you heard that them youngstas creep in the UPT
Niggas be leavin them white sheets in the UPT

[B.G.]
My block is hot wit killas, ATF be hittin
Niggas slangin and snortin, if we spittin we splittin
I put G's on the map, leave brains in laps
I hit da stage with drama, startin niggas to scrap
See my hood straight thugged out
You in my hood slippin, nigga you get drugged out
Ya body layin there, but ya spirit is shoved out
On V.L., it's hell when the coke drought, you assed out
When you hear my name, nigga, you hear my street, nigga
When you hear my street, nigga, you think six feet deep
You think six feet deep 'cause you know I kill
You spot me comin up the block, I'm in black wit a sparkle grill
You see, we tote macks, Glocks, and choppers
Playin wit them hoes, nigga slip we got ya
Rest in Peace, Hooley Hoo, 13 'til death
Thug 'til he die, now my nigga at rest
Runnin ounces by the half, birds by the half
Whatever you want we have, chumps we got it on the half
My people Big Stan, Uptown open shop
Funky Fades and Trimmings, 10 dollars a whop
If you real you make it, fake yo ass get shookin
Fo' you can look, you hit bitch, yo life get tookin
If you think, stay put, or feel the fire from the K
If you ain't from Uptown, stay from round my way

[Juvenile]
Nigga, you must be real in the UPT
You would wanna be packin that steel in the UPT
I know you heard that them youngstas creep in the UPT
Niggas be leavin them white sheets in the UPT

[B.G.]
Around my way nigga hustle, from crooked cops we fled
Niggas struggle to support they habit, gotta keep that monkey fed
Catchin cases every week, misdemeanors and felonies
Playin hatin is a disease, gotta beware of jealousy
If you ball then you hated on
If you do bad dats what bitch niggas done waited on
Caveman, dats my nigga bitch
Mook brother Pete we on Valence 'cause we all in the click
Man Pookie took a fall, this ho tryin to rott ya
Nigga I got ya, just stay click tight wit all the partnas
I'ma watch ya, Hooley Hoo nigga did 'em foul
I had to watch 'em get pulled out from under a fuckin house
He didn't diserve it
Joe Casey is an old G
I take his advice, he one of the old G's on Valence street
Funk and Clarence upstate, but hey gon' touch down
Soon as ya thinkin, think hustlin down uptown
Ya think we ain't, Lil Baby just hit the street
From that 13th, took a lil cake, now the nigga see what I see
He down wit me
My nigga Pete just got 2 years, he gon' survive
But Lil Popeye lookin at 5, that ain't shy
Nigga gon' bring noise like a drummer
Everybody gettin outta jail, it's gon' be a hot summer
Better dare yo thinkin and be ready to spray
If not...
You gon' get bucked down nigga, around my way

Juvenile,"I'm a nigga from the third with a helluva nerve
And if you cross my line then you will get served
I win, lose or die this happens everyday
Muthafuckas get killed in this game I play

I put these hands on a nigga 'cuz he talk too much
He told my business to a bitch, I had to fuck him up
When I confronted this nigga, he got highly upset
Took off his shirt, booted up, then looked down to my chest

So I slammed his ass, the nigga started to kick
I went to stompin' in his face, fuckin' up his shit
Gave him a good ass whippin', then I started to steppin'
I saw him reachin' in his pants, I seen he was stressin'

The niggas was stuntin' but I had mine
Five times through the chest, family outside cryin'
On the way back home, I saw this sharp ass lady
Polo down, hair fixed and some gold earrings

I asked just where she's headed, she said, ""7th Ward""
Release the fine bitch out the St. Bernard
She hopped in the ride, I take the hoe to Popeye's
Got a three piece white, cold drink and small fries

The hoe got full, we went to the Rochambeaux
Took off her clothes and bust three nuts and after that I was through
Took her halfway home and told the bitch, ""Get on""
Didn't give a fuck about her 'cuz I gave her the bone

Everyday somebody else will get, hung by the gaffler
Niggas roll down the ave. 'cuz I'm the neighborhood amp
Fuckin' around with the Juvenile and you get your brains blown out
'Cuz that's what livin' all up the project is all about

With them hundred round tip-tips, to make sure niggaz ain't breathin'
You recievin', a punishment for not believin'
Curly head lookin' for me, cause I'm hot and word don' got loose
Bundles of dope fronted, from the Magnolia to the Goose
Snitches wanted to testify the shit that they know
Set a bomb on the front door, put a key in the door and the place blow
Look I been walkin' way mo', with a coat full of yeh-yo

My biological father, was a sperm donor, around the corner
Was the man that killed lil Lanny, who knew we'd understand it
That way that, my mother was heartless to her kids
So he took us in his home, and he raised like his own
Now we grown, and we learned responsibility,
The devil tryed to get wit me
To affect all of my dickin' inability
But it's gon' be some shit, when a collision is occurin'
Asurin', of me bein' a factor, through '97 and after
And I'ma have to, get my ten percent
Or I'ma get punished, like the rest of these niggaz and there's evidence
'Cause ever since all these cars and all these mansions, and all these
luxuries was givin'
You wasn't givin' no thanks, to the reason you was livin'
So I'ma keep an open mind and make the right decision
And ain't tell you niggaz shit, and put my self in a position
That's unescapable, 'cause you capable, of puttin' my life in danger
And it's causin' confusion, confusion draw conclusion
And shootin' up some niggaz that pose a threat
Until somebody warns you that you're close to death

While I'm in my Benz with your friend
And she bout to get nervous
Baby I don't want nothing but some mouth and lip service
Don't act bad, don't get mad
That's all I can do with you, cause I don't want your ass
Look you kinda fine with a nigga name on your spine
Now respect my fuckin' mind how I'ma hit that from behind
Got a ho across the court
And my lil' boo stay next door
I'm getting tired of you rappers
Its time for me to restore
I done fixed these bitches house up
And have them living swell
But yet and still a nigga like me was eating at Taco Bell
But after that shit
All that trick shit I stopped it
And lock my fuckin' pockets
You can't pick it or pocket
Now I get what I can get
Out of these hoes and I'm up
And if she wanna flex up
I'ma back the ho up

When I got that drama on my mind I'm goin' to bring it
I ain't backin' down from no nigga that's nathan'
If the nigga say I ain't bout my business look here he hatin'

Coming uptown playboy we gonna slang it
If I catch down nigga bad we gonna leave ya stankin'
Fucking wit my H.B's nigga I'm gonna bring it
Rollin' uptown stay strap and keep thinkin'

Uh, let it play for a minute
Oh, I ain't got that much time?
Check this out
To all my niggas out there, that know they'e gangsta
Even though you ain't got no ring on your finger
But it's always the one bitch I mean one woman
If you got nineteen hoes, it's always that one
You'll die for

I'm on my knees screamin' ""Baby I apologize""
'Cause I don' hurt you so much, I know you tire of cryin'
You was there every Sunday when I was doin' time
And sent a letter every Monday just to ease my mind
To let a nigga know that pussy cat was still mine
And bought you two fat dildos just to kill time
The fact that I'm... on the other side of this glass
I realize... just exactly what a nigga had
You stayed wit' me... even though I used to spank that ass
Didn't hesitated wit' me... any time I needed cash
A many days I was stressed out and feelin' bad
You laid me down on my chest and massaged my back
And plenty days you don' cooked, and I never came home
Collard greens, macaroni & cheese, and neckbone
Po'kchop, sweet potato pie up out the stove so hot
I know I'm pimpin' right now, but baby one day this pimp gon' stop
I know I was crazy baby I had you out there slangin' rocks
But I'm out now so face it baby I gotta hit the block
What you talkin' 'bout? Hell yeah I love you and it ain't gon' stop
I always said I wan'nt gon' do it again but I never stop
But I did you so wrong - that's the purpose for this song
I didn't mean to break your heart but now our love is on the run
Run-run-run-run, fuss-n-fightin'
What's done is what's done, let bygones be bygones
And you was there - to console when I lost my homey
And you was there - to give me head anytime I was ho'ny/horny
And you was there - when my eyes was on the verge of cryin'
And you was there - when I was on the verge of dyin'
So how the fuck I fixed my mouth to call you a bitch
If you was bitchin', it's probably 'cause I got you pissed
This on my life, since them wife folks ain't givin' me life
When I get out, promise to God I'mma make you my wife

A gangsta wife(yeah), down to ride(oooooh yeah)

Shawty, I know it's been hard on ya the past couple of years
You shed so many tears, wonderin' if my love is real
To show you how I feel, hell I mostly pay the bills
Hustle up on drug deals, so we can get a hot meal
I'm from the streets, so the streets don' made me how I is
I know I'm in them day and night, but that's just how I live
So ain't no need to fuss and fight, wit' you all in my grill
'Cause if I ain't want you, best believe that I wouldn't be here
Got some issues, best believe that we gon' get clear
'Cause you been down wit' me too long to up and disappear
Just give me time, enough time for me to stack a mil'
Then we can hit the hill and build us a tight crib
Some tight cars, candy paint wit' the big wheels
Bulletproof windshields, strapped with the blue steele
I know your love is trill, 'cause you don' stuck wit' me
So if I up and leave this city here, you goin' wit' me
If I come stuntin' in the hood, shit you stuntin' wit' me
And if I'm chiefin' me some wood, shit you chiefin' wit' me
I'll never get through thuggin', but'll be a good husband
The only one you lovin' plus the only one you fuckin'
The situation get ugly, then your head I'm bustin'
That's if you cheat, or you leave a nigga stuck with nothin'
Eventually you'll see, and understand me
So when I'm through off in these streets, one day you'll be

I'm a young nigga, go by tha name B.G.
Don't stunt, nigga, my K hold fifty
And I will use, in a minute you six feet
I refuse to lose, I issue blues

It'll be no clues
When I strike, you lose
I tip-toe light in Reebok shoes
Your issue's.. where I hang

You cannot stand without your pistol in your hand
You ain't no man
You get ran.. off tha set... like a bitch
And if you stay.. it's trigga play

Motherfucker, you get split
And once it's on, it's on, you all in
I'm comin' full force after tha hissin'
Stay off tha block.. 'cause everyday I spin tha ben

Without a grin
Hot Boy$ I represent.. to tha end
Just me and my girlfriend
We out to win

Still got ki's for ten
I get from be	
Bring 'em straight in tha U.P.T.
After tha pack it's chance for me off six deep

Tried to play me, ain't playin' me
Thought it was all gravy
He got his issue

They got a lot of.. niggas tryin' ta.. get me killed
But I done flipped.. tha fuckin' script.. and played it real
Now I'm dippin'.. an Expidition.. around tha corner
And can do.. just about.. whatever I want

I'm money-rollin'.. and it's legal
And ain't no quittin' in tha Regal
Behind tha tints.. my chopper's spittin'
Me and Dougie.. fuck in (?), and showin' us in

It's like a movie.. they want to do me.. it's on again
I know it's showin'.. how niggas scorin'.. I can hear ya talkin'
Niggas knowin'.. now they hoin'.. to me for offers
I can't holla.. don't have no powder.. until tomorrow

But I got a.. couple of dollars.. that you can borrow
Nigga, go
You're 'round my door.. you're drawin' heat
You can go.. but on this porch you destroyin' me

No exception.. at disrespectin'.. can't let it happen
Now you step in.. my fuckin' section.. talkin' 'bout jackin'

[Chorus: x 4]

[B.G.]
Duck.. nigga, duck
'Cause when I come I gon' bust.. fifty-plus
Don't give a fuck who in tha way
It's on you.. when I spray

Whoever hit, look here, it's on you
Tha B.G. and Juvenile.. tear it down
We get them pistols in our hand.. and act a clown
Niggas fucked up don't know.. what to expect

Cash Money liable to do anything next
Fly around your set in a private jet
Have your bitch next to me in a Corvette
Or ridin' on tha back of my motorbike
Around tha second line stun'n with tha loud pipes (vroom vroom)

We showcasin', bodies erasin'.. we want it all

Seven figures.. me and my niggas.. we comin' up
Gettin' rid of.. tha garbage litter.. with fifty-plus
Now we drainin'.. 'cause that 'caine in-side of our nose

Let these niggas know your (Look!) background nigga (Look!) 
Let 'em (Look!) know your (Look!) background! 
Let 'em know how you've been for a while 

All I was taught was murder murder 
Kill drama and nothin' less 
I strap tha Smith Wess and bust, it in they chest 
I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle 
Had ta struggle for success 
Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks, under they dress 
Them niggas there with me fooli' 
Me, I'm full of that dilly 
Hope when I catch them slippin' 
Him and they daddy's trippin' 
Shorty can hold it down 
Shorty be totin' rounds 
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds 
Shorty, wow 
Hair, all over my head 
Bandana 'round my brain 
Eyes bloodshot red 
Briches down to my legs 
Guns up in my trench 
When niggas playin', they get drenched 
My pockets is full of lead 
So, nigga, stay off tha ben 
I'm young with bad nerves 
Since I lost my partna, I've been troubled, hurt in this 'burb 
So I don't even hesitate ta leave 'em on tha curb 
And wet dem niggas' shirt 
Nigga, get 'em full of birds 
Tell them niggas, Geezy!

Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die

Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die

Weezy Wee roll with K's, glocks, and MAC's 
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real 
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga 
 
Look, look 
That time I forgot the bills 
Ain't been home in two weeks 
Macita lookin' for me 
The word all over the streets 
Well, shit! I love my momma 
But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems 
I lay back in the cut 
These niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here 
We all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here 
Tha lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow 
I can't see it, I'ma drop my pile on the floor 
They got some niggas stuntin' in Benz, hey man, them boys ain't riders 
{gun cocks} Hand it over, partner, my feet done got tired (Break it off) 
Well, picture this, I gotta corner this ole nigga address 
He said he got that work, and needed me ta meet 'I'm there (Meet him there) 
Nigga, take your Roly down with somethin' shady, daddy (What?) 
Within a week he changed his mind, and, received the package (What?) 
Oh well, back to tha drawin' board (Board) 
Cowards start hollerin' cause they know I'm comin' for it

Lemme tell 'em 
You remember that there nigga use ta be thuggin' it out 
Blunt in his mouth, would stay passed up in a drought 
Run in your house, ""Lay down! Nobody move! 
Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!"" 
That's how it was, crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs 
Lots of thugs, make niggas come ta answer them up 
Some niggas choose ta come back to me, ride around my set for me 
My lights off that thing 'cause I got that SKS with me

You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin to get ya
Look, I make a phone call to the big dog

Even though a nigga rich and I rock ice
I still bust a nigga head on the block aright

Watch the bullets chop off the head

Cause the water gets deeper
See I bust you wide open
And take 'ya daughter with me
Here come the beat boy
Shoot out the street lights
Time to bring on the heat boy
If you ain't really wit it

Wha wha wha nigga nigga
I put piss stains on private planes cause its my jet nigga
Money ain't shit cause my rottweilers drink moet
Diamond baugette bracelets for my lovers
Player, I use Cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost 3 nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slanging pickle
Who got Benz, a prowler, playboy, and a Vette
Tell the truth--who fucked ya on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the noila to new york
Who got every bitch attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talking bout, look, y'all don't know?
I'll give you a hint, see that bitch you with?
He fucked that hoe
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch, its like Harlem world video
White diamonds, red rubies, blue baguettes, I don't know
Shorty, when the next time I'ma be up in your bed
I love you? you love me?
Well go head on and gimme some head

[Chorus: x2]

Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

[Verse 2: (Baby)]
I told four I need something
With some hell of a ice
Nigga came back with a hell of a price
That ain't nothing
These hoes doing ghella wrong
Calling these niggas on our cell phone
Bitch riding Benz on 20 inch chrome
Gimme the key, the car hoe, and the alarm
For my prowler, my jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20 inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the choppa is mine
Hit my block in my Benz hoe with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Ordered the tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the vc's and tv's so a nigga could shine
With my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job

[Chorus 2x]

[B.G]
I ride the best from a Benz to a jag to a beamer to a lex
Might fly first class on delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a reppa
Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moet, and Cris
See that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring ya bitch around me
Cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different
That's ya issue
But after she come back
Your best out is not to kiss her
Hoes sick saying damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at BG watch
That bitch blingalingaling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 g's or better
Me and Wayne take the left
Juve and Baby take the right
Its dark in the room, we hold up our watches and its light
Cash Money millionaires living a hell of a life
Like my nigga weezay said, we surrounded by ice

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil Wayne]
Whoa whoa whoa
Now I'm shining baby glossing
Big tymin stuntin and flossing
Lamborghini sitting on broads
With two more in my garages
Plus a blue and black ferrari
With Nintendo and Atari
Man I swear the car is awesome
Vroom! sorry we lost 'em
I'm back
I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the hummer,
Hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jets about to land
The women fall out when I let em touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20 inch fans, damn
Got damn
Man I am
L-I-L, weezy, off the heezy
But still in all, ice flooding on my watch
And in my grill and all
Porch blocks front blocks
Still in all, me and Slim in the Rover
Beatrice brick holder, Cash Money young soulja
