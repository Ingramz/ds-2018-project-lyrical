Sly & Sal,"Oh, girls, you know we've got to watch out,
You know, you know, you know we've got to watch out.
He, he, he's a playboy, (watch out)
He, he, he's a playboy.
 
Playboy get away from my door, 
I heard about the lovers you had before.
You took their love for a game of joy,
You tossed their hearts around as though it was a toy, Playboy.
 
Playboy I see your kind, winning ev'ry girl with the same old line.
So playboy stay away from my door,
I know about the lovers you had before, Playboy.
 
You wasn't sayin' nothin', in my book,
'Cause this is one fish you'll never ever hook.
You left the others standin' with their hearts in pain,
Now you're comin' 'round tryin' to do me the same.
 
Playboy I see your kind, winning ev'ry girl with the same old line.
So playboy stay away from my door,
I know about the lovers you had before, Playboy.
Watch out, He, he, he's a playboy. (Watch out) Please, please.
 

",Playboy,1988
Sly & Sal,"Before we slip and fall in love, I'd better caution you
I'm the kind they've warned you of, I've slipped a time or two
The stories you just can't believe though I'm guilty as accused
I've still got my pride, slightly used

It's been slightly used, but it still hurts to love and lose
It's been slightly used, but it still hurts to cry the blues
If you still want this heart of mine, than it belongs to you
With all my love, slightly used

Our destiny's are not the same, I'm bad and you're so good
One of us would have to change, I don't know if I could
And if I fail I'd drag you down, until your pride refused
Then you'd be like me, slightly used

Oh I've been slightly used but it still hurts to love and lose
I've been slightly used, but it still hurts to cry the blues
If you still want this heart of mine, than it belongs to you
With all my love, slightly used",Slightly Used,1988
Sly & Sal,"In this day and time, love don't last too long
And I lost you the day that he came along
I guess that he loves you but I love you too
And I've got wall to wall heartaches next to you

I've got wall to wall heartaches in this room that's missin' you
And everything in it is crying for you too
While you're out there happy, I walk these floors over you
And I've got wall to wall heartaches next to you

Even when you did me wrong I loved you all the while
It seems true love's old fashion and it's going out of style
You promised me happiness what you said you never do
And I've got wall to wall heartaches next to you

I've got wall to wall heartaches in this room that's missin' you

Sly & Sal,"Wishing I could see you again, dear
That the fires of love could burn once more
But I know that's just wishful thinking
And too much to be wishing for

Just thinking of how you once kissed me
Wishing that it hadn't meant goodbye
But I know that's just wishful thinking
Now I know why some people cry

I'll live my life in dreams and long for your love
It's you I'm wishing for and you I'm thinking of

My heart echoes the love words you've spoken
How I wish that I could hear them from you
Won't you answer a heart that's broken
And make my wishful thinking come true

Wishing I could see you again, dear
That the fires of love could burn once more
But I know that's just wishful thinking
And too much to be wishing for

I'll live my life in dreams and long for your love

Sly & Sal,"I've lost the only love I've ever known
Too many nights I left her all alone
I said forgive me, one too many times
And now her parting words ___ my mind
You're with the wrong company they'll drag you down
You're spending too much time on the wrong side of town
Now it's your life to live, but it's my heart to give
And if you still want me, give up that wrong company
She warned me but I've wasted my last chance
And now she's gone without a backward glance
Oh how I miss the love I threw away

"Sly ""Pyper"" Jordan","All my life, I've been down to ride
Till I kept it real and I stayed alive with no compromise
And I fantasize about the baddest bitch and being between her thighs
Then I woke up and realized this is my motherfuckin' real life

You know where the fuck I'm from
From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where the niggas load clips and fats
And get stabbed at home room should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit, take your car for a test drive (Ah shit)
Gangbanin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside
These niggas don't know my life
All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life, you never die, you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now
All y'all lil' niggas need to simmer down
Shut the fuck up, I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle

R.I.P to KMG
Still gotta murder rap, and don't give a fuck where the body at
You do too much talkin' I walk in the building I just give a fuck where the money at
They coaching the player
They trust me it's only just one of them
I'm callin' them shots and makin' the plays and if you get a train better fuck with him
I keep it gangsta, y'all testin my patience
Got me feelin' so anxious, I be lookin' so facetious
Feel like running a capre

(Wait, hold up I got next)
(What up X)
Spent my birthday in Dubai
Skyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy
Black tux, oh you fucks guess what, I'm ready to blow
(Yo, oh no)
I hang that 6-2 sideways
Pissin' off the neighbors scrapin' bumpin' in the driveway
You gave me the pistol told me to kill at will
(Blow, yo, oh no)
(I couldn't give a fuck)
Literally, cashed out just livin' to me
Blast it like a Kennedy beat
Wanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me
While I'm just over here cozy holdin' these double D's
She book smart with pornographic abilities
(Well I don't know what you know
But I know I got that shit)
These motherfuckers still talking? Fuck 'em!
That's why they bring X and the guillotine out
To stop these bitches niggas from runnin' their mouth
(It's bout time somebody said something)

One in the glove, one in the clip, one in the chamber
One on the dash, one in the stash, ready for danger
I'm ready to die I can't control this fuckin' anger
Ah shit, somebody better fuckin' stop me
Cause I'm a loose cannon that can't stand myself I'm bad for my own health
You niggas really think I give a fuck about somebody else (fuck em')

[Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

[Nate Dogg]
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

[Warren G]
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice so I said ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""

[Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won't'cha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

[Warren G]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said ""Damn, what's next?""

[Nate Dogg]
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Warren G]
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

[Nate Dogg]
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin' 
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

[Warren G]
Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up cause it's on
N A T E and me
The Warren to the G

[Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought 
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""oh I like your size.""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the Senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free 
Hey Sis, one kiss, and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed Milton's paradise lost could be found
But in the eyes of the Dean, his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's gotta do
What a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter and me 
They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered ""I love you -
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol""
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses 
Now, the paint is peeling

Now, and when the chips are down

Sly Johnson,"Parce que la vie est amère
Comme un jus de pamplemousse, avec de la mousse de bière
Je sors au clair de lune avec ma guitare et de l'herbe
Afin de réchauffer les chaumières
Ma voix positivise dans les bagnoles 
Change les capotes en parasol
Quand pétillent des bulles de rigolade
Faut se taper des tranches de limonade
Saisir l'immensité de l'instant
La savourer dans son importance
Car perdre sa vie à la gagner
N'a plus de sens s'il faut s'éloigner.

Partir 5 minutes
Refaire l'histoire du monde, les soirs de pleine lune
Partir 5 minutes
Entourer de colombes, de minuit à midi.

Je rêve en rugissant, je vais là où le soleil et
La terre se touchent en rougissant
Les anges nous seront témoins
Ferme les yeux que j'attrape tes mains
On s'envole dans mon imagination,
Demain trop tard pour l'invitation
La ville est difficile allons à la campagne
On va gagner, sois douce quand tu m'accompagnes
On verra mes amis à Bogota ou Genève
Nous dessinerons des chansons dans la neige.
Parce que la première est toujours la dernière fois
Déguste chaque minute,
Vivre un perpétuel terminus
Comment faire quelques heures de 5 minutes

Partir 5 minutes
Refaire l'histoire du monde, les soirs de pleine lune
Partir 5 minutes
Entourer de colombes, de minuit à midi.

J'étanche ma soif de liberté,
Je te danse ma part d'éternité
Le bonheur, j'en ai un appétit populaire
Ma peine est profonde la sympathie naturelle
Laisse-moi juste 5 minutes, on verra le bout du tunnel
J’suis trop peace, mais j'm’en donne la peine
Craignant que sans moi la vie continue
Je chante pour sortir de ma bulle
Car le temps qui nous reste diminue
Je m'en vais porter par quelques libellules.

Sly Johnson,"Sans escalier, j'ai grimpé à l'étage 
La vie un livre dont il faut tourner les pages 
Les cours c’étaient pas cubiques 
Un Q.I élevé n'explique pas 
Les bulletins d'un cancre chronique 
J'ai arrêté l'école avant de la quitter 
Hélas en dessous de mes capacités, 
Les plans qu'ils avaient pour nous je les ai déjoués 
Taffer nous fait chier au risque d'échouer 
De toute façon, on ne va pas se plaindre 
Nos parents se sont saignés: 
Au sommet, on sera pas plein
Car on se fout d'être conseillé 
Mon daron m'avait dit qu'exister c'est 

Tirer des traits vivre les sacrifices de si près 
Je sais à quoi tu songes en secret, 
À notre âge déjà les traits tirés 
À force de tirer des traits 

En vrai, les femmes n'aiment vraiment que leurs enfants, 
Moins tu le comprends…plus tu te morfonds. 
Tous nés pour morfler!
Mes nuits blanches ... d'un divorce de Morphée 
Une vie montagneuse, des virages, des pics 
Des chutes et des mirages ! 
Radeau cassé, on repart à la nage du rivage 
Garçon, en une décennie, j'en ai vu défiler 
Trop de frères sont difficiles, à tirer 
Je t’aurais prêté la jambe, même estropiée 
Je t’ai donné la main, tu l'as escroquée 
Atteindre l'âge des blessures sans coquards, 
Transmission de savoir, se vider 
Pour que d'autres puissent avoir, 
Pouvoir pardonner j'ai tout donné, 
Mais les gens ne savent pas recevoir

Tirer des traits vivre les sacrifices de si près 
Je sais à quoi tu songes en secret, 
À notre âge déjà les traits tirés 
À force de tirer des traits 

5 disques, de traits tirés un million 
Autant de larmes tracées entre les lignes 
Mon métier les textes durs mais polis 
C'est la réponse lors des contrôles de police 
Elles viennent de l'univers, 
Mes phrases misent bout à bout font le tour de la terre, 
Les traits c'est comme les cartes, 
Le pire est de tirer les mauvaises 
Que tu le souhaites ou pas, tu vas... tirer un trait 
Tirer deux traits ça fait… très mal mais 
La vie c'est ...

H.N.B. robbery, in Manhattan for currency
Sittin' up in the crib, drawin' out a map
On where security was gon' leave the door open at

Park the van around back, the M.P. jet black
We should be in and out 60 seconds flat
So son what's the deal? He ain't takin' his route
He rather stay home like a bitch, and have a alibi

What his cut look like, he think he takin' half
While we do all the dirt, he sit home on his ass
I got a funny feeling son, somethin' just ain't right
Kinda glad, I didn't go wit Rum and them that night

And sure enough nigga, you best to believe
Duke snitched under the hot light, like steady people
Wit a vote than a Clinton, Rum and me
Him in cell 2, and me in cell 3

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

Me off the job would of been easy, if son wouldn't have been greedy
I told him to parle, 'cause he one high jet speedin'
Laughin', countin', tryin' to play with money he ain't got
No knowledge of himself, and the trigger gave him heart

He just finish biddin', some remote federal prison
D said he was quotin' niggas, word to word shittin'
To get a light of sense, evident as I remember
When Dunn Dunn got knocked, I just seen him last summer

At Soul In The Hole, it was a King E. King game
First time out his crib, the kid got body, he got blamed
For being the last one seen, fleein' from the scene
Walk was with him up there, he said Duke was held obscene

On some in and out a cell, C.O. slayed him on his mail
His family got banked, he out on 200 foul bail
Myself I don't trust, and that's ya man, so you bust him
'cause every man, know a dead man don't answer questions

It was all love, when push came to shove
I had back, till one kid got clapped
They lock G, for conspiracy
He turn around tryin rattle me, Arabic

I know about this type of shit, snitches do exist
To all my dunns, holdin' guns
Gettin' funds, watch ya self
Through most of ya crimes by delf

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

She said she love me, but she took me for granted, when she panic
Flip the whole street, to some shit I couldn't handle it
From my man from up the hill, what the deal?
The block is heatin' up, and I need to cop steel

Come and see me, come bring dough 'cause, I can't afford a freebie
And come alone son, 'cause cats know to be snitchin' on TV
Be easy, I'm out but my love wanna tease me
Shorty want some attention, not to mention wanna please me

Hold tight, I'll be back in a flash, don't worry
You got money honey, stop actin' funny
Out the door, to care of my B.I.Z.
And I know this muthafuckas that's eyein' me

Is it a set-up, I peel but I make a detour
And come back, and see my shorty talkin' wit the law
I witnessed her trappin' 'bout my business
Where I be goin', who I know in the industry

She sex me good, but I should of known
Come into this world alone
Leave this world alone

I've seen the seasons come and go.
Could be today may be the day,
Tomorrow comes and I'll stay the same.
Don't know my place,never thought it'd be this way.
Can't change my face, never thought I'd see this change.
Too many times I've passed these doors,
I've seen them open just to close.
Now I'm searching for some new key.
Locked up, locked out it comes down on me.
Don't know my place,never thought it'd be this way.
Can't change my face, never thought I'd see this change.
I've come to see this change,

Everything I do I end up thinking about you.
I'm scraping and crawling, I chose that road myself.
I slammed the door in my face, I want to fix it.
I don't know anything today make me numb my friend.
Twisting and tying knots makes it hard for me to breath.
I want to know something, untie the knots that bind.
I want to be strong my friend, I want to breath.
Tell me I'm wrong and I'm far from it, I can't loosen the grip.
Take your hands off my throat everything I do I end up thinking about you.
Give me broken glass instead of all the answers.
Sincerity runs strong through me, I'll hold onto it.
Won't you tell me and hold me, won't you tell me everything from the radio tonight.
I slept on the floor, just waiting screaming at myself, ""do you love her tonight?""



",In Tune,1999
Small Brown Bike,"Cabin in the woods.
Where I feel isolation.
Where I feel separation from everything.
But my mind travels distances that my body can't make.
I find it hard to sleep with this oncoming dream, I recite, ""I see you.""
This room sinks below.
Underground tonight.
Is your room sinking too?
I lie in the hide away bed.
An attempt for the best to awake my sleeping life.
Death is contagious. Death is courageous.
The phone was crying tonight, but I can't answer its call.
(Wake up, wake up)
With a purpose to react to this loss of response. ""I'll find you.""

Caught in the icy stare of the snow queen

Once I was a stone many years ago
Into a pool was thrown many years ago.
Time passed by, the pool ran dry, excavated was i.
And tempered and beat in a fiery heat,
By the hand of a man, who's name was dan
Dan the blacksmith.

Once I was a sword, many years ago.
And my blade was broad, many years ago.
Worn with pride, into battle I'd ride at a warrior's side.
And I cut and I killed and was lost in a field,
And I soon did rust, corrode to dust,
Oh my.

Once I was a daisy, many years ago.
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago.
But I was et by a goat who fell in a moat and forgetting to float
He sunk like a lead and stayed until dead,
But was relieved to find just how kind it all was.

Once I was a grub, many years ago.
I lived in muck and mud, many years ago.
But on the very first noon I became a cocoon that resembled a prune.
When the good lord was done in the warmth of the sun.
I shed my skins, and dried my wings, and I flew away.

Once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival.
And once I was a carp and lived in waters ornamental.
And once I was a myna bird, quoting verses from the bible,
Said ""pretty boy, pretty boy, st. luke"".

Once I was a mule, a many years ago.
But my master treat me cruel, a many years ago.
By and by I was sick, couldn't move to his kick, so he took out a stick
And hit it right 'cross my back to an almighty crack,
And to his dismay, I passed away, into the blue.

I was born a human baby, many years ago.
I was born unto a lady, many years ago.
All our hopes they were piled on the back of a child that turned out to be wild.
Sent the devil a prayer and caused the parson to swear.
So I took my leave to lie and thieve my way to jail.

I've been tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor.
I've known good times and disaster.
But now I've found a teacher, and the teacher has a master,
The master is perfection, so he'll help us get there faster.
I don't need no proof, because that's the truth, and I'll drink to that.

There's a man wants to show me the river
Hoofing at five I'll be more dead than alive
I find a reason to survive when I'm too old

Should I walk in the lightning and the thunder
On a hilltop so high and show my face to the sky?
Will I find just what it is I'm looking for?

And the fold in my trousers, it ain't straight

And get myself a smooth outfit

From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied
The smallest matter

When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak
But only flatter

He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there that he made his bed
Often times he could be seen returning

Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
""The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning""

The leaves began to fallin'
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many

Nobody knew him or what he had done
But mothers would say to their children, beware of mad John

Laugh with the wind in the cold end of night
But people from behind their curtains, said he's not quite right

John had it sussed, he was living the life of a tramp
Yes, his bed was the cold and the damp but the sun was his friend
He was free

So here was a wise one who loved all the haters
He loved them so much that their hate turned to fear
And shaking from behind their curtains the loved ones would hear

Last call, as you stagger out the door.
Dream of a better life on a coast you've never known.
Remember loves you've lost, and friends that you've out grown.
Is there answers in the bottle

To the questions that you found at the bottom of your bag.
Barely among the living. forget forgiving.
Spark it up, and dive into a pool of your regrets
That is quickly becoming a sea.

We don't die, we multiply 'cuz there's a strength in numbers, baby
So I brought some of my family members here today
To talk to y'all about celebrity chicks
So Ching-a-ling, why don't you go ahead
And start this thing off for, what up?

From the moment she wake up, so Hollywood puttin' on her makeup
Can't save her but it's always a fool to keep her caked up
You ask the chick out, tike the say where you gon' take her
And see the, to Vegas or Cali to see the Lakers

She brought that paper, getting over on Cat's major
This at the Billboard's I seen for real name in the pager
Say what, most of these balls they can't fade her
She stay fly, Dolce Gabbanna and Marc Jacobs

You can catch a Melrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats, so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

She got a loan and can't pay the rest
So she got another brother writing a check
I'm talking if she want it bad enough, she will get it glad enough
She can run it, run it at the same time standing in place

And got a long list of giving me
And who will be buying tables man, I'm out of here
But it's to late now, she can see I'm paid now
That I can make it rain now, say now I think I lost a girl

You can catch a Melsrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

I see some celebrity chicks everywhere that I be
Everywhere that I've been, the selection or celebrity chicks to see
I see Meeg and I see Mia, I be wantin' to meet 'em
I can see them in the sheets when I imagine me between 'em

I'm straight up off the streets the MC
And I've been waiting to see Heaf
So I could shred it to him rough ride
And I leave it to the back seat of the Beamer

And hear that heatin' and give lil' mama the reason
To send papa to a region, as hot as a pot steamin'
I wanna be the secret that me and Trina keepin'
I'm hood enough for the girl I keep and every toe I Keisha

Good lord Jesus, she can go and pet the jeezer
I just want it for the weekend
I got the power to be 'bout it, I'm not a weakling
I'm trying to fly out to see Jessica Alba in bikini's

Holla at us when you see us, if you want us, how I need us

Small World,"Yo, let's get back to the hardcore right now
Underground hip-hop yo (*foreign singing*)
This one's a gangsta tune, whassup fosha?
I'mma send this one out to all the refugee gangs around the world
Signal, signal, y'all need to chill with the drive-by's
It was the fourth of July I heard the cherry bomb bang
Stay in the house that's the sound of the gangs, clef
By the time we figured out what happened
I was in an ambulance tellin' my cousin keep breathing

Don't wear your colors here, that cemetery gear
I got my gun and nine, killing's my appetite
(but that ain't right y'all)
Don't wear your colors here!
That cemetery gear (california, california)
I got my gun and nine from hollywood, to your neck of the hood

True, true, yo hollywood got a lot of kids twisted
Jumpin' in and out of limo's thinkin' is his ass really gifted
The only gift y'all possess is workin' with the triple six's
Y'all disguise yourself with bandanas and diamond necklaces
Mosta y'all can't even go back to the hood where y'all grew up
Actin like y'all drink alcohol and all y'all do is throw up
Talk about when y'all blow up y'all gonna visit the project floors
But the last time they saw y'all was 1984
Now y'all wonder, why they got on hoodies screamin' ""freeze""
Get out the navigator, godfather iii in the dvd
They hop in, they take your car for a spin
It's cold outside so all you feel is the wind
There's no cell-y phone, so you can't phone home
Oh lord, here come those criminals maleek & jerome
(""yo, who you know here, you got family over here?"")
He a rap artist
(""I don't care, he got the wrong colors over here, no fear"")
Now you look shook like that mobb deep song
I'm surprised, cause on all y'all records you was al capone
And come to find out that you never held a chrome
And you escaped the draft and never bust a shot in vietnam
Now you standin' in the form amongst the children of the corn
Like the son of man stood with a crown made of thorns
The only difference is for you there'll be no resurrection
Cause it's a traffic jam, they got you locked up in a intersection

Don't wear your colors here, that cemetery gear
I got my gun and nine, killing's my appetite
(but that ain't right y'all)
Don't wear your colors here! (colors)
That cemetery gear (chicago, chicago)
I got my gun and nine from hollywood, to your neck of the hood

Yo, hollywood has half-man be hollow to you
How could you have slipped through
While I was detecting the trick that's in you
Pretending you pitbull, when really your candy-ass is poodle
We wouldn't of hit you, hammers have already been
Cocked and cleaned, yo, it was who?
It's click-up, click-up, north cackus, commence to stick up
That's what's within us, cack and lack, clap, buck killers quicker
Stick up the forest misters then head up to chickens with 'em
Adrenaline's givin', when I riff with the fifth to your chin-in
You never knew bout how we play these innings
But you about to play the commission
Waves are spinning, I'm out the glaze I'm sh...ing
The real is missing but the fraud is evident
Ever so clear, but you got the nerd to come around here with pounds of fear
Your colors wrong you must rock edible dons with that huh?
Damn paul, what's that huh?
Let me get that, with the quick snatch
If it's a little man in you then I better put the trick back
And if it's anything killers is fearing, I know my clit stacked for realer

Don't wear your colors here, that cemetery gear
I got my gun and nine, killing's my appetite
(but that ain't right y'all)
Don't wear your colors here! (colors)
That cemetery gear (detroit, detroit)
I got my gun and nine from hollywood, to your neck of the hood

Tell the fbi that I won't be home tonight
Tell the secret service I won't be home tonight

(What about Texas?)  They need to chill with the gun play
(New York city y'all)  Police are at the door
the Magnum was by the ashtray
(Look at shorty y'all)  He bout to go out like Scarface
He woke up in a cardboard box with no space

To all my thugs in Houston, you wan' push drugs?
To all my thugs in Memphis, you want the cars in the videos?
To the Jacksonville Thug Angels, let me tell you how it really goes

I'm on the highway with a black bandana, headed to Atlanta
Until I heard WOOP WOOP, that ""Sound of Da Police"", should I pull over?
He had the dark shades on, but he ain't look like Stevie Wonder
His face was, pale and long - he looked like cold day in December
Now let me ask the truth or somethin - 
should I slow down and be a good camper?
I heard a young thug scream, 
""It depends what you got in the beamer!!""
Now I got two choices I could blast and become Most Wanted in America
Or I could slow down like the man in the Bronco 
and get Johnny Cochran to be my lawyer
Ohh Sonya, hit her on the Motorola
If I get locked up I ain't getting out 'til Tuesday
Cause this is Saturday, and it's a holiday
Now I got to spend a week hangin in the South in jail
but you told me that crime pay

You a dealer, how many drugs did you deal-a?
For'realla, used to sell crack on the hill-a
Yeah right!  My name is Elvis and your wife is Pricilla
You're an ACTOR, you need a part in this thrilla
Hold up, ain't no nead to bust your four-fifth-a
It's two of use, one of use is bound to leave in a coma
So say your prayers, and give my regards to the undertaker

She said that she was pissed
Up all night making noise

She said we was running a flop house

Musicians and hooligans and we were all on the drugs
So she got bent and raised the rent
Said it would only take one more

What's it gonna take to get a break

Ill come home and razz my neighbors too

And all the other bills are overdue

You can be the rook or the pawn 
But if you have the strategy that's best 
You can be the King or in this case the Don

Things I shouldn't understand, comprehend or care 
Like, oh, I don't know maybe I shouldn't go there

Stetching out the cold 
Searching for the answers,
And some say I'm not alone 
Could you tell me 
Where I might find 
Fallen horses?
Their spirits they fly .

Staring at the sun,
I'm wishing that I had wings 
So that I could become one.
Would you help me
If I wanted to die?
I could ride off 
With horses tonight.

When success stalks and along comes fame 
Do you open the door or watch in horror 
Through the peep hole as they all go away

It's late an interruption in space

With obvious and used excuses 
Blue gas burning above flicks and cartoons 
Bumper stickers in preparation for tomorrow

I'll wrestle the beat
With my two left feet
They'll laugh and they'll stare
At what my mom made me wear
Tomorrow I'll wake up
Crying and smiling

It's just another day in the suburbs
Where behind every cloud there's a big ball of burning sunshine
Sometimes

Hitching a ride to the high school dance
And I don't know what we're going there for 
The girls are so pretty in their shopping mall fashions
And we're so invisible to them

I feel like I'm in 
Some John Hughes film
Like a dream we've all had
Where you can't run too fast
Tomorrow we'll wake up
Crying and smiling

Driving on up to the Hollywood party
I dunno what I'm going there for
There's too many fools and too many rules
And dress codes, and I'm one too many people there

They'll shake and they'll grin
Sharing 8 by 10's
They'll point and they'll laugh
At my photograph
Tomorrow they'll wake up
Crying and smiling...",Seventh Grade Dance,2003
Smash Mouth,"There you go around your tiny world again
Playing space man in your silver shoes
You say you want to come back down to Earth again
When you're down you find your mind and slip

There you go
Just like all the other times before
You're lost in space

Anti-gravitation keeps you high above
Like some comet speeding toward the sun
Communication's lost between the ones who love you
It's impossible to think that something loves you more than us

There you go
Just like all the other times before
You're lost in space

Smash Mouth,"It's like I told you before baby
And what more could I say that I know you should know
Three little words are thrown around so much 
That after a while they begin to lose their touch

And you know that I should think of something better
Switch it around like I came up with something clever
Or maybe I should just shut up
'cause I got nothing but a whole lotta love

Could you be lovelier?

For you I'd take off my shoes and my socks baby
And watch you laugh as I walk across burning rocks
But then I couldn't chase you everywhere you go
And it's all about the chase, everybody knows

I'd like to think that you would never make me do this
But you know I'd do it if I had to prove it
I'd do it again and again, you know I'd dummy up
'cause I got nothing but a whole lotte love

Could you be lovelier?
Could I be luckier?
So why was I so dumb?
Maybe we're living on Mars
And Venus is too far
Now I got nothing but nothing to lose

Could you be lovelier? I don't know
But I've seen a lot of things and nothing measures up
They say that beauty never goes deeper than the skin
I know a certain girl they've never ever seen

And every time I see ya I just wanna get near ya
And I just wanna make it crystal clear
It's like I told you before, I got nothing for you
But a whole lotta love

Of one cupids arrow under your coat

Wishing, hoping, praying for this day
Now I sit and watch them
The little ones I love
So excited by the way

There'll be toys for everyone

And now the word is given

To bust with pain
A heart goes blank

To ask on behalf of you
Of you, where are you?
Where are you in you?

I got my elbow on the window-sill, 
Hand on my face looking out to the world. 
A lot of questions lay awake in my brain 
And I'm still trying to suss out what ima say. 
And if I do speak on something's if it's you 
Stone cup all that hates so here goes. 
Why is it that when some guy makes it outta a hood life
They're like; No we can't let ya. 
And allow five-oh to rape girls and compensate them 
Like David Bikem is so wrong and expect us working people 
To fund your wages for you to uphold the law, which is what exactly? 
That I really need to know. 'Til then I'll stare outta my window. 
Hehe probably wont get an answer for that one.

I got some questions in my mind that definitely need 
Some answers right now 'cause I gotta know. 
Got all the pieces to the puzzle but can't seem 
To make it fit so I'm lost, tell me where to go.

But you turned your back and you went away. 
It's making me crazy I feel so alone. Why did you turn your back. 
Why did you go away? Cause you were my brother, and you should of stayed.

Listen I lay awake at night looking up 
At the ceiling tryna clear my mind. 
I can't sleep with the shit that I've seen today. 
Seen a dude in the dairy get stabbed for change. 
Passed away. His parents wont pass the pain, 
And feel like you just came let the rain in. 
Feels like you just let it happen man 
Take away a kids life away just because he tagged, damn. 
Why you let us get ahead, if you let us pull us 
Back right before we see the end. Please tell me understand 
Why you took away my friend, son to brother, 
Lost my brother, I gotta know.

It's making me crazy I feel so alone. 
Why did you turn your back? Why did you go away? 
'Cause you were my brother and you should of stayed.

Listen I gotta few things on my mind 
Can't really explain to you but I gotta try. 
First I wanna know other things why you letting your little brother
Slang rocks out side who drops and do what ever. 
Do you really think's making it better 'cause what 
I see is a cold world living, your little sister known as a hood rat, 
But you can overlook that, proves to us all you wanna do is fit in. 
Why you lettin' your daddy abuse your children 
When they go school bruised they're making excuses. 
Why is the majority of friends that 
You have all gang affiliated, hurting the innocent.

I got some questions in my mind that definitely 
Need some answers right now cause I gotta know. 
Got all the pieces to the puzzle but can't seem

Do we, have to result in fisticuffs?
See I get swifter myself, that's when the Ruck erupts
So think not, of what I am, and what I do
Just recognize in the murder mic, I rule

How many corny MC gon' try?
Fifty MC, forty of dem done die
Run wit' Heltah Skeltah, through the realms of the dark
If a nigga rift, then I'mma let the 4-4 bark
Everybody knows, where my notty head grows
I turn into a lethal weapon, and start steppin' on toes
I, waste no time, when I move mine
Grab my glock, and then I clear the stuff, like I was code nine

That I fears no fears, and that's word to my dry tear
I brake ya whole fuckin' crew in half

Wontime, for ya mind, hit that ass color blind
Signed on the dotted line, it's how I live my lifetime
Reality hit me at some degrees

Because I just smoked a bag of weed

I beat more ass, then Mom dukes leather belt
I gets open like doors when I be droopin'
Trademark be bootin, baggin' pants roopin'
Hoopin' and hollerin', nigga shut ya mug

'cause I'm bugged and my dome piece, roam in the streets

Wit the crazy dred, the mad boy head fed
Of corny shit that said, so now you bleed like your man bled
We gettin' twisted as our Timb's cover pavement
Flowin' state to state, pickin' up the next payment
Yo thoughts smell, violator to the left
Four slugs hit them chest, no more, no less
So think about it, abort your mission, it's impossible
Or be a vegetable, and ya meant up in the hospital
You silly wabbit, Trix, tricks are for kids, don't you know that?
Fuck wit my Boot Camp, and get your wig pushed back

Some of ya niggas be tryin' to pull the trigga
But I figure, I could bust that ass just a little quicker
Time to catch Wreck, and back to the set
Where all them rules, them cock in check

All up in ya muthafuckin' grill, I be Steele
Comin' through wit my Wreckin Crew, so I reckon you keep it real
If not, I'm blowin' spots, on whoever be showin' glocks
And what nots, walkin' around fakin' mad rocks
The only Rock I know is B.I.G., wakin' up and I double
G-H, wit that nigga are-you-see-K
Better be ready to be jetty if you petty
'cause if it wasn't already said, we dangerous and deadly
You better recognize or recollect, I reck a set wit a
Tek, and we askin', we blastin'
Now from this you might think the Steele is trife
I earn my strife, 'cause I deal wit the real in life
And I reveal my knife, to cut you loose
I'm not ruthless, but you get the boots if you useless
'cause, time upon time, I find
If you remain blind, you get left behind
But we, see very clearly, so step up to the front
'cause this is where we, represent on the lovely
For you and get praise due to the father above me
'cause we ain't here to attack, or, when we take the backs off
The wack rappers that jack off

Smif-N-Wessun,"Sittin' on the toilet, shittin', puffin the dough
Strobe light affect, everything's movin' slow
Slip into a deep zone, the sound let the phone bring me home
Stagger to my feet, emotion toward the walk talk
(Aiyo Ripper what up nigga, check out this proposition
There's money to bait and I'm in the mood to go fishing)
Whatever nigga, give me time to wash my ass
My habit at your norm' day, fiendin' for the cash
(Do what you gotta do, 'cause I'm on my way in the car
'cause when I get there, yo we outie like Tamar) Right right easy
(Now I'm off to the south to get more info on this dough I heard about
Gotta make sure everything secure
Can't let me and my man let these grants slip past our hands
The man's out heavy today
I hope they don't try to get in the way of our pay)
Damn, I'm ready, high noon, the man's out
Gotta take a quick shower, get dressed and bounce
Grabbed a fatigue, strapped out the generals
Proper attire for all criminals
Blazed up the clip, loads up the 4/5th
If a boy riff, leave a body their stiff
Who dem man there gon' rap on my door
Disturb me at work, on the low dub four (Yo it's me)
Who that (ST, what up) Aight hold up son, let me put it back on safety
(Aiyo kid it smells like fresh grown cess, lets
Twist up some trees before we jet)
True, you know we keep a fat pack of sense
Even though you know it make our pockets go empty
(But no less about to starved into free men
So whenever we finish we gon' bag up this spinach)
Easier said than done, peep the 4-1-1
The dred around the corner, just try to blast Ruck and Dunn
(I knew it, bad vibes flowin' like fluid
Forget about the dough, let's do it
I see you already strapped pa, so I'll meet you
Outside, 'cause my gats back in the car
How far must one go
Before he throw his whole entire life right out the window)

And a dead boy, and I don't even know
(Aiyo he looks like the dred, that hooked us up on the low)
What you say fly?
(Thinkin' out loud, just caught me in the zone
I'll tell you all about it on the way home)
Whatever, I'mma send this nigga to his essence
Fuckin' wit' the family, know he gotta learn a lesson
And you know he ain't yardy right
Some boy gon get dead tonight
As we strap on the gloves, feel the buzz from cannabis
Niggas bout to get scandalous

Gotta be gon' the double, I think I seen them all tumble
But on the left there's trouble
Undercover had to spill staked out
Watchin' the whole thing go down, yo it's time to brake out
The 4/5th as I shift and drive
'cause every mind right here might not leave alive

Son why you stallin'? Hop on the ballin'
Get us outta here before we be the next fallin'
Right now, this whole shit is bug, we the thugs
Yet the beast comin' up showin' niggas love
Took our burners, gave us dap, let us bounce
Now it's back to the dog house, to smoke the next ounce

Who could believe them beats left us alone
And took the chrome that's in one of our own back home
And not only that kid, check
How money that we just did, was that connect
For the cash, them pigs must of had dips for the stash
That ain't that some shit for ya ass

Troops say, ya never liked this pretty ass anyway
But that shit wit the pigs CO-made my day
Gave me a whole new outlook on the beast
Even watched out for the ones so called the beast
But anyway, you know we high right now

Smif-N-Wessun,"This is the story of a place that we call home
Where the kids pack heat when it's time to roam
Everybody's on the scramble, life's a gamble
Hoppin' on the white horse, tryin' to get a handle
On the fast pace that we call the last race
Step wit' precaution when you enter this place
We got a spot on every block that makes ya dreams come true
Just come correct wit' the synapses or ya doo

Don't come cryin' broke, still tryin' to cop the dope
What parts of no, do not you understand bro
We can't afford to take shorts or be playing sports
Empires need to be built, mack 10's bought

What the face now, me and my people's taste crown
Stayin' face down, while K-9's sniffs around
What they found was irrelevant, the weed 'cause
They was sent to represent and 'cause a ruckus amongst us
Now I got more pigs rushin' we, handcuffin' me
Takin' hold of we in the custody

For blushin' in, rasta boy restin' in peace
After going through the bullshit, we in release
To hit the streets, where the war still off for all of y'all
'cause they kept rule locked behind the wall

Stand strong, on ya own two, mista

Black hoodie on, black dusty fatigues
Bloody red afro, puffin' on the black weed

Give nurture to your seeds, and load up ya guns, dunn

Help me at times, and keep our minds organize

See me and my Clik got a thing going on
True to the game and the love makes us strong
For every day trials and tribulations
You try to stop us, get rocked by the nation
See my forefront of soldiers, ready to blow ya
Leave ya back broke and ya body slumped over
The war is on and the stakes is gettin' high
You kill 'em on dead, if them shit where them lie
It's the code of the streets, when you out wit ya peeps
Bumpin' on the beat, be on point for the sweeps
Pigs, harass that ass for the drug cash
Armageddon soon come keep the gun stash
But for the meanwhile, cess ease the stress
Takin' gun shots through the nose, through the chest
Bless the sense, that get me irie
And all praises due to all mighty

Before I go to bed, I take a L to the head
Reminisce over words that was once said
By my man, God rest his soul, I was told stand bold
When under pressure, don't fold

Smif-N-Wessun,"Walkin' down the street, watchin' you, clockin' me
Could it be because I'm magnetic, yet it gives me a fuckin' headache
'cause it's pathetic when niggas jump on ya dick and sweat it
But it gets hectic, when I set it off, by sick jazz niggas pop stressin'
Smif-N-Wessun, from the corner of my red eyes, I peeped you
But you don't know, 'cause I rock my rag real low, move slow
'cause you might get moved on, can't even get my crews on
Without niggas puttin' they screws on, shit ain't cool son
'cause soon one day I feel I'm gonna have to lay somebody for real
A deal is, but Steele is strictly business
So when dick riders slide around, I dismiss shit
And get wit, Boot Camp Clik, how we flip shit
On the regular, forever stay on our own dick

Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you twist up ganja
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you big money spender
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you no follower
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, for Jah Rastafari

I'm pullin' you're coats to the side of the block, we've all been to
See them on the corner when you're lookin' out ya window
The dick riders, on Dick Riders Boulevard
You'se that large, and even got to look hard
You got a couple probably at the crib as we speak
In ninety now, ain't no woman town for the weak
Don't laugh though, stress'll make a nigga hurt somethin'
Precede to get some yard weed 'cause the dred is pumpin'
And as I approach and greetin' by my 'cause Roach
""What up, ya high ass nigga, yo, you're shits the dope!""
And then he just K.I.M., Keep It Moving, damn
And now here comes the dick riders screamin ""You da man""
Until I turn my back, bet to quick to grab the gat
The head dick rider said ""I know where he live at""
See that's what I'm talkin', suckin' dick while you're walkin'
Now you'se the target of the Boot Camp stalk kids

Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you no cop blocker
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you do ganja hot seller
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, for number 1 mama
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, for the rebel winner

Aiyo Haktu (what up son?) You know money over there? (nah)
The one who wan stare over here like I'm tried scared
Me, or maybe check what I wear, see I represent lovely
For my Timb tree to my D-I-see-K, every day, all day, we stay read up
If you ride dicks, then shut up, keep it movin, 'cause
I'm fed up

You took the words right out my mouth, ST
Got niggas ridin' we, tryna' suck on these trees
Pockets full of lent, hummers browner than shit
Wanna suck and duck, 'cause he's the neighborhood dick
Rider, if I was a bag of smoke, would I be chocolate?

Smif-N-Wessun,"Before I lay my head down ta rest 
I roll up a nickel sack of cess ta relieve the stress 
The herb and the Calisthenics do a nigga justice 
They fake cause I'm a snake and cant be trusted 
I put up with none of them punks who front shit 
Even though some I used ta run wit and smoke blunts wit 
Fuck the foreplay lets do shit the raw way 
Kill the he say she say check what we say 

I'm dwellin' in the cellar wit my niggas Heltah Skeltah 
Loadin' up the clips wit lyrics punks run for shelter 
Smif-N-Wessun's on the loose with a noose for yo neck 
You let info slip out so its dead ya get 
Here's the Black Moon we creepin' up in ya room 
Death fills the air along with the scent of boom 
Open ya eyes motherfuckers and greet ya fears 
Off with the head of a snitch then we outta here

Won rhyme for the snitch droppin' dime 
Wontime 
Won rhyme for the heads doin' time 
Wontime 
Won rhyme for the crooks commitin' crime 
Wontime 
Wontime for ya muthafuckin' mind 

Sittin' in the pens with my back against the gate 
Hot as a fuck cant wait ta get that bus headin' upstate 
New plates same faces from the last joint 
Got my banger so when danger come Ill be on point 
In the parallel cell mad niggas flip 
Cause some think they're doin' dip just got his ass ripped 
Juveniles buck wild in this vicinity 
Keep an open eye cause now I sleep with the enemy 
(Watch ya back shorty!) 
Ready ta thump wit any chump without theirs 
Nobody move nobody gets blown from here ta rear 

Thinkin' of a way ta get even wit my P.O. 
Cause I knew the bitch dicked a nigga on the D-Lo 
Now behind bars where scars come in pairs 
Troopin' wit' my blowers in case these niggas wanna bring it here 
Flippin' on the bitch ass, got cash and commissary 
Cause I ain't goin' home ta never worry 
Another straight up ""No"" comin' from the board 
Keep my anger hidden til I'm back up in the ward 
Niggas know whats the word cause the grill is blank 
Once again its on sucka-type grab yo shank 

[Chorus]

Well I was taught two wrongs don't make a right 
But me and Ripper been real tight for awhile an everything's aight 
I got one in store for hardcore fanatics 
Bangin' from basement ta attic put static if ya got dramatics 
Who's the next up for heads, when my leads used up 
I'll use my baseball bats and you'll get bruised up 

Word Life my semi-automatic 
And static smokin' lyes more than a habit 
And our victims die tragic 
We stalk around like the beast out for prey 
Back in the island pullin' more jooks by the day 
Takin' loot wit my crimeys on the run from the coppers 
Boot Camp's on the map and ain't no way that you can stop us 

Get out my way nigga, I'm comin' through deep 
And my fleet packs heat 
Ain't nothin' sweet we play for keeps 
I got money on my mind and my hand on my nine 
Got ta get mine cause my life's on the line 
I roll with the Ripper and the Ripper rolls with me 
And my Brethren D to the O-G 

See we be hittin' up Boom spots a lot 
In the cipher gettin' high with the hoods on the block 
If you don't know me don't even come in my circle 
Fuck around and get me vexed then I'ma hurt you 
Bumba claat rude bwoy lick off ya nine 
As I hit you one time for ya fuckin' mind 

[Chorus]",Wontime,1995
Smif-N-Wessun,"What up? I heard that you got a little prob'
Wit the way that we roll and the heads we done robbed
Stickin' and flickin' the bangers, thrown them out through ya neck
Another beat down inflicted by that nigga Tek

And for ya back, establish, yea I got a sharp dagger
And a left hook that'll cause ya jaw bone to shatter
Whose skilled enough to come test the weeded two
Titans from Bucktown, that'll burn through ya crew

I got a vibe from the session in the back
When niggas is shaft on the ground puffin' meth and kickin' raps
Smif-N-Wessun comin' wit nuff buds and skunk
Fake the funk and get found dead in the trunk

Puffin' the lye, gettin' high to a beat minus two
Choke my yak, is where I lives at and lotta rats
Cooch and pain is my brain, so I don't sweat that
Instead I mack wit a Tek and a Dog, my man Ruckus and Rock
And yo Rippa, what up doc?

The deals going down like this
None affect the mouth, watch ya lips and my boots do a French kiss
Puttin' an end to those who tend to get me aggravated
I'm tired of countin' dues and addin' up the years we waited
Be on the lookout for these mad blunts smokin'
Keep ya girl away from me, 'cause I won't hesitate to stroke it

I'm feelin' the rush from the cannabis plant
But I can't lamp 'cause niggas get me amped
Talkin' this and that but my raps formats phat
And I slap cats that come miss the stand backs

Never could I ever agree on
Cuttin' loose a lot of mic troops that I roll wit for eons
Be on ya tippy top or ya crisply crop
By them crooked cops or the local cop blockers on ya block

I watch my back when for delf
Some say the buzz, but I say the fuzz bad for my health
Huh, critics could get banged like did it
Bowl, first I get lifted wit my click before up in a show

So, I say what I mean, mean what I say
Do what I do, and me not play
Say young God for punks who play hard
Don't be surprised, I'm pullin' ya card, ya better wrekonize

on a journey to see a for real MC
the mind tricks the body
body thinks the mind is crazy
but when I get the slazy
keep my flow I'm swayze
I break, you take
whatever type of shit the nigga Buckshot makes
the incredible lyical and original
You can kill a bull if you want to take it cool
Whatever I see I attack(tack)
Fuck up the back black/nigga fuck that
The devil lurks in my heart yearns for it well
Look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
I hit my head on the concrete to beat defeat

I can break it down like whatever you want

I enta da stage, nigga cock ya gauge
I bust em off somein awful

I gotta nigga on scope throught the eye of an Eagle
but I had the nigga puffin steel

Pain as a niggas brain I'm goin insane

Pick up the route and be jetty wit the loot
don't try to walk wit a switch bitch like your cute

Hands to the sky, soul searching, wearing cheap airs
Guns busting, blades sticking
Bandanas covered the stricken
Many of my niggas ain’t niggas
The story was written by the corrupted who’s only goal is to oppress
If I ain’t believe in jah, put a hole right through their chest
But I'm civilized, focus on breaking into their system
Stacking paper isn’t the goal, it's the intermission
Direct your mind’s energies, not on your enemies
But rather on increasing your charity over centuries
This is meant to warfare with solidarity
My legacy is something to celebrate over centuries

Smif-N-Wessun,"Get him boy

I ain't having it don't try to give me dap
I don't fuck with rats if you take the pack
Better bring that money back
It's a simple fact, that the bill is scrapped
With the milli mac, hit you with a rack
It's a mummy wrap
Haters jumping out got you frozen like a snapshot
Drumroll your whole team the mascot
Pure killa, no filter hoover gang
Real niggas never speak about our murder game

Crippling bullies, black hoodies
Get fully loaded nigga, I smack pussy
Pussy pussy cat, come here pussy cat
Pull that hoodie back
We shooting first ain't no shooting back
I like my bitches from the hood
Head tied with the doobie wrap
She told me bring that big dog
I told her bring that cootie cat
6 inch Ruger, 9 milli in that Louis bag
Down that shit I be quick to cop the tooly back

Bedford Stuyvesant the livest one
My barrel is thorough fill a cold burrow
Niggas on me, I'mma RIP 'em
Put him on display let his homies see him
This young boy think the game is soft
Till they get they whole head knocked off
My nigga still shocked from the crack era
20 years later coming home together

This style is that really good shit
This that wish a nigga would shit
2pac and Suge shit
Got a lot of niggas mad because the money's steady coming in
When I pull my phone out them bitches put they number in
Automatic guns you can call my niggas drummer men
And when they go burrrrahh, you see a bunch of running men
If you ain't fucking with M.A aye well fuck 'em then
The mixtape is coming that's a way to bring the summer in

25 years with an L on it
Put a closed eye no scale on it
Fuck paid a quarter hope it come back
If not guns out and we come back
Still from day one all about the money
Paranoid niggas so they move funny
Taught a boy learn from the hand to hand
Death is life, you can die or you stand

I don't give a fuck, not a motherfuck
Not a single solitary fuck
Pussy cream when the pistol buck
Keep a pistol tucked
Come up missing when you mess with us
Fuck the game, bitch I run the team the commissioner
I'mma freak, I'mma vicious one
Got some bitches tougher than you niggas that will hit you up
Tell the coroner, zip you up
Pop a zip, tell a sensai roll a cinci up

Brooklyn, home of the official
Motherfuckers comeing with a shock for your body tissue
Probably miss you if you was somebody important
Irrelevant rappers getting clapped in that black coffin
That's often seen when I'm on the scene nah-mean?
M.A said get him Buck, I get him with the team nah-mean?
When I'm on the scene nah-mean?
M.A said get him Buck, I get him with the team
Get him boy feel what I'm spitting boy
When the clip deploy niggas get destroyed
RIP, now all I need is a clip of blow it in the crowd
Fuck loud that ain't shit to me, I'm a riot
Nigga try it, you a joke no laughing
But I'mma grab 'e see heads dying
Feds eying shots firing
BK the liars men bitch where I just went

Smile Dk,"Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue 
Thought I heard you talking softly 

I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio 
Still I can´t escape the ghost of you 

What has happened to it all? 
Crazy, some´d say 
Where is the life that I recognize? 
Gone away 

But I won´t cry for yesterday 
There´s an ordinary world 
Somehow I have to find 
And as I try to make my way 
To the ordinary world 
I will learn to survive 

Passion or coincidence 
Once prompted you to say 
""Pride will tear us both apart"" 
Well now pride´s gone out the window 
Cross the rooftops, run away 
Left me in the vacuum of my heart 

What is happening to me? 
Crazy, some´d say 
Where is my friend when I need you most? 
Gone away

It's peak when I brainstorm, bring an umbrella
Sell a, parcel, sell out, never
From the city of god like I was raised in a favela
Smiler got the vocals that'll burn in ya set
The illest, more British than the fuckin' Burberry check
I'm king Zeus, so you see my friends all gods
I'm Phil Collins B, against all odds
I'm Lino Lacedelli after climbing the K2
Haters question will he ever sign will he breakthrough
And then they show me love and gimme hugs when I skate through
Supporters tell me, Smiler you're the best, never make do
So when the verse drop now and man hears ""bravo""
It's first round knockout, the Amir Khan flow
Truth is I made it to the stage from the block I suppose
Now I'm feeling I'm on top of the globe, let's go!

Another day in the life of me
This is the life I lead
And if you're looking through my eyes
There's no one else in sight
Hello, hello, can anybody hear me? (Can you hear me?)
Cause I'm on top of the world

Ask Jay and Kanye who run the town, Smiler!
I made it from the block with hard prayer
Been on the dock longer than the yachts in Marbella
Now my wings spread like the bird on ya Lyle & Scott Crest
The bottom sucks B, can I reside on top? ""Yes""
A child o' destiny, next to be chosen
So I watch X-factor just for Kelly Rowland
Yo we about to win, get a glass out kid
More money more problems so I blast out big
Never mind the competition, they'll be cast out quick
Like my feature in the pass out vid
I chew my own lane like a game of Pacman
Look at what I got from no Robin, I'm Batman, truth is

Like it love it or hate it
It's a bitch, ain't it?
From how I can treat the car showroom like an Avis
I tend to use my right arm whenever I'm waving
Cause I'm aching from waving with my left arm
Due to what my watch is weighing
I'm saying, my watch is heavy if you don't get it forget it
I've always been more leg it then legit
A reputable eligible bachelor credible I ain't
I ain't credible – bitch I'm incredible
I don't know if it's the wage or the venomous pace I lay flows at
All I know is that I'm in an incredible space
I don't need for nothing don't normally floss
I must have some food in my teeth or suttin'
Tooth pick before I skin 'em still 'em rock denim
It's hot stop do not tell 'em, I hook venom in my verses

Smiley Burnette,"Ridin' down the canyon, to watch the sun go down
A picture, that no artist ever could paint
White faced cattle lowin' on the mountain side
I hear a coyote whinin' for its mate

Cactus plants are bloomin', sagebrush every where
Granite spires are standin' all around
I tell you folks it's Heaven, to be ridin' down the trail
When the desert sun goes down

When evening chores are over at our ranch house on the plain
And all I've got to do is lay around
I saddle up, my pony and I ride off down the trail
To watch the desert sun go down

Ridin' down the canyon, to watch the sun go down
A picture that no artist ever could paint
White faced cattle lowin' on the mountain side

Roll lexus only top watch

Chorus: Southstar (Smilez)
You can twerk's out, you can get crunk

Yo, you feelin' lucky then try touch me

And your swil seedin' got your girl creepin'

It's on a cold table gettin' surgery
We doin' it again haters still pissed
Still mad over ""Who Wants This""
Deal with it Smilez always real with it (Uh-huh)
HDT be clear when I spit it
How you want it? East or West Coast style
Or Dirty South slowin' it down
Or thuggin' it out bustin' a pound (Uh)
Smilez goes both ways, pick your rail (Uh)

Smilez says Chorus

(Southstar)
Still want to play? I don't think so
I got no draws, only K.O's
Only homeruns, I never miss three's
What I'm sayin' is ya can't fuck with me (Hell no)
This won't take long it's a quick 'bout
Game over c'mon scream my name out (Southstar)
Raise my arm up call me the champ
You thought you was the man now you's a loyal fan

(Smilez)
Yo, get your dring on, get your smoke on
Pop pills till' you fall out on the floor
I know your love strong, but he doing you wrong
Let that man next door hit it to the song

If ya'll spit bullets I spit missles
You know I stay pissy, off that 50-50

For sho
It's alright",Alright,2002

Yo this is Smilez and South-Stigga with just say no
We gon' kill y'all with this vernacular flow, for sho'
We about to blow and leave out all y'all windows
Cop the new coupe and traded all y'all old Pintos
FiFi's fabric acid, it's so simple, yeah

[Chorus: 4X with ad-libs]
We keep it gully
We keep it gully
We keep it gully
Gully, gully, gully

[Verse 1: Southstar]
I'm so grimey, I keep y'all behind me
Spit so raw I'll make y'all rewind me
Just to learn the song, just to rap along
I'm like Mills Lane, ready to get it on
I'ma prove a point, listen to the joint
Only hot shit, I don't ever disappoint
And even with that cheedar, I keep it so gutter
And even with the pressure, man I won't stutter
Yo this ain't no joke, I'll make ya speak in smoke
If ya get to close give ya a heat stroke
See it's my time, can't take the shine
And when I'm done with this they buildin' me a shrine
So in the meantime make this game mine
I got enough rhymes to last a lifetime
So I'ma keep goin' ain't no way of slowin' me down
Cause you know Southstar'll keep flowin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Smilez]
You know the flow sick, know this, Smilez focus
Drop sixteen and ya man's foldin'
Burpin' after I eat him for din-din
And look at his boys, they like I'm not with him
Yo Smilez keep it gully up in the Lex buggy
With ma rubbin' my tummy and suckin' babies from me
And girls real funny not understandin' my mack
I'm not Jordan, once I'm done with you there's no comin' back
Keep my hat tucked low anywhere I choose to go
want to meet my dough, first meet my fo-fo
Cause niggaz act sour when they around ya
But bullets like aliens, don't catch a close encounter
Rhymes you can bet, keep 'em fat nothin' less
Put this in ya face and you'll catch a cardiac arrest
Who cares how dope you is or who you rollin' with
You can't touch a hair on my chinny-chin chin, BITCH!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Smilez & Southstar]
Hey yo we straight out the O, O-Town, just so you know
It's mister Smi-dow and it's South-Stizzo
In the Lex and the Benz, and we comin through slow
Ridin' on dubs, chicks like there they go
With a pinwheel cap and a throwback jersey
Dude need to bring his youth back cause they mercky
Girls love Smilez he a freak Kirspy
And I got the whole world beggin' me mercy
Techs so raw y'all don't want no more
We in it to win it you know that's for sure
And this is just the begginin' we got more in store
We gon' kick in the door big style on you dog
We gon' buy out the mall, cause another storm
If they do cop another one and that's our law
And my words is bionic, y'all nigga don't want it
Have you red, white, and blue make you patriotic

Yea this right here
Is going out to all them girls out there
That did me and south wrong, ya know?
Tell you a lil story its the reason

Love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
We date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
Too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
What's going on what's going on

Yo, eh yo me and miss thang
We run a perfect team
We had all the things all them other couples fiend
Love, trust, good sex, and security
If you ever felt weak Smilez was your energy
Trips across seas, show you the finer things
No more burger king it was fine dine, cuisine
And if it never had it, I don't think it mattered
We were a classic like Nas in Illmatic
I was so deceived, I thought we had a thing
You used to blow my 2 way up wit 143s
Da L-O-V had me blind I would had to see
I trusted my friends, all they were yelling at me
How could you do me so wrong, I don't want to get dogged
I invested three years ma, plus this song
I'm so confused, where to go? How do I choose?
I guess to find real love I gotta pay my dues

Love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
We date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
Too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
What's going on what's going on

It seems so good, yo we used to chill in the hood
You made me feel that tingle in my heart like nobody could
And all the long we stood, when times was hard
Even before all  this rap shit made me a star
When I was working two jobs, just to survive
When I felt like killin' myself you kept me alive
What a pair, me and you, we was a match
Different tastes, but you know opposites attract
By my side, hold my head, and kept me strong
Still trying to figure out, where the hell we went wrong
I did what I can, young cat made a man
Stayed and weathered the storm, when most would of ran
Too much pride, and you know men don't cry
Had to let you go even though it hurt inside
All by myself, now I had to turn to these rhymes
Its the only way I know to release my mind.

Love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
We date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
Too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
What's going on what's going on

Its been a while yea you know time goes fast
Let me tell you though, some things still don't pass
Sit back in the pad, think about the times we had
Try not to let it make me sad, or make me mad
I'm tryin' to move on wit my life, the wound is healed
Yea I'm just speakin' it real, I'm ready to feel
Ready to provide for my seed, a man now
Bet you can't believe its me

You ruined a good thing and all of our dreams
Tryin' to lock me down a lifetime in the beam
Monitoring my calls, griping at my dawgs
I never really understood the cause
My friends were your friends
Your friends were my friends
Your doe was my doe
My doe is my doe
Mano why mano
We'll fought this weather
And everybody that's been through it
Then sing it together.

I was born in all black, how could God denounce this?
I told Him, 'Give me my money, I need my money now'

Who died for one live balling our peace!

To the stars and the planets and not tha phallic's
Just sun, stars and talks about Mars I got to have it

The only bit of innocence that I ever had
From my a semen from my father from my grandads
Grandson in London to educate one not just books
I traveled the world like Lisa not dumb

While sucker sippah's living life for face value
Think your brand new 
But you ain't changing so damn you
Lost souls who never moved on with their shoes on

In a situation that they can't improve on
Kinda sad situation bad if you live like that 
Shit can send you mad

On that Robert De Niro mate talking out loud
Acting to put the fear right back in
Your cerebellum but first I tell 'em facts
And certain heads are swelling

Because they don't like the rhythm
For some it's easier to tell than to listen so listen
Realism and truth ain't the same wave
Within the brainwave check the difference

The order is to maintain
Throughout the struggle and the strife
Because if is the middle word within 
The word Life word life

I'm concealing, I don't know why
It's just a mental, sentimental alibi

But I adore you
So strong for you
Why go on stalling
I am falling
Our love is calling
Why be shy?

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?

Let's close our eyes and make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try
To make a go of it

We might have an end for each other
To be or not be
Let our hearts discover

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it, while we are young

Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2004

I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank

Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G

'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman

I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash

Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why

We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car

All the color's washed away
I've had it now for more damn years
Than I can count anyway
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

This shirt's got silver buttons
And a place upon the sleeve
Where I used to set my heart up
Right there anyone could see
This shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance
Where the boys ignored the girls
And we all pretended to like the band

This shirt was a pillow for my head
On a train through Italy
This shirt was a blanket beneath the love
We made in Argeles
This shirt was lost for three whole days
In a town near Buffalo
'Till I found the locker key
In a downtown Trailways bus depot

This shirt was the one I lent you
And when you gave it back
There was a rip inside the sleeve
Where you rolled your cigarettes
It was the place I put my heart
Now look at where you put a tear
I forgave your thoughtlessness
But not the boy who put it there

This shirt was the place your cat
Decided to give birth to five
And we stayed up all night watching
And we wept when the last one died
This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton
Shining like the memories
Inside those silver buttons

This shirt is a grand old relic
With a grand old history

I wear it beneath my jacket

Maybe I should go

Go crazy, go insane, go for everything
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?
Really, really, really really though?
Really, really, really though?

As to my procrastination due to my revelations

So if you see me out in public show me respect and we aight
And yes you can have an autograph
But if I’m with a girl or my family and friends
I don’t get that much so please don’t ask
Pick and choose, you respect me as a person, I’ll reciprocate
Tip my hat and give you dap and I will just be on my way

Shoot for the top, ain’t no looking back

Bought me a mic, best day of my life
Ever since then I just make this music
Put it out for them to hate
But I’m Superman, my skin too thick to be penetrated
So many people always been telling me that I never would make it
But I’m an artist, how many times must I demonstrate it?
Now it’s my time to take it, I made my choices
But now so many people in my ear I’m hearing voices
So if you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign

I’m just tryna live my life like I’m supposed to be
While I’m following the path that has chosen me
Now it’s everywhere I go people notice me
Feet planted with my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low, and I don’t see no haters
My eyes red, cause I’m always medicated
Now they say I made it, cause I’m elevated
But my feet planted and my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low, I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low with my head up high
And I’ma keep my brim low",Brim Low,2015
Smoke,"Damn. 
I'm broke. 
My feet hurt. 
(Inside the mind of a car jacker) 
And that bitch is slippin'. 
It makes me wanna, creep. 
It makes me wanna, creep. 

Damn  I'm such a G it's pathetic 
Here comes the big headed 
Nigga that's dippin' 
Sippin' on Courvoisier 
Goddamn I must havta floss today 
Now pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary 
So I'm chasin' bitches like Tom chased Jerry 
I'll put the pedal to the flo-uh 
In my two-tone Ford Explo-uh 
You know how it's done 
Sounds bumpin 
Ain't that somethin'? 
Jumped on the 110 
She's flyin' in the Blazer 
Like ""Go Speed Racer"" 
But I ain't gonna chase her 
Like Racer X 
But I won't flex 
Til it's time to have sex 
So when you want to get together? 
Cause you know a nigga like me 
Is down for whatever 

And I'm down for whatever 

When I was little I didn't want to be like Mike 
I wanted to be like Ike 
Cause 
Papa Was A Rolling Stone in the sixties 
And he liked green like Bill Bixby 
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty 
Pokets never skinny 
Played let's get it on in the living room 
And hwne he gets drunk you better give him room
Cause he'll turn the party out sayin', ""This is my motherfuckin' house"" 
And y'all gots to go 
Through the door 
And if you can't find the door 
He'll help you with the four-four 
Talkin' much shit on the grass 
And straight down to blast 
I'm still in my p.j.'s 
He's in a turtleneck sweater 
And we down for whatever 

And I'm down 
Solid Pro is down for whatever 
The Don Jaguar is down for whatever 
And it don't seem to stop 

Now 
I don't talk a lot of shit 
But when it's time to get busy with these hos, let's go 
Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead 
Then my niggas wearin' blue or red 
Cause I got the gift 
To hit these hos swift 
And I'm smellin' like a fifth 
Of somethin'
Yeah, that's right 
I'm standin' in the store 
Koreans 
Act so nice 
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells 
Doughnut
And you know what? 
I'm Cool Like That like Digable Planets 
But don't take a nigga for granted 
Cause whether it's a verdict of the L.A. four 
You just don't know 
That this rappin'-ass nigga will change with the weather 
And be down for whatever 

And I'm down 
Creep. 
And I'm down for whatever 

Ice Cube, devoid of pop 
And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas 

It makes me wanna, creep. 
It makes me wanna, creep.",Down for Whatever,2004
Smoke,"I got me a girl, my little pearl. 'Cause when I met her she changed my whole world!
But what I've seen out there, it ain't fair, all those beautiful honeys with long luscious hair.
I just want to call'm, be ball'n, Show em' the shit that I'm haulin'
Bring home the bitches, take off their britches, fuck them and my girl like mad wicked witches!
Show em' a good time, break out the wine, cause fuck'n two girls would be so fine!

[Chorus:] 
It's not a phenomenon! Two girls is all I want! In a menage a trois! Fucking like ""Ooh La La!""

Lay em' on the bed, at the foot and the head, I want to fuck em' hard til their faces turn red
Give me some, let em' cum, nice and slow like ooh yum yum!
I'll lick some clit, and suck some tits, while one of y'all deep throats my dick.
I hope you want, my dick in your cunt, cause I'm gonna hit that with my funk.

I'm in Miami actin' ghetto hollerin' out Shy run it 
And you can see I hold the crown ain't no taken it from me 
I let my chain hang down from my neck to my tummy 
I got a pet pink poodle named FiFi 
I love taking pictures cause these bitches wanna be me 
I only swim in Donatella or some Givenchy 
You can catch me on the yacht we chasin' vodka wit some Fiji 
You bitches ain't know I do this shit for fun 
My daddy got that paper I been rich since I was one 
Been living in them mansions been soaking up the sun 
Can see me in that Rolls or that Ferrari either one 
Before you try to holla at me know I'm bout that paper 
And I'm a I'm a a hustler I don't need no package saver 
They feelin' all my flava and that ass so plush

She's a ten in them nines with stilettos 
With a figure 8 frame in them 7 jeans

She's a trophy I put her on a pedestal 
Damn the can be feelin' the way it shake 
I wanna jam it in her jello 
Anything for me she want it 
Like a beast she be so funky you can see it from the front 
She got more ass than a team of donkeys 
Itty bitty waist like a bumble bee 
Titties plump please Dolly Parton up 
When she walk through and make way for the double D's 
I love that pretty brown round 
She shaking got me shook 
Cause her print so fat between her thighs 
It look just like a camel foot 
Can I look can I rub it 
Matter fact fuck that let me cut it 
Can I touch it can I grab it 
That hairy nappy fat rabbit 
Meet me there I take a flight 
Your dark chocolate fittin' to be up in the air like a kite 
Caught up in the Chicago wind 
Just to be up in your guts from dust to dawn 
Humpin' like a camel back 
From am from pm from pm to am 
I'll beat it up like a punching bag 

Damn she got a donkey 
And that shit so chunky 
How she get them jeans on that monkey 
Like blam got me like a junky

Hold up wait a minute step back let a nigga just catch my breath 
Got 'em all up on it want it Watch it go right to left 
Watch it go up and down like that 
Watch it go front to back Hope it don't hurt too bad 
Cause it's gonna make me mad 
You like it how I do it fast Love it how I do it slow 
They Like it how I move it up and down and make that booty roll 
They see that pussy swoll It be so juicy oh
He said he wanna try to take me home and eat that pussy whole 
Said he never had the chance But he gotta have a taste 
And he was like a kid and I was like shit I just wanna ride the face 
And that's just how I play 'em I ain't never been out to lay 'em 
My shit's so mean up in them jeans And now I gotta 'em sayin'

Smoke,"Everything really is stupidly simple
And yet all around is utter confusion
Fairy tales written may help you to see it
Do you understand about Lewis's Alice?
We fit all our lives into regular patterns
All that we really know is that we're really living

(spoken:
The man that seeks the world, his wisdom seeks to know his mind
And knowing where his feet should walk, and when he should or should not
talk And have a friend to find
Don't look around to find the sound that's right beneath your feet
The hermit sits inside his cave and seeks to know his mind
Staring into empty space and seeing things in people's faces others cannot find
Don't look around to find the sound that's right beneath your feet)

We've nothing to hide so why try to hide it?
I know there are some but they're screwed up inside
