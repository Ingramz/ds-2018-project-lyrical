Infected Mushroom,"Why can't I see what's in front of me?

I see the doors that I can't open
Adding locks from time to time
When it opens something blocks me
And I'm asking myself why
Did I take the step I wanted
Was it just a state of mind?
I feel sorry for myself
Every time I close my eyes.

And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more 
And I can take no more 
And I can take no more 
And I can take no more 

Why can't I see what's in front of me?

What's behind the door I wonder
Must be brighter than my past
Will I feel a little different
When I take myself across
Was it really worth the turning?
Was it just a foolish task
I feel sorry for myself
When I open up my eyes

And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more.

Down the street of my soul 

You take my self, you take my self control 
You got me livin' only for the night

You help me to forget to play my role 
You take my self, you take my self control

I haven't got the will to try and fight 
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it

Oh, so fast
My time is flying by
Relentless
I'm senseless

Why does it speed up?
Inside I heat up
Aging and raging because of what won't return
Acceptance is a joke
Don't you know?
No one can honestly
Say they age happily
So much I'm wasting
While I am hasting
Please come to terms with the fact that I'll never learn

So take me back to youth tonight
Bring me back to living
'Cause I can't live without my life
Time is unforgiving
Is it just me who's hurt?
Or do you feel the same as me?

That your age is never right
It's always out of place
Always out of place...

I used to think one day
I would say
""It's time, so here I am!""
It's such a shame, it never came
'Cause procrastination
And my hesitation
Has ruined my chance to enjoy every song and dance

So take me back to youth tonight...

That I am longing
To be a part of you

I am still a child
That never grew up
Then I awake
Feeling sad, it's gone
But why?
What do I seek?

Bad days, bad ways I was always upset
Time gone, long gone and I tend to forget
Past tense, no sense, but I like my present me

Back in the jungle a man was free
Free from fear, from urban captivity, cause
No where a color, we heard that too
Brother got as sick as you
Runing trough his face, just like the ocean
So they won't admit that, so take caution
Coz the enemy just want to separate
The human race, so there ain't no time to debate
Start taking care of yourself, find your soul
And that's an individual that you find your course HU!
Start to use your mind for the people
Cause this is the food that makes us evil
Disagree, the proof will show it's red
And the truth to turn from the shame

Shoot the racist and the area turns red
Shoot the racist and the area turns red
Shoot the racist and the area turns red
Shoot -shoot-and the area turns red

I pick up with the dance, and the people drop dead
Cause the area turns red

That the area turn red
Come and dance with the people that

And everything you said was real
And everything I said was right
That we don't have to fear the night

Then I'm in light and I still find
That when we look around we still feel
Like we're running out of time
And there is nothing left for us to try

We stay together now
When all the signals say we
Should move on from here

But I don't think it's coincidence
And I don't believe in accidents

Why are we still here

Come back down and we still find
That all our waking fears are around us and
Shining in our eyes
They are blinding out the skies

And try to see your face
