The Dubliners,"I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
Ghetto America!

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences

[Chorus]

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Standing here throwing them songs at me
Somebody pray for me

[Repeat: x3]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay",I Wish (Till Apples Grow on an Ivy Tree) [#][*],1964
The Dubliners,"BOULAVOGUE
(P.J.McCall)
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormack,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
""Arm! Arm!"" he cried, ""for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die.""
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

The Dubliners,"I've been a wild rover for many's the year
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store 
And I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me ""nay""
""Such a custom as yours I can have every day""

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

I then took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She says ""I have whiskeys and wines of the best""
And the words that you tolt me were only in jest

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

I'll home to my parents, confess what I'd done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they've caressed me as ofttimes before
I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover

The Dubliners,"Tim Finnegan lived in watling street
A gentle Irishman, mighty odd
He'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet
To rise in the world, he carried a hod

See, he'd sort of a tipplin' way
With love for the liquor poor Tim was born
To help him on with his work each day
He'd a drop of the craythur every morn'

Whack fol, de, dah
Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

One morning Tim got rather full
His head felt heavy which made him shake
Fell from a ladder and he broke his skull
They carried him home, his corpse to wake

Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And laid him out upon the bed
A gallon of whiskey at his feet
And a bottle of porter at his head

Whack fol, de, dah
Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

His friends assembled at the wake
And misses Finnegan called for lunch
First she brought in tea and cake
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch

Biddy O'Brien began to cry
Such a nice clean corpse, did you ever see?
Tim mavourneen, why did you die?
Arrah, hold your gob, said Patty Megee

Whack fol, de, dah
Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job
""Arrah"", biddy says, she ye're wrong, I'm sure
Biddy then gave her a belt on the gob
And left her sprawling on the floor

There the war did soon engage
Woman to woman and man to man
Shillelah law was all the rage
An a row and a ruction soon began

Whack fol, de, dah
Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

Then Mickey Maloney raised his head
When a bottle of whiskey flew at him
It missed him falling on the bed
The liquor scattered over Tim

Tim revives, see how he rises
Timothy rising from the bed
Then Whirl your whiskey around
Like blazes Thanum an Dhul
Do ye think I'm dead?",Finnegan Wakes,1966
The Dubliners,"Fine girl you are! 
Adieu to you my Dinah a thousand times adieu 
We`re going away from the Holy Ground and the girls that we love true 
We will sail the South sea over and then return for sure 
To see again the girls we love and the Holy Ground once more 

Chorus: 
Fine girl you are! Your`re the girl that I adore  
and still I live in hopes to see The Holy Ground once more. Fine girls you are! 

See the storm a-rising I see it coming soon, 
And the sky it is so cloudy you can scarcely see the moon. 
And the good old ship, she was tossing about, 
The riggin`was all tore, and still I live with hopes to see, The Holy ground once more. 

And now the storm it is over and we are safe on shore, 
We will drink a toast to the Holy Ground and the girls that we adore. 
We will drink strong ale and porter and make the rafters roar, 
And when our money is all spent we`ll go to sea for more.",The Holy Ground,1967
The Dubliners,"As down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by
No fife did hum, no battle drum
Did sound its dred tattoo
But the Angelus bells o'er the Liffey's swell
Rang out through the foggy dew

Right proudly high over Dublin town
They hung out the flag of war
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with theirlong-range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew

'Twas Brittania bade our wild geese go
That small nations might be free
But their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves
On the shore of the gray North Sea
But had they died by Pearse's side
Or fought with Cathal Brugha
Their names we would keep where the Fenians sleep
'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew

But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide
In the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze
At those fearless men, but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew",The Foggy Dew,1967
The Dubliners,"I'll tell me ma, when I go home
The boys won't leave the girls alone
Pulled me hair, stolen me comb

She is the belle of Dublin city
She is a-courting one, two, three
Pray, want you tell me who is she?

Albert Mooney says he loves her
All the boys are fightin' for her
Knock at the door, they're ringin' the bell
Say, ""Hello, my true love are you well?""

Out she comes white as snow
Rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
Ol' Jenny Murray says she'll die
If she doesn't get the fellow with the roving eye

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high
And the snow come travelin' through the sky
She's as sweet as apple pie
She'll get her own right by and by

When she gets a lad of her own
She won't tell her ma when she gets home
Let them all come as they will
It's Albert Mooney she loves still

I'll tell me ma, when I go home

The Dubliners,"In the County Tyrone, near the town of Dungannon, 
Where many the ructions meself had a hand in.
Bob Williamson lived, a weaver by trade, 
And all of us thought him a stout Orange blade, 
On the Twelfth of July as it yearly did come, 
Bob played with his flute to the sound of a drum.
You may talk of your harp, your piano or lute, 
But none can compare with the Old Orange Flute.

Bob, the deceiver, he took us all in; 
He married a Papist named Bridget McGinn.
Turned Papist himself and forsook the old cause
That gave us our freedom, religion and laws.
Now, boys of the townland made some noise upon it, 
And Bob had to fly to the province of Connaught.
He fled with his wife and his fixings to boot, 
And along with the latter his Old Orange Flute.

At the chapel on Sunday to atone for past deeds, 
He'd say Pater and Aves and counted his brown beads.
'Til after some time, at the priest's own desire
He went with that old flute to play in the choir.
He went with that old flute for to play for the Mass, 
But the instrument shivered and sighed, oh, alas, 
And try though he would, though it made a great noise, 
The flute would play only ""The Protestant Boys.""

Bob jumped and he stared and got in a flutter
And threw the old flute in the blessed holy water.
He thought that this charm would bring some other
Sound; 
When he tried it again, it played ""Croppies Lie Down.""
Now, for all he could whistle and finger and blow, 
To play Papish music he found it no go.
""Kick the Pope"" and ""The Boyne Water"" it freely would
Sound, 
But one Papish squeak in it couldn't be found.

At the council of priests that was held the next day
They decided to banish the old flute away.
They couldn't knock heresy out of it's head, 
So they bought Bob a new one to play in it's stead.
'Twas fastened and burned at the stake as a heretic.
As the flames soared around it, they heard a strange
Noise; 
'Twas the old flute still whistling ""The Protestant
Boys.""
""Toora lu, toora lay, 
Oh, it's six miles from Bangor to Donnahadee.""",The Old Orange Flute,1967
The Dubliners,"Will you come to the bower o'er the free boundless ocean
Where stupendous waves roll in thundering motion
Where the mermaids are seen and the wild tempest gather
To loved Erin the green, the dear land of our fathers

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

Will you come to the land of O'Neill and O'Donnell
Of Lord Lucan of old and the immortal O'Connell
Where Brian chased the Dane and St. Patrick the vermin
And whose valleys remain still most beautiful and
Charming

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

You can visit Benburb and the storied Blackwater
Where Owen Roe met Munroe and his Chieftains did slaughter
Where the lambs skip and play on the mossy all over
From those bright golden views to enchanting Rostrevor

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

You can see Dublin City and the fine groves of Blarney
The Bann, Boyne, the Pillar and the lakes of Killarney
You can ride on the tide on the broad majestic Shannon
You can sail round Lough Neagh and see storied
Dungannon

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

You can visit New Ross, gallant Wexford and Gorey
Where the green was last seen by proud Saxon and Tory
Where the soil is sanctified by the blood of each true man
Where they died satisfied that their enemies they
Wouldn't run from

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

Will you come and awake our dear land from its slumber
And her fetters we'll break, links that long have encumbered
And the air will resound with Hosannahs to greet you
On the shore will be found gallant Irishmen to greet you

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower",Will You Come to the Bower?,1967
The Dubliners,"Have you heard of one Humpty Dumpty
How he fell with a roll and a rumble
And curled up like Lord Olofa Crumple
By the butt of the Magazine Wall

Of the Magazine Wall/Hump, helmet and all?

He was one time our King of the Castle
Now he's kicked about like a rotten old parsnip.
And from Green Street he'll be sent by order of His Worship
To the penal jail of Mountjoy

To the jail of Mountjoy!/Jail him and joy.

He was fafafather of all schemes for to bother us
Slow coaches and immaculate contraceptives for the populace,
Mare's milk for the sick, seven dry Sundays a week,
Openair love and religion's reform,

And religious reform/Hideous in form.

Arrah, why, says you, couldn't he manage it?
I'll go bail, me fine dairyman darling,
Like the bumping bull of the Cassidys
All your butter is in your horns

His butter is in his horns./Butter his horns!

Hurrah there, Hosty, frosty Hosty, change that shirt on ye
Hurrah there, Hosty, frosty Hosty, change that shirt on ye,
Rhyme the rann, the king of all ranns!

We had chaw chaw chops, chairs, chewing gum, 
The chicken pox and china chambers
Universally provided by this soffsoaping salesman.
Small wonder He'll Cheat E'erawan our local lads nicknamed him
When Chimpden first took the floor

With his bucketshop store
Down Bargainweg, Lower.

So snug he was in his hotel premises sumptuous
But soon we'll bonfire all his trash, tricks and trumpery
And 'tis short till sheriff Clancy'll be winding up his unlimited
Company
With the bailiff's bom at the door

Bimbam at the door/Then he'll bum no more.

Sweet bad luck on the waves washed to our island
The hooker of the hammerfast viking
And Gall's curse on the day when Eblana bay
Saw his black and tan man-o'-war

Saw his man-o'-war/On the harbour bar.

Scampitle, wick an wipin'fampiny
Fingal Mac Oscar Onesine Bargearse Boniface
Thok's min gammelhole Norveegickers moniker
Og as ay are at gammelhore Norveegickers cod.

A Norwegian camel old cod./He is, begod.

Lift it, Hosty, lift it, ye devil ye! up with the rann, the rhyming
Rann!

It was during some fresh water garden pumping
Or according to the Nursing Mirror, while admiring the monkeys
That our heavyweight heathen Humpharey
Made bold a maid to woo

Woohoo, what'll she doo!
The general lost her maidenloo!

He ought to blush for himself, the old hayheaded philosopher
For to go and shove himself that way on top of her.
Begob, he's the crux of the catalogue
Of our antediluvial zoo


Messrs. Billing and Coo.
Noah's larks, good as no.

He was joulting by Wellinton's monument
Our rotorious hipppopopotamuns
When some bugger let down the backtrap of the omnibus
And he caught his death of fusiliers,

With his rent in his rears./Give him six years.

'Tis sore pity for his innocent poor children
But look out for his missus legitimate!
When that frew gets a grip of old Earwicker
Won't there be earwigs on the green?

Big earwigs on the green,
The largest ever you seen.

Suffoclose! Shikespower! Suedodanto! Anonymoses!

Then we'll have a free trade Gaels' band and mass meeting
For to sod the brave son of Scandiknavery
And we'll bury him down in Oxmanstown
Along with the devil and Danes,

With the deaf and dumb Danes,/And all their remains.

And not all the king's men nor his horses
Will resurrect his corpus
For there's no true spell in Connacht or hell",Humpty Dumpty,1969

The Dubliners,"In comes the train and the whole platform shakes
It stops with a shudder and a screaming of brakes
The parting has come and my weary soul aches
I'm leaving my Nancy, oh

But you stand there so calmly determinedly gay
You talk of the weather and events of the day
And your eyes tell me all that your tongue doesn't say
Goodbye my Nancy, oh

And come a little closer
Put your head upon my shoulder
And let me hold you one last time
Before the whistle blows

My suitcase is lifted and stowed on the train
And a thousand regrets whirl around in my brain
The ache in my heart is a black sea of pain
I'm leaving my Nancy, oh

But you stand there beside me so lovely to see
The grip of your hand is an unspoken plea
You're not fooling yourself and you're not fooling me

Put your head upon my shoulder
And let me hold you one last time

Here I must leave you standing alone
We had so little time and now the time's gone
Goodbye my Nancy, oh

And as the train starts gently to roll
And as I lean out to wave and to call
I see the first tears trickle and fall

She's got a mouth as big as galway bay

See her drinkin' 16 pints of Pat's blue ribbon
And then she can walk home without a sway
If the sea were beer instead of salty water
She would live and die in galway bay

See her drinkin 16 pints at pat joe murphys
When the barman says ""I think its time to go""
She doesn't try to speak to him in gaelic
But a language that the clergy do not know

She rubs the sunlight soap around by Claddaugh
Just to watch the suds roll down on Galway Bay",Galway Bay,1993
The Dubliners,"One pleasant evening in the month of June
As I was sitting with my glass and spoon
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch

Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire?
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

You killed my poor father but dare you kill me

The Dubliners,"As I went down to Galway Town
To seek for recreation
On the seventeenth of August
Me mind being elevated
There were passengers assembled
With their tickets at the station
And me eyes began to dazzle
And they off to see the races

With me wack fol the do fol
The diddle idle day

There were passengers from Limerick
And passengers from Nenagh
The boys of Connemara
And the Clare unmarried maiden
There were people from Cork City
Who were loyal, true and faithful
Who brought home the Fenian prisoners
From dying in foreign nations

And it's there you'll see the pipers
And the fiddlers competing
And the sporting wheel of fortune
And the four and twenty quarters
And there's others without scruple
Pelting wattles at poor Maggie
And her father well contented
And he gazing at his daughter

And it's there you'll see the jockeys
And they mounted on so stably
The pink, the blue, the orange, and green
The colors of our nation
The time it came for starting
All the horses seemed impatient
Their feet they hardly touched the ground
The speed was so amazing!

There was half a million people there
Of all denominations
The Catholic, the Protestant, the Jew, the Presbyterian
Yet there was no animosity
No matter what persuasion
But failte hospitality
Inducing fresh acquaintance",The Galway Races,1993
The Dubliners,"Though the night be dark as dungeon, not a star to be seen above
I will be guided without a stumble, into the arms of me only love

I rapped on her bedroom window 
My darling dear, do you lie alone?

I'm a rover, seldom sober
I'm a rover of high degree
Ans when I'm drinking, I'm always thinking
How to gain my love's company

She raised her head up from her feather pillow
Raised her arms up around her breast
Saying who's at me bedroom window, disturbing me at me long night's rest?
It's only me, your own true lover, open the door and please let me in
For I have come on a long night's journey
I am near drenched to the skin

The Dubliners,"Come, all you lads and lassies, and listen to me a while
I'll sing to you a verse or two that will surely make you smile
Concerning a young man I'm going to tell you now
Who has lately came a-courtin' the maid of the sweet brown knowe

This young man says, ""My pretty maid, will you come along with me?
We'll both fly off together, and happy we will be
We'll join our hands in wedlock bands as I'm speaking with you now
And I'll do my best endeavor for the maid of the sweet brown knowe""

This fair and fickle young thing, she knew not what to say
Her eyes did shine like diamonds bright and merrily did play
She says, ""Young man, your love's subdued, for I'm not ready now
And I'll spend another season at the foot of the sweet brown knowe

The young man said: ""My pretty maid, how can you answer so?
See down in yonder valley where my crops do gently grow
Down in yonder valley I have horses, men and plow
And they`re at the daily labor for the maid of the sweet brown knowe""

""If they're at their daily labor, kind sir, 't is not for me
I've heard of your behavior, I have indeed,"" said she
""There is an inn where you call in, I've heard the people say
And you rap and you call and you pay for all and go home at the break of day

""If I rap and I call and I pay for all, the money it is my own
And I'll never spend your fortune, for I hear that you got none
You thought you had my poor heart won, by meeting with me now
But I'll leave you where I found you: At the foot of the sweet brown knowe""",Maid of the Sweet Brown Knowe,1993
The Dubliners,"When I was eighteen years of age
Into the army I did engage
I left my home with a good intent
For to join the forty-second regiment

While I was posted on guard one day
Some soldiers' children came out to play
From the officers' quarters my captain came
And he ordered me for to take their names

I took one name instead of three
On neglect of duty they then charged me
I was confined to barracks with loss of pay
For doing my duty the opposite way

A loaded rifle I did prepare
For to shoot my captain in the barracks square
It was my captain I meant to kill
But I shot my colonel against my will

At Liverpool Assizes my trial I stood
And I held my courage as best I could
Then the old judge said, Now, McCafferty
Go prepare your soul for eternity

I had no father to take my part
No loving mother to break her heart
I had one friend and a girl was she
Who'd lay down her life for McCafferty

So come all you officers take advice from me
And go treat your men with some decency
For it's only lies and a tyranny
That have made a murderer of McCafferty",McCafferty,1993

She drew under a green bush the shower for to shun
With her white apron wrapped around her he took her for a swan
Took aim and alas it was his own Molly Bawn

Oh young Jimmy ran homeward with his gun and his dog
Sayin' uncle, oh uncle, I have shot Molly Bawn
I have killed that fair female, the joy of my life
For I'd always intended that she would be my wife

Oh young Jimmy Ranlon, do not run away
Stay in your own country till your trial it comes on
For you'll never be convicted of the shootin' of a swan

Well the night before Molly's funeral her ghost it did appear
Saying uncle, dearest uncle, let young Jimmy run clear
It being late of an evening when he took me for a swan
Took aim and alas he killed his own Molly Bawn

Well I hugged her and I kissed her the whole night long, 
Till she wished the short night had been seven years long. 

Well early next morning the sailor lad arose 
And into Mary`s apron threw a handful of gold 
Saying ”Take this me dear for the mischief that I`ve done 
For tonight I fear I`ve left you with a daughter or a son.” 

”Well if it be a girl child, send her out to nurse, 
with gold in her pocket and with silver in her purse, 
and if it be a boy child he`ll wear the jacket blue 
and go climbing up the rigging like his daddy used to do” 

Oh come all of you fair maidens, a warning take by me, 
Never let a sailor lad an inch above your knee, 
For I trusted one and he beguiled me, 
He left me with a pair of twins to dangle on me knee

He took her up to Monto, langeroo! To you

Well if you've got a wingo, take her up to Ringo
Where the waxies sing-o all the day.

Just give your men the order, ""Back to the quay""

The Dubliners,"On Raglan Road of an autumn day
I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I might one day rue

I saw the danger and I passed
Along the enchanted way
And I said, let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day

On Grafton Street in November
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worth of passions pledged

The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
And I not making hay
Oh, I loved too much and by such, by such
Is happiness thrown away

I gave her gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to the artists who have known
The true gods of sound and stone

And her words and tint without stint
I gave her poems to say
With her own name there and her own dark hair
Like clouds over fields of May

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly
My reason must allow

That I had loved not as I should
A creature made of clay
When the angel woos the clay
He'll lose his wings at dawn of day",Raglan Road,1997
The Dubliners,"As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying ""Stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

The Dubliners,"Well, you've heard about the Indians with their tommy hawks and spears
And of the U.N. Warriors, the heroes of recent years
Also I might mention the British Grenadiers
Well, none of them were in it but the Dublin Fusiliers

You've heard about the Light Brigade and of the deeds they've done
And of the other regiments that many victories won
But the pride of all the armies, dragoons and Carabiniers
Was that noble band of warriors, the Dublin Fusiliers

[Incomprehensible] face, this is the way we go
Charging with fixed bayonets, the terror of every foe
A glory to old Ireland, as proud as Buccaneers
And a terror to creation are the Dublin Fusiliers

Well, you've heard about the wars between the Russians and the Brits
The Tsar one day was reading an old copy of ""Tidbits""
And when the General came to him and threw himself down in tears
""We'd better run back like blazes, here's the Dublin Fusiliers""

The Tsar commenced to tremble and he bit his under lip
""Begorra boys"" says he, ""I think we'd better take the tip""
The devils come from Dublin and to judge from what I hears
They're demons of militia men, the Dublin Fusiliers

[Incomprehensible] face this is the way we go
Charging with fixed bayonets, the terror of every foe
A glory to old Ireland, as proud as Buccaneers
And a terror to creation are the Dublin Fusiliers

Well, the sergeant cried, ""Get ready lads, lay down each sword and gun
Take off your shoes and stockings boys and when I tell yous, run""
They didn't stop but started and amidst three ringing cheers
Came a shower of bricks and bullets from the Dublin Fusiliers

The time that Julius Caesar tried to land down at Ringsend
The coastguards couldn't stop them, so for the Dublin's they did send
And just as they were landing, lads, we heard three ringing cheers
""Get back to Rome like blazes, here's the Dublin Fusiliers""

The Dubliners,"Good evening, all my jolly lads, I'm glad to find you well
If you'll gather all around me, now, the story I will tell
For I've got a situation and begorrah and begob
I can whisper all the weekly wage of nineteen bob

'Tis twelve months come October since I left me native home
After helping them Killarney boys to bring the harvest down
But now I wear the gansey and around me waist a belt
I'm the gaffer of the squad that makes the hot asphalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt

The other night a copper comes and he says to me, McGuire
Would you kindly let me light me pipe down at your boiler fire?
And he planks himself right down in front, with hobnails up, till late
And says I, me decent man, you'd better go and find your bait

He ups and yells, I'm down on you, I'm up to all yer pranks
Don't I know you for a traitor from the Tipperary ranks?
Boys, I hit straight from the shoulder and I gave him such a belt
That I knocked him into the boiler full of hot asphalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
 
We quickly dragged him out again and we threw him in the tub
And with soap and warm water we began to rub and scrub
But devil the thing, it hardened and it turned him hard as stone
And with every other rub, sure you could hear the copper groan

I'm thinking, says O'Reilly, that he's lookin' like old Nick
And burn me if I am not inclined to claim him with me pick
Now, says I, it would be easier to boil him till he melts
And to stir him nice and easy in the hot asphalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt

You may talk about yer sailor lads, ballad singers and the rest
Your shoemakers and your tailors but we please the ladies best
The only ones who know the way their flinty hearts to melt
Are the lads around the boiler making hot asphalt

With rubbing and with scrubbing, sure I caught me death of cold
For scientific purposes, me body it was sold
In the Kelvin grove museum, me boys, I'm hangin' in me pelt
As a monument to the Irish, making hot asphalt

The Dubliners,"Eighteen sixty nine being the date anf the year,
Those Waterloo sportsmen and more did appear,
For to gain the great prizes and bear them awa',
Never counting on Ireland and Master McGrath.

On the twelfth of November, that day of renown,
McGrath and his keeper they left Lurgan town,
A gale in the Channel, it soon drove them o'er,
On the thirteenth they landed on England's fair shore.

Oh well when they arrived there in big London Town,
Those great English sportsmen all gathered around,
And one of those gentlemen standing nearby
said, 'Is that the great dog you call Master McGrath?'

Oh well one of the gentlemen standing around,
Says, 'I don't care a damn for your Irish greyhound!'
And another he sneered with a scornful 'Ha! Ha!
We'll soon humble the pride of your Master McGrath.'

Then Lord Lurgan came forward and said, 'Gentlemen,
If there's any amongst you has money to spend.
For your grand English nobles I don't care a straw,
Here's five thousand to one upon Master McGrath.'

Oh, McGrath he looked up and he wagged his old tail.
Informing his lordship, 'Sure I know what you mean,
Don't fear, noble Brownlow, don't fear them agra,
We'll soon tarnish their laurels', says Master McGrath.

Oh well Rose stood uncovered, the great English pride,
Her master and keeper were close by her side;
They let them away and the crowd cried, 'Hurrah!'
For the pride of all England and Master McGrath.

Oh well Rose and the Master they both ran along.
'I wonder', says Rose, 'what took you from your home.
You should have stayed there in your Irish domain,
And not come to gain laurels on Albion's plain.'

'Well, I know', says the Master, 'we have wild heather
bogs
but, bedad, in old Ireland there's good men and dogs.
Lead on, bold Britannia, give none of your jaw,
Stuff that up your nostrils', says Master McGrath.

He jumped on her back and held up his ould paw -

Left, the girls of Tuam were nearly broken-hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn and leave where I was born
Cut a stout, black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins
A brand-new pair of brogues to rattle over the bogs
And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road

Started by daylight next morning blithe and early
Took a drop of pure to keep me heart from shrinking

To hear the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a-bubblin'

Down among the pigs, did some hearty rigs
I played some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling

Oh love is pleasin' and love is teasin'
And love is a pleasure when first it's new
But as it grows older sure the love grows colder
And it fades away like the morning dew 

And love and porter makes a young man older
And love and whiskey makes him old and grey
And what can't be cured love has to be endured love
And now I am bound for America

",Love Is Pleasing,1998
The Dubliners,"As I went a walking one morning in May
I met a young couple so far did we stray
And one was a young maid so sweet and so fair
And the other was a soldier and a brave grenadier

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

Out of his knapsack he took a fine fiddle
He played her such merry tunes that you ever did hear
He played her such merry tunes that the valley did ring
And softly cried the fair maid as the nightingale sings

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

Oh, I'm off to India for seven long years
Drinking wines and strong whiskies instead of strong beer
And if ever I return again 'twill be in the spring
And we'll both sit down together love to hear the nightingale sing

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

""Well then"", says the fair maid, ""Will you marry me?""
""Oh no"", says the soldier, ""however can that be?""
For I've my own wife at home in my own country
And she is the finest little maid that you ever did see

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

The Dubliners,"Let grasses grow and waters flow in a free and easy way
But give me enough of the rare old stuff that's brewed near Galway Bay
Come policemen all from Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim too
Oh, we'll give them the slip and we'll take a sip
Of the rare old Mountain Dew

Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh

At the foot of the hill there's a neat little still
Where the smoke curls up to the sky
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell
That there's poitin' brewin' nearby

For it fills the air with a perfume rare
And betwixt both me and you
As home we stroll, we can take a bowl
Or a bucket of the Mountain Dew

Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh
Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh

Now learned men who use the pen
Have sung the praises high
Of the rare poitin' from Ireland green
Distilled from wheat and rye

Put away with your pills, it'll cure all ills
Be ye Pagan, Christian or Jew
So take off your coat and grease your throat
With the dear old Mountain Dew

At the hour of twelve at night
Who should I spy but a Spanish lady
Washing her feet by the candlelight

First she washed them, then she dried them
Over a fire of amber coals
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so sweet about the soul

Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye

As I came back through Dublin City
At the hour of half past eight
Who should I spy but the Spanish lady
Brushing her hair in the broad daylight

First she brushed it, then she tossed it
On her lap was a silver comb
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so fair since I did roam

Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye

As I returned to Dublin City
As the sun began to set
Who should I spy but a Spanish lady
Catching a moth, in a golden net

First she saw me, then she fled me
Lifted her petticoats o'er her knee
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so fair as the Spanish lady

Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye

I've wandered north and I have wonder south
Through Stoney Barter and Patrick's close
Up and around, by the Gloucester Diamond
And back by Napper Tandys' house

Cold as a fire of ashy coals
But there is the love of me Spanish lady

The Dubliners,"As down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by
No fife did hum, no battle drum
Did sound its dred tattoo
But the Angelus bells o'er the Liffey's swell
Rang out through the foggy dew

Right proudly high over Dublin town
They hung out the flag of war
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with theirlong-range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew

'Twas Brittania bade our wild geese go
That small nations might be free
But their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves
On the shore of the gray North Sea
But had they died by Pearse's side
Or fought with Cathal Brugha
Their names we would keep where the Fenians sleep
'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew

But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide
In the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze
At those fearless men, but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew",The Foggy Dew [Live],1998
The Dubliners,"I remember the night that he came in from the wintery
Cold and damp
A giant of a man in an oilskin coat, and a bundle that
Told he was a tramp
He stood at the bar and he called a pint, then turned
And gazed at the fire
On a night like this, to be save and dry is my one and
Only desire

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

Then in a voice that was hushed and low he said
""Listen, I'll tell you a tale""
How a man of the sea became a man of the road and never
More will set sail
I fished out of Howth and Killybegs, Ardglass and
Baltimore
But the cruel sea has beat'n me and I'll end my days on
The shore

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

One fateful night in the wind and the rain we set sail
From Killybegs town
There were five of us from sweet Donegal and one from
County Down
We were fishermen who worked the sea and never counted
The cost
But I never thought 'ere that night was done, that my
Fine friends would all be lost

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

Then the storm it broke and drove the boat, to the
Rocks about ten miles from shore
As we fought the tide, we hoped inside to see our homes
Once more
Then we struck a rock and holed the bow and all of us
Knew that she'd go down
So we jumped right into the icy sea and prayed to God
We wouldn't drown

But the ragin' sea was risin' still as we struck out
For the land
And she fought with all her cruelty to claim that
Gallant band
By Saint John's point in the early dawn I dragged
Myself on the shore
And I cursed the sea for what she'd done and vowed to
Sail her never more

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

Ever since that night I've been on the road, travelin'
And tryin' to forget
That awful night I lost all my friends, I see their
Faces yet
And often at night when the sea is high and the rain is
Tearing at my skin
I hear the cries of drowning men, floating over on the
Wind

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear

There was Hogan from County Tyrone

We had two million buckets of stones
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides
We had four million packets of bones

And seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million bags of the best Sligo rags
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost her way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced unto two

When twenty long weeks they were over and were past
Her mommy chanced to notice how she thickened round the
Waist
It was the handsome ploughboy, the maiden she did say
For he caused for to tumble all in the new-mown hay

Breast
And like the jolly ploughboy she whistles and she sings

Here's a health to y'all ploughboys wherever you may be
That likes to have a bonnie lass a sitting on his knee
With a jug of good strong porter you'll whistle and
You'll sing
For a ploughboy is as happy as a prince or a king

The Dubliners,"It's lonesome away from your kindered and all
By the campfire at night where the wild Dingos call
But there's nothin' so lonesome, so dull or so drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

Now the Publican's anxious for the quota to come
There's a faraway look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
What a terrible place is a pub with no beer

The stock man rides up with his dry, dusty throat
He breasts up till the bar, pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
When the barman says suddenly, ""The pub's got no beer""

There's a dog on the verandah, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog round a pub with no beer

Old Billy, the blacksmith, the first time in his life
Has gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen, she says, ""You're early, me dear""
Then he breaks down and he tells her that the pub's got no beer

It's lonesome away from your kindered and all
By the campfire at night where the wild Dingos call
But there's nothin' so lonesome, so dull or so drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

The Dubliners,"In a neat little town they called Belfast 
Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many an hour's sweet happiness
Have I spent in that neat little town

As sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from me friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

Meaning not long for to stay

And her hair, it hung over her shoulder

And a gentleman passing us by
Well, I knew she meant the doing of him
By the look in her roguish black eye

A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand

Oh, as I went home on Monday night
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw a horse outside the door
Where my old horse should be
Well, I called me wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me

The Dubliners,"I am a freeborn man of the traveling people
Got no fixed abode, with nomads I am numbered
Country lanes and byways were always my ways
Never fancied being lumbered

O we knew the woods, all the resting places
And the small birds sang when wintertime was over
Then we'd pack our load and be on the road
They were good old times for the rover

There was open ground where a man could linger
Stay a week or two for time was not your master
Then away you'd jog with your horse and dog
Nice and easy, no need to go faster

Now and then you'd meet up with other travelers
Hear the news or else swap family information
At the country fairs, we'd be meeting there
All the people of the traveling nation

All you freeborn men of the traveling people
Every tinker, rolling stone, or gypsy rover
Winds of change are blowing, old ways are going
Your traveling days will soon be over",I'm a Free Born Man,2002
The Dubliners,"In the County Tyrone, near the town of Dungannon,
Where many the ructions meself had a hand in.
Bob Williamson lived, a weaver by trade,
And all of us thought him a stout Orange blade,
On the Twelfth of July as it yearly did come,
Bob played with his flute to the sound of a drum.
You may talk of your harp, your piano or lute,
But none can compare with the Old Orange Flute.

Bob, the deceiver, he took us all in;
He married a Papist named Bridget McGinn.
Turned Papist himself and forsook the old cause
That gave us our freedom, religion and laws.
Now, boys of the townland made some noise upon it,
And Bob had to fly to the province of Connaught.
He fled with his wife and his fixings to boot,
And along with the latter his Old Orange Flute.

At the chapel on Sunday to atone for past deeds,
He'd say Pater and Aves and counted his brown beads.
'Til after some time, at the priest's own desire
He went with that old flute to play in the choir.
He went with that old flute for to play for the Mass,
But the instrument shivered and sighed, oh, alas,
And try though he would, though it made a great noise,
The flute would play only ""The Protestant Boys.""

Bob jumped and he stared and got in a flutter
And threw the old flute in the blessed holy water.
He thought that this charm would bring some other
Sound;
When he tried it again, it played ""Croppies Lie Down.""
Now, for all he could whistle and finger and blow,
To play Papish music he found it no go.
""Kick the Pope"" and ""The Boyne Water"" it freely would
Sound,
But one Papish squeak in it couldn't be found.

At the council of priests that was held the next day
They decided to banish the old flute away.
They couldn't knock heresy out of it's head,
So they bought Bob a new one to play in it's stead.
'Twas fastened and burned at the stake as a heretic.
As the flames soared around it, they heard a strange
Noise;
'Twas the old flute still whistling ""The Protestant
Boys.""
""Toora lu, toora lay,
Oh, it's six miles from Bangor to Donnahadee.""",The Ould Orange Flute,2002
The Dubliners,"I've been a wild rover for many's the year

And I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more

And take up your stations for hauling the nets
And mind up all together lads all through the night
And shaking your oilskins until it's daylight
With a heave and a haul and the shaking of nets

It's when we're at hauling we're living on hope
The boy in the locker the lads on the ropes
The fellows in the hold to our hauling the nets
And shaking the herring out on to the deck
With a heave and a haul and the shaking of nets

It's net after net we pull up from the sea
With a haul and a shake and a one, two and three
The herring are a piling around our sea boots
And slithering and sliding down into the shoots
With a heave and a haul and the shaking of nets

It's hour after hour we are hauling away
All through the long night till the dawn of the day
The captain's in the wheelhouse he's on the RT
And the cook's in the galley a brewing the tea
And we're heaving and hauling and shaking of nets

Now the season is over so be on your way
And head for the home port to sign for your pay
Your missus will be waiting to welcome you home
It's so hard for a wife to be so much alone
And you're finished with heaving and hauling of nets

The Dubliners,"I wish I was in Carrickfergus
Only for nights in Ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
Only for nights in Ballygrand
But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
And neither have I the wings to fly
I wish I had a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over my love and I

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times there spent so long ago
My boyhood friends and my own relations
Have all past on now with the melting snow
So I'll spend my days in this endless roving
Soft is the grass and shore, my bed is free
Oh to be home now in carrickfergus

On marble stone there as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her
But I'll sing no more now til I get a drink
Cause I'm drunk today and I'm seldom sober

The Dubliners,"While in the merry month of May, now from me home I started
Left, the girls of Tuam were nearly broken-hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn and leave where I was born
Cut a stout, black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins
A brand-new pair of brogues to rattle over the bogs
And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

A-one, two, three, four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack, follol de-dah

Started by daylight next morning blithe and early
Took a drop of pure to keep me heart from shrinking
Thats the Paddy's cure when'er he's on for drinking
To hear the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a-bubblin'

Was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin

To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city

Down among the pigs, did some hearty rigs
I played some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling

Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin

Galway boys were by and saw I was a hobblin'
With a ""lo!"" and ""hurray !"" they joined in the affray

The Dubliners,"On the Fourth of July, 1806
We set sail from the sweet Cove of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the Grand City Hall in New York
'Twas a wonderful craft
She was rigged fore and aft
And oh, how the wild wind drove her
She stood several blasts
She had twenty seven masts
And they called her The Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrels of stones
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides'
We had four million barrels of bones
We had five million hogs
six million dogs
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million sides of old nanny goate tails
In the hold of the Irish Rover

There was awl Mickey Coote
Who played hard on his flute
And the ladies lined up for a set
He would tootle with skill
For each sparkling quadrille
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
With his smart witty talk
He was cock of the walk
As he rolled the dames under and over
They all knew at a glance
When he took up his stance
That he sailed in The Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee
From the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk
Who was scared stiff of work
And a man from Westmeath called Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole
Who was drunk as a rule
And Fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man, Mick McCann
From the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover

For a sailor its' always a bother in life
It's so lonesome by night and by day
That he longs for the shore
and a charming young whore
Who will melt all his troubles away
Oh, the noise and the rout
Swillin' poiteen and stout
For him soon the torment's over
Of the love of a maid he is never afraid
An old salt from the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years
When the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in the fog
And that whale of a crew
Was reduced down to two
Just myself and the Captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock
Oh Lord! what a shock
The bulkhead was turned right over
Turned nine times around
And the poor old dog was drowned (1, 2, 3!)

Down in the heart of the Cumberland Mine
There's blood on the coal and miners lie
In the roads that never saw sun or sky
Roads that never saw sun or sky

Down at the coal face the miner's working
Rattle of the belt and the cutter's blade
Crumble of rock and the walls close round
Living and the dead men, two miles down
Living and the dead men, two miles down

Twelve men lay two miles from the pitshaft
Listen for the drilling of a rescue team
Six hundred feet of coal and slag
Hope imprisoned in a three-foot seam
Hope imprisoned in a three-foot seam

Eight days passed and some were rescued
Leaving the dead to lie alone
All their lives they dug their graves
Two miles of earth for a marking stone
Two miles of earth for a marking stone

In the town of Spring Hill you don't sleep easy
Often the Earth will tremble and groan
When the Earth is restless, miners die

The Duhks,"It was past her bedtime
On a stormy night
And she couldn't shut her eyes
And she couldn't blow out the light
So she gave up struggling
And let the candle burn
The hail knocked her window
As her memories knocked in turn
And her room had four blue walls
They've been hers since she was small
No sleep in sight

Oh her father
Is the only one
Who pretends he can't remember
What was done
And her mother
Can't find the strength
To do anything at all but stand and pray

In a room with four blue walls
That were closing in together
'Til they got so goddamn small
That she had to brave the weather
By herself

So she went to the barroom
And she picked a fight
He told her she was looking for trouble
And she said ""that's right""
She was looking for an eardrum
So she beat him and she shoved
'Til he couldn't quite resist her when she dragged him home for love

To a room with four blue walls
On a floor that's worn like leather
And the shadows fell across them
As she held their eyes together
And they cried

Would you be my ocean
Won't you be the rain
Can a kiss from you rinse another from my brain
Can we wash these floorboards
Can we wash these walls
Can I close my eyes and sleep once and for all

In a room with four blue walls
Filled from floor to roof with water
And a man who calmly calls her ""darling dear""
Not ""darling daughter""
She sleeps at last
She sleeps at last

And her room had four blue walls",Four Blue Walls,2005

Struck a glancing blow
Frames form in his mind
Words form in his mouth
Call into this night

At each new corner
I grow more weary
At each new corner
I see more people
I see more people
Lay in this doorway
In the orange street glare

Their names mean nothing now
I see them turn and stare
I watch them slip away
Their names mean nothing
Their names mean nothing
Their names mean nothing now

This man on the ground
The dirt on his clothes
And the blood on his face
He has his own blood
And the light in his eyes

Their names mean nothing now
Their names mean nothing

What do I see
The old grinder selling
Sawdust balls with a moth-eaten parrot
And he plays
Watch the children play on Paradise Passage Road
I see the best things aren't free
Despite everything
This old grinder still in love
With a shiny-scaled mermaid
Quick-tailed
Some... Some place between him and a myth
And he plays
What is forever
Are there things we can change
And the parrot
He says
I... I believe in the sun and the sky
Words that just don't seem to tell me why

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for

And it sounds so fresh it'll make you stand
You hear the highs in your eyes, the bass in your face
This super DJ can rock the place
You hear bass, highs, tremblin' tones
He can even cut the jams without the headphones

Let me hear you say 'DJ' (DJ)

You better take my advice
Because it lasts this long
Is rocking the house
One job well done
For any DJ in this world to be someone
To make a fella say ""ho"" the girls get loose
And if the crowd respond to that, the jock got juiced
Enough pull to make some cash
'Cause it's all about duds
And they can jam-pack the place
No matter how much you spend
So if you wanna make some cash or be a DJ
You must rock the house right and know what to play

Let's all get together, repeat after me
Say, 'oh' (oh)
Say, 'oh, ho' (oh, ho)
Once again I like it (I like it)
Come on I love it (I love it)
One more time I like it (I like it)
Come on I love it (I love it) ha!

Say, 'break dance' (break dance)
Say, 'break dance' (break  dance)
Come on

Unplug the cord, debug the store
We love the lord, but keep getting drug into war
What's the gun for? If all we're doing is talking
What are you doing marching when all of these humans starving?
The diamond's like, shine a light, they got it right
Or, we can set it off like dynamite
The balance is found, Los Angeles bound
In a van full of cannabis pounds

Searching gold in the midnight cold

Keeping each other warm in the rising storm

Where's the gold
That we'll share
As we share the road?

Tree trunks had fallen down on our way
Rocks of the ice age that would not stir
We lifted all that troubled our haste
One spell, one voice for one single aim

Searching gold, will we find it?

All dried out in the sun

Who will ever force me out
With a polar bear up there
How am I gonna travel light?

Like a lion in a cage, starving wild
And I've ran out of meat
Something in my head
Something crawling like a snake
In my bed, made me rip off my sheets

Well, it's an awkward situation
Trying to fight the jungle alone
But I gotta make my way through
If I wanna travel light

Lately I've been walking away
Floating like a song in the air
Lately I've been trailing away
I've been walking my way

I was standing on the edge
Of a mountain of clay
And I got tired of wading through the mud
So I jumped to hit the ground
It was firm yet it was hard
And I stood proudly up with my pain

Now, I don't care about the scratches
No one followed me this far
Oh, broken bones but empty head
I made it on my own, this far

Are they going to save me, arrest or save me

That I know I will not deserve when

Out of reach no pun can hold when 
Out of joy that's when we break a goal

Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

It read, one of us is dead
And old man looked me in the eyes
And smiled

Maybe I'm the one who's already gone
Cold in the ground or fast asleep

Some days I don't know if I've grown too cold
Grown too old and left without saying goodbye
Goodbye

Maybe I'm the one who's already gone

Maybe I didn't see I was buried today
Wasting away and sleeping all alone
Maybe I'm not a man who sees so well
Knows when his heart began to fail

I saw one of us was dead

Just like before

If I just think about it, I'm always wasting time
Applying cream to this.
It never stops the itching, the burning cracking skin
And I have had enough of it

We are the most challenged of friends
Taking what we need to live
But I will fall with one more pull or pluck of this

Pray for the time, I've got my mind, set, pay for the seats
I've got to see the way we pull through

We are the most shallow of friends
Taking what we want to live
But I will fall with one more pull or pluck of this

Anybody got a second chance for a man giving up on it

Back at the ocean to meet with dirt where we will wait and find ourselves.

I think this is love
And the question will be my next move.
Think it's a good one,
Probably better than my last few.

But if all goes to my plan,
I'll prove everyone wrong.

For once...

I might as well live it

Just happy to be living

I'm really not like that

And now my stomach hurts, as long as I'm in love it's so hard to leave
I feel a bad pain moving through my chest and my knees start to shake

One thing missing every time I leave and drive
One thing missing every time I'm far from home
There's one thing missing every time I leave for months
One thing missing every time I lose control
There's one thing missing every time that I stay home

I've got some deep scars from a little black heart that only make me stronger
And now I don't sleep, seeing any relief that gives me some perspective

But again, it's not the first time thought I was losing what was mine.
I won't wait for a reason,
I'm taking over and back what is mine.
I won't wait forever.

",Scared to Lose,2006
The Early November,"


We're in love, sweet love.
We're in love, sweet love.

We built our life from nothing.
We don't have much, no more money
But we've got love.
We can only grow much better
I'm so glad we're here together, and on our own, in love.

And in just a few more years
I'll prove everyone wrong.

You've only two hours, 'fore everything is lost
And swallowed by light

You've got the cure
But the virus by your side
You wait 'til it's right
Then you strike
And you bring out all you've got

Maybe someday you'll find a way
To balance pressure
But you're slow
And you're jealous like a child

Breaking up things that found a way
To dream forever
Get your gun
'Cause the flock is flying in

You're dress is nice
Casual, but then strangely elegant
You're eyes are wide
You got them once
Got them twice
Now three's the charm

And you're jealous like a child

I'm watching you now
You're right in my sight
Supposed to take you out
And end this tonight

It's harder to fire

My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game
To hell with those lords o'er the sea

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

I played in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn
I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

There's my lover

Those are the lips that kiss me
Those are the arms that hold me
Those loving hands caress me

What was in your mind
To turn and leave it all behind?
The One True Love
Was it not enough?
So now, tell me what did you find?

Did pain embrace you with open arms
While hurt was scratching at all your scars
And love, so close yet seemed so far...

Love's not far, far behind
It's never too late to change your mind
When you fall and start to cry
There's always a second time
There's always a second time

Now that you're away
What do you feel inside?
A never-ending playground ride?
Now you've fallen off
Some kind of twisted fate
So now, why do you hesitate?

You look and wish on a falling star
Does it remind you of who you are?
He wants to heal up your broken heart...

Love's not far, far behind
It's never too late to change your mind
When you fall and start to cry
There's always a second time

There's always a second time
There's always a second time
Keep in mind, the second time

There's always a second time
There's always a second time

You look and wish on a falling star
Does it remind you of who you are?

Your reason to stay
Condemned by the words you say
An extended nail-pierced hand
Can find your place to

Is your conviction losing sight?

And now you're...

Waiting for the end of the shame
Waiting for the end of the blame
Waiting for the end of the pain
Waiting for the end of the day

When you look so young, but you feel so old
And your heart is growing cold
Take a piece of hope and let your heart take hold
And watch his peace unfold
Your sense of guilt and fear
Your fear of guilt and loss
Was all it ever cost
With no more role that you will play
You can step out of the way
That left you...

Are the clanging chimes of doom

A lonely picture of my heart...
Unexpressed.
And all this sentiment
That I've chose to keep at bay
Has left a debt that I can't pay

The feelings on my mind
I save them for another time
Tomorrow - it never comes
And I still feel the sorrow

Now all that's left are memories
Promises and guarantees of tomorrow
I never thought
That this would be the last time
That we'd say
Goodbye

The little things that I remember
Seem to fade away like shifting sand
If only...
I could touch your hand
And try to turn back time
And all the things I'd say instead
But words unsaid are left for dead

The Edge,"I went out walking
Through streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking
Under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye

Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering

I went drifting
Through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it

I went out riding
Down that old eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name

I went with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you

I went out there
In search of experience
To taste and to touch
And to feel as much
As a man can
Before he repents

I went out searching
Looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking
With a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon
Yeah I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon

Yeah I left with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you

Yeah I left with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering

To find the right dress to wear

Heads turn around
Here she comes
To take her crown

Is there a time to run for cover
A time for kiss and tell
Is there a time for different colors

And you said rise above
But I can't
I can't

How long will it take
Before these feelings
Go away
How much longer do I wait
And are there any real answers
Anyway

Your silence in a crowded room
Louder than the loudest tune
I hang on every word

And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
But I can't
I can't

I miss you in everything
I was too fast traveling
To take you in
I know, silence is no crime
Just wish I could hear you fill it up

One more time

Yes, I know what you'd say to me
Exactly what you said to me
I Still hang on every word

And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above

In a time of treason
Is there time for trust
Where there's no them
Only us
Is there time for reason?
Has your heart had enough
Is it time to let go
And rise above?

She was walking down the street so I said ""Hello
I'm Kangol from UTFO."" And she said ""So?""
And I said ""So?!? Baby don't you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
Cause I'm Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I'm concerned ain't nobody greater
From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn't be upset
Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo.""
I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body.""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""

The Edwin Hawkins Singers,"Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see

Take a good look around and if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide

Walk around, be free and roam
There's always someone leaving alone
Pleasure at the fairground on the way

And I love the thought of coming home to you
Even if I know we can't make it
I love the thought of giving hope to you
Just a little ray of light shining through

Love can bend and breathe alone
Until the end it finds you a home
Don't care what the people may say

Life begins when you get your gal all alone.
From morning until twilight
I don't know I'm alive
But I know love begins at 8:45.

The stars are gonna twinkle and shine,
How they'll shine!
This evening about a quarter to nine.
My loving arms are going to tenderly twine
Around you around a quarter to nine.

I know I won't be late
Cause at half past eight,
I'm going to hurry there.
I, I'll be waiting where the lane begins
Waiting for you on needles and pins.
And then the world is going to be mine
Mine all mine!

About the things that I've planned

People will lend a hand
They better watch it or else they'll start sinking
With their heads in the sand

I've got a way, way of my own
Come back, when you've time for the world
You must think they'd don't need anyone, no no

And I?ll love you for the next five minutes

I'm your magazine, ?'cause you read me clean
Without taking any time for pictures
I'm your hand grenade and your lemonade
?'cause I?ll blow up and leave you soured

Find somebody with a working car
And drive them crazy, too
The big surprise is me

I worked extra hard to pick your birthday card
You just threw it out and kept my money
I got up at six to make your favorite dish
So I sank when you said, you weren't hungry

Filed your tax return, let some candles burn
Played Mozart, to make your plants grow
Then I clipped the trees, got down on my knees
Not to work, just to pray, you'd see me

Find somebody who will paint your house
And gloss them over, too

The tragedies and enemies, the debts you'll never pay
Understand it's in your hand to turn the other way
Make tomorrow the first day

All wonderful but none as grand as the man who chooses life
And we compete in word and deed
You think we'd learn by now that's not what people need
But that's our style

So raise the glass and look right past the time you've thrown away
The tragedies and enemies, the debts you'll never pay
Now understand it's in your hand to turn the other way
And make tomorrow the first day

Done too much of both types of whining
Still wasn't right fight after fight
To get out of my life get away from me get away from that gun

No it's not a joke it's cards on the table time
I could have phoned I could have spoke
But how to break the news without beaking your heart

Being dead don't hurt,
No only dying
Cards on the table time,
Sometimes it's right to say goodnight

Always searching for paradise,
I'll admit that I'm good as blind
Darling I confess yes I've ruined three lives
And didn't care till I found out that one of them was mine

I confess
Our love seems like a punishment
And I confess,
If it's all the same to you I'll stay indifferent

I confess I confess I confess
I confess I confess I confess

No-one wins and there's no denying,
Don't pretend like you don't know why,
Just a little word here a little push there darling
I confess look I confess that I don't really care

I confess I confess I confess
Out like a light
Another boy who's given up trying
Blinded by fright

He scream my life's not open
Please get out,
I know I'm shouting,
I like to shout

It's not a joke it's cards on the table time

It's only to camouflage my sadness
And honey to shield my pride I try
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

[VERSE:]
She's got everything she needs and it isn't you 
A cosmetic arsenal a bucket of glue 
Signs on her back that say Keep on the grass 
Powerful liquor in a hip flask 
Coins from the commonwealth Doubloons from the sea 
A knife in her boot heel A Bonsai tree 
Ice cream in her pocket Diamonds from her fence 
It all works like clockwork It all makes sense
 
[CHORUS:]
To a force of nature, force of nature, force of nature
That's what she is
 
With her clouded leopard on a leash in the shed 
A vicious black rodent she calls Fred 
She keeps her diary under the bed 
but there's nothin' in it 'cause it's all in her head 
Walkin' round London with foreign banknotes 
throwin' silver nunchucks at cab drivers throats 
Being invisible Being obscene 
Being the person you wish you'd been

Saw you were naked and called it a sin

Smelt something burning and they were sure
It must be the flag you were burning that's what they swore

What they don't tell you is that he's typical
What he stands for is totally mythical
And as they lead him away he'll pray for you brother
With a bible in one hand and playboy in the other
Imagine what he does to his mother

To millions of jerks who will live by the knife

Watched the hammer as it hit the ground

We're not ska-core, reggae, jazz, we're not hip hop or rock or pop, you know we won't stop groovin', it's like a thing called Jive!, you mix it up and keep the people satisfied no need to classify or nullify the claims that say we're insane, so to pacify those of you who need a label call it what you want I know you'll kick it if you're able.
We call it Jive!
Don't get me wrong, I don't think that we're special just 'cause our sound is not that commercial, or maybe it is, maybe that's not for me to say, but I've seen less honest music everyday, just like our soundless souls that are sold on the radio melodramatic lyrics made up like Fabio, they hide reality in a well made allusion to a world where the real is illusion.

Back then is when we used to swang, rankin, and skankin was the thang until the music scene back home sold out, that's when me and my crew decided to show them what it's all about for the old skool we were late, we put down the skates, started grabbin' guitars horns drums and the bass kickin it live inside the garage hittin' them with a lyrical barrage but it's like we're trippin' tips shit got drastically of a sudden , the need to play bombastically, we lost sight of what is real it took us this long to get back on the reel to reel.

If I could show you just what goes through my head...
Things change, that's how it is can you deal, with things that you know are real, I'm always movin, changin, and rearranging, I'm sick and tired of those who try containin me don't you see I'm in a state of flux don't you know, it's got nothin to do with luck, but if you want to know what's up with us, we're still a bunch of rude boys, causin a fuss while we're kickin it live!
If I could show you just what goes through my head...
There were a couple of girls who used to come to the shows back when we used to jam every Wednesday at the Zone they were skankin to the beat, I'm like ""Hey, I like your shirt"" to the one who was up in my shit I guess she was tryin to flirt she said ""yo, you're like the bosstones"" I said ""Hey, what's up with that?"" we've got our own thing going and we know it's where its at, now every time I see 'em they're talking about we're wannabe's, but they're the ones that are payin whether they're wack when they come or what, see.....we're kickin it live!

We met
And felt our love
First time
We held each other close
And all she said ""just hold me tight""
I held her in my arms once more
And wandered in the park with the dog
We laughed and cried
And talked how good it felt
And kissed for ever more
And how we only used to feel
And all the plans we made
And all that mattered was our love
Sealed with a ring
Engraved
As the yeards went slowly by

And all these things
Just changed somehow
I wander in the park alone
No smell of you
No fur at all
I hold you in my arms once more
A picture of a year before
I laugh and cry
And think how good it felt
When we kissed evermore
And now I only think of you
And all the love we had
And all that's left
Of me and you
It's just the ring

En hiver il y a du vent et du froid un sale temps et le soir 
Tous les gens sont en noir
Le visage triste c'est la crise et la brise joue l'artiste 
Et la neige comme des larmes dans le ciel nous attriste
Un personnage dans le noir y assiste 
Un bonhomme de neige qui pourtant n'est pas triste
Devant lui défile des silhouettes sombres des ombres qui en nombre
Dans leur manteau s'enfoncent
Malgré tout il a un sourire sur ses lèvres il célèbre l'hiver entouré par de jeunes élèves
C'est pour ça qu'il ne pleure pas c'est pour ça qu'il ne pleure pas

Je me demande pourquoi les bonhommes de neige ne pleurent qu'au printemps x 4


Au printemps tout le monde souffle les fenêtres s'ouvrent 
Et quand tout le monde dit ouf sous le soleil notre ami souffre
Plus les couleurs se déposent plus notre ami se décompose
Et plus les degrés montent et plus c'est dur de garder la pose
Ce qu'il ressent c'est que plus personne ne lui ressemble 
Il plaide l'innocence pendant que le soleil le descend
Son moral et tombé de ses échasses 
Il a perdu de son charme on a même pillé son écharpe
L'homme de neige n'a plus son sourire sur ses lèvres ça s'achève 
Plus de rêve délaissé par les jeunes élèves

Madame Météo

Couplet 1 ( Mr Ice)
Lundi il y a du soleil quand on lui dit t' es la plus belle
Au rythme des décibels je mets les autres à la poubelle

Mardi c' est nuageux elle n a pas eu son message
J' étais de Passage pas le temps de faire un massage

Le lendemain c'est la tempête quand on lui dit que j ai fait la fête
Elle va me faire ma fête elle croit que je me paie sa tête

Jeudi C' est l' accalmie l' ouragan se passe dans le lit
Il y a du gris le soleil revient quand elle sourit

REFRAIN 

Aujourd'hui il y a du vent mademoiselle prend les devants
elle bascule les rang invite monsieur au restaurant

Samedi C' est glacial encore un mensonge de son mâle
Et comme elle se sent sale elle pense à se faire la malle

Dimanche c' est jour de pluie elle n' arrête pas de parler de lui
au téléphone ses ami(e)s voudraient qu' elle l' oublie

Lundi il y a du soleil quand on lui dit t' es la plus belle
Au rythme des décibels je mets les autres à la poubelle

COUPLET 1 
Dans ma ville tu peux croiser quelques ptites folles
Qui picolent et qui se collent et picorent les peoples
Qui sortent et qui se cognent pour un kiss de leur idole
mais qui comme toi on un coeur mais elles l'isolent
dans ma ville plus personne ne sourit
c'est tout gris les touristes disent que c'est tout risque
Et pour rire on leur indique des chemins pourris
Et courir après le métro provoque des fou rire
Dans ma ville il y a un élan
ou les langues se mélangent les bancs sont témoins des ébats
Et des hauts et des bats et des lol et des barres
des débats dans des halls ou des bars

Dans ma ville jamais rien de s'éteint
C'est un festin sein et de fesses hein
des timp des pétrins je ne mange pas de ce pain
mais bon je suis un blédard alors parfois je déteins
Les parisiens se prennent tous pour les plus beaux
les plus haut on ne voit pas les autres depuis le hublot
les parisiennes se prennent pour les plus belles
et plus elles grandissent leur copains deviennent au pluriel
Dans ma ville on vit au rythme du métro
des mégos et des gos et trop souvent de l'égo
de texto pour aboutir sur du sexo
ma ville a pas mal de blem-pro
mais bon je l'aime trop

The Et's,"Je réalise que la vie n'est qu'une salle d'attente
Pleine d'épreuve qui te pousse à presser la détente
Je ne suis pas triste même quand mes yeux versent une pluie battante
Parce que je sais que de l'autre côté beaucoup de personne m'attendent 
Je réalise que l'amour n'est qu'une salle d'attente 
Des projets des disputes des moments de détente
Et on attend on attend que la haine se répande
Et plus on tire sur le fil et plus il se détend 
Je réalise que le succès n'est qu'une salle d'attente
Plus on avance plus on avance plus il y a de chose à apprendre 
Et plus on donne plus on donne plus les autres en attendent 
Plus tu monte sur du monde plus tu as besoin de défense 
Et j'ai peur que la mort ne soit qu'une salle d'attente
Pas de paradis pas d'enfer pas de vision marquante

Je vois des filles des coeurs qui vacillent des soleils qui chavirent des esprits qui naviguent (dans mes souvenirs d'été) x 2 
Dans mes souvenirs d'été


Couplet 


A la sortie d'un bar au milieu de nul part
Après un tour en caisse je finis par éteindre mes phares 
Elle s'appelait Laeticia ou quelque chose comme ça 
C'est ce que ses lèvres m’ont dit avec un gout de Tequila
Au détour d'une ruelle je suis tombé sur elle 
Après quelque mots au râteau elle préfère la pelle
Et devant son hôtel elle m'a laissé son tel
Et aujourd'hui encore elle attend que je la rappelle 

Couplet 


Quelque part sur la côte j'en ai trouvé une autre 
Et grâce a quelque potes on s'est retrouvés côte à côte 
Je ne me rappelle ni de son nom ni de sa jupe ni de ses bottes 
Et si je n'ai plus de nouvelles aujourd'hui je pense que c'est de ma faute 
A l'intérieur d'une boite quelque échanges de droite
Après une soirée arrosée on se retrouve en boite 
Elle s'appelait… hue … ça finissait par A 
C'est son accent qui me l'a dit en me lisant mes droits

J' ai perdu mes repères
Je viens d' une autre planète
Isolé dans l' univers

Bientôt à Cour de Carburant

Alors je lance un SOS

Allo il y a le téléphone qui sonne
et il sonne et il sonne et dans le vide raisonne
Je suis un homme je perds le Nord on dit que je suis hors norme
Depuis môme il n'y a pas de mot correctement me nomme
J'ai les deux pieds sur le sol mais les pensées qui s'envole
j'ai le passé qui me colle mais mes actes qui s'en veulent
qui s’engueulent et je me sens seul et je noircit la feuille
je le sentiment que c'est ma maison qui m'acceuille
Et j'appelle et j'appelle des souvenirs a la pelle
et j'ai de la peine oui de la peine car trop manque a l'appel
Je veux prendre une direction mais je ne sais pas laquelle
Je veux allé vers le succès mais j'ai peur de tomber de ma selle

Je veux rentrer chez moi mais j'ai perdu la raison

Look at everybody go, go-go-go
Somebody please tell me, what's all the rush
But tell you Babalu's getting married, what you say?
Babalu's getting married, that cheap skate
Hear the church bells ringing-ding dong
All the people are signing's, hay, hay
And the bride is waiting, wait wait
Hear them all celebrating, so gay
But he ain't the money, oh oh
Babalu's wedding day

Some people think it's funny
Some people think it's true, true, true, true
Babalu's getting married, what will he do?

He met his woman at a baseball game
Playing second base for the Milwaukee Braves
Husky Babalina was her name
Asked her for an autograph and made a date
Babalu, Babalu, Babalu's wedding day

He had a friend who lived at the corner
He thought Babalu was a gone-er
From his friend he tried to borrow a dime
So he could get to church in time
Babalu, Babalu, Babalu's wedding day

He had a monkey tied on a string
An organ grinder that he played
Counting the money at the end of the day
The monkey took the money and he ran away

You will not recognize my voice
I am the perfect law to end these wicked crimes
I am a man without a past

I face a world without a future
And I've done it all at least a million times
I'm the eyes that read between the lines
I devise the rumor and vicious lies

I do everything I can to hide the truth
But can you see it in my eyes?
I kill spies

As I walked into the room
I couldn't help but feel the tension
I can hear your thoughts, I can read your mind
I've been through this all before

By persistence, by intention
I just do my job and leave the past behind
Once there was a time when I believed
Anything could happen at any time

I've been waiting for this moment all my life
And now at last the pleasure's mine
I kill spies
