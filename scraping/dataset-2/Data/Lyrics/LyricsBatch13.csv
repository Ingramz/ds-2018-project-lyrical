Aimee Mann,"Come up to meet you 
Tell you I'm sorry 
You don't know how lovely you are 
I had to find you... 
Tell you I need you 
Tell you I set you apart 

Tell me your secrets 
And ask me your questions 
Oh let's go back to the start... 
Running in circles; coming in tails 
Heads on a silence apart 

Nobody said it was easy 
It's such a shame for us to part 
Nobody said it was easy 
No one ever said it would be this hard 
Oh take me back to the start 

I was just guessing at numbers and figures 
Pulling your puzzles apart 
Questions of science; science and progress 
Do not speak as loud as my heart 

Tell me you love me 
Come back and haunt me 
Oh and I rush to the start 
Running in circles, chasing our tails 
Coming back as we are 

Nobody said it was easy 
Oh it's such a shame for us to part 
Nobody said it was easy 
No one ever said it would be so hard 
I'm going back to the start 

Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Aimee Mann,"Say you were split, you were split in fragments
And none of the pieces would talk to you
Wouldn't you want to be who you had been
Well baby I want that too

So better take the keys and drive forever
Staying won't put these futures back together
All the perfect drugs and superheros
Wouldn't be enough to bring me up to zero

Baby, I bet you've been more than patience
Saying it's not a catastrophe
But I'm not the girl you once put your faith in
Just someone who looks like me

So better take the keys and drive forever
Staying won't put these futures back together
All the perfect drugs and superheros
Wouldn't be enough to bring me up to zero

So get out while you can
Get out while you can baby I'm pouring quick sand
And sinking is all I have planned
So better just go

Oh, better take the keys and drive forever
Staying won't put these futures back together
All the perfect drugs and superheros
Wouldn't be enough to bring me up to zero

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put baby together again
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put baby together again",Humpty Dumpty,2002
Aimee Mann,"Lost in space above all drifting
To a place where planets shifting
The moon erased, it's features lifting
The glare

But I am the stuff of happy endings
Though mostly bluff, belief suspending
But close enough for just pretending
To care

And I'm pretending to care
When I'm not even there
Gone but I don't know where

Well she's the faith and I'm the devil
Who keeps the pace and clears the rubble
And lost in space, fills up the bubble
With air

By just pretending to care
Like I'm not even there
Gone but I don't know where

It split like a cell
And man cannot tell
The lie from parallel

So baby beware
I'm just pretending to care
Like I'm not even there
Gone but I don't know where
Gone but I don't know where
Gone but I don't know where",Lost in Space,2002
Aimee Mann,"V1
I feel I’m buried on the inside
Do you feel anything at all?
Don’t say you’ll love me more than ever
To see what you might steal

V2
I feel I've nothing left to give
You never call me now at all
You brush it all under the table
To see how you might feel

Bridge
Are you out of my league?
Then get out of my head.
Let’s put this to bed forever more.

Chorus
Save me, Save me, Save me
I’m Dreaming
Alone inside with out you to guide me
Wake me, Wake me, Wake me
I’m Dreaming
I’m the one who’s left without you now
Save me, Save me, Save me
From dreaming of you.

I’m Still Dreaming of you
I’m Still Dreaming of you

V3
You listened attentively to me
To the words that split my head
I never believed they’d set me free
That’s my philosophy.

V4
I really did it once again,
I made a first class fool of myself
You hang on every word he’s saying
He’ll tell you what to be.

Bridge
Are you out of my league?
Then get out of my head.
Let’s put this to bed forever more.

Save me, save me, save me
From dreaming of you.

I’m Still Dreaming of you
I’m Still Dreaming of you

Mid 8
You never felt like this before
You feel so strange like something’s wrong
Everything changes, life goes on
Do you even miss me now at all?


Save me, save me
I’m Dreaming
Alone inside with out you to guide me
Wake me, Wake me, Wake me
I’m Dreaming
I’m the one who’s left without you now
Save me, save me, save me
From dreaming of….
Save me, save me, save me

Aimee Mann,"You look like a perfect fit
For a girl in need of a tourniquet

Come on and - save me
If you could - save me

Aimee Mann,"Nothing was saving our day
There was nothing to say,
But you said something anyway
Claiming I stepped out of line
Which forced you to leave me
As if that idea was mine.

Oh, you stupid thing
Speaking of course as your dear departed
Oh, you stupid thing
It wasn't me that you
Outsmarted
Oh, you stupid thing
Stopping it all
Before it even started.

I bet you knew it would come
That's just like you, to sit back
And just play it dumb
One word of warning would help
But that sacrifice was made
Trying to save yourself

Oh, you stupid thing
Speaking of course as your dear departed
Oh, you stupid thing
It wasn't me that you
Outsmarted
Oh, you stupid thing
Stopping it all
Before it even started.

Maybe that's just how I am
To fall where I stand, or
I'm weak for that kind of man
One who looks helpless and brave
But you turned into a coward
I don't care for the parts you saved.

Aimee Mann,"(one, two)
In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye
No guts to sever so forever may we wave good-bye
And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move
When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove
I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book
So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook
By saying there is no use changing
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are

Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
What's the matter with the truth did I offend your ears
By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try
Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy
It's not like you would lose some critical piece
If somehow you moved point A to point be	
Maintaining there is no point Changing
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are

Now I could talk to you 'til I'm blue in the face
But we still would arrive at the very same place
With you running around and me out of the race
So maybe you're right nobody can take
Something older than time and hope you could make
It better that would be a mistake

So take it just so far
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are
That's just what you are

Acting steady always ready
To defend your fears
(that's just what you are)
What's the matter with the truth
Did I offend your ears
(that's just what you are)

You're like a sleepwalking man
It's a danger to wake you
(that's just what you are)
Even when it is apparent
Where your actions will take you

(that's just what you are)
And that's just what you are
(that's just what you are)
And that's just what you are

Aimee Mann,"It's coming on christmas
They're cutting down trees,
Putting up reindeer,
And singing songs of joy and peace.
I wish I had a river,
I could skate away on.

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green.
Gonna make a lot of money,
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene.
And I wish I had a river,
I could skate away on.

I wish I had a river so long,
I would teach my feet to fly.
I wish I had a river,
I could skate away on.
I made my baby cry.

Tried hard to help me,
And you put me at ease.
Loved me so naughty,
Made me weaking in the knees.
I wish I had a river,
I could skate away on.

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad.
I've gone and lost the best baby,
I ever had.
I wish I had a river,
I could skate away on.

I wish I had a river so long,
I would teach my feet to fly.
Wish I had a river,
I could skate away on.
I made my baby say, ""Goodbye.""

Aimee Mann,"You pulled up and parked your El Dorado
We said ""hi"" and kissed with some bravado
I got out my camera and was laughing
Happy it was you I'm photographing

And we drove to the ferry
Like the cat and canary
I said, ""Baby, it's scary
When it's so beautiful

Why does it hurt me
To feel so much tenderness?
Beautiful
You little wonder, you""

Maybe then I held your hand and kissed you
I know once I just hauled off and hit you

'Cause I can't even stand it
'Cause I don't want to end it
To be perfectly candid ?
Baby, you're beautiful

Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Wish you could see it, too

And all I have to do today
Is make you happy
The only thing you have to say
Is, ""It's all lovely, baby""

Late that night, we checked into the Bellevue
Held you close, but, baby ? couldn't tell you

And we stayed in our Calvin's
And we swore we'd be best friends
And I looked through the zoom lens
And thought you were beautiful

Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Baby, I'm dazzled
By the view

You don't need to tell me
I'm completely powerless

Aimee Mann,"Cotton candy was king
On the midway that spring
When I saw you in the ring on the lawn

Dear John
Throwing kisses so Richmond's unfortunates can go on

Oh, the lectures I gave
So the girls would behave
While the band played all your favorite songs

Dear John
Throwing kisses so Richmond's unfortunates can go on

But numbers come up and you're left to the fates
Though I always thought you were one of the greats
Once somebody stationed in Kuala Lumpur
Said he thought you went out, but he couldn't be sure

Aimee Mann,"That summer was just crazy hot
We walked the fairground parking lot
And with our secret handshakes
Sealed the deal completely
But I'm too close to know just what
Will keep Pandora's boxes shut
And so I'll fail you badly
When you really need me

'Cause I don't know
What I should know ?
That I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore

And give you my analysis

A wall that you decided
Wasn't worth defending?

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.

Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Aimee Mann,"Three A.M. I'm awakened
By a sweet summer rain
Distant howling of a passing Southbound coal train
Was I dreaming
Or was there someone just lying here Beside me in this bed?
Am I hearing things?
Or in the next room
Did a long forgotten music box just start playing?

And I know (it's a sin putting words in the mouths of the dead)
And I know (it's a crime to weave your wishes into what they said)
And I know (only fools venture where them spirits tread)
Cause I know (every word, every sound bouncing 'round my head)

Is just static on the radio
(Everything I think I know is just static on the radio)

Now there's a church house
About a stone's throw down
From this place where I been staying
It's Sunday morning
And I'm sittin' in my truck
Listening to my neighbor sing
Ten years ago I might have joined in
But don't time change those inclined
To think less of what is written
Than what's wrote between the lines?

Cause I know (dreams are for those who are asleep in bed)
And I know (it's a sin putting words in the mouths of the dead)
Cause I know (for all my ruminations I can't change a thing
Still I hope (there's others out there who are listening)

How you offer up all your love and devotion

Love is like a ferris wheel
Love is like a roller coaster
Love is at a standstill
Body after body after body
It's a landfill and I just caught a body
In the lobby and got my hands filled

I set up all the dates
That rang up fate and got my friends killed

I love that Purple Rain love
That have a fight, that scratch my face
That fuck outside and ride my motorcycle in the rain love
Love is like a garden, love is like a death sentence
Love is like a pardon, I'm free again and ready
Once outside these prison walls, to believe again is scary
Your garden is my sanctuary

And 25 soldiers multiplied, always strapped, we march on

Woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

In Trinidad there was a family
With much confusion as you will see
There was a mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to marry and have a wife of his own

He met a young girl who suited him nice
He went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said, ""Son, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

A week went by and the summer came down
And soon another girl on the island, he found
He went to his papa to name the day
His papa shook his head and this time he did say

""You can't marry this girl, I have to say no
That girl is your aunty but your granny don't know

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

Now, he went to his mama and covered his head
He told his mama what his papa had said
His mama, she laughed, she said, ""Go man, go
Your daddy ain't your daddy but your daddy don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, worries, it worries me, shame and scandal in the family

Me and Fast got the gats, we're out to rob a bank 
We got Steve outside, carrying a full pack 
Now everything's cool and everthing's smooth 
I walked up to the teller, I gave her the letter 
She gave me the loot with puckered up lips 
And a wink that I found cute, and I said,
""Baby, baby, baby""
(Is this some Kharmic-Chi love thing happening here baby or what) 
By that time Fast tapped me with the nine
He said it's time to blow, ya know, so out the door we go 
Back to the ride with Steve inside and alive, off we drive 
See, I hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll never get far
Riding around in a stolen police car
So we dropped it off and piled in a Caddy 
Steve was driving 'cause I had to talk to my man about something

You can torture me all you want""

From the suicide of the Lisbon girls.
People saw their clairvoyance
In the wiped-out elms and harsh sunlight.
Some thought the torture tearing the Lisbon girls
Pointed to a simple refusal  to accept the world
As it was handed down to them, so full of flaws.
But the only thing we are certain of
After all these years, is the insufficiency of explanations. 

Obviously doctor,
You've never been a thirteen year-old girl.

The Lisbon girls were thirteen,
Cecile, fourteen, Lux, fifteen, Bonnie, sixteen, Mary, and seventeen, Therese.
No one could understand how Mrs. Lisbon and Mr. Lisbon,
A math  teacher, had produced such beautiful creatures. 

From that time one, the Lisbon house began to change.
Almost every day, and even when she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,
Lux would suntan on her towel wearing a swimsuit
That caused the knife-sharpener to give her a fifteen minute demonstration for free. 

The only reliable boy who got to know Lux was Trip Fontaine
For only 18 months before the suicides had emerged from baby fat
To the delight of girls and mothers alike. 

But few anticipated it would be so drastic.
The girls were pulled out of school,
And Mrs. Lisbon shut the house for maximum security isolation.
The girls' only contact to the outside world
Was through the catalogs they ordered
That started to fill the Lisbon's mailbox
With pictures of high-end fashions and brochures for exotic vacations.
Unable to go anywhere, the girls traveled in their imaginations
To gold-tipped Siamese temples or past an old man,
The leaf broom tidying the Maw's carpeted speck of Japan ?
And Cecelia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta

Collecting everything we could of theirs,
We couldn't get the Lisbon girls out of our minds,
But they were slipping away.
The colors of their eyes were fading,
Along with exact locations of moles and dimples.
From five, they had become four,
And they were all (the living and the dead), become shadows.
We would have lost them completely if the girls hadn't contacted us. 

Lux was the last to go.
Fleeing from the house, we forgot to stop at the garage.
After the suicide free-for-all,
Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.
They had Mr. Henry pack up the house,
Selling what furniture he could at a garage sale.
Everyone went just to look.
Our parents did not buy used furniture,
And they certainly didn't buy furniture tainted by death.
We of course took the family photos that were put out with the trash.
Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market,
And it was sold to a young couple from Boston. 

It didn't matter in the end how old they had been,
Or that they were girls.
But only that we had loved them,
And that they hadn't heard us call, still did not hear us.
Calling out of those rooms where they went to be alone for all time,
Alone in suicide.
Which is deeper than death,
And where we will never find the pieced to put them back together.",Suicide Underground,2000

For precious time in paradise

We listened to that silent voice
That haunts you 'til you just give in

Just reading well each other's eyes
The world had turned while we stood still
And held on to each other

And in between the right and wrong
Is somewhere that sometimes you can belong

can not hide

I'd give you my heart and soul (I'd give you my heart and soul)

Filling all the space there is to find
Melting love's own ice that lay so frozen

So if I face another day without you next to me
I'll lock you in my mind and wish away the key


CHORUS
Hope springs eternal when you're near
All the passion reappears
All emotion seems so strong


Hope springs eternal through your eyes
Draws me closer to your side
And keeps me there where I belong


Given back the trust that was so fleeting
Captured by one my heart was seeking
Taken to my destiny's horizon
Searching for the moon we see it rising


And in the silence of the night, I hold you next to me
Feeling dreams take flight, they set the spirit free


CHORUS


",Hope Springs Eternal,1986
Air Supply,"(graham russell)

When the shadows spread their wings and chase the day away
The time that is for love I know is near
The mystery we feel will soon surround us
The journey of both laughter and a tear

Sweet memories we make will be forever now
The voices from the past will understand
Waiting for the smile that cuts into me
The fragrance of your hair borne on the wind


(chorus # 1)
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
What is between us is more than your caress
It's more than I would dare confess
I know it to be true
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
Don't you remember the panic of our love
We've risen high above it now
I owe it all to you
I'd die for you, I'd die for you


The flames that born as one in time may fall away
The glow that is within will never die
To live without you now, I cannot understand
To live with out you I could not survive


(chorus # 2)
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
What is between us is more than your caress
It's more than I would dare confess
I know it to be true
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
Don't you remember the vision of our love
We've risen high above it now


Whenever you hold me the cycle is complete
The secret of eternal love is laid right at our feet

",I'd Die for You,1986

I won't ask you to stay
I won't hold you back
I won't stand in your way
If that's what you've gotta do, I understand

It's not that easy setting you free
But that's how it's gotta be
And as you're walking away
As I'm watching you go
There's one thing I want you to know

Just remember my heart's with you
When the night gets so long and cold
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone
Take a moment to think of me
And the love that we used to know
And if you ever find you ever need me someday
I'm just a heartbeat away

Saying goodbye isn't saying were through
Just know through it all I'm still here for you
Light a light in the window
When your lost in the dark, ooh

These arms would be happy to hold you again
If ever you miss me or when you
Start thinking about
All the nights that we shared
Darling, you know Ill be there

Just remember my heart's with you
When the night gets so long and cold
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone
Take a moment to think of me
And the love that we used to know
And if you ever find you ever need me someday

You walk to the door with nothing to say
I look in your eyes and you look away
You're leaving me now, but darling, I hope
Hope that you'll look back someday

And remember my hearts with you
When the night gets so long and cold
And no one's there to hold when you're all alone
Baby, take a moment to think of me
And the love that we used to know
And if you ever find that you're all alone

Just remember my heart's with you

I don't need things to weigh me down

To be a part of everything you do
To break through a lost communication
To let me know that everything is true

Put love in your life, find it today and hold me tonight
You know there will always be me
There will always be you
Put love in your life, open your heart it won't be denied
The one you thought could not be
Is waiting for you


I don't need anxiety to hold me
In the name of something to embrace
I don't need society to scald me
To pin me down and slap me in the face
All I need is you and your affection
To be the judge and jury in my life
Searching for that moment of perfection
To let me know we surely are alive

It all was meant to be

This feeling now just cannot wait

And yet we always worry for the things that we can't see

You know what seems invisible will never ever be disguised to me


I start to lose control
I start to lose control


CHORUS
I know I will remember for longer than forever
All the love and the stars in your eyes
Until my arms surround you and build the world around you
All I see are the stars in your eyes


First you hear the angels sing and then you see the wedding ring
Shining as the threads of life so secretly are woven
You know what you've found, you want to last forever
You heart has found its wings and left for never never


And then I lose control
I start to lose control

I know I will remember for longer than forever
All the love and the stars in your eyes

And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me

Only you can fill that space inside

So thereâ??s no sense pretending
My heart itâ??s not mending

And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby those memories come crashing through
And I just canâ??t go on without

Iâ??ve done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain

I just canâ??t live without you
I miss everything about you

In the words that we say
We're all searching for sanity
Till it drives us away
To that place in the wilderness

Wasn't easy to find
Why do we spend time alone
Why don't we end nights together
Isn't it time to come home

I can't stop the rain from falling
Do what you must do
I can only hope to share
The pain I gave to you

And be thrown to the ground
If I'm still a part of your life
Come lay your head on my pillow
And tell me to hold you tonight

A long time ago, from the valley of the sun
Came the holy power,
When the gods were one
Searching for a new home,
Searching for this land
Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen
The pillars of the temple,
In these hills of green
Buried deep inside for only us to find

(chorus)
It is the roar of the wind,
The power of the sun
The strength of a thousand bows
And those who near it again, will fear it again
And it's here in the heart of the rose
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake
All that lay within you,
As this dawn should break
With this force awoken, none can stand before
This is the hour, now is the time
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine
All that we must be, is everything we see

Our love, has brought us both together
And it's our love that will go on forever
There is no love that can become as one
Before it's time

And through us this secret flows
And now our destiny calls,

When you ran across the road
The light alone soon told me
You had a heavy load
But I can't see why you didn't stay
Why you didn't come to see if I felt
The same way
And I do, and I do
I never asked for any comfort
To take up your time
But now I feel so very different
I need to make you mine
And I want to take what you have to

From my head

One I can defend

Is do you want to live

Frightened stiff with fear

And it must go on
Being here with you,
Taking what is mine
Just between the lines
And here we are, here we are
All alone for me to take
And here you are, here you are
All alone for me to take

To lose and gain
But when the sun was taken

It's to say I love you to

For granted
Among the silent victims
Only the wind would moan
And for a time I felt us touch
The great unknown
For that eternal moment
Oh what a price to pay
With nothing left but all we have
We slowly walked away
If there's one thing I must do
It's to say I love you too
It's the one thing I'm so sure of

And cast your heart beyond those

I can make the final block
I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone
But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really want to see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do

",All That You Want,1997
Air Supply,"The book of love, that sacred place
Where we walk tall, or in disgrace
Who tills the ground on which we tread
Who gives us all our daily bread
The spirit woken from its sleep
The demon stirring from the deep
Whose gates at dawn we all must pass
The last one first, the first one last
Whose words must be both black and white
Whose music shall be day and night
The moon that tells us of the sun
Where voices soar so far above
These pages are the book of love


If we were born just to succeed
If life was meant to be a choice
For either happiness or greed
If you can't walk, you'll always run
Away from anyone, yes you will


But if we learn to take our time
As though each moment is a treasure
That's not so hard to find
When you are free, then suddenly
There's room for everyone, yes there is


CHORUS
The book of love, the world of dreams
Those shadows fall upon us all
And send our weary eyes to sleep
But when you wake, your heart will make
Some room for everyone


Just come to me
There's nothing you should fear
Just come to me
I'll always be right here
I tell you now
Your heart is where I live
And what you ask, is what I'll give


If we were born just to succeed
If life was meant to be a choice
For either happiness or greed
If you can't walk, you always run
Away from anyone, yes you will

I put on all my armour
But I couldn't find my sword

If they come to take you prisoner
I'll be there to set you free


Mother said, I'm grown up
In a Sunday shirt and tie
As long as I can see you
Can I hold you when I cry
There'll always be tomorrow
I'll be so big and strong
I'll sleep with all the lights out
Not afraid of anyone


I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you
I need you


Mother said she's sleeping
So I climbed back into bed
But the monsters took her prisoner
That's all that father said
So I thought about tomorrow
And I learned to be alone
Making friends with shadows
As they moved around my home


Mother never leaves me
I can always see her smile


I sit here in the evening
To talk to her awhile
There'll always be tomorrow
Just you wait and see
I know that any moment
She will come to set me free

You were always a part of my destiny


I always believed, that this day had to come
There was not enough time
And too much left undone
I could never deny
Just how far we had come

So much love
So much love

Another day to spend with you
That's all I ask, just to be with you

When I say I need you
When you say come closer
I know I'll never leave you

You can stare into heaven
When your heart is free
I suppose that we just couldn't wait
For heaven is where we must be

I don't feel the rain

You'll never miss the world you left behind

And I am your man

Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take

It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am

Are we both about to leave

Say we're together, always forever

You can say I'm not the one
That a lot of faith has gone
The bridges were never quite crossed

Every grain of truth, we deny or prove
Is somewhere before it gets lost
And is found again

Flying around me in a world of their own
What if there's nothing that needs to be said

Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn of the power of love

Where life is new and dreams come true
You're only in love, only in love

When conscience pulls you away and your destiny calls
Just follow your heart all the way, you'll never need more
More than the burning light when evening must die
You'll never forget this night, or wonder why

And facing the truth
That words can't explain
But the truth I think you know(Tell me)

And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright

Well, it's nothing 'til I give it to you

I can make the final block
I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

Do you really want to see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do

Airmen of Note,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999

Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad

You gave, my pride, back to me.

""AJ's gonna fall off"", you're hoping, right?
Hardly make it all pop, get your scoping right
Uh, and I always got a badders and a good ting
Bad ting, coming round the crib on a wood ting
LV, good ting, not a boog ting
I ain't got no time for a broke or a hood ting

I leave the crib when my P's are right
Send my niggas to your door like the pizza guy
Don't be looking for no smoke 'cause it's free, my guy
My akhs bringing out the smoke like a shisha pipe, you'll get smoke
Keep acting up, you'll get smoke
You're not bad for us, you'll get smoke
Come and run your mouth, you'll get smoke
Like a shisha pipe, you'll get smoke

Trap house is doing numbers
Now my money works for me, I take slumbers
Eyes up exotic gyal with them bumpers
Peng tings running me down for my jumpers
We wear black like we're grungers
You man are pushing shit like you're plungers
I'm a cool guy, now I pay my own bills
But I still haffi lurk the strip with my hunters
Come from country and punters
Money stack look real thick, it's one chunkers
I don't chill with frauds or no stunters
Dem man fake like Dairylea Dunkers
Take my Arab baby girl for dinner, then a show
Nando's, Butterfly Chicken, it's a go
Buss the pussy, she won't tell me lick it 'cause she know
I ain't built like that, nigga, that's a no, look

I leave the crib when my P's are right
Send my niggas to your door like the pizza guy

'Til I saw the guns and the drugs
There is tons in the hood
I'll admit, I never sold a sack in my life

Watchin' ""Scarface"" thinkin' that was a life
Slingin' dope or coke, respect, money and power
But what happen when things start to go sour
Everybody want to see more cash

But ego's clashin', that's when egos crash
See the two of them started when they was in dimes
Graduated, now they movin' bricks at a time
Down to do whatever even wet up cops

Tryin' to build an empire so they shut up shop
They got themselves a connect ready to tie it down
A buster went from Philly straight to China town
Now there is dough's poorin' heads thinkin' it's the same

All of a sudden there is weak link in the chain
He's a 6""2, brawler cat -- nickname Bolo
Caught beef with his man so he had to go dolo
But that was a no no

You know the code of the streets; everybody gotta eat
And that's how shit in the hood be
Ain't sayin' it's a true story, but it could be
For the next three months Bolo is nowhere to be found

They say 'cause of the beef that's why he left town
And everybody knows why they don't get along
He's a greedy bastard - stole half a meal from Fom
Fom is the quiet type, silent and deadly

You play with his money now he's violent and ready
They was partners - betrayed by his own man
So he really gotta take action into his own hands
Father forgive me for the sins I commit
But when I see that thief again, that's it

The good, the bad, things can get ugly
Every hustler over this money thinkin' what it should be
Never know who, when, where, what could be
If you still alive then you'll probably understood me

Meanwhile across town in a two bedroom apartment
Bolo's going through it, baby mama through it
All that dumb shit he be puttin' her though
Disappear for three months plus he hittin' her too

Now she got her bags pack then she ready to bounce
Didn't leave a thing - not even the keys to the house
Let her leave, he ain't talk with her at all
Went straight for the safe behind the portrait on the wall

He's back for his jewels, that 'n the cash
Plus the sale of last few bricks he had in his stash
Get his money right then he leavin' again
Off to find a new life and start breathin' again

So the deal was made and the buyers agreed
And exchanged - they bring what the suppliers would need
Pick a spot in China Town uncle Lenny used to own
Dollar bills on the wall respectfully known

Bolo went by himself even though it seem risky
Wanted the whole cake - somethin' smell fishy
Back in the kitchen the money was waitin'
Deep in his heart he knew he was dancin' with Satan

Dress in all back with gats - this ain't part of the deal
Had a me set a mouth for the kill
Startin' lettin' off shots now just a few here
Sounded like firecrackers durin' Chinese new years

Bolo's big as a truck I don't know how they missed him
But they got so close the bullet stay there and kissed 'em
Grabbed the suitcase threw a table at the goons
Jump out a shattered window not a moment too soon

The thugs follow and he sprayed up his ride
Cut up from the glass but he made it alive
Now he's back at the crib frankly they say at least
He was just being chased by thugs and the police

Countin' his dough sittin' on the couch' in
Two shots to the back of the head now he slouch' in
Fom tried to get him at the spot, couldn't then

Aja Smith,"It's from the heart
It's from the heart right here (yeah)
Everybody has a story to tell
Check this out though

I knew this chinese dude in Junior High
Part of my crew, everybody knew the kid
He was the talk of the school, intelligent
And well spoken, respected by teachers
All the other students kept their eyes on his sneakers
What can I say? You can tell he's cool if you talk with him
During fire drills girls would want to walk with him
He could have any chick up in his view
But there was only one girl he wanted to call boo
See its all true, found himself stressed in a dead end
The girl he was feelin was obsessed with his bestfriend
His bestfriends a playa, that's the reason he's pissed
Plus he treat her like she don't even exist
He ain't tryna hate on his man, but there was no help in it
Wrote the girl a letter told her how he felt in it
She was shocked at first of him revealing the truth
Till she realized that she was feelin him too

[Chorus]
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you

And you've been thinkin of me

Oh

Uh
So you know as time goes by
Things get a little bit serious
Just listen

It was strictly hip hop, now they bumpin slow jams all day
Went from holding hands, to makin out in the hallway
Their relationship, seemed like a dream come true
As time went by their friendship grew
Staring at the stars, trading secrets on the phone
When her parents were at work, she would sneak him in her room
He told her he was a virgin the day that they met

So on his birthday he got a gift he'll never forget
Females were jealous, but they still calling him cute
First day of summer school, they rocked the matching nautica suits
Happy in each others arms, can it be
They found true love, living in a fantasy
Then reality attacks, his pops couldn't see past the fact
His son was asian, but his girlfriend was black
Imagine having to choose between the one that you love or your fam
That's like cutting off your right or left hand, damn

[Chorus]

Uh huh, yeah

I know this sounds like a true story
Coulda happened to any one of us
It's crazy though right?

Now if this sounds like a true story
That's probably cause it is
And I know for a fact cause I'm that chinese kid
Mm, lookin back now, I know its more than just a crush
I'm sayin the whole expierience taught me so much
Love can overcome anything that gets in its way
That's reason I still think of shorty 'til this day
We talk now and then, she's doin her thing
We both full grown up, I think she rockin a ring
I know she's proud of me and all the things I've accomplished
She was there when I was nobody, that's being honest
Ain't no shame, I'll admit it she was there when I cried
So in return I wipe the tears from her eyes
As far as my pops, he's a little more open minded
If his son is happy, he's 100% behind it
Now this is a song I know I had to do
Cause all the stuff I went through might have happened to you

[Chorus]

Oh

Uh, yeah

You only get one
So you gotta remember

What kind of fools are we thought

In the face of our children. Why have we decided to

In the shadow of certain demise
When will our suffering be broken
When will the wrongs be made right

When will we fall on our face in repentance and

Aun puedo leer, en mis manos tu piel
Y de la noche que me diste, que no olvidare
Y me pongo a pensar, que me podría pasar
Si acostumbraste mi vida, a tu forma de amar

Fuiste en mí, la forma nueva de amar
Con quien yo aprendí mil cosas que nunca pude dar
Y me pongo a pensar, que me podría pasar
Si acostumbraste mi vida, a tu forma de amar

Mañana partiré
No sé cuánto pero lloraré
Mientras camino la melancolía
Me dice que no te volveré a ver

Lleva en sus alas todo mi dolor
Más yo quisiera tener el poder
De unir tu historia y la mía mi amor

Día con día te escribiré
Para que sepas de mí
Aunque yo me encuentre ausente
Sentirás que estoy aquí

Llamabas Valentín que fue fusilado y colgado en la sierra
No me quisiera acordar era una tarde de invierno
Cuando por su mala suerte cayo Valentín en manos del gobierno

El capitán le pregunta cuál es la gente
Que mandas son ochocientos soldados
Que tienen sitiada la hacienda de Holanda

El coronel le pregunta cuál es la gente
Que guías son ochocientos soldados
Que trae por la sierra Mariano mejía

Y así mueren los hombres mi amigo
Los que inventaron la revolución verdad de Dios y échele mi AK-7

El general le decía yo te concedo el indulto
Pero me vas a decir cual es en jurado la causa que juzgo
Valentín como era hombre de nada les dio razón
Yo soy de los meros hombres de los que inventaron la revolución

Antes de llegar al cerro Valentín quiso llorar
Madre mía de Guadalupe por tu religión me van a matar
Vuela y vuela, palomita párate en ese fortín
Estas son las mañanitas de un hombre valiente que fue Valentín

Donde los dos nos recreamos
Ahora que estamos solitos
Que dices nos vamos
A cortar los vergelitos
De aquellos hermosos llanos

En un barandal de acero
Se paseaba el rey de roma
Si Dios fuera justiciero
Apreciaría al que enamora
Y hasta la vida daría
De las leyes que hay ahora

Agua de las pilas nuevas
Donde se recrían las flores
Ya vinieron tus amantes
Ya vinieron tus amores
Aquí los tienes cerquita
Ya no pedirás amores

Cupido como valiente
Quítame esta vida ingrata
Yo te pido de favor
Que la dagacia de plata
Para morir con honor
En los brazos de mi chata

Mi querida me mando
A una ciudad muy lejana
Me encargo que le trajera
Una lechuga alemana
Un clavelito francés
Y una flor Americana

Unas buenas calabazas
No me las cortes muy tiernas
Porque se secan las matas
No dejes la puerta abierta
Porque se meten las vacas

Tan misteriosa como su melancolía

Tomo las llaves de su auto y se fue
Cuida los niños regreso más tarde
En la oficina tengo mucho que hacer

Y a un hotel de carretera él se fue
Con las reservaciones listas
No dijo nombre ni quien es
Seguramente lo esperaba esa persona
Que robaba sus instantes se decía que era su amante

Cuál es la falla que he tenido contigo
Dentro de mi alma sé que no eres feliz
El se dio vuelta y agacho su mirada
Por un momento no supo que decir

A paso lento fue acercanse a ella
Con la insistencia ya no supo qué hacer
Y el le dijo perdóname vida
La que me llama no es ella es el

Si hubiera sido ayer seria otra realidad
No hay una buena frase que pueda cambiar

Ouais M.C: ton rap ne casse pas des briques
Donc laisse pas traîner ta serviette hygiénique dans les chiottes du Quick
Reste reur-ti, meurtri par les échecs
Coquards et grosses lèvres lendemain d'un jour de fête
Dans chaque tiex', c'est la hass
Jure pas sur la Mecque, tu veux m'la mettre: je te baise

Neuf-Cinq, S.O.A., Banlieue d'Paris: c'est là qu'on est
Ma ville tu la connais, par ici la monnaie
J'veux la daronne assise a la son-mai
L'khalis il doit tomber
L'raciste on va plomber
Pas d'cinéma, pas d'carte UGC
Barbare oui je sais, j'ai ma capuche baissée
J'arrive zgègue de Galsène, j'baise de la chienne
J'reste moi-même: Nourou, say my name

Un truc spécial pour mes cailles que j'étale sur mes cahiers
J'envoie des mots comme des balles en métal: vaut mieux tailler
Zes' mec de tess, nous on fait trembler ton palier
J'débarque, Vitry, Neuf-Quatre, on a l'talent pour t'braquer ou freestyler
J'suis dans un hall, gros j'suis calé
Avec l'équipe, dans une allée
Mange du bitume toute l'année
Veulent voir nos rôles ici: caner
On a choisi, on s'est cramés
Par les soucis, gros j'suis gavé
Viens pas m'check si t'as trop parlé

T'as trop parlé, bâtard?
Nique ta mère, la chatte à ta grand-mère, bâtard
On va t'niquer ta mère
On va t'jeter dans une cave dans l'Neuf-Cinq

Hé, Tonton Seth, j'ai huit mesures en or si tu m'l'autorises
J'arrive plus lourd qu'une orgie d'sumotoris
À mon mariage c'est moi qu'j'aurai l'plus beau jogging
Le plus gros bolide: une R19 avec un turbo d'Boeing
Les MC encaissent mieux les pruneaux qu'Tony
Zekwé chie des rafales d'obus
Le F.C. Porto va droit au but
Ouh caralhou, teste pas les cailleras d'nos rues
Ou l'addition sera salée comme un accra d'morue

J'arrive en balle, mon excursion sera expéditive
Écoute: je ne mens pas, c'est bien pour ça qu'j'obtiens l'respect des p'tits
Toujours au top moi, j'ai la bonne recette
On prend les mêmes et on recommence
J'te mets en transe sur l'album de Seth
En une phase, le ter-ter subit un tremblement
J't'ai vu dans l'angle mort, tu kiffais pas, au final t'en redemandes
J'suis une bombe à retardement
Ça fait ""brrraaah"", ""zdedededex""
Ouvre pas tes fesses, j'te la mets tendrement

On a des têtes comme dans le ""Dernier Gang""
Oufs à la Spaggiari, on est des barbares
Que des ""7"" sur le code-barre
Ambiance Audiard ou Tarantino, touche pas à nos bambinos
On t'aura, comme dans ""Gomorra"": cache pas l'butin sous l'Dunlopillo
Demande à Al Poelvoordino: wanted pour murder
Nique ta mère la Police, nique ta race Fox Mulder
On y croit tous comme Ribéry, fout l'dawa comme au Bayern
J'baiserai la France jusqu'à c'qu'elle m'aime comme Mac Tyer

C'est pour les malfrats, les ghetto youths
Entre la mosquée et la muscul', ou sur Neptune via d'la ppe-fra Absolut
Insolents, on sait vi-sèr' des sons lourds
Prêts a salir
Coûte que coûte on veut les salaires
Coups d'couteau dans sa mère
L'rap crève, arme, guerre
Micros en l'air
Tout l'monde à terre: temblement d'ter-ter
C'est Aulnay, 2SK'Prod, tes potos connaissent

On roule dans des caisses d'occase
La marijuana vient d'Tijuana
Les balles qu'on tire, wallah, viennent du Caucase
La fumée s'propage comme des phéromones
Starfoullah l'héritage qu'on a offert aux mômes
Avec classe, on s'échappe par l'vasistas
Face au fisc on balise pas
Vu qu'à la douane les valises passent
T'façon on a jamais aimé Rambo, Tarzan
Nos idoles sont ceux qui vendent des kilos d'pavot afghan

J'suis le côté diabolique de Serge Gainsbourg
J'connais le diagnostic mais j'espère que les médecins s'gourent
J'festoie fils: serre-moi un verre d'vin rouge
J'm'esquinte, j'souffre, j'suis quelqu'un d'louche
Je fatigue Satan
Crois pas qu'la Police arrive à temps
Ou qu'ça tire à blanc dans la galerie marchande
Je fabrique l'argent, la famille attend
Qu'j'ramène entre les dents le string de Fanny Ardant

Envoie les clefs du TT, j'me transforme en virtuose
J'mets des grosses fessées sur des p'tits culs roses
Vote pour moi sur ""chien-d'la-casse.fr""
J'te regarde de travers si tu cherches moi les vers
J'pue l'Jack Daniel, j'suis l'fils caché d'Gargamel
J'm'en vais danser l'disco avec deux-trois chattes d'Asnières
On s'entraîne au tir au bois d'Achères
Ambiance murder, pas d'voice au vocoder
C'est Giorgio Moroder

Sur moi, ne lé-par pas
Car chez nous la trahison ne se répare pas
On prend les sens interdits
T'rentre dedans comme la vachette d'Intervilles
Crois pas qu'chez nous c'est fantastique
À mettre la cagoule, les gants en plastique
Les 'tasses de tess', c'est pas ma tasse de thé
Pour les p'tis gars du Seize: fais des traces de C

Quand on était p'tits, les anciens nous envoyaient acheter des canettes
Aujourd'hui ils nous sucent la bite pour qu'on leur avance une galette
C'est la galère ouais, mais nique sa mère, on a l'feeling
Investir dans un calibre c'est mieux que d'faire d'l'haltérophilie
À la mairie, on leur a demandé un terrain d'foot
Ils ont refusé, on s'est mis à bicrave et on a ouvert un terrain d'chnouf
Bouffe pas la galette des rois, tu trouveras pas la fève
J'ai vendu la galette darwa, j'ai fini au Quai des Orfèvres

Laissez passer les têtes de cabochards
Enfouraillés au 79, rue Quentin Bauchart
Donne toujours une pièce quand tu rencontres un clochard
Wesh, éteins ton char
Échange pas des années d'liberté contre un bon-char
En bon couche-tard, j'ai la gueule du Capitaine Caverne
Va niquer ta mère
Si t'es un kouffar
On a la même beu-bar qu'Jacques-Oussama Mess'Laden
Au tier-quar on baise la mère de Papy Broussard

Were leading us together

So I’m gonna build a boat

And sail it to the blue

Yet I’m a kind of believer

Nuit de hasard on se sépare
Sans trop y croire

Okay
C'est une histoire de peau
Okay
On repart à zéro
Okay
On oublie aussitôt
Okay
Qu'on s'est tourné le dos

Nuit magique
Une histoire d'humour qui tourne à l'amour
Quand vient le jour
Nuit magique
On perd la mémoire au fond d'un regard
Histoire d'un soir

Nuit magique
Si loin de tout sans garde-fou
Autour de nous
Nuit magique
Nuit de hasard on se sépare
Sans trop y croire

Akapela,"Un peu spéciale, elle est célibataire
Le visage pâle, les cheveux en arrière
Et j'aime ça
Elle se dessine sous des jupes fendues
Et je devine des histoires défendues
C'est comme ça
Tellement si belle quand elle sort
Tellement si belle, je l'aime tellement si fort

Elle a les yeux revolver
Elle a le regard qui tue
Elle a tiré la première
M'a touché, c'est foutu

Elle m'a touché, c'est foutu

Un peu larguée, un peu seule sur la terre

Akbar,"One two
Comin for you
Yo yo yo

Last night, I didn't know what to write
So I broke my pen in half, in a violent rage
Opened my journal, then let the ink bleed on the page
Until it formed a sihlouette, of me on stage
Still abstract, like unidentified objects
Find my name scrawled on the walls of your projects
Like hieroglyphs, written in cryptic form
To forewarn the comin apocalyptic storm
I dreamt of fire, swallowin' this wicked empire
And saw the entire world hurled into destruction
With their inequity, trickery and corruption
Caught you with your pants down, in the Oval Office
When the Messiah came, without an introduction
Too late to escape your fate, though many have tried
The pens have been lifted, the pages have dried
It was all prophesied like comets, droppin' from the skies
Causin' earthquakes, and whole cities to capsize
My peoples dyin' while you tryin' to save the Earth
You need to stop lyin' and SAVE YOURSELF FIRST

Still, they wonder why, I chant the battle cry
It's not that I'm anti, it's just that I can't lie
The only thing I stand against, is ignorance
But you call it hate, when I advocate, self-defense
What's the battle cry? 
What's the battle cry? Allah you Akbar
What's the battle cry? 
What's the battle cry? Allah you Akbar

Now put the Ak' on, as I presume to rock on
Leavin spots torn, whenever we lock horns
Come battle me, and that'll be your last mission
When you hear the boom, assume the crass position
Somebody tell my opposition, stop the mission
Mental giant's about to drop science, listen
To the ancient tribal drum
Close your eyes and nod your head and the vibe'll come
From the base of your spine
To a place in your mind that transcends all space and time
The legendary lonely wolf roam the prairie
Hug your kids tight, midnight, quite scary
Under fire, movin' through this concrete jungle
Feelin' trapped, wishin' I had a gun, with nowhere to run to
I hear helicopters, I see buildigns begin to crumble
I feel somethin hot, I've been shot! I stumble
I blackout, then when I come to, I'm trapped
In the concentration camp, with a government stamp
Some type of microchip implant
Made in the factory, that's what they use for trackin' me
So if I try to escape, over the gate
The guards will attack, and put a bullet in my back
They stripped me of my identity, my name, my religion
Now I'm just a number in the system
Holdin' on to nothin', but my convictions
And cold steel bars, waitin' on Jar Jar to lick them

Still, they wonder why, I chant the battle cry
It's not that I'm anti, it's just that I can't lie
The only thing I stand against, is ignorance
But you call it hate, when I advocate, self-defense
What's the battle cry? 
What's the battle cry? Allah you Akbar
What's the battle cry? 
What's the battle cry? Allah you Akbar

Still, they wonder why, I chant the battle cry
Still, they wonder why, I chant the battle cry
Until the day I die
Allah you Akbar his name I glorify

Ake Johansson,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Ake Johansson,"They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me

I guess she's not for me

Can't be ordered a la carte
I wonder if she will be
Always a fantasy

Will I ever find the girl in my mind?
The one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she was my ideal

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1953

Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh

First off I wanna apologize
Every time I made my momma cry
Leaving these pussy ass niggas traumatized
All the bad names I called ya when Lil Bleek and Lil Ivy died
Bless me over and over again
I know he bless me the more I was sin
Guess I was moving too fast in the wind
Got tied and put my ass in the pen
Now I'm looking at the past, thinking 'bout the future
Glad I got another chance, see ya feeling's mutual
Protect me in the streets when the times got crucial
When niggas slung iron, you made me blind to the shooters
And now I'm all alone and I'm calling on you daily
Asking for forgiveness and I'm asking you to save me
Protect my T-lady , don't stress my old lady
And you and I know how much I love my seven babies

Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh

Thinking 'bout them nights that my momma cried
Only son since my only brother died
Surgery on surgery, I can feel the pain
Have mercy on the Lord, please don't let her hurt again
God you blessed my auntie Brenda be the living proof
Had a tumour in the brain size of a grapefruit
It's for them ghetto saviours that's living major
Now they missing like the flight 370 to Malaysia
We was skinning and grinning, thought we was winning
Heard it's hot in Hell so I'm packing linen
And lately my conscience been shaking me, waking me right about my sleep
Keep it 100, I ain't slipping 'bout a week, hey look
Gotta do it for my little cousin Trasity
See her boyfriend took her life
When I think about the daughter that she left behind
Pardon me, can't let see a gangsta cry, Lord have mercy

Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh

I was lost in a world-wind, now I'm sorry
Five different baby mama's coulda been on Maury
Staying up all night, smoking purp for hours
Can't even get my ass off to church a couple hours
Beefing with the enemy, teaching my son wrong things
In and out the hospital on that strong lean
Looking at the phone ring knowing it's my auntie
Knowing that she tryna pray for me, but I don't accept it
Now I'm selfish, not to others but myself
'Cause I'm feeling like nobody know my struggle, just my wealth
But that was then and this is now and since you gave me another chance
God man I'mma promise I make ya proud
Lotta times I screamed to ya, felt like you ain't hear me
You ain't heard me 'cause I wasn't worthy, sins dirty dirty

Beefing with the enemy, teaching my son wrong things
In and out the hospital on that strong lean
Looking at the phone ring knowing it's my auntie
Knowing that she tryna pray for me, but I don't accept it
Now I'm selfish, not to others but myself
'Cause I'm feeling like nobody know my struggle, just my wealth
But that was then and this is now and since you gave me another chance
God man I'mma promise I make ya proud
Lotta times I screamed to ya, felt like you ain't hear me
You ain't heard me 'cause I wasn't worthy, sins dirty dirty
Thugs cry, no lie had to hit my niece
Like please please, have mercy on me

Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh",Mercy on My Soul,2015
Akenya,"Sometimes I gotta get away, get away
Wake up at dawn with the main bang

With her little friend on my dang-a-lang, pitter-pat
Pump ya lil breaks with the Bickerang

I'm allergic to negativity, a-choo, look at you
Sexy when you mad though, ooo, look at you

Lay me down right, fuck the daylight
Fuckin' 'til the day break in the moonlight
Moanin' and sentimental giggles
And reminiscing as the remy trickles
Slowly down the hollow of my throat
Hold me like your only tomorrow
Show me I'm the one you would die for
I'll be everything you could ask for
Just you and me, babe
Stay here with me, babe
Silkk like my shocka, poppa
Silk like vanilla waves

As a pagan mystic rose
Perfect prostitute priestess
Face dripping with the semen of many
Initiatrix to the great work, devoted Isis
Without Osiris
Demeaned and demonized by God
A god so full of self hate
Futile hate
He loathes even his best creation
So full of hate, Full of self hate
Superior sub-rosa Sophia
Sucking the anointed at the temple
Fucking the Baptist by candle
In the trance of Horasis
Goddess soul carved in rock
Heavenly hymns hewn in stone
â??Mary, I am lost without youâ??
Raising arms to the head
To the head of the bed
Breasts rise across her ribcage
Shooting thick white debris
All over her face and hair

La vie est courte, les délices du bonheur substantiels
La mort frappe l’oiseau assassiné en plein ciel
Le sort collabore à emporter des fois des corps
Le Bad Boy sort quand le coroner s’endort encore
Mourir à trente ans, passer du bon temps
L’angoisse casse l’enfant, fait du frère un type arrogant
Assuré de voir un autre jour sous les coups
Je peux quand même apprécier un coucher de soleil comme vous
Rester lucide si les soucis troublent ma raison
Quand des tours de béton s’érigent à l’horizon
Mais vraiment c’est drôle ; ma philosophie est tel un saule
S’élève vers les cieux, pour replonger plus tard vers le sol
Vision de cauchemar, noir désir du savoir
Voir l’ange déchu, main mise sur le purgatoire
Croire en soi (en soi)
Rien de nouveau sous le soleil
Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys

Tempérament fatigué, on est nés sous le soleil

On habite Marseille
Quelle était la ville initiale?

On ne vit qu’une fois (fois) faut prendre du bon temps
Oui, autant (autant) profiter des instants les plus plaisants
Le monde est ainsi truffé de subtilités, trésors cachés de gatsés
Suffit de les débusquer, en abuser avec respect

Tu peux me faire confiance, j’entre dans la danse
Un sale gosse de plus (yes!) siège à la table des hautes instances
Un accro du micro qui fera mal à ta tête
Prends un Aspro et laisse faire les pros, made in Marseille

Maintenant tu sais que dans ma ville des MC’s déchirent
Multiplier notre empire, graver notre musique dans tes souvenirs
Faire le mac car dorénavant la famille sort du côté obscur
Sûr de t’avoir à l’usure, gazier

Akhenaton,"Chaud comme Marseille, on vous met le feu
Le cœur de la ville s'enflamme quand le son entre en jeu
Les préoccupations des frères s'infiltrent dans ton Walkman
L'argent, la boisson, la fumée et les femmes

Je nagerais avec les femmes et un micro dans une piscine
Si j'avais l'occasion de partir loin des vermines
L'hésitation ne se ferait pas, c'est certain
Mes poches sont vides et j'ai faim de pognon et d'un bon destin

J'extirpe ces quelques mots, un stylo de mon paletot
Sorti un jour du caniveau, je roule dans les casinos
Ouais, je fais le zguègue en espadrilles, mais j'assure quand même
Quoi qu'il arrive, car Fonky est la Famille

Autant parler des mains que la bouche chez nous n'est pas louche
Méditerranéen de souche, mes styles font mouche
Au milieu d'embrouilles ou de mauvais coups
Je crame tous les tintanos qui nous cherchent des poux

Dans la nuit, un MC check check le mic
Taquiner la rime et le beat est mon véritable hobby
Envoyer des styles pour tous les frères qui nique la halla
Pour la première fois, le refrain commence comme ça

Tranquille au bar et popo dans le pétard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
Porche sombre et gadjos dans les couloirs

Pendant que tu fais un flop, que tu tapes un magnétoscope
Don Choa calcine les rimes comme une clope en garde à vue
Le hip-hop au top descend le long de la rue
Et se saisit du showbiz à son insu

Accepte le son, qui touche de près mes entrailles
Au bercail, ma fonction est le travail
Je me comporte en canaille
Aïe! Les mauvais garçons se collent comme des moucherons
Aux jupons, frappent sans hésiter pour le pognon

Comme les apaches guinchent ton scalp
Ton fric est la proie, des hordes de chiens des Alpes en veulent à tes Delacroix
Mais pas moi, je suis droit, respecte les autres et crois
Au pouvoir de la rime dans la destruction des hazas

L'été, les quartiers, postes dans le bus
Que demander de plus, fusse le funk ou des Vénus?
Gus, soi-disant ma ville pue en plus
Dieu t'a-t-il fait avec un anus au lieu des sinus?

Simple dans ma façon de faire mon sang est rouge clair
Pourtant, j'ai la peau noire et fier de l'avoir
Je cours à la gloire des quartiers avec mes idées
Le produit, sera toujours enragé

Y'a pas que le mauvais côté
Le Rat te le dira, ""la vie est faite pour s'amuser""
Capte le concept des mecs qui s'en battent les couilles
Le bon délire est là, t'inquiète on se débrouille

Mes pensées drivent coolo, coolo
Voilà quelques mots
Pour l'avenir incertain de mes potos
Qui ont quitté les cours tôt
La rage est dans mon âme pour le drame du Front National
J'allume la flamme, la flamme

Fils, comprends ce que tu peux comprendre
Un bon conseil, prétends à ce que tu peux prétendre
Réfléchis un instant avant de faire un pas, tu saisiras
Pourquoi on te lèvera où que tu sois

Avant, je combattais contre des moulins à vent
Maintenant, je fais vibrer les salles et le public en rappant
Satir au soleil, zique à l'oreille
Signe une carte de visite live de Marseille

La balle de ping-pong d'Ali Kong tape
De Marseille à Naples, pour le rap, je capte les étapes
Et cap vers le possee qui me suit

Akhenaton,"Le vacarme des humains, parfois me rend patraque
Donc, je continue ce morceau en vrac en live dans mon hamac
Étant plus jeune, j'adorais les bruits de la ville
Des gens qui se filent, et des automobiles
Désormais, je préfère le silence
Me retrouver avec moi-même en méditation intense
Et c'est dans cet état que me viennent les mots les plus beaux
De rien je fais un tout, sonore dicté dans le micro
Je ne suis pas un aigri, oh non
De ceux qui aiment les enfants avec trois cuillères de Nopron
Ni un Marcel regardant pousser son bide
Tout au long de sa vie molle et vide, chrysalide
Il est, chrysalide il restera, mais moi je préfère être un papillon
Créer des œuvres dans mon sillon
Ce que j'appelle user de mes cinq sens
Ou vivre simplement avec le calme comme essence

J'aime entamer un texte après une relaxation
Vivre simplement avec le calme comme essence
J'aime entamer un texte après une relaxation
Je veux vivre simplement avec le calme comme essence
J'aime entamer un texte après une relaxation
Vivre simplement avec le calme comme essence
J'aime entamer un texte après une relaxation
Ne m'inspirant de rien sauf du silence

Le monde de l'absurdité devient-il un bastion?
Naître ou ne pas naître?
Telle est la question
Maintenant je suis ici et j'ai le choix de
Vivre dans la douceur ou bien survivre dans la douleur
C'est un chemin tracé dans la tête de chacun
Il faut se décider à la croisée de dégun ou de quelqu'un
Soit-disant je suis un VIP, moi je voudrais n'être rien
Qu'un simple citoyen méditerranéen
Quelque fois partir en Corse voir des amis
Un petit saut à Naples afin de saluer la famille
La simplicité règnerait dans les tranches de vies que j'ai dépeinte
Comme un paysan d'Agrigente dans mon orangeraie, j'arrangerai
Les fruits de la terre et me vengerai de celui qui les mangerait
Je me souviendrai alors de ces jours où
Je chapardais des citrons dans les champs de Cefalù
Le pardon est facile quand la mémoire est saine
Car l'homme est un cheval dont la raison est les rennes
Efface le lien du bonheur à l'abondance
Je veux vivre simplement avec le calme comme essence

J'aime entamer un texte après une relaxation

J'apprendrais à mes enfants que la Terre est une sphère
Je leur enseignerai que la couleur est illusion
J'apprendrai à mes enfants qu'une guerre est un enfer
Je leur enseignerai le respect des traditions
Car les anciens sont la mémoire, la sagesse, un fils
De métèque ne les met pas dans un hospice
Non, même si l'argent ne coule pas à flots
Il faut se dire que dans la vie il y a des bas et il y a des hauts
J'ai passé plus de temps en bas
Pourtant s'il fallait décrire les moments je ne le saurai pas
Joie et tristesse s'interpénètrent
À la manière du regard intense de deux êtres, par une fenêtre
Éloignez-moi de la multitude pressée
Préservez-moi de la solitude stressée
Loin du métro et des gaz d'échappement loin
Du gris des bâtiments, du train-train et des coups de freins
La technologie était supposée me servir
Et non pas m'endormir pour m'asservir
Les valeurs de base ne sont pas si mal quand j'y pense
Je veux vivre simplement avec le calme comme essence

Akhenaton,"Ma famille est sept fois séculaire, ancienne et insulaire
Entourée de mystères, et comme le Saint Suaire
À l'aube du troisième millénaire encore on dit
La légende des trois cavaliers espagnols qui débarquèrent
Au large de Trapani, les usages d'une secte
Dans leurs têtes et leurs bagages amenés de Tolède
Et tout ceci n'est pas mythe, fou l'ignores-tu?
Le jour où mon sang a coulé sur un fil, je fus perdu
Je suis né en 1903
Au milieu des Vendettas, dans les environs de Caltanisseta
Où seuls l'honneur et la famille décident
Les bancs de mon école s'appelaient racket et homicide
J'étais un pauvre paysan, gardien d'un Latifondo
Pour la criminalité, oui la Sicile a bon dos
Mais quand même, comment expliquer
Que des culs-terreux ont régit l'économie d'un pays entier
J'ai envoyé des tas de types au caveau
Ainsi je fus soldat dans la puissante Cosca des Salvo
Puis j'ai loué mes services un peu plus au Nord
En 22, j'étais à Bagheria dans la Conque d'Or
Pour rappeler à l'ordre ceux qui ne payaient rien
Et taxer leurs biens aux propriétaires terriens
On peut trouver ça monstrueux
Mais tout ce que j'ai fait, je l'ai fait pour être heureux

Tu appartiens à la Cosca
Ton sang appartient à la Cosca

Puis les fascistes sont arrivés au pouvoir
Pour les deux décennies noires
Avec le désir d'envoyer au placard
Les membres de l'honorable société
Les hommes de ma tradition furent chassés, arrêtés et enfermés
J'ai vite décidé de m'exiler en Tunisie
Pour fuir la répression du préfet Cesare Mori
À Tunis, il y avait déjà beaucoup d'italiens
Donc venu sans rien, j'ai dû m'accaparer des biens
Les familles s'étaient reconstituées
Les clandestins de Sicile réclamaient des peccadilles pour tuer
J'ai vite eu sous mes ordres une armée
Mes affaires ont prospéré jusqu'à ce que le gouvernement français
Eut signé mon acte d'extradition de Tunis
J'ai fuit, vers Le Havre puis les Etats-Unis
Là-bas en 43, j'ai lutté contre les sabotages des agents philo nazis
On a collaboré avec le gouvernement
Pendant quelques années jusqu'au jour du débarquement
Ils nous ont renvoyé l'ascenseur après quelques mois
En installant dans les mairies des gens de Cosa Nostra
La collusion entre Mafia et partis politiques
Était à son comble, pire c'était une logique
Ceci marqua d'une pierre blanche ainsi 50 ans d'emprise totale de la Mafia sur l'Italie

Tu appartiens à la Cosca
Ton sang appartient à la Cosca

Grâce à mes relations, dans les sphères de l'Etat
Je fus acquitté, pour un contrat, par un certain magistrat
En 57, j'étais incarcéré à l'Ucciardone
Mi-58, je travaillais dehors à Corléone
Les naïfs, comprennent-ils qu'en un an de prison
Ou dix ans de liberté on a les mêmes connections
C'est dans ces années-là que l'économie a changé
L'honorable société s'est vite adaptée
D'abord le trafic de drogue, l'assassinat de femmes
Aujourd'hui ils vendent même des organes
Et comme pour liguer tous les délits impunis
En 70, la criminalité s'est réunie
Il y avais là, des types de Campanie: de la Camorra
Et ces putains de balafreurs cruels de la 'Ndranghetta De Bari, le Sacra Corona Unita
Et je faisais partie des gars venus de Cosa Nostra
Peu à peu, se creusait un vide entre eux, leurs objectifs et moi et mes principes
Cinq mois après j'avais tout raccroché
M'étais barré dans la montagne pour me cacher
Et voilà donc vingt ans qui sont passés
Je suis resté discret et n'ai jamais balancé
J'ai quatre-vingt piges et des nouveaux changements politiques
Me font comprendre que mon âge est critique
Dehors, cette moto m'inquiète
Ce soi-disant postier porte des lettres? Il guette
Ils ont encore moins de respect que je pensais
Peut-être des nouveaux gars de l'organisation appelée Stidde
C'est terminé, alors pourquoi ne pas en rire
Sortir cette tête qui vaut 600.000 lires
C'est dérisoire, à dix mètres se tapit une armée de Guappi, tout ça afin d'éliminer un papi

Akhenaton,"C'était un jour de pluie où l'on n'aime pas mettre
Un seul pied dehors, la tête à la fenêtre
J'étais très occupé à me plaindre de notre concert
Du lieu, du son, des conditions, de l'atmosphère

Qui régnait, mais peu de temps avant de jouer
Une dame s'est approchée et m'a dit
""Cet enfant est condamné
Son rêve est de vous rencontrer""

Elle avait fait 400 kilomètres en ambulance pour nous voir
Ecouter le répertoire ce soir
Quand Steve est descendu, son visage était pâle
Miroir de la maladie, une empreinte du mal

Le concert terminé il était si content
Que ses yeux retrouvèrent les couleurs du printemps

Puis, je lui fis faire des promesses sur une année
Pour empêcher le désespoir de l'emporter
Je suis parti environ trois semaines
Quand je suis revenu, Pascal n'était plus le même

Il m'a dit, tu sais, les plus beaux cœurs ont une fin
Le 23 août au soir, Steve s'est éteint
Je n'ai pas pu te parler, désolé
Mais pour toi ces paroles sont nées, 21 jours après

Moi qui me plaignais de mes vacances
De ceci, de cela, de l'argent que j'ai paumé en France
Chill a perdu 200 balles à Roissy
Et Steve a perdu la vie à 17 ans et demi

Depuis ce jour, le caprice dort dehors
Et j'ai promis d'éviter de chialer sur mon sort
Tout ce que j'ai dit, que je n'aurais jamais dû dire
Je le regrette car ma vie jusque-là n'a pas été la pire

Il y a des soirs où je suis si malheureux
J'ai réalisé être un petit con capricieux
Steve d'où tu es, je suis sûr que tu peux me voir
Ces mots sont à jamais pour ta mémoire

Je ne suis pas à plaindre

Il est arrivé la main tendue vers nous, moi
Je pensais qu'il voulait des sous.
Cette nuit-là à Marrakech je ne l'oublierai de sitôt,
Il demandait seulement un escargot.

Vois-tu le décalage de rêves qu'il y a entre nous enfin?
Le bonheur pour lui, pour moi est un rien
Ce sont des faits effrayants
Il était minuit, lui tout seul en haillons, il avait 4 ans

Je suis parti un nœud dans les entrailles
Mais lui heureux tout plein, les cheveux en bataille
Des images douloureuses alors sont revenues dans mon cœur
Que je voulais oublier à jamais

Comme cet enfant qui pleurait
Battu par son père qui semblait enragé
La ceinture dans une main, de l'autre il agrippait ses cheveux
Parce qu'il ne voulait pas faire des trucs avec les messieurs

Je revois la misère, ces gosses qui ne voient pas
La mort flotter sur les bidonvilles de Casa
Les dirhams que j'ai donnés pour une fleur
Et que ce petit a gardé, une heure sur son cœur

Moi, étant gamin, je partais faire des footings
Et grognait tous les jours pour un trou dans mon training
Une pièce de cuir, autre défaut dans mon château
Les semelles de mes Kickers et les lacets de mes Tobaccos

Je crisais quand mes amis sortaient
Des fois ma mère ne pouvait pas me donner assez
J'y repense aujourd'hui et le mal devient bon
A côté de ces enfants, nous sommes nés dans le coton

Je ne peux rien changer, je ne peux rien y faire
Les jours où j'ai flippé, j'aurais juste dû me taire

Je ne suis pas à plaindre",Je Ne Suis Pas à Plaindre,1999
Akhenaton,"A ceux qui m'appellent enculé
Je voulais dire que la première fois où ma main
A touchée un mic je voulais rire
J'avais 15 ans à peine, je crois
C'est drôle ce qu'un môme crois, un rêve
Une grosse croix sur ma vie plus tard
Voir se qu'on aime plein de soucis ça fait trop de peine
Et comme les peines ne viennent pas seuls
Dans le bus je revois ma tante visiter son fils
Purger une lourde peine, les camarades de classe
Le mercredi au catéchisme, l'église, la place
Mon frère et moi on fessait du vélo en face
La famille rouge, mon grand-père n'a jamais cru en Dieu
Peut être Dieu lui a volé ce qu'il aime

Le même jour lui laissant qu'une paire d'yeux
Perdu parmi les immigrés de Naples Et les environs du Vésuve
On se contait les vives violentes, des dards
On crucifiait comme Jésus, traumatisés
Visant bar tabac, visage découvert
P38 explose la tête visée, du sang te couvert
Moi, bouche bée, virage dans le passé
Ce jour là j'ai compris tout
En regardant les autres se conduire
Comme si c'était rien passé merde

Instinct d'voyage, se virer de là
Loin des histoires de jeunes assassinés
Le jour de leur mariage, c'est dingue putain
Si là je crache le venin, tas de rimes en pipe-line
Du freetime, au son de mon walkman je répétais half-time
Aux sœurs que j'ai traité mal, je m'excuse te sais
J'avais rien à offrir, sans amour
Juste un autre jour à souffrir rien de plus
Juste un autre jour à se faire chier, à mourir comme d'hab'
Mais là je fais pénitence cloîtré dans mon lab'

Je revois des potes d'avant et je parle des petits
Eux me parlent de Rolex, puis le silence
On regarde la montre, même si on se sépare
Disons qu'on reste collègues
Ex-frères de fête, la vérité
Aujourd'hui je crois qu'on a plus rien à se dire c'est bête
Adulte à 9 ans, j'ai fumé ma jeunesse
Là je nie, regretter cette perte
Je nie, mais je compte 7 ans de gâchis
Et tant bien que mal je me dresse
Le stress de moi s'emparant 
Sans guide, sans parents

Je me suis tellement effacé que j'en suis devenu transparent
Je voulais être comme eux
Draguer les minchs, craquer les francs devant
M'élevant, mes potes braquaient les riches
Sans sentiment, de naïf à méfiant
De méfiant à paranoïaque
La rue et la paraffine te rendent trop nerveux
Et l'estomac plein de Prozac
Avec les filles j'ai foiré aussi
Tu vois le problème à force de fréquenter les clebs
Tu crois que ces connes t'arnaquent ton pollen
Quand elles attendaient de moi un peu de passion
Je comprenais pas, y avait dans le magasin

Que stress et pression
A trainer là où les patates se perdent
On encaisse bouche close
Et la vision s'déforme en rêve
On s'engraisse, bouche rose, puis
On s'trouve où les ennuis sont
Démon s'amuse, Marseille la nuit
C'est comme avoir sa figure d'vant un anus
Quand ça arrive, ferme les yeux
Essaye d'rigoler, parce que le pognon
Te rends pas la santé qu'cette vie d'chien t'as volée
Parfois j'ai des nausées et des soirs ma poitrine se comprime
Ce qui faut comprendre ou prendre des comprimés

Faut croire que je déprime
Je te jure je flippe, comme j'ai flippé cette fois
Sauvé par l'avens ce putain de soir d'été
Où ils m'ont tirés dessus au Mac 10
Moi je veux vivre peinard mais je traîne
Ce vécu le boulet, et les barils plein de moulailla
Que j'ai vu, c'est pas en écrivant que je les ais trouvés
Ça c'est Chill, 30 ans, pas d'bluff, lyrics de dard
On clape, histoire vraie, action
Pas d'invention de fanfaron du rap
Famille dure, on vie devant des exemples durs
On a pas le choix sous les jets de pierres
J'ai porté cette 'zique c'est mon chemin de croix
Quand je tend la main franco

Je tend la main de bon cœur
Frère si je suis si gentil
C'est que j'ai vu trop de gars qui blissent
Blessent dans le cœur
Trop de gens qui portent
Le Mal Comme je t'apporte cette nouvelle
Je t'apporte mon cœur ouvert
Comme des faux frères t'apportent leurs poubelles en prose
Frimousse, des petits gars maigres solitaires
A l'origine solidaires, à goûter le miel
Trop de frères attrapent le ver solitaire",J'Voulais Dire,2000
Akhenaton,"C'que j'te livre, non, rien d'complexe, c'est juste mon texte c'est l'savon
Tu sais, j'ai trop d'scrupules et j'suis lucide sur mon état
Ce qu'ils nous ont laissé ? Espoir et fausses joies, on cessera
D'parler d'ça p'tet jamais ouais j'sais c'est noir
Demain c'est loin, j'l'ai dit ! Si j'le répète c'est mieux si j'foire
Ma vie j'm'en carre, mais j'foire aussi la vie des miens
Je n'vis mieux qu'depuis qu'j'écoute plus souvent l'avis des miens
Ravi d'un rien, parce qu'habitué à rien, j'ai vécu chichement
Chiche man, on s'tire d'ici, vivement c'jour, mais c'jour
N'est pas venu, j'ai passé 10 ans tristement
La rue a eu ton fils, pour oublier, j'fumais trop d'canabis man
Là au milieu des parrains, j'ai vu plus d'fric qu'dans Casino
Avec mes 20 balles au p'tit Casino,
J'ai vécu ma routine seulement dans l'fond
Quand mes potes vendaient la popo et par jour s'faisaient des milions
Le fric ? M'a jamais tourné la tronche, j'pensais p'tit, à fumer
A rimer, à boire mon ponch, à être raide,
Pour les heures qui suivaient, plus j'buvais plus ça passait
Et j'cuvais les mains sur la putain d'cuvette rivées
Et là j'songeais qu'les lech de la classe
Avaient p'tet raison que c'était moi le lâche
Puis on lâche ses études pour un prétexte bidon
Et on lâche son étude de la vie sur un premier texte bidon.

Et pour ça, j'vens mes rimes comme un savon
On sort des tripes tout c'qu'on vit et c'que nous savons
J'applique l'intelligence du turf dans mon giron
Y'a pas d'putes et pas d'place pour les caves que nous bravons
Et pour ça, j'vends mes rimes comme un savon
Lâche des bombes sur les vinyls que nous gravons
J'applique l'intelligence du turf dans mon sillon
C'est plein d'groupes ici c'n'est que du pur que nous vendons
Et pour ça, j'vens mes rimes comme un savon

Toutes ces années stériles, accroupi sur une rampe
Comptant les secondes s'évaporant dans les pertes
L'estomac en proie aux crampes, si violentes et les merdes tombent
Sur la route, tu sais plus si c'est l'doute, la faim ou le stress qui t'prend
Avec nos ganaches de craps à l'écran, j'suis fier d'pouvoir
Poser sur l'écrin avec cran, sans s'dire ma face
D'faits divers fait tâche à leur sens, c'qu'ils pensent, j'm'en secoue
Tant d'silences qui voulaient dire au secours, personne n'est venu grand,
J'me suis débrouillé seul
Sauf quand des potes mataient mon dos, si je m'embrouillais seul
Tu connais l'truc, les shlass et les clans
Belsunce 86, centre, dangereux d'squatter les bancs
Paroles fortes et conneries à 2Fr
On en trouvait tremblants par terre dans le hall
En train d'baigner dans leur sang. Frontière mince
Transparente, séparant les mecs biens, sincères, fiers, francs
Des embryons délinquants; des gens brillants, combien s'en sortent 
Combien regardent leur vie sous l'briquet, vont en soirée sous escorte
Ou s'comptent des histoires d'faits d'armes violents
On est loin des légends sur l'pays, qui plaisaient à nos parents
Ma rime je vends bleu, tout simplement à qui l'veut
Et des jours de grand beau temps au fond d'ces yeux, il pleut
Reluques la salive sur ma langue et mes dents
Apologie du précédent, timide, clos stress aidant
A égréner toutes ces minutes, c'est horrible j'veux pas l'revivre
J'me réfugie, derrière ce thème j'me livre. Il joue des notes couleur de
L'air du temps
J'pourrais jamais plus traîner comme avant, j'ai l'sentiment
Que j'perd du temps c'est idiot mais c'est comme ça qu'j'me sens
Evacuer le fiel par la plume, j'n'ai que ça dans l'sang

Et pour ça, j'vens mes rimes comme un savon
On sort des tripes tout c'qu'on vit et c'que nous savons
J'applique l'intelligence du turf dans mon giron
Y'a pas d'putes et pas d'place pour les caves que nous bravons
Et pour ça, j'vends mes rimes comme un savon
Lâche des bombes sur les vinyls que nous gravons
J'applique l'intelligence du turf dans mon sillon
C'est plein d'groupes ici c'n'est que du coeur que nous vendons
Et pour ça, j'vens mes rimes comme un savon

C'est comme ça il faut croire
C'est ce qui a été dessiné
Un mic ? C'est peut-être ce à quoi j'ai été destiné
Soit. Mais c'est un autre chapitre du livre de ma vie
Et c'est pour la postérité que je livre un autre plan de ma vie
Et quand je s'rais plus là, pour veux qui m'ont tenu la main
Et ceux qui l'ont lâchée, pour ceux qui firent mes joies
Et ceux qui l'ont gâchée, pour mes soleils et mes lunes

Reconnaissons que dans l'monde y'en a peu classe comme nous
Les ritals, j'viens d'la où parler avec les mains c'est vital
Où on te recoud le bras à la place d'une jambe à l’hôpital
J'viens d'là où le sourire s'affiche sans complexe
Où les relations avec la loi sont difficiles et complexes
D'là où les cités sont ennemies depuis des temps immémoriaux
Sans cesse aux mains d'colons venus d'Espagne
Du monde arabe ou d'France, du Royaume Normand
J'viens d'la où la terre ferme tremble en dormant
La où on s'pète un plat de penne all'arrabiata
Sur une terrasse au soleil relax avec des grosses Lozza
J'viens d'la où les maisons s'font et s'finissent pas
D'là où les équipes et les quartiers ne s'unissent pas
Où la majorité, s'acquiert dans la Strada
Où on rêve tous de luxe, de femmes qui claquent et de costumes Prada
D'là où y'a pleins d'gens honnêtes aussi
Des travailleurs qui s'lèvent, et des fous qui vivent des rêves, des dancings
Des boites de nuit qui jouent du
Des putains d'bandits qui jouent du
J'viens d'la où sur les murs, y'a les avis d'décès
D'la où Pipo plonge quand il joue les blessés
D'où les mecs préfèrent aux hommes, les animaux, seuls
Car très étrangement ils aiment tout ce qui ferme sa gueule

J'viens d'la ville où ""à peu près"" est synonyme de ""très bien""
Faut pas nous en vouloir, c'est un système mis en place de très loin
D'là où les filles sont belles et les frères jaloux
Mais comment dire une fois libres, elle s'laissent aller au
Quand elles sont seules, de là où
Viennent Alban et Romina, là où
Les mômes, défilent en ville avec 6 kilos d'gomina
Sur les scooters à 3, attention au sac à main
Ici l'rétroviseur fait office de glace de salle de bains
J'viens d'là où les blondes généreuses squattent la télé
Blondes, eh ouais, le complexe mon frère, la Méditerranée, tu sais
D'la où les cartouches de clopes sont bourrées d'sciure
D'la où on t'fait un Nike sur la figure
Où les paris clandestins embrasent un pâté entier d'maisons
Si bien que tu vois les chevaux, s'tirer la bourre dans la rue
La où les p'tites stars du foot tirent et courent dans la rue
Là où les p'tits caïds de 12 ans tirent et tuent dans la rue
J'viens d'la où les mères, lisent et disent l'avenir dans l'tarot
Où on adule le sang de San Gennaro,
Santa Lucia dis moi comment va l'Vésuve, et l'Isola Verde
Où gosse je m'baladais, et j'me perdais
Je viens d'là où les bougainvilliers sont immenses
L'porte-monnaie mince, mais où l'hospitalité est immense
Où les gens ont le sens du secret, c'est pas qu'ils s'terrent
Mais ils savent qu'si on a rien d'bon à dire alors vaut mieux s'taire

Sales samedi soirs, éveché
La rue m'a rapporté qu' des déchets, fourbe, à la longue, elle m'a ébréché
Taxé de vandales dans les rayons d'CD, ici les techniciens
On vient tout réparer paraît qu'le lynicisme est décédé place à la variété

J'donne du temps au cahier, comme ma mère, le faisant, à la CGT

Une pensée, pour les MC's qui m'ont précédé
Aucune gratitude, pour ceux qui l'voient, comme un CDD
C'est réglé, début vinyl, maintenant DVD
Toujours la même force, excité, comme un mec sous PCP
Vrai, sans imaginaires démêlés, y'a personne qu'je hais
J'veux être juste au dessus de la mêlée
Sans s'dire avoir le train d'vie fastueux d'un gros PDG
J'veux ma part d'rêve et qu'autour des miens, l'ai soit léger

Le cœur de la ville s'enflamme quand le son entre en jeu
Les préoccupations des frères s'infiltrent dans ton Walkman
L'argent, la boisson, la fumée et les femmes

Je nagerais avec les femmes et un micro dans une piscine
Si j'avais l'occasion de partir loin des vermines
L'hésitation ne se ferait pas, c'est certain
Mes poches sont vides et j'ai faim de pognon et d'un bon destin

J'extirpe ces quelques mots, un stylo de mon paletot
Sorti un jour du caniveau, je roule dans les casinos
Ouais, je fais le zguègue en espadrilles, mais j'assure quand même
Quoi qu'il arrive, car Fonky est la Famille

Autant parler des mains que la bouche chez nous n'est pas louche
Méditerranéen de souche, mes styles font mouche
Au milieu d'embrouilles ou de mauvais coups
Je crame tous les tintanos qui nous cherchent des poux

Dans la nuit, un MC check check le mic
Taquiner la rime et le beat est mon véritable hobby
Envoyer des styles pour tous les frères qui nique la halla
Pour la première fois, le refrain commence comme ça

Tranquille au bar et popo dans le pétard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
Porche sombre et gadjos dans les couloirs
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
T'as garé ta voiture ici trop tard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille!)
Tranquille au bar et popo dans le pétard
(Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys!)

Pendant que tu fais un flop, que tu tapes un magnétoscope
Don Choa calcine les rimes comme une clope en garde à vue
Le hip-hop au top descend le long de la rue
Et se saisit du showbiz à son insu

Accepte le son, qui touche de près mes entrailles
Au bercail, ma fonction est le travail
Je me comporte en canaille
Aïe! Les mauvais garçons se collent comme des moucherons
Aux jupons, frappent sans hésiter pour le pognon

Comme les apaches guinchent ton scalp
Ton fric est la proie, des hordes de chiens des Alpes en veulent à tes Delacroix
Mais pas moi, je suis droit, respecte les autres et crois
Au pouvoir de la rime dans la destruction des hazas

L'été, les quartiers, postes dans le bus
Que demander de plus, fusse le funk ou des Vénus?
Gus, soi-disant ma ville pue en plus
Dieu t'a-t-il fait avec un anus au lieu des sinus?

Simple dans ma façon de faire mon sang est rouge clair
Pourtant, j'ai la peau noire et fier de l'avoir
Je cours à la gloire des quartiers avec mes idées
Le produit, sera toujours enragé

Tranquille au bar et popo dans le pétard

J'en ai marre de les voir flipper
Y'a pas que le mauvais côté
Le Rat te le dira, ""la vie est faite pour s'amuser""
Capte le concept des mecs qui s'en battent les couilles
Le bon délire est là, t'inquiète on se débrouille

Mes pensées drivent coolo, coolo
Voilà quelques mots
Pour l'avenir incertain de mes potos
Qui ont quitté les cours tôt
La rage est dans mon âme pour le drame du Front National
J'allume la flamme, la flamme

Fils, comprends ce que tu peux comprendre
Un bon conseil, prétends à ce que tu peux prétendre
Réfléchis un instant avant de faire un pas, tu saisiras
Pourquoi on te lèvera où que tu sois

Avant, je combattais contre des moulins à vent
Maintenant, je fais vibrer les salles et le public en rappant
Satir au soleil, zique à l'oreille
Signe une carte de visite live de Marseille

La balle de ping-pong d'Ali Kong tape
De Marseille à Naples, pour le rap, je capte les étapes
Et cap vers le possee qui me suit
J'en suis reconnaissant

Quand j’allais éclater deux fils de pute avec un parpaing
Jamais violent, toujours sur mes gardes, j’ai fait du mal par mégarde
Rejeton du Belsunce Breakdown
Ma mère est née en bas, 17 rue Sainte Barbe et donc
Trente ans après mes premiers raps près de la rue Longue
L’impression qu’m’a laissée l’adolescence, une perte de temps
Avec des cernes de sang, j’voulais qu’on soit fiers de quand
J’monterais sur scène avec des projets plein les pognes
Mais merde! J’suis resté trop longtemps dans les secteurs où ça cogne
Dans l’équipe, on a tous l’air équilibré
Mais chacun porte ses merdes, jusqu’à ce qu’la mort vienne nous délivrer
La gamberge pousse à la surface les actifs
J’avais du mal à respirer, sous sédatif ils m’ont placé
Puis l’élixir parégorique m’a cassé
J’ai fait ""Sol invictus"" en dépression, le moral fracassé
Me voilà d’retour, les crasses sous serrures à deux tours
Les basses? C’est c’que la sève de mon hip hop a de lourd
J’sais pas où j’vais mais rappe jusqu’à pas d’heure
J’suis comme James Dean, sur l’asphalte, au volant de sa Spider
J’défoncerai leur barrage, j’sais pas où j’me situe
La vérité ils l’ont fouettée si fort qu’elle ne crie plus
J’m’attends pas à c’qu’elle débarque toute grimée
Des MC comme Faf sont des mecs si sous-estimés
J’aime le rap comme un lycéen kiffe son premier amour
Mais tant d’Chippendales lui ont fait la cour
Que j’ai du m’battre pour démontrer par A + B
Que c’rap gonflette ne vaut rien face aux types scarifiés
J’trace ma route avec ce poids sur mes épaules
Sans jamais ressasser le succès passé de l’école

Opposant les troyens de la variété aux spartiates
Valeureux guerriers du sens
Ayant comme seules arme la puissance de leurs sons et leurs âmes
La ferveur et la violence de ces affrontements
Donnent la sève de ce glorieux récit
À l'heure où celui-ci vous est conté
Les spartiates débarquent sur la plage

J'ai pris l'champion de ton crew, il a rejoint l'aut' rive
Traîné sous les murs de Troie, attaché derrière un chariot de rimes
Le soir venu, c'est dans la douleur
Qu'tes frères dans mon camp m'ont réclamé, Achill 
Je t'en prie rend-nous le, soit
Ils ont séquestré l'verbe
Mais jamais j'arrêterai l'combat
Jusqu'à ce que ces imposteurs se la ferment, le sort les condamne
Ils voient v'nir la charge des Myrmidons
Dressés pour écraser et cravacher les pires bidons
Ô verbe, regarde l'horizon, la mer est couverte
On vient pour t'sortir hors de ta prison
Retourner là où les versets sont allègres
Mais avant beaucoup tomberont sous la catapulte et l'arbalète
Tour d'Ivoire, geôle aux mille pierres, assise de l'illusion
Où les paillettes brillent
Où les fils de nos rimes étrillent à profusion, les rangs s'étiolent

Y a les fauves et y a les proies
Les vifs restent droits, les autres cloués sur des croix

La plage a été prise
Et la terreur s'est répandue au sein des cœurs troyens dépéris
La colère et la masse de guerriers spartiates ne cessaient de grandir
Le vent de la liberté soufflait dans la geôle du verbe

Entends-tu la complainte du vaillant qui mord la poussière?
Qui meurt pour une cause noble, pauvre, loin de ses terres
Chute pour le bien l'plus précieux d'l'homme
Des sombres récits décorent mon coffre, où j'élabore mon code
Mon art d'vivre avec des rêves plein les poches, le chemin emprunté
Nous force à embrasser bien trop souvent le front des proches
Les lanternes qu'on décroche
N'éclairent qu'peu nos voies, alors, tenez-vous prêts la fronde est proche
Drame dans la plaine, casque, armure noire pour la peine
C'est ma mémoire, faut-il vraiment boire pour la perdre?
Si d'Aventure, tu guerroyais sur ces pistes
Le dernier flash de ta vie serait celui d'Achill le guerrier triste
Ô troyens, je vous en conjure, rendez-nous les mots, rendez-nous les songes
Rendez-nous les jours, les nuits passées calame à la main
Écrits en majuscules, récitant à voix haute, tous mes poèmes du crépuscule
Mars coule dans nos veines, et rien n'pourra changer ça

Akhenaton,"Sentir les portes se refermer devant soi et se dire
Mon instinct s’est évanoui, il ne reviendra pas c’est fou
J’ai eu ma deuxième chance en même temps
L’attente a été longue, très longue et stressante
J’ai brûlé mes plus belles années comme ça, mais bon me voilà

Quand j’ai vu passer le premier train
De ma life, sous mes yeux, j’ai réalisé, il était déjà loin
J’entends encore la loco' qui sonne
Il s’est évanoui à l’horizon, évaporé avec tous mes diplômes
J’avais déjà du mal à assumer l’appart’
Et les courses, j’aurais bien eu besoin d’une autre carte
Chance ou hasard, un coup de pouce, pas d’épaule
Que ma souris et moi on puisse quitter ce trou à rats
S’entraîner avec nous, trop de regrets dans les pommes
Tout le monde souhaiterait voir refaire les traits
Que la destinée a dessiné, décidé à changer
On attend la deuxième chance comme la pluie au Sahel
Les jours nous semblent n'être qu’un funeste manège
Pourtant la vie n’est pas un tribunal
Tout effacer ne serait pas plus mal
J’ai les souvenirs qui s’animent au fond de mes yeux
Quand la nuit me dit que ça n’ira jamais mieux
Les mains s’ouvrent et se tournent vers les cieux
Moi aussi j’ai été enfant, j’ai pleuré et j’ai ris
Quand la malchance a dessiné une drôle de série
L’air s’est raréfié, j’en ai pris une goulée
Et me suis débattu dans tous les sens pour ne pas couler
Irascible, caractère inégal, normal
Si on sombre dans la parano de l’illégal
Les jours se ressemblent, y’a rien qui dépasse
Les emmerdes sont de briques, y’a rien qui les cassent
Et on fredonne ces mots « Y’a rien qui les effacent »

La belle vie me doit une prochaine danse
Aller ailleurs pour que mon air change
Que je souris, que ma colère flanche
Mon dieu (mon dieu) j’aimerais bien avoir ma deuxième chance

A tous mes soss’ qui ont tenu ces murs
A mes côtés, impassibles, vigilants, quand l'hiver était dur
Cette ville nous appartient plus qu'à tous ces richards
Tous ces aigris et ces vieux pleurnichards
Les rues portent leurs noms, les briques portent les nôtres
Rien à battre des hipsters et ces lieux qu'ont la côte
J'étais là où il en faut pour rester en vie
Équipe de France bitumeuse, brille les yeux dans le gris
Le temps a fait que mes genoux plient
En pleine forêt d'ennui j'ai du creuser ma place, facile
Élu domicile dans l'arbre qui les cache
En attendant le second train, le soleil a tapé
Si fort, qu'on pour ne pas crever, j'ai tracé à pieds
Glissé une cassette dans mon baladeur Jurassique
Vers d'autres horizons, le mien était si dur à vivre
Nan, je n'ai jamais blâmé Dieu pour ça
Toute cette merde sous mes yeux, elle était bien à moi
Comme un grand, j'ai passé l'éponge
Je peux le dire maintenant, la gamberge ronge
Rage au cœur, croiser le fer avec ses démons dans les songes
Personne ne tient ta main quand de si haut ton corps plonge
La fidélité elle te crache à la face
Pour deux billets ou quelques sapes, pour rester à la page
C'est vrai, je n'avais que peu d'options
Et cette corde où je marchais menait droit à l’extrême onction
Même si tous croyaient que la pièce était jouée
Moi de mon côté, j'me surprenais à chanter

La belle vie me doit une prochaine danse
Aller ailleurs pour que mon air change
Que je souris, que ma colère flanche

Salves de vinyles gravés d'un rap orthodoxe
Viendra le jour où grogneront leurs toc aux portes

La vanité m’a appris qu’un temps je me suis égaré
Quand vicieusement de mon cœur elle s’est emparée
Puis je l’ai sortie de mes tripes dans un intervalle douloureux
Malheureusement des frères en sont encore habités
Paranoïaques ils prennent tout pour eux, même les petits coups pour rire
Putain d’écho monstrueux qui en fait des gâteaux pourris
On se croit au top, coupé, habits ridicules

Alors on revoit les ambitions à la baisse
Faut pas y voir le mal si jamais les mains retournent à la Grèce
Loin des embrouilles de la basse-cour
Le principal est donner, recevoir de l’amour, ainsi
L’amour m’a appris que tout est fleur fragile
Il meurt et fait place à la peur, panique
Peur d’être haïe ou peur d’être seul
Et les draps de l’étreinte deviennent un linceul
La rose est délicate quand on l’enserre ou on l’enferme
En étouffant son paradis on bâtit son propre enfer
En fait, c’est se conjuguer au pluriel
Et se donner corps et âme jusqu’à qu’il ne reste plus rien
L’hypocrisie m’a appris à être méfiant
Et livrer ma confiance à bonne escient
Y’a rien à attendre de ceux qui boivent des larmes à plein pôle

L’honneur m’a appris que peu importe la situation
Faut rester droit en toute occasion même si il n’y a pas d’option d’évasion
Revanche contenue avec une mémoire d’éléphant
Laisser passer le temps et la furie des éléments
Transparent aux yeux des puissants en moquettz
L’exhaler un souffle ultime, appuyer sur un bokken
Ainsi quand vient l’heure de l’appel
Beaucoup perdent valeurs et aplombs lorsque approchent les ailes de Raphaël
Je n’ai rien à vendre à part mes notes
Mes poésies où je dépeins la vie des nôtres
Chez nous on ne tire pas à la ras’, baille à l’hôpital
On définit le destin par ces putains de nuits de mistral
Libre, la liberté m’a appris que tout se fane
Et qu’on doit se battre pour, c’est un luxe qui se gagne
Maintenant les boites où les parents bossaient délocalisent
Et les députés hypocrites viennent y pousser leurs vocalisent
Lancent la chasse aux votants
Excitent le patriotisme en chantant la marseillaise d’une voix chevrotante
Liberté? Nah! Ce n’est qu’un Ersatz
Ce n’est qu’un vaste poulailler fliqué par la Wehrmacht
Où tout le monde juge ou condamne
Devient le geôlier de l’autre, mon pays se trompe de combat
Sale hypocrite, être libre c’est d’aimer
Puisse l’honneur nous garder de sombrer dans la vanité

Y a cette force dans les poings quand on les dresse en l'air
Fier quand nos classic shit parcourent la Terre entière

Et on compte nos histoires peu ordinaires de panthère en verre
J'aime ma life, j'aime la musique aussi
Pour le succès on verra bien fils, y'a pas de croquis
La louve du rap nous a nourris, on lui a pris le sein

Tu l'sais ce sera bien fait, bien fait
Mais pour agiter les troupes, bien sûr éveiller les foules
Tu l'sais ce sera bien frais, bien frais

Il est posé dans un fauteuil en osier comme (?) et Newton
Pompe dans la main, le canon ne crache pas la gomme
Mais l'acier trempé du wakizashi qui taille l'album
Comme d'hab' le son est brut, dur, brutal
Rien n'change, ils remettent nos souhaits à plus tard
Pour ça on se crée un univers de rêves parallèles
Nous les enfants dont les mères lavaient les fesses au paraben
Laisse tomber, mieux vaut penser aux bonnes choses
Tu peux chopper c'track en vinyle dans les bons shops

I’m alive and well
I can feel the inner chi
Through the rays of the sun
Shinning down upon me
And even though it pours when i trains
I know that won’t stop me
I gotta fight through the pain
To make a better me

Quel torrent fougueux est ma vie
Je les chevauche avec passion jusqu'au seuil de la nuit
Les cubes m’entraînent au pays où la terre fume petite mort
Emmène-moi auprès de ceux que j’ai perdus
Je t’en prie ne souffle aucune amertumes
L’univers a ses règles, un jour elles nous percutent
46 printemps le cœur plein de rustines
Je m’étais gouré de monde car j’y cherchais la justice
Y’en a pas alors dans la rue m’assure le 
Colt con t’façon on verra bien qui est le plus speed
Faut bien le dire, la plume reste muette
La feuille immaculée lassée par les duels
Quelle importance si la renommée s’étend sur les lèvres?
On pense être fort quand bout le sang dans les veines
Et puis le temps aidant, la lumière change de spectre
La violence est bien l’arme du méchant et du faible
Laisse-moi voir la route, la vie écraser leur régime
Encore plus de 10.000 roses, courber leurs échines
Les flèches rouges du soleil dard te déciment
Frappé en plein cœur, l’une d’elle embrase mes rimes

J’ai été élevé à la dure par les rues de cette ville
Pour réussir y’avait la queue, j’ai grugé cette file
Arrive un âge où on perd le sommeil
Et les souffrances ne sont pas compensées par le soleil
Parce qu’on le regarde comme si il nous devait tout
A force de se mettre au centre, on ne sent plus la terre tourner
Et elle boit doucement sous les coups
Combien d’âmes arrachées en une seule journée?
J’ai appris à contempler la nature
Et ma joie ne se mesure pas à la facture
Entre deux univers depuis c’est la fracture
Comme ces condés qui nous matent comme des singes de la voiture
J’ai mis mon cœur à nu dans les courbes des lettres
J’espère que de là-haut mon père approuve mes gestes
Comme rendre grâce pour ce jour, c’est le minimum
Ta vie est mieux gaulée, elle a ses deux nibards en silicone
La paix n’a pas de prix, la foi n’a pas de maître
Accepter que tout meurt est dur à admettre
Que cet arbre sera la caressé par la brise
Le jour où la terre aura effacé ton sourire
Mon œil court sur l’eau qui tourbillonne
Et les cieux à l’horizon s’habillent en vermillon
Les hirondelles volent sur la citadelle
La ville s’éveille, au loin une voix délivre son appel
Je suis en vie

Je me revois main dans la main avec ma mère dans les manifs
Les piquets de grève, les camarades syndicalistes
Avec les étudiants qui brodent des ""Peace and Love"" sur le futal
Pour que cesse la guerre du Vietnam
Les gens se battaient pour les autres, cause commune
Depuis les idéaux sont morts, fosse commune
Aux antipodes de la pleinitude
Comment ralier le peuple, si on incendie ses véhicules
La confiance mutuelle maigri
Pour ce pays le qualificatif, aigri
Cette amertume se lit dans les forums
Où tout les sujets ont le clash pour des chorums
Où on jette de grandes phrases sans instructions
Répondant seulement à la culture de la destruction

Crucifié parce que différend

On fuit les sujets qui dérangent
Vraiment, en poids sur les postiches
Et l'illusion débouche sur une révolution en plastique
Les fachos sont deguisés en démocrates
Les criminels en hommes pieux, théocrates
Marche dans le rang, tes consoeurs te regardent
Sans limite, la haine et la jalousie les gagnent
Nos dirigeants n'ont pas compris que le mal est mondial
Quand depuis 15 ans les extrêmes ont colonisés la toile
Auto-flicage, bactéries qui se dédoublent
Tout les tubes uniformisent les coups
Et nous au milieu de tout ça
On a pas d'horizon comme un jeune de 20 ans à Gaza
Dans ce cas le silence est utile
Quand les dés passent dans les mains des ignorants debiles

Ici la lassitude tue plus que l’arme à feu
Les constructions en vrac s'apparentent à l'affreux
Elles sont le fruit de tous ces blazes qu’on a élus
Du bouillonnement d’idées qui chute, s’atténue, disparaît dans l’indifférence totale
Au mépris des lois et de la morale
Partie au beau milieu de leur devoir d’histoire redessiné à leur goût
Je ne peux pas les voir tant que l’or noir pend à leur cou
Pourquoi parler au pluriel? Tous n’en n’ont rien à foutre
Les haineux s’agenouillent à la hauteur de leurs idées courtes
Invoquant Dieu pour souhaiter le mal aux autres
Faut pas s’étonner si c’est le Diable qui vient et toque à la porte
On cherche des ""oui mais"" voici l’argent de la drogue
C’est l’argent de nos votes et peu importe la cause
Pour s’échapper loin du royaume des rêves déçus

Ils n’éduquent pas nos enfants, ils les déprécient
Au lieu de leur jeter une corde si ils se noient
Ils préfèrent passer une corde autour des branches de Magnolia

Si violent fut l'ennui, que vint l'envie de lire
Même quand les jours furent durs, furieuse envie de rire
Ecrire, assis à table, là où tout semble si stable
Qu'on en oublie de songer au pire
Les fables furent des havres dans mes étapes
Des orages d'amour qui éclatent dans mes étals
Puis vint la nuit à tous les étages
Mon père est parti nous aimer depuis les étoiles
Je n'ai pas su vivre, j'étais occupé à mourir
Souffler, voir le monde, je pensais trop à courir
Tourne la manivelle de cette boîte à musique
Parfois j'envie l'état de grâce de qui n'est pas lucide
Tout plier et panser les plaies, voilà qui est sage
Car je survivrai pas à leurs cages, mon âme, un quetzal
Jeter ces mots au mistral fera l'affaire
J'aurai l'impression qu'ils font le tour de la Terre

Où les petits s'retrouvent, en dépit de tout, dans les comicos

Chacun dans son coin, lendemain solitaire
Au lieu de bonnes mines, tous préfèrent avoir une mine aurifère
Ils vendent leurs âmes par tous les orifices
Ça paraît clair, si tu songes au contraire, je t'assures t'es minoritaire
Trop lisses pour la presse bourge de gauche
Qui aiment le bad boy tant qu'il rackette pas ses gosses
Célèbrent des chanteurs maudits et leurs compiles post-mortem
Au pied de l'hôtel du hip-hop, je dépose leurs têtes

Je joue ma vie comme au stand-up
Technique rodée sur les planches d'une salle miteuse
Je me sens comme un musicien de jazz
Années 30 à Harlem, partition solo, Sooo Bad

""Monsieur l'agent, n'hurlez pas au crime, je fais du rap""
Si la baignoire est remplie d'encre noire, appelez-moi Marat
Nos buts, tous peints de gris, on le sait bien
Voilà pourquoi nos couplets font sept fois la taille des refrains
Si on dit qu'on va découper, ce n'est pas vos rideaux, vos cadenas
Mais tous ces mots qui vont buter nos karmas
Ball-Trap comme à la kermesse, des gâchis nazes de l'orchestre
On leur colle une renaissance pour booster le bas de leurs caisses
C'est le son du futur, rien à foutre si ta ritournelle fut tube
Story-telling pur, dur, gaze, compresses et sutures
Je parle pour les miens, ignore les ânes bâtés
Avec cette impression amère d'être ce maire d'une capitale ratée
Le cœur forgé dans l'amour, transpercé de la force
Samouraï de vert élégant, vêtu de la mort
La voix du mic' m'a hissée hors du gâchis
Mon sillage d'haineux gisant sans vie #Musashi
Et les soirs, lorsque l'orage déchire le paysage
On peut lire la méfiance et la peur sur les visages
Si on n'sait plus rêver on s'comporte comme un sale gosse de maître
On la joue rebelle, mais avec des gosses de merde
Si ça nous mène là où certains nous dénient
Défiler main dans la main avec le pire des ennemis
En ces temps troublés, où l'ambiance tendue, est attendue
Je préfère toujours la main tendue, au bras tendu

Je joue ma vie comme au stand-up
Technique rodée sur les planches d'une salle miteuse
Je me sens comme un musicien de jazz

Akhenaton,"Si tu regardes dans le miroir, ne sois pas sévère
Cherche dans les tiroirs ce qui sublime ses lèvres
Dis rien du style ""j'traîne pas avec ces laides
J'suis trop bien pour elle et moi j'vais être célèbre""
Allez viens faire un tour dans l'monde
Y a tant de choses à voir, loin des phares, des couv' de la mode
Loin de ces clichés qui racontent que t'es con si t'es blonde et moche si t'es noir
Y a une vie, ce n'est pas la télé
Ce n'est pas à 16 ans qu'on accouche et qu'on pleure à maman pour garder l'bébé
Indépendante, tu sais ce que c'est
Ta life c'est la tienne et pas un mec ne va la guider
J'ai cette angoisse, c'est la crise, l'ère du temps a comme solution
Le striptease, quel sublime avenir
Puis c'est si loin de tes desseins
T'es pas une fille de la nuit qui porte un blaze américain
Vois celui qui va te ravir, ne laisse personne te dire ""ce gars-là sera l'amour de ta vie""
Le fric ne protège pas de l'insipide
Un mec c'est un mec et un mec c'est pas une Infinite
Si tu t'promènes en ville, ne cache pas ces beaux cheveux
Pour que ces petits branleurs te laissent tranquille
Comme disait le poète en somme
""Sois femme ma fille car la femme est l'avenir de l'homme""

Souris encore, n'aies crainte, aussi forte que l'amour que j'te porte
Regarde-moi avec des yeux d'biche
Reste loin d'eux, leur haine est si grande
Car les femmes leurs font peur, du coup ils les appellent bitch
Reste auprès de moi une journée
Album photo, cette page non j'veux pas la tourner
Souris encore, Dieu que t'es belle
Il a sûrement dû oublier tes ailes

Souris-moi encore
Non ne change pas
Reste auprès de moi

Je t'en prie, ne m'fais pas la tête quand j'dis ""Ne sors pas s'te-plaît""
Il va pas s'envoler, je sais, ce petit gars te plaît
On veut respirer à ton âge
Tu es ma lune douce sûrement pas un oiseau en cage
Mais j'dois t'protéger, t'éviter les coups
C'est pour ça que certains jours j'ai l'air si relou
Alors tu dis que j'ai pas l'auréole, t'as raison
Mais je m'en fous d'avoir le mauvais rôle
Hey le petit copain, quoi d'neuf?
Je vais te faire une entrevue style Jack Byrnes
C'que tu gagnes? Peu importe, sois correct
Pas d'bluff, pas d'bol la famille est nombreuse
Tu vas oublier pétard et Gin Fizz
Et passer vite de bad boy à militant de Green Peace
Inutile de la couvrir de cadeaux
Emmène-la voir combien le monde est beau
C'est important qu'on discute
On perd tant de temps dans les petites disputes
Ma fille garde raison, croque cette vie
Comme une pomme de saison
Tu seras toujours prêt où le vent te porte
J'espère que t'auras une petite place pour ton vieux père dans ton appart à New-York
Comme disait le poète en somme
""Sois femme ma fille car la femme est l'avenir de l'homme""

Akhenaton,"T'es comme une bougie qu'on a oublié d'éteindre dans une chambre vide
Un trou dans mon histoire, un flou dans ma mémoire
T'es comme une bougie qu'on a oublié d'éteindre dans une chambre vide
Je viens d'un peu partout, c'est chez vous que je suis tombé
T'es comme une bougie qu'on a oublié d'éteindre dans une chambre vide
Demain recule encore, c'est l'inconnu
T'es comme une bougie qu'on a oublié d'éteindre dans une chambre vide

Alors que tu pensais que tout était figé
Qu'avec la montre aussi, on pouvait tricher
Que seul les idiots coulent et touchent le fond
La vie t'a infligé de bien tristes leçons
La fortune comme l'eau, entre les doigts elle glisse
Elle revient, elle brille, elle s'éteint, elle file
Mes souvenirs au fond des yeux posés
Jusqu'à la fin on ne pourra m'les voler

Un matin de juillet d'un coup le ciel s'est assombri
Les collines alentours dévorées par l'incendie
Les pompiers m'ont dit ""sors, la maison est menacée""
Je n'ai rien pris à part les photos dans mon sac entassées
Ton sourire sur le parvis à la mairie
Sur la plage aux Lecques avec notre petit à Carry
Ma lune habillée en princesse du Pendjab
Et l'blond que j'ai filmé excité en tenue d'ninja
C'est mon trésor gardé dans le plus sûr des coffres
Il s'ouvre quand j'me perds dans mes yeux qui décollent
J'y mets des images depuis mes premiers jours d'école
Et les flèches intactes ou brisées que Cupidon décoche
Si tu emportes la voiture, le toit et les bijoux
Ce sera dur mais je me dirais que c'est le sort qui joue
Que tu viens pour délester, l'inné de l'acquis
Pour qu'une fois encore je médite la vanité de la vie
Que mes yeux fassent la part entre utile et futile
Pris dans le tourbillon, parfois la diff' est subtile
Quand on a la chance et qu'un grand soupir
C'est comme garder la grenade pour balancer la goupille
Trop d'honneur pour s'abaisser à faire les poches
Voyou fini par rimer avec pelle et pioche
Belle et moche : mon histoire oscille entre les deux
Un jour il a fallu que j'me décide entre mes jeux

Alors que tu pensais que tout était figé
Qu'avec la montre aussi, on pouvait tricher
Que seul les idiots coulent et touchent le fond
La vie t'a infligé de bien tristes leçons
La fortune comme l'eau, entre les doigts elle glisse
Elle revient, elle brille, elle s'éteint, elle file
Mes souvenirs au fond des yeux posés
Jusqu'à la fin on ne pourra m'les voler

Je suis le fils de l'homme qui nous a tant aimé
Perdu devant l’avenir, mutilé par mes heures perdues
Quand la colère et les noires pensées me percutent
Y’a que mon (?) qui sépare ton corps des perfus
Dans le creuset beaucoup jalousent la réussite
Pour dire le mal sur l’autre là ils se réunissent
Nombre demeurent où les armes à feu nous pressurisent
Rares sont les jours où les condés les élucident
Mon métier m’a fait croiser des chiens et des lions
Comme partout j’y ai vu des gars bien et des cons
Ceux qui piétinent tout pour les biens et les ronds
Dans la rue c’est tordu, donneraient les adresses et les noms
Tu peux me prendre mon larfeuille avec un glock petit
Armer ton courage et faire ce que la coke te dit
Mettre sur pieds la pire équipe qui puisse te suivre
Mec tu n’saurais braquer mon échoppe de souvenirs, le rap
J’en suis une allégorie, des placards trop p’tits
Moi j’plane hors catégorie
Pendant qu’ignorance et oppression font terrorisme
J’dors prés de la paix, là où mènent mes hiéroglyphes
Produit d’une époque où rien autour n’était carré
Où ça faisait ""po po po po"" dans les soirées
Les anciens pensaient qu’on était mal barrés
Tous évoquent le métro et sa bande de sacrés enfoirés

Alors que tu pensais que tout était figé
Qu'avec la montre aussi, on pouvait tricher
Que seul les idiots coulent et touchent le fond

Après avoir sorti les abrutis du cockpit
Rien à foutre d'briller ou aller vite, on nous voit pas venir
Propulsion électromagnétique
Pas de jojo, rien que des canevas
Peu de bla-bla, style de gars lambda
Aux balances et aux ennemis on a su résister
Si fort que pour les schmitts même on n’a jamais existé
Les gamins friands de gloire et de renommée

Ces embrouilles qui démarrent pour un dislike ou un clic
Les Facebook et les tweets deviennent le prolongement normal de leurs bites
Ils en finissent suspendus au retour de l’écho
L’abonnement à la box pour tremplin de l'égo
Se montrer, être suivi ou encore faire du chiffre
Profils de bandits sans poings, avec rien que des griffes
Des gens tous pourris, pour exister s’créent des beef
Et s’réfugient chez les flics en pleurant si s'abattent les gifles
Match aller-retour comme dans les play-offs
Les gens deviennent fous comme si ils avaient bu du peyotl
Pour faire vrai ça met la schnouff dans le rayon
Ils veulent manœuvrer sombre avec sur la face un néon
Et quand la BAC frappe et les bracelets clipsent

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.

I'm steady tryin' find a motive, 
Why do what i do?, 
Freedom ain't gettin' no closer, 
No matter how far i go, 
My car is stolen, no registration, 
Cops patrolin', and now they done stop me, 
And i get locked up,

I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things I have done
And things that have not occurred yet
And the things they don't want to take responsibility for

I'm sorry for the times I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know

That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I am in the streets like everyday
Sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

I understand that there are some problems
And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me

And all the times you didn't know what to do
Sorry that you had to go and sell those packs
Just trying to stay busy till you heard from Dad
And you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though Pops treated us like kids

He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away

For the embarrassment that she felt

Her daddy should never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a twenty one and older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you

So when I strike, man
You'll think you been struck by lightning
Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga
Even a child could take a life by pullin' the trigga
Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion
So you target in the distance and keep on blastin'
They say guns don't kill people, people do
So when you're hit, man
You feel that shit the evils do
Can't see myself get beat down
My eyes swollen
Mom's cryin', they don't know what happened
My pride's stolen
If I ain't got my heat, then I got a blade
That hit ya off

Keep my eye out for jakes
Ears to the streets
Other eye out for snakes
And these scandalous freaks
If we ain't on good terms
Don't bother to speak
Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me
Same thing'll make ya laugh will make ya cry
And while this nigga quiet nigga, he'll take ya life
Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice
If somebody else could travel
Through the tunnel of life
'Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there
When you're ridin'
But I'll stay to myself

With a bear we fightin'

Also known to have no business with no beefin' on me

No exceptions to ya neither, homey
Ya know I got that African connection
Locked up in a facility correction

Diamond studded VVS
No less
Kunta Kinte bracelet
Lit up the whole set

Believe it's no sweat

I give you that credibility for the right check

Akiko,"As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things I have done
And things that have not occurred yet
And the things they don't want to take responsibility for

I'm sorry for the times I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect

I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I am in the streets like everyday
Sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

I understand that there are some problems
And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

Sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
Sorry that you had to go and sell those packs
Just trying to stay busy till you heard from Dad
And you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though Pops treated us like kids

He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away

I understand that there are some problems
And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

You can put the blame on me

Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry that it took so long to see
They were dead wrong trying to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl trying to have fun
Her daddy should never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a twenty one and older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you

Even though it might get a little difficult
Always remember, girl, that we're inseparable

It don't make any difference to me
(One love, one love, one love)
What the world thinks about us, baby
(Yup, one love, one love, one love)
Cause in my heart I will always believe
(Yup, one love, one love, one love)

That we were meant for each other
Love ain't got no color
It don't make any difference to me, yeah

It don't make any difference to me
(One love, one love, one love)
What the world thinks about us, baby
(Yup, one love, one love, one love)
Cause in my heart I will always believe
(Yup, one love, one love, one love)

That we were meant for each other
Love ain't got no color
It don't make any difference to me
Yeah, what they see

We love them black, we love them white, we love them Asian
Caribbean, the African, the Latin woman
The European, Middle Easterns and the Indian
This one goes out to all the girls around the nations

Akil Dasan,"Kevin Michael, Lupe Fiasco
Hey, little girl, don't cry, dry your eyes
I wrote this song for you
Now, it goes down

Can you imagine every world?
Every boy and every girl
They'd all get the same things
They'd all get the same things

A little dough, a lot of love
With a mom and dad to hug
They'd all get the same things

Huh, but down here the world is real
And it don't matter how you feel
Because, we don't get the same things
We don't get the same things

You got to work to stay alive
Forty hours, from 9 to 5
We don't get the same things

All my gangster friends, yeah
And all my skater friends
(What they want?)
We all want the same thing
(What we want, now?)
We all want the same thing, yeah

DJ's in the clubs, Jesus, freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, now

And, I think about the way
All the politicians say
(What they saying, now?)
Say they want to change things
Say they want to change things

But every year, they take some more
And I don't know what it's for
Though, they never change things
(They don't change nothing)

But, if you want to make it stop, stop
Well, first, you got to start
Making some big, old changes
Doing some different things, yeah

Get up out your bed, think outside your head
And you won't get the same things
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, now

All my gangster friends
And all my skater friends
(What they want, now?)
We all want the same thing
(What we want, now?)
I said, we all want the same thing

DJ's in the clubs, Jesus, freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing now

All my ex-girlfriends
And all their new boyfriends
(What they doing, now?)
They all want the same thing
(What they want, now?)
I said, they all want the same thing

From Wall Street to the hood
New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing, yeah
(And what you say, what you say?)

Yeah, first say pie to the people
The have's and the have not's
Are we willing to give up all the hours
Just to make it all equal?

And make players out the mascots?
'Cause, right now, we don't see you
Like the Sasquatch
Unless, the root of all evil is what you have got

You're even more visible
If your hair is lots
If not banging from the beach
Then banish you to the sand box

With no lifeguard to come after you
No amount, you don't count, like Dracula
Your bound to drown like a Titanic passenger
Or, a Haitian refugee trafficker

They come and get you off the island
That you crashed into
They take a yacht
And send the slave ship back for you

Money matters, don't let it master you
Pressing on the answer
Till they give you what you're asking for
It's like that, yeah, it's like that

This is a message to
Remind you there's just one who calls love
Take them to church, Kevin

All my gangster friends
(What they want, now?)
And all my skater friends
We all want the same thing
I said, we all want the same thing

DJ's in the clubs, Jesus, freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing now

All my ex-girlfriends
(What they want?)
And all their new boyfriends
They all want the same thing
I said, they all want the same thing

From Wall Street to the hood
New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing, yeah
We all want the same thing, yeah

You get no help HERE, my name ain't welfare
Uh uh dear, take that bullshit elsewhere
Your ass gotta go if you don't got dough
Call me what you want, woman, because you're just another hoe
I know you'd probably make a good mother miss
But I don't got no time to be bothered with no broke bitch
Riffin' at the mouth, get you kicked out, without no whereabouts
The Love Boat shape up and ship out
And take everything you came with when you was startin'
This ain't a world tour, no more trips to this apartment
I want your ass to be ghost

But I won't do a date upstate
I just perform that old Mike Tyson play and cry out rape!
Before you burst, gimme my keys, stop pleadin' for please
This ain't church, get off your fuckin' knees
I'm not lookin' for no blow job, you better get a real job
So we can have some dough Hobbes

Akinyele,"It's the bomb, baby 
The bomb, baby 
With no ifs, no ands, no buts, and no maybes 

[Verse 1] 
I walk through the projects with stress in my hands 
A bad young man from the Lefrack lands 
They say I got an attitude, that's rude 
Because I walked over Elvis' grave in some blue suede shoes 
PUNK, I got some some stuff that'll bust through your pest LUMP 
Clearing cells CHUMP, you know the Ak shit BUMP 
But every now and then they say (he's wack) 
But deep down in your hear you and them dudes from Ridley's don't
believe that 
Everyone's down with the Ak brother 
Every place I go people be like UDDA UDDA, UDDA 
Trying to get the slang down pat, using verbs and syllables, shit 
But I'll flip the style like half a brick 
So give me space like NASA, one deep like a bachelor 
I turn shit over like a spatula 
You know how it goes by now, word to God 
Lyrics are so hard they'll be Kevin Costner's bodyguard 
Move over Whitney Houston, I'm not losing 
By the way woman, yo, my name's not Susan 
It's the Akenyel, I rock well and with more clientel 
Then a guy with long caps of crack to sell 
I take poetry and start illin' with it 
Homicide police be looking for me from the way I be killing and shit 
You niggas can't push along, with the Ak song 
Because thise shit here's the bomb! 

Chorus 

[Verse 2] 
I catch wreck like an automatic tec 
Ripping rhymes as if it was written with Gilletes 
Rapping over slamming tracks 
My hand's compared to a drug called crack 
Because it don't take much to get your ass smacked 
So you can save bullshit 
Word is bond get your shoehorn 
Because I got a style that fit 
See Akenyele be cold cuttin' brothers up like a DELI 
Keeping my cool like Arthur FONZARELLI 
I kick more black ass than Jim KELLY 
Down with easy shit, this nigga TELL ME 
They give me mines from state to state 
And gettin' so much props, my career should be real estate 
So now it's time to face up 
But if you play your jaw like a sneaker yo it's bound to get laced up 
For the MC's that LOST IT 
I'll treat your rock rhymes like a frisbee, watch the Ak TOSS IT 
Selling out it what ya CAUSED IT 
Charlie Angel rapper make like Farah 
And get rinsed down the FAUCET 
because I'm coming at 'em 
So save your devilish tricks for eve if you don't know me from Adam 
My lyrics are hotter than summer school 
My image, far from an air conditioner beacause I never blow my cool 
No thumbs up, nor a COLLAR 
I won't scream or HOLLER 
I make MC's sit their five DOLLAR ass down 
Because all they do is scream and speak in tounges 
RAH RAH RAH, but I bust your motherfuckin' lungs 
Burning up charts with the rhymes I spark 
Cardiology is the word because it comes from the heart 
Brain is on steroids, keeping the lyrics strong 
Huh, this shit here is called the bomb! 

Chorus 

[Verse 3] 
I keep the mic like glass, because I slash 
Thirsty rappers' ass on a Friday night without no hockey mask 
I make Jason meet his doom 
I hit him with the bass from the room that goes 
Ba-do-doom-do-do-DOOM 
You can't fuck with it beacaue I'm a little to exquisite 
For y'all snake-ass lizards 
Check my style right before you freestyle 
My style's hostile, Teddy Ted heard it he said ""Oooh child"" 
I'm quick to damage you amatures some of you pros 
Know on the downlow that I'll assassinate your character 
To think that they can get with this 
With all those dreams you fuck around and put Freddy out of business 
because I'm a rapper's worst nightmare 
Bringing tears for fears, I'm more bad news than the BEARS 
Say a lot for success, I won't DARE 
I'm not Shadow Stephen so I cease to be just another Hollywood
SQUARE 
I rope 'em like a lasso, you'd better dash yo 
Don't stand around and be another Dennis Leary asshole 
You'll get chopped like vegetables 
I leave plenty many hanging like testicles, huh 
Doing what I half to 
To get room to breathe even if it means knocking out your asthma 
This Ak flow ain't no fad 
I be smoking niggas like cigarettes because they style is just a fucking
drag 
I done blew up the World Trade and Vietnam 
Huh, because this shit here is the bomb! 

Chorus",The Bomb,1993
Akinyele,"I throw incinerators at rappers that talk garbage 
about the Ak, they don't know me from a tree in the forest 
My name's not summer so I don't sweat it 
Most y'all niggaz know I cut ya like cheese that's cheddared 
I been around the world like Lisa Stansfield tour bus 
Tearin niggaz up from here to West Bubblefuck 
So don't front like you don't know what my name is 
Before I start diving up in that ass like Greg Louganis 
That's not my number one AMOS 
You take my style and squeeze your lips 
like probably you see your life stopped, you're freakin FAMOUS 
I dare another rapper try to TAME THIS 
I hit you in the ANUS 
Once y'all reach for the damn A-LIST 
still, this ain't the pretty boy 
Fear sex-appeal it's Ak, a.k.a. the real deal 
I make punk rappers stutter, why-yoyoy-yoyoy-yoyo 
I bring out the Das EFX in a motherfucker 
I livin larger than a mansion, you hear me? 
You fear me, you're just a Little House on the Praerie 
Leave 'fore Hurricane Ak come blowin in 
All you motherfuckers best to breeze like the wind 
Check the news forecast 
I place a con niggaz'll stick ya on your butt 
If you're light in the ass 
Close your eyes, and concentrate it's time to recognize 
The Ak keep brothers on checkmate 

Check over there, and then check over here 
Just lend me your ear, c'mon listen 

Nigga you just can't defeat me 
Child abusers walk around, knowin they just can't beat me 
So don't try to take the winner's belt 
Aiyyo this ain't April 1st so don't dare fool yourself 
It don't get no liver, I'm hittin harder than a chastiser 
I flip rhymes like saliva, poundin on your BRAIN 
With the sick shit I'm SAYING 
I got more GAME than a panhandler on a TRAIN 
Huh, it's rare if I don't catch props 
I'm the Ak I tear that ass out the frame like a benzie box 
You know the rules if you ain't ruff 
Stay on the hush and get played like Sunday school shoes 
and get scuffed, I put heads to bed like newlyweds 
Sing your rap eulogy 
'cause now you're good as dead 
Hit the deck, once I round it off like a Tec 
I play you like a game of chess and keep your ass in check 
Checkmate 

Check all around, and then check for them clowns 
Check the fuckin real sound, break down 

In English, MC's can't last 
Similar to a car crash, I got rap in a smash 
Whenever you want to get loose and hang out 
Remember I done turned enough troops into The Last Boy Scout 
Think you'll last? Then come try 
Otherwise make like a librarian and keep your ass quiet 
I'm out to catch the winner's cup 
All you number one contenders just got knocked to the runner's up 
What nigga what? I'm blowin up the spot with dynamite 
rhymes by the Ak 
Airports they amazed to me 
Shit 'cause I fly so much heads yah have my own travel agency 
Rap's are fat like SUMO, slammin like JUDO 
I won't get abused like numbers, I'm MENUDO 
I got the art down pat, pass the courderoy 
this bad boy about to start to slack 
Fuck how ""I could just kill a maaaan"" 
I'm slick and puttin brothers out with these Edward Niggahands 
Ten fingers of death, grippin micraphones 
Holdin my own, sparkin rhymes up like grindstones 
Rippin up challengers 
Creating a mess on stage out of comedian rappers like Gallagher 
My mind is filthier than a HAMPER 
Dirty like a CAMPER 
On top of that I've been through more shit than PAMPERS 
Fake is what I ain't 
But Constantine the Great, don't know me from a can of paint 
Listen to how the soundwaves vibrate 
You can't relate, I got your whole brain on checkmate 

Rob Swift is his name, with Akineyle in the game 
You're best to maintain, as we aim for your brain 
as we aim for your brain (3x)",Checkmate,1993
Akinyele,"My vocals sound dynamic when placed on track 
Me wack? Your local mechanic couldn't even fix his mouth to say that 
I'll make a rapper change his occupation 
And have him selling hot dogs if he ain't saying nathan' 
I wait for challengers to pick a day to beef 
I'm not a calendar- 
I'll knock your ass to the middle of next week (next week) 
Leaving you OUTDATED, I'm are-RATED 
Niggas on my dick was to fall off if I was to get CASTRATED 
No need to explain 
I'm doper than heroin, so just take my name in vain 
You can't follow the Ak's footmarks 
I'll throw your raps in a shoebox and let the bullshit WALK! 
I straighten up those who be slacking up 
In other words I'm not a film director 
So don't come over here acting up 
You know just who I AM 
This ain't the DAMN Macho MAN Wrestling PROGRAM 
Over here you get SLAMMED on the premises 
remember this, the name Akenyele it don't rhyme with Genesis 
I'm not the one to get played 
This ain't the arcade 
Pull over here and you'll find your fingers in the yellow page 
You can't hang with the kid 
My lrics are so bad they're only taught in school 600 
So all you rappers keep eyeing me 
But just admire me 
And write this shit in your diary 

Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple) 
Write it in your book, kid 
Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple) 
Put it on your pages 
Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple) 
Write it in your book, kid 
Dear, dear diary...check it out 

Yo Rob Swift! (Rob Swift gets business) x4 

All you got to do is just set it 
Better yet act like you want it and see if you don't get it 
I walk over rappers like doormats 
Save all that Nino Brown chat for all them other New Jacks 
In your CITY, with your whole damn COMMITTEE 
Your butt-ass rhymes are all SHITTY 
So don't riff cause I'm in a class by myself 
Make like a ventriloquist, talk that shit someplace else 
Lyrics you pick are all simple 
And all like swift to come out your face like a dam pimple 
But just so you can't follow this 
My rhymes penetrate to the skin just like a dermatologist 
Best to head to the CLINIC 
Cause Akenyele's style about to spread like an EPIDEMIC 
I don't talk past the speed LIMIT 
One style's a GIMMICK 
I won't change up because I'm not a SCHIZOPHRENIC 
Pushing a wooden box 
6 foot 6 is what you catch if you step to the Ak 
I kill a rapper's better one sec 
If he ever play me like an accident and think he can catch wreck 
Shit (sheee...) 
Once I COMBINE ya, here's another REMINDER 
Niggas can get stomped down to CHINA 
In other words get that ass kicked 
I'll send your wack baby-ass raps right back to pediactrics 
Play the back before you get smacked 
Ask like a Lumberjack, I come from the projects of Lefrack 
AK to the NEL 
Don't give a HELL who you want to TELL 
Not an intercom but my name rings BELLS 
So all you rappers c'mon, if you want to start trying me 
But write this shit in your diary",Dear Diary,1993
Akinyele,"I want to get out this relationship 
But I'm scared that my man will flip 
He always swears how he's gonna kill me 
And fill me with the bullets from his clip 

[Verse 1] 
I met her in Queens her personality was erotic 
She asked me where I come from, and I just replied ""The projects"" 
Love at first sight as she was staring 
Checking me up and down, yeah, at the gear that I was wearing 
I had an office jacket, Polo shirt, diamond on my hand 
Stonewashed pants ticked inside of some Timberlands 
Her eyes just stayed on my face 
She threw her hand on my hip and felt the four-fifths on my waist 
Yo, my name is Ak the hard rock shit that shot a cop with a glock 
Cause he tried to make the money STOP 
She didn't speak, she didn't START, she didn't TALK 
All of the sudden let's take a WALK through the PARK 
But it was dark, she didn't bother 
She probably thought I was trying to play her out 
Like a Central Park jogger 
But that's not my style that's what I'm telling ya 
Give me your number and I'll probably call you up on my cellular 
At night we spoke for hours and hours and hours and hours 
Hot convo turned into cold showers 
Monogamy, yo, increased to pornography 
Miss Astrologist because she looked like a star to me 
But I be dressing sharper than those brothers with Farrakahan 
Throwing a lucky charm without a leprachaun's arm 
Out on the streets dealing and sticking up 
I try to make her look appealing 
I went out and started tricking bucks 
I got her all dressed up, she used to look messed up 
Now all of her friends can't wait to be next up 
I need to get her thoughts fixed up 
She fell into a blender, she got the stuff all mixed up 
She caught me talking about a quits 
But that's that old bullshit 
It's ain't over til I say it's over, miss 
So if you want to catch a fit, you catch a melon split 
Once you in there ain't no exit 

Chorus 

[Verse 2] 
I talk a good game of pain 
Put it in your ear and let it rain 
Benadryl can't stop the migrane 
Once my voice touch your brain 
So you can talk that fast slang dialect 
But I got a tec to keep you in check 
Other words make you come correct 
Think that to stop giving the loving 
You must be smoking pestacide because you're damn sure bugging 
After one hit you're ready to split 
What, are you test crashing cars? 
That's that ol' dumb dumb shit 
You don't flatter me tring to sign off 
You best to take the batteries out your watch if you want some time off 
I write my name on your street curb 
So you can scratchmy letetrs girl if you want to mark my words 
I got the Calimyne BESIDE ME 
In case you want to TRY ME 
And break out on my ass like poison IVY 
You better take it or ease, roll up you sleeves 
And prepare to go all out like New Year's Eve 
Trying to take my dough like a Swaggart 
Girl, I have to bag ya and fall on your head like Niagra 
Shit, you're bound to catch it, once I start flexing 
Ayo bum bitch there ain't no exit

And I got so much love to give
But I gotta survive, and make papes outta state
I'm ready to make papes outta state, man
I got all my life to live
And I got so much love to give
But I gotta survive, and make papes outta state
I'm ready to make papes outta state

Ak to the Nel to the LE, I'm tryin' hard as hell
To pick my future before my future picks me
Twenty-one years of AGE, not with minimum wage
Don't ever seem like I'ma get paid rhymin' on the stage
College, I always dreamt of tryin it; the only problem here
I don't seem to meet financial aid requirements
Locked writin' rhymes in the crib when would I get out?
Seems like I'm pushin' yo a hip-hop bid
At home the vibes don't feel right
My parents keep lookin' at me as if I'm some type of parasite
My moms separated from her spouse
The oldest of two kids, it's my job to play man of the house
That means gettin' off my ass, makin' immediate cash
That broke shit, save it for an orthopedic cast
I get road maps, learned the interstate
Shit I'm headed out state to make papes man

[Chorus]

I'm ready to get up on a scam trip
The I-95 outta state to make the damn loot flip!
First I need a crackhead with a credit card
So he can head uptown and purchase me a rented car
Just make sure that it's black
And take off the rear view mirrors cause it ain't no lookin' back
I'm goin' one deep, in the driver's seat
Throwin' the vegetarian book cause I'm ready for beef
I got a three-hundred and fifty-seven, faren-degrees-heit
Of heat, better known as a burner on the street
Cool, I got the keys to the CAR
Accelerate on the gas, and have the rubber burn up
On the TAR, I'm out to get money real far
I hear my moms voice, {singing} ""I'm wishin on a star!!""
But I got to go far ma! {sing} ""But I could wonder where you are!""
On the streets just deliverin' packages
So I can just relax and get some type of livin'
Think that it is when it isn't
Easy to see a family, suffer from povery, as bein given
Man, like heck, and when I get back
I'ma rip up them welfare checks
I got a new nine to five mom, so don't wait up late
My job's located outta state

[Chorus]

I reached my destiny and my goal
I done flashed right past the dumb-ass highway patrol
If everything goes well I'm in it to win it
I'm tryin' to find a hotel so I can rest up for a minute
A round of crackheads gonna show me -- neighborhood clowns 
Fear me up and down cause they really don't know me
But all my hits, I see them scopin' out the clip
They want to get open, I can let shit rip!
Whatever is broke got to be fixed, twenty dimes and nicks
Step into my house made of bricks
My man gave me work, home on credit
You think that I'm comin' back?  Tch, black he can forget it
'Cause I got moves to bake, no time to be fake
Bad enough gotta watch out for a snake called Jake
Money nonstop, kept in the hush
At twelve o'clock, I'ma catch, huh, the midnight bus
And watch the dough flow like water
I'm not Taco Bell but hell I'ma make a run for the border
I feel odd, like a extraterrestrial left alone
A calling card number, so I could phone home
To let my people know my mission went great
On my great escape to outta state

Rest in peace to my little brother Donnie Boy
Rest in peace to my man Rakim
Rest in peace to my man, named Understanding
Rest in peace, umm, to Atiba
Rest in peace to my man Wilson from Exena Street
Rest in peace, to all my other peeps
Also rest in peace, to my man T-Bone

You know we goin Worldwide this tour
'Cause yo you know how that go
We gon' get together y'all, word up
That's how we gon' bring it to you
We gon' go all around the world

Word up, my man Rhasaan in the house
We gon' bring it to y'all like this, word up
Just give it to 'em Ak  uhh

I been in and out all areas
And all you true hip-hop fans, you know the Ak's takin care of ya
Slap your ass with real rap
I keep it underground, like subways, so I can stay on track
I'm not a carpenter, but I'll cut the rug
Think you can hang with Ak?  Ha, that's your brain on drugs
Smack fire out your ass like a flag from Backdraft
Didn't peep the movie, you don't know the half
Schoolin' MC's until they start learnin'
We don't gotta be Mississippi to watch the Ak start Burning
I kick that shit that's known to hit
So much rap lines, you might fuck around and hang clothes on it
But yo it ain't no thing in it, your static-free rhymes
That you kick, need to be kicked, cause it doesn't got no cling in it
Then you turn around and start singin' it
Hard Akinyele be brought, so I'm here to start bringin' it
First cannibalistic rhymer, eatin' bitch niggaz
By the statistics, like, Jeffery Dahmer's
Huh, scrapin' you like a sculpture, murder you for the vulture
My dozen dirty, my brains be donated to agri-culture
So come on and face it, my skills are like medicine nigga
You just don't want to taste it
You best to slide to the side, another corner of the map
'Cause this here is worldwide

[Repeat x4]
Worldwide yeah yeah 

Put them tired rhymes to bed, and loosen up your laces
Your shoes are too tight, and now it's goin to your head
Me you feel you can pull with
Remember that I'm not a matador, so get off that bull-shit
I put rappers and singers in they place
A real rudeboy with the raz', I write it all over your face
Leavin' you bloodier than a MaxiPad
Crayola crayons, they'd have to Color Me Badd
So play like a midget and forget it
'Cause I put oil to the fire, like an arsonist
When it comes time to set it
I get more run than an athletic
Sharp as a hyper-dermic
Lyrics are flavored up like a dia-betic
I recoups, and they try to step to this
Nowadays I probably have as much kids as Jerry Lewis
My rhymes drip like a razor, punch like Joe Frazier
I don't sell shoes, because I don't believe in favors
Ducks better break North, before I start
Baggin' that ass, like a motherfuckin' washcloth
Winnin' battles cause I'm a hip-hop soldier
Act like you know, and fuck what your girl told ya
No bluff, for years I've been in this
A nine to five employee don't got shit on me
'Cause I done stepped to nuff rapper business
Beggin' for for-giveness
Channel 7 news and people from Jehovah done witnesses
The whole Akinyele vibe
You know what I'm sayin kid, this here is worldwide

[Reapeat x4]
Worldwide yeah yeah 

Ak not catchin' wreck, come the fuck on
Ring the alarm, I drop bombs like the Guard in Vietnam
I kick that shit, niggaz dream to write
My brain so hot that it ignites, but you can't see the light
Fast rappers can't speed by this, you better slow down
Because I'm puttin' the brakes on your ass like Midas
Nope, it don't matter what type of slang you drop
I give you rope and you still can't hang with the Ak
For years I put ears through therapy
Watch a episode of Cheers before you come try the beer with me
I graduated from lobbies, bangin' on walls for a hobby
I battle anybody, even a dead body
I got rhymes that would attack ya
So you better watch your back, or fuckin' hire a chiropractor
Ain't nuthin change from before, slap niggaz with mani-cures
Stomp you down, after a pedi-cure
Here's another lesson, I'm not a quiz
So that talk about me not gettin' biz that's out of the question
It's a Ak, jam, god damn don't get slammed
You catch the backhand, word to my dead man
You best to rest if you want peace
'Cause like a hooker from up the street, I'm down for beef
I'm hotter than a sauna again the drama is rugged
Word to Sinead O'Connor, I be tearin' shit up
'Cause I sprayin' immaculate, like a Mac-11

I take you to London, worldwide
I take you to Europe, worldwide
Come back to Queens, worldwide
I take you to Russia, worldwide
I take it to the North pole, worldwide
I bring it back to Queens

I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle

Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement

And every night I fucked that same Yoko Ono chick

Anything to get wet, I guess I was just young, sad and blue
Like the Lissette cassette, the world made me like this
Girls very rare gave me a kiss, pulling my dick out only to piss

Now the tables switched and turned no nigga's straight
Like a perm, bank I earn, no time to learn, one girl
Give me all of them, I'll have a ball with them
And when we do change the numbers, so they don't call again

We probably see them at the mall again or the dance hall again
Fuck it if they with it we could do it all again

How do you know? 'Cause I told you so

Go fuck her, then come fuck me
Well, you're shit out of luck 'cause this bitch ain't free
I had a fat piece of twat and it must get bust
But you're hoing everywhere and you want your dick sucked

And you want to come home, pass diseases to me
Have me scratching my pussy like I'm looking for fleas
But I'm not your ho bitch
And you can't fuck me around, 'cause you're a ho

Oh my gosh! oh my gosh!
This girl was hairy like that man sasqwash
Ugh-ugh-ugh, that's all that we said
Man, ugh, pardon me, ugh - back on the bed
As I turned her over, I said ""I beg your pardon""
Tried to stick in in her butt, the girl kept on fartin
Pfrr-pf-pf-pfrr - like the human beatbox
Pumpin that ass up just like reebocks
As I turned her over, I said ""I beg your pardon""
Try to put it in her mouth, but the girl kept on maulin
Rrraw, rrraw, like captain caveman
My dick on her breast, and her chest just caved in

try'na put my seed up in 'em, you know..
All the girls who gave me a wrong number 
when I just asked them for their fuckin' phone number 
tryin' to call 'em and hook up for a date and all that shit... 
All the girls who left me in restaurants eatin'...
talkin 'bout they gonna use the phone 
and left me with the fuckin bill....

HA! It was all a dream, I used to read Playboy magazine,
Niggaz gettin' their dick licked with whipped cream
Women from all places, no matter what their race is,
Mami want to put punani where your face is
I said ""Ha, Whut?"" Put my face by her trap
Smoke weed, bamboo, lick her in her private spot
Way back before niggaz even started smokin' crack
They used to act, proooo black
Remember Brand Nubian, 'One for all'
Who ever thought Akinyele would get paid for grabbin' his balls
Now I'm in the strip bar, big rap star
Time to get laid, which one of y'all girls want to get paid?
The lieu..tenant, sit behind windows tinted,
Remember when I used to push cars that was rented
Now I cop the drop top, made their hearts stop
Drive another block , they be like ""yo, that was Ak!""
Huah! I stay away from the A-I-D,
pack condoms like guns 'cause that's the way I be,
One love to the late great Easy E
Larry Flynt, Hugh Heffner, and Ron Jeremy
Huah! I get pussy you know how I do,
call the crib last four numbers, ten-eighty-two
What the fuck??

My coochie is soo juuiicy, yeah (4x)

I can take the girl from the local streets
and take her to Cancun and fuck her on the beach
and I'm far from cheap, I make sure all my niggas get laid,
Open your legs girl, make some way, Hey-ay!
Around the way they used to diss me, girls never kiss me,
 Now they writing letters how they miss me,
I never thought that hard work could pay off and shit,
I was too used to jerkin' off and shit
Now the hunnies play me close, like the butter play the toast,
When I'm grabbin 'em, I'll be baggin' them like a Coach
Condos in Queens, head blown for weeks
Feelin' up the cheeks of the 'put it in ya mouth' freaks
Raw sex is what I fear, so I pack condoms when it comes to this here
I hump bitch! A bunch of bitchs grabbed the family jewels,
considered a fool 'cause i get more ass than a mule
Stereotype of a perverted nigga misunderstood....and its still all good

Chorus (9x)

Yea this for all the girls when I used to call they house 
they see my number on the caller ID 
and they never pick up the phone..fuck you...
This for all the girls when I call 'em 
they answer their phone like ""Hello"" and when I say 
""Its Ak"" they act like their fuckin 'sleep..
yeah fuck you... 
This is dedicated to the Notorious B.I.G.

The way I murder these rhymes
I flip hundreds of lines
Cause I'm done hit this mic over 7 times
I shine

In niggers pussy like cat litter
Who would ever consider this pepto bismol drinking nigga
Bring a ruckas and I'll start shitting on you motherfuckers
Cause the raps I give
They running through your ass like a laxative Huh
I could get drastic
Like Rupaul swing that dried dick
I get aggy when I hit
I get you boombastic
Cause Akinyele only give you boom back shit
Original incredible lyrical hook for years
But y'all wasn't trying to hear
Like you hear them through (?) ears
I kick it loud and clear
Make you whisper like those motherfucking temptations is out
Hey yea
I end careers
By the pier like pliers
This mic get iced once I cream niggas like wires
Paper weight fires
Play them both sides of the fence like barbed wires
But I will make your whole entire empire retire
Once I'm dressed in army atire
All you hear is repeated gun fire
Leaving your chest heated like clunky dryers

We came to fuck you right on up
So if you want to
Get up 
I'll bust you down
We came to fuck you right on up

Even on a blind date
You couldn't get with me
I'll put these hot ass tecs on your neck
And give you permanent hickies
Leave you in lakes like Ricky
Think that I was distributing whisky
The way niggas be riding on me tipsy
The rhyme chief maker, hittin punch lines 
like a rapper who slammed his sister loose leaf paper
It don't get no better than this
I got that medicine
For rock veterans
I'm bad to the bone like skeletons
Or some dracula shit
Biting mics turning niggas into vampires
Cause they can't get no light huh
Kid can't you tell
That it's the Aki-NYELE
I be holding this shit down like a bucket ina well
Jammed like hell
And plus I rock your dome without stones
The black stallion
Pack the certified chrome to make you think I'm Italian
From the way that I roam
I drunk and stuck the microphones like BOOOO
Niggas think it's dial tones
And start looking for Miss Jones
You clones
Are soft like foam
I like rap superstars out of their twilight ass zone
Like doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
When n n n n n
What the hell you think it's the AK
You be like huh what
Like I'm yelling it's my beat huh what
Niagga don't sleep

We came to fuck you right on up
So if you want to
Get up 
I'll bust you down
We came to fuck you right on up

Akinyele,"[Chorus]
How do you feel now that you know you cheated on me
Was she as good goody goody good as can be
How do you feel knowing that I know
And how do you feel cause I'm out the door
And how do you feel knowing that I cheated on you to

And did she get you open with a 69
Doggy style that's from the back and from behind
Now did she do you well
Did she go down low
Did she take it fast or did she take it slow
See my guy he did me and he did me well
He kissed my lips
He touched my tits and then my panties fell
With some cherry jello and the cool whip cream
I feel man dick go up inside of me

[Chorus]

Now did she get you open with a second round
On the bed the chair or maybe on the ground
Was it as good as good as you though it'd be
Did the skinny amateur even compare to me
When my guy got finished with his love and flow
He showed me many many things that you didn't know
And by the time we reached found 44
It took his time laid me down and we made love some more

[Chorus]

Ha now I didn't even mean to cheat on your pussy
I found another lady who said she'd fuck me for free
And I didn't even like have to eat her out
The first thing she put this dick up in her mouth
Now I'm not saying that I was loving the chick
I was a little astonished from the way she ws sucking the dick
Do get me wrong later on I'll probably be fucking the chick
Get on some Donald shit
Then start ducking the chick
Now the motherfucking moral of the story is
You cheat on me I'll cheat on you that's just how it is
My new sweetie she know I don't come speedy
Before she give me long head like nephrotite
Now what we do with me and you don't go tell he or she
Keep it to yourself like Monica Lewinsky
So we don't blow trial
Or get caught up
When we cheating in the night cause we get hard up
Keep the guards up
When you creeping through
Cause all the bitches that cheat this song's for you
And all the niggas that cheat this song's for you
And everybody that cheat's this song's for you
It goes

Don't trust no nigga or bitch that calls you the word boo

But I let it pass
With a simple laugh
'Cause it was the beginning

So I stay smiling and grinning
Even when you joke and said my wrinkled sweater reminded you of
Fucking crushed linen (that shirt is wrinkled like crushed linen ha ha)

Would they fuck them three girls from 702?
Would Erykah Badu fuck them two righteous dudes
>From the Brand Nubian crew and include Grand Pu?
Did Mary J. Blige ever fuck Case and Nas?
Was ??? ever comin on Kimberly Drummond?

In that girl from Digable Planets?

Did Laverne and Shirley ever fuck Carmine?
Was Gina and Pam humpin on Martin?
And all you freaks on that motorcycle shit
I wonder would you ever fuck them two police from _Chips_?
_New York Undercover_, what's that puertorican's name?

[Akir]
One Enterprises, comprises the artist and the sound
The pen and paper plays my savior while I'm getting down
Pray for my nieghbors as a favor for holding me down
Slave for my papers as I savor the way that it pounds
It's underground, but the blatent vibrations widely found
Facing the nation complacent radio stations now
Stop hesitaing and contemplating the way we paitient
Start motivating and get them playin the shit we sayin
Ain't no delayin in this war that we gettin slayed in
Cause times a waistin while we stand adjacent to abrasions
They fouls are more than flagrant
And so I see the prisons cages while I pound the pavement
Looking for payment saying fuck enslavement
Usin the tools of old ancients
Announcing my engagment to this music that we making
Ain't no faking on tracks, and we ain't never come wack (never!)

[Immortal Technqique]
Immortal Technique in the trenches with my nigga Akir
Our family surived the genocides so we can be here
And now we enterprise the aftermath, one in the same
Living the revolution 'till we catch one in the brain
And even then my spirit will return in heavenly form
And wipe the chess board clean, of my enemies pawns
The red don communist threat, burried and gone
So they invented a war, the government can carry on
It makes me wonder if the word of god is lost in the man
This is for the children of Iraq, lost in the sand
This is for the illest emcees that'll never be known
And this is for all the soldiers that'll never come home
I wrote this for Momia, stuck in a beast
For people who, march in the streets, and struggle for peace
For hood niggaz, born rugged, never rocking Versace
Eddie Ramierez's cousin George, and my old friend Sashi
Chris from the block, and all my niggaz stuck in a cell
Paul Wolfowitz, motherfucker I'll see you in hell
My destiny is to show the world, that the music is real
Go back in time and play this shit, for the slaves in the field
And for my children in the future, waiting to breathe
People slowly dying hanging on, waiting to leave
Believe when I'm gone, and this album's on a library shelf
I'll be one with god and one with you and everything else

[Hook]

[Immotal Technique talking]
Yeah..
Revolutionary Volume 2 has been brought to you
By the type of motherfuckers who ain't scared of shit
And if you playing this album, and I'm no longer here
And sometime far away from when I recorded this
Remember that history
Isn't the way the corperate controlled media made it look like
Read between the lines and free your mind
Revolution is the birth of equality
And the anti-thesis to oppression
But this is only built for real motherfuckers
So when I'm gone, don't let nobody I never got along with
Try to make songs kissing my ass, recycling my beats or my vocals
The shit is real over here man
Thank you for listening, and thank you for supporting independent Hip Hop
The heart and soul of our culture
Keeping the truth alive
Goodnight my people.. goodnight..

Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1994

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Steals across the meadows of my heart

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away

I understand that there are some problems
And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry that it took so long to see
They were dead wrong trying to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl trying to have fun
Her daddy should never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a twenty one and older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you

And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me","Sorry, Blame It on Me",

They say they want that hot sh, say no more
Had to walk around the block, couldn’t take no more!
Like escaper from the rock, couldn’t wait no more
Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword
So I’m sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce
Plain and simple and in short, when it rains, man, it pours
Stepping in manure, second sippin in the moor
Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war
Guessed, but I’m pretty sure that I’m destined to endure
Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore
World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace
What’s behind the door the allure something strange?
Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed
No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change
Course is unphased, contorted or concave
I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang
Got me feeling like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I’ll be the last man standing!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!

I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself
I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health
When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt
Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help
So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real
So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield
Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal
When friends become foes know you're doing it well
Just keep it going
I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker?
Group homes and tombstones to feel safer
Loopholes for new souls, lets keep praying
Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in
Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it
Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it
Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is
Way I play the game, no wonder the brother made it like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive

Got me still in this fight, and I’ll be the last man standing!

Put my life on the line on the grind hit the streets all day

Hoppin' over them gates, I could see your face 
More reason to get away the set 
Get runnin', tucked my kids to sleep, tell 'em daddy's coming 
And I wanna get you outta them jacks

She can autograph my pockets,
Anytime, anyplace, anyway,
I'll be looking at everybody else watchin'
I don't wanna be obnoxious,
But this girl worth the gossip,
Take away the smile,
The tattoos now, forever she very guard-less
I imagine her topless
She might set off my rocket
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
On and poppin' she mad marketing
Attitude like we arguing
With her by my side bring glitter to my life
I should twitter this girl is sparkling

She ain't no rock star
But she got groupies,
She ain't no actress
But she makes movies,
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl
She ain't got riches but she got fashion,
She ain't a model but camera's flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl

Hey, I wanna know her mamma's name,
'Cause that where she get it from,
They ain't never shot her with silicon,
Shawty is her and her she's the real one
Touch one, grab one, feel one,
I wish she would'a told me that
Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back,
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass,
She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags
Like damn, can I be yo' police badge
Pull it up, get a little cozy and
Woman is sort'a like and oldie jam,
Record some ssh,
On a playboy cam,
She ain't no actress
The movie from my mattress
Rock star, none of that practice
But still she got fanatics

And then a made bond, take it from the profit of the weed
All this just to feed my seeds, yeah
