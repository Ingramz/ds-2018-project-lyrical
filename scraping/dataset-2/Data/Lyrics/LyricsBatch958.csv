Roy Orbison,"I was all right for a while, I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say ""Hello""
Aw you wished me well, you couldn't tell

That I'd been crying over you, crying over you
Then you said ""so long"". left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying crying
It's hard to understand but the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you but it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do
For you don't love me and I'll always be

Crying over you, crying over you
Yes, now you're gone and from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
Yeah crying, crying, over you",Dream Baby,1997
Roy Orbison,"I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on blue bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes
Workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on blue bayou

I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to blue bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on blue bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on blue bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on blue bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on blue bayou
Ah, that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

I'll never be blue, my dreams come true on blue bayou",Blue Bayou,1997
Roy Orbison,"Where the Nile flows
And the moon glows
On the silent sand
Of an ancient land

When a dream dies
And the heart cries
Shahadaroba 
Is the word they whisper low

Shahadaroba, Shahadaroba
Means the future 
Is much better than the past

Shahadaroba, Shahadaroba
In the future 
You will find a love that lasts

So when tears flow
And you don't know
What on earth to do
And your world is blue
When your dream dies
And your heart cries
Shahadaroba 
Fate knows what's best for you

Shahadaroba, Shahadaroba
Face the future 
And forget about the past
Shahadaroba, Shahadaroba
In the future 
You will find a love that lasts

Roy Orbison,"I sat there alone upon the ferris wheel
A pastel colored carriage in the air
I thought you'd leave me dangling for a little while
A silly twist upon a childish dare

Below I saw you whispering to another man
Who held the lever that could bring me down
He'd stop the world from turning at your command
It's always something cruel that laughter drowns

And I'm up while the dawn is breaking
Even though my heart is aching
I should be drinking a toast
To absent friends
Instead of these comedians

I can hardly hear the music from the carousel
The wind picks up, the carriage starts sway
As one by one the lights go out
It's closing time
I see you take his hand and walk away walk away

They say that you will always be the last to know
They say that all that glitters is not gold
It's not just that you're never coming back to me
It's the bitter way that I was told

And I'm up while the dawn is breaking
Even though my heart is aching
I should be drinking a toast
To absent friends
Instead of these comedians",The Comedians,1998
Roy Orbison,"Everyone you know's been through it
You bite the bullet then you chew it
Tie the knot at the end of your rope
Buy a book to help you cope but
No consolation gonna come
You're the only one

Take a look through history
Recant some bits of poetry
You'll find the words still ring true
Some things don't change
Some things do

And you're the only one with a broken heart
The only one who's afraid of the dark
The only one in a crowded room
The only one who sees a blue moon

What you wouldn't give right now
To be another face in the crowd

And you're the only one who is all alone
The only one who's love is gone
The only one who has given in
And you're the only one with a broken heart
The only one who is falling apart
The only one in a crowded room
The only one who can see the blue moon

Tell me one more time, that you want me one more time, break my heart in two 

Tell me one more time, with your hand in mine, that you need a love so sweet and true 
Tell me one more lie, I'll cry you one more cry, tell me that you love me one more time 

One more time, tell me that you care, one more time, honey I'll be there

She been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay. 
To get a brown eyed handsome man 
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man 

Way back in history three thousand years 
Back every since the world began 
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear 
For a brown eyed handsome man 
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man

Between a doctor and a lawyer man 
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself 
A brown eyed handsome man 
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man 

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass 
She had the world in the palm of her hand 
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match 
To get brown eyed handsome man 
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

He hit a high fly into the stand 
Rounding third he was headed for home 
It was a brown eyed handsome man 
That won the game; it was a brown eyed handsome man",Brown Eyed Handsome Man,2001

Falls down western style

Steal my heart away

Said she can make me a man

I gave you my love 
I wanted your heart 
Without yesterday haunting the way 
Maybe we'd still be together 
Sharing that loving you feeling again 
It's really got me reeling again 
Will it ever stop and not start over again 
That loving you feeling again 
No matter how much I try 
This loving you feeling 
It's taken such a long time to say goodbye 
And getting over you is so hard to do 
With this feeling loving you 
That loving you feeling again",That Lovin' You Feelin' Again [Remastered Album Version] [Version],2005

It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry 
When waking from a bad dream 
Don't you sometimes think it's real? 
But it's only false emotions that you feel

So let your hair down and go on and cry",Crying [DVD],2007

The mountains all fall to the ground
But I will fear none of these things
Shelter me, Lord, underneath Your wings

Dark waters rise, the thunders pound
The wheels of war are going round
And all the walls are crumbling
Shelter me, Lord, underneath Your wings

(Shelter me)
Hide me underneath Your wings
(Shelter me)
Hide me deep inside Your heart

In Your refuge cover me
The world can shake
But, Lord, I'm making You my hiding place

The wind can blow, the rain can pour
The deluge breaks, the tempest roars
But in the storm my spirit sings
When You shelter me, Lord, underneath Your wings

(Shelter me)
Hide me underneath Your wings
(Shelter me)
Hide me deep inside Your heart

In your refuge, cover me
The world can shake
But, Lord, I'm making You my hiding place

Someday when time no more shall be
I'll say, oh, death where is your sting?
You shelter me, Lord, underneath Your wings

No some won't ride, but we're going get on the Bible train
Some ride but not all the way
The Bible train is in the yard now and it's waiting and oh it looks so good
But you might get bored and impatient waiting like those two good brothers over there
They pass around the bottle in the car before they got on the train
Just want to take one more for the road and then, that leads to something else
Well they ain't on the train no more and maybe 9 or 10 got off with them
There's a sister in the church and she says to her friend 
Your husband works at night and so does mine, why don't we just

Get together sometime when they're gone and go downtown and find us some action, 
Well then they gotta get off the Bible train.

And then another man he's sitting over there looking at a woman in the corner 
And he's gives her that eye, you know and they

Meet later, secretly, so they got to get off, 
This train's got a rule against adultery.

And while all this is happening the train is getting ready to go, 
But there's a lot more to get off than different reasons

Just before the train pulls out, 
But listen its starting to move now, 
Listen to it.

Here we go'.

As it leaves the man on the caboose with a long white beard says,
This train is bound for gory, this train,
This train is bound for glory, this train,
This train is bound for glory nobody rides it but the righteous and holy,
This train is bound for glory, this train

This train is a free train, this train,
This train is a free train, this train,
This train is a free train,

This train don't pull no liars, this train
This train don't pull no liars,
No false pretenders and no backbiters
This train don't pull no liars, this train.

This train is a clean train, this train

Then you said so long
And left me standing all alone
Alone and crying

That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

Roy Rogers,"Late down last night, trying to play my hand
Oh, through the window, out stepped a man
I didn't know no better
Oh boys, in my girlish days

My mama cried, papa did too
Oh, daughter, look what a shame on you
I didn't know no better
Oh boys, in my girlish days

I hit the highway, flagged me a truck
Nineteen and seventeen, Lord, the winter was tough
I didn't know no better
Oh boys, in my girlish days

Flagged a train, didn't have a dime
Trying to run away from that old home of mine
I didn't know no better
Oh boys, in my girlish days

All of my playmates are now surprised
I had to travel 'fore I got wise
Now I know better
And I still got, oh, my girlish ways, ooh yeah

When I would have drowned beyond doubt

To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep, he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
""I can do no more for him, Jim""

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side and looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

And no more with old Shep will I roam

Roy Young,"Lovely Rita meter maid,
Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.

For too long now, there were things I should have said 
In the darkness...I was stumbling for the door

The misty ghosts of childhood fears

Where I was, I had tears I couldn't cry 
My emotions frozen in an icy lake 
I couldn't feel them until the ice began to break 

I have no power over this, you know I'm afraid 
The walls I built are crumbling 
The water is moving, I'm slipping away... 

I throw myself into the sea 
Release the wave, let it wash over me

They called him Cassius 
Watch me bash this beat like a skull 
That you know I've beef with 
Why do you riff with me 
The maniac psycho 
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 
Cause I might go Blaw! 
How you like me now? 
The ripper will not allow 
You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift, 
Listen to my gears shift 
I'm blasting, I'm blasting 
Kinda like shaft, so you can say I'm shafting

I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out

I just don't know 
What made you forget that I was raw 
But now I gotta new tour 
I'm going insane 
Startin' the hurricane 
Releasin' pain 
Lettin' you know 
You can't gain or maintain 
Unless you say my name 
Rippin' 
Killin' 
Diggin' and drillin' a hole 
Pass the Old Gold 

I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out

Shotgun blasts are heard 
When I rip and kill at will 
The man of the hour, tower of power 
I'll devour 
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand 
That I'm not your average man 
When I gotta jammy in my hand 
Damn! 
Oh! 
Listen to the way I slay 
Your crew 
Damage 
Damage  
Destruction, terror, and mayhem 
Pass me a sissy so sucker I'll slay him 
Farmers (what) 
Farmers (what) 
I'm ready (we're ready) 
I think I'm gonna bomb a town 
Get down 
Don't you never, ever 
Pull my lever 
Cause I explode 
And my nine is easy to load 
I gotta thank God 
Cause he gave me the strength to rock Hard

Say you stressed as such, few niggas you had to touch
Plus the shit's rough, sendin you balloons, read it up
Thug it up, keep it tight, 'cause your girl on right
It's all a struggle in life, to sell things and pay the price
But I'm wit you, can't let you down son, I miss you
But back on the streets, the police want me wit you
It's official, I'm tryin to blow them lands like a missile
Holdin my pistol, to keep it real when I'm wit you
Commissary a hit you, like Kings try to rip you
Suffer razors an issue, blowin niggas like a whistle
Geo.'s 'a try to snitch you, watch the beam before they fish you
So just lift weight, I'm layin low until release date

Direct sale, judge face to face, no bail
Take it to trail, spend a year on the Isle
First day, Sing-Sing, walkin through the gates
Stuff's a shame, wild nigga walkin wit the length
We was cellblocked, think about, Flush want the top
Put my pictures up, relax for a minute, kick it up
Watch the top cat, La Familia got the coke in that
I need a part in that, fine tango, just give 'em cash
Soup 'em up, make 'em feel wild as fuck, now what up?

[Noreaga]
I know my real family, new people try to be around me
Try to surround me, goatee, ganja leaf
Locked up chief, well let that be
Doorags and cuffies, gave me a razor, recruit me
Now I'll slang, and catch a band, til the bing
You workin in the kitchen, ice pick and now ya snitchin
You Scarface, lost ya face, is laced up
So what, you got cut, then you told police
Keep it real in the beast, same thing in the streets
Wild cats tell, play PC inside a jail
Yo me, did three, never in PC
Stand freely, Musolini, we just a heemy
Life in exile, people like we, penitentiary
Did time, all evolve wit crime
Desert mind, police hit strip, caught mine
What, what, what, what, what, what

Shootin close range, half of these niggas died in the game
It's a city game, blastin at cops by all means
Keep it real throughout queens
Catchin jooks for cream
On the tap phone, fuckin wit niggas that's far from home

Guarnateed to blow, puffin on trees do I go
Way low, kidnappin children for dough that's how it go
Place a criminal minds traces are hard to find
To commit crime, half of these niggas is droppin dimes

Didn't sell drugs, where the money come from?

You have to hit them hard.
You've burned the bridge,
And I fell in a sea of sorrow.

Just bring back yesterday,
I feel the pain, it makes me hate tomorrow...

Take me for a while,
Just to make me smile.

In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band

And she was blinded by the light
Oh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East
He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

Yeah, he was blinded by the light

Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said, I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right

Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Once in a while
Please promise me you'll try

When you find
That once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been

Think of me
Think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me
Trying too hard
To put you from my mind

Recall those days
Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you

We chased them through bramble
We chased them through the fields
We could chase them forever

And some saw her shadow
On the crest of a hill

Away from the kill

At the end of a pale afternoon
And we'd lay down our heads just like we were sleeping
Controlled by the drag of the moon
We ran through the forest
And we ran through the streams
And we ran through the heather
Though we ran in our dreams
And you were my lover
And I was your boy
We ran like the river
For what else did we know
One day we'll reach a great ocean
At the end of a pale afternoon
The dogs are all howling
And the horses are late
All the hunters have hunted
Through the end of the game
Our love was a river
A wild mountain stream
In a tumbling fury
On the edge of a dream
And they chased us through bramble
And they chased us through the fields
They could chase us forever
But our heart would not yield
And the fox is done running
At the end of the day

I'm ready to pay

In the park, yesterday
I saw a face that spelled danger
A friendly smile, a worried look
I mistook for a stranger

Something's biting me I'll never give in
Coming back to me again and again

Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,"You ought to know about Mr. Mistoffelees the original Conjuring Cat. 
(There can be no doubt about that.) Please listen to me and don't scoff. 
All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say: 
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

[Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh! 
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Watching trains go by.

It's telling me it might be you
All of my life...

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life,
Wondering how they met and what makes it last.

If I found the place,
Would I recognize the face?
Something's telling me it might be you.
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you.

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And we've so much love to make

I think we're gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time

There are always two sides to every story'
 
Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town 
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down 
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man 
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can 

We always need to hear both sides of the story 

A neighborhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night 
Young faces hide in the shadows, 
While they watch their mother and father fight 
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone 
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says 
Looks like it's just us from now on' 

We always need to hear both sides of the story 

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now 
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now 
Be sure, before we close our eyes 
Don't walk away from here 
'Til you hear both sides 

Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the centre of the storm 
Neighbours once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn 
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets 
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat 

We always need to hear both sides of the story 

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now 
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now 
Be sure, before we close our eyes 
Don't walk away from here 
'Til you see both sides 

White man turns the corner, finds himself within a different world 
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall 
He says 'would you respect me if I didn't have this gun 
'Cause without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one'

All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on just holding on to time
Now that we're living separate lives

Well I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
