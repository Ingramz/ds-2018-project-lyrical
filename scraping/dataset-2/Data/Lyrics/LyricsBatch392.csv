J.T.,"I knew a girl and I like her still
She said she knew she would trust me and I her will
I said okay, baby, tell me what you'll be
And I'll lay my head down and see what I see

By the time she was back
By her open eyes
I knew that I was in for a big surprise

I knew a girl and I like her still
She said she knew she would trust me and I her will
I said okay, baby, tell me what you'll be
And I'll lay my head down and see what I see

By the time she was back
By her open eyes
I knew that I was in for a big surprise",Love Song,2010
J.T. Adams,"I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me
So

Bells ring
Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry
Bye bye blues

Its alright (its alright), It's alright (its alright)

I got a problem with fuck niggas
Always talkin' shit and try to duck niggas
Sucker niggas won't finish what they started
Be coppin' dueces cause them niggas soft-hearted
They straight bitches
Always puttin' on shows for these niggas and hoes
Be wantin' to run your mouth but won't throw no blows
Ain't got no scrap, better kill that rap
Think life is a game, until that ass get tapped
And when it do, what you do, you run like a bitch
Or do you straight turn state on a nigga and snitch
When you ain't got your boys, you ain't got no balls
And you ain't gangsta with all them 911 calls
Real niggas don't call police
Real niggas handle theirs when they got beef

Taking your life ain't nothing but a factor
Matter of fact, I'm a killer straight out the slums
No time to dump, I got these pumps for you chumps
And I ain't talking bout' the reeboks
Getting three glocks and jumping out of treetops
Making suckers flee spots, and leave knots
Got guns, get funds, yeah I'm packing styles
Suckers acting foul, get smoked like Black and Milds
Nigga know a plan, laying down this thing
Beyond all that rap shit, I only spit game
You scared, say you scared, but just peep what I said
I'm so wicked off the head, probably shoot out of dread
that's right, all you suckers better recognize
Before I start recognizing, ain't gonna have you niggas sweatin' mine
I'm in this thang for real, ain't nothing fake here
Putting down in the zone with my nigga Shakespeare

You want to get it on nigga, its alright
Its alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)

I wear my hat low, when I walk through a circle of folks I don't know
It ain't to much chalk in these streets that can hold me back
I make stacks and stacks, for the weeks and weeks I got slapped
Freaks, I got the grill with the white gold
Keep a pistol in my hand with the tight hold
From the city where they drop blows
Known to pin-hold down off them figure fours
Shit shady, we all about to bust on sight, lighting up the night
Putting hoes off in 74's and watching em' all blow
It ain't shit funny, its the money man and Gipp
Holding sawed-off pumps in your face chump
Don't disrespect the city, streets, that I'm standing on
Niggas from Miami and Atlanta holdin' heat
It ain't nothing happy
You see, it ain't all about that rapping

You niggas don't want war, talking all that shit
Cause you apted up on that motherfucking tough guy juice
Get round' the motherfucking boys, listen to this goddamn rap music
And niggas think its a motherfucking game
Alright, play with it

I'm a North Memphis Survivor...Survivor
I'm a North Memphis Survivor...I'm a young nigga, money and power
I'm a North Memphis Survivor...Survivor
I'm a North memphis Survivor...I'm a young nigga, money and power

[Yo Gotti]
I was a young nigga thugging now, moms bugging now
Getting the Third Degree, for bringin drugs in the house
Getting my ass in, but my mama had to spoil it
Ran across my work, flushed my shit down the toilet
Fucked me up bad, but I tried to ignore it
Couldn't though, why? 'cause I owed the nigga for it
125 grams eight one yo-la, 50 doller power tell blue motorola
Broke up my tube and my scale, I got no luck
Hold up, mama even threw away the soda
I remember this shit like it was yesterday
Falling in the house late, seent the look on mama's face
I knew something was wrong, by the smile and the smirk
You know the look you get when your mama really hurt
She shook her head, I dropped mine, ya'll already know
Boy you selling dope, get your shit you got to go

[Chorus repeat- X2]
I'm on the motherfucking grind
You think this easy, you out your motherfucking mind
You could see the shit I'm doing, if you was blind
Straight up, I'm just trying to get mine

[Yo Gotti]
What am I to do now, where am I to go?
And how the fuck I'm gonna pay this nigga for his do?
Been looking for me, got a nigga kind of scared
And all the other niggaz looking up side my head
They said he came through, layin low with his beeper
Two, Three cars Two, Three Desert Eagles
Got me a fresh quarter ounce and a beeper
Fuck it, I'm a grind till my bank get steeper
72 hours had 28 elither
Know what I'm talking about that uncut ether
Junkies lookin whoin, goose neckin and browsing
Word got around, I sold up the Public Housing

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]
One week later had 4 and a split
Called up the nigga, told him told him come get his shit
I'm a real nigga, I just ran into some problems
All the time you think a nigga tried to slick rob ya
Thinking about my mama and them, I'm ready to go home
I'm fifteen years old, out here on my own
Mama let me back in, mama real strict
After school, straight home, no phone, no shit
Now doom in my room, I assume I was broke and it's true
So what the fuck a nigga gone do
Called grip, I heard he just got back off a trip with that shit
Man fuck it, I'm getting back with my click

J.T. Money,"I got a problem with this punk ass bitch I know 
Ol' no good skanlezz switch out ho 
An untrustworthy bitch like delilah 
Only thing she good for is puttin' dick inside her mother fuckin' face 
Bitch got some good neck 
But the little trick need to learn some respect 
She made me beat her ass. 
Take a nigga out this game. 
See I don't beat my hoes cause all my hoes is payin' 
But this one act like she don't understand 
You is the bitch, me, I'm the man 
Remember dat shit, then learn to submit 
And that when you stop gettin' your funky ass kicked little hard headed 
trick 
See a nigga know about ya 
And I know a dollar bill 'll bring tha ho outcha 
Then you got the nerve to claim you better than the rest of my hoes 
When you ain't even in the rankin' of the best of my hoes 

[Chorus]
Somethin' about pimpin' 
That makes me love this game 
Somethin' about pimpin' 
The hoes be off the chain 
Somethin' about pimpin' 
I just don't want to stop 
Somethin' about pimpin' 
Cause this players gotta keep a fat knock 

I'm like JD Walker 
Pimp hat to tha right smooth talker 
Bitches workin' all night like a stalker 
Gettin' every last nickel dime and quarter 
Pimpin' ain't hardly nuthin' new to me 
Used to be a little kid watchin' movies 
I knew what I wanted in life, about nine or ten hoes 
I ain't want no wife 
I used to walk real cool like my leg was broke 
And I still do, now I get paid from hoes, Beeitch 
'cause this East side nigga don't care 
Since I was nine years old I been a player 
And now I got a lot 'o women 
It's never endin' 
It's just somethin' 'bout this pimpin' 

[Chorus]

Now, one time for you H-Os 
You want to try a real player bout his pesos 
Hey hoes, I know you in this game tryin' to come up, pick a come up 
Got these niggas got they nut up for some cut ups 
So wut up all I want to do is get this money witcha 
I'm dead serious, I ain't tryin' to be funny witcha 
I teach tha game but It ain't for free 
When I see you with some change you just bring it to me 
See you can come up in this game 
And you can get hurt ho 
When you in public just remember who you work for 
Cause all them tight ? cats gonna come try to holla 
So called ballers, flashin' they dollars 
Hatin' J baby, you just play it crazy 
Let him spend his loot on them boobs 
So you can pay 
All I want is the bread 
He want the pussy and head 
Don't be misled just remember everything I said

You know me as your player, your pipe layer, your all-night-stayer

Now, n****, what you gon' do?
Ugh, let me put this good lovin' on you
We can do everything that you want to
'Cause I like it real freaky, n****; don't you?

Down at my boy's house
It was the summertime 
When everyone would hang out
Down at the corner store
We had the best of times
Yellin' bingo out 
At every card that came by

I knew that I haven't changed
And I wanted them to believe
That I was gonna make it

Oooh oohhh oh yeah 
From the bottom to the top
I got 'em 
In Miami
This is where I stay (ooh yea)
Oooohhh oh ohhh oh yea

I got 'em

I can't  believe at last
I headed to the ATL 
Just to hear tha sound
To go with Dallas and
He had a record plan 
That Jt Money; Vega;
That whole Miami route

I knew that I haven't changed (oh yea)

That I was gonna make it big

Where the girls in the tempa just stay hot
That bottom where the base game started
And the girls shake they thang ho' hearted

Straight thug when it don't be happenin'
Old school on the fish and the chumps
Lettin' out playin old school funks
Big Sammie put it down for the bottom
Fly hunnies want money we got em' (oh yea)

Find hot street wear all in the street
A place where the old stuff retreat
Where they move to an up tempo beat

Fly bitch, do or die bitch, my bitch don't play, baby
Doin' every damn thing for J, baby
And she luv to see a nigga on top
Even though she know there's other bitches wantin' the spot
But they can't fuck wit Slim, cuz baby be the real
Got nerves of steel, feds can't make her squeal
She's a freak in bed, love gettin' head
Keep a nigga welfare wit plenty of bread
Call her Superbitch, love nice shit
All the high price shit, the golden ice shit
Wit the game to mack, no strings attached
Type of bitch only rich niggas dream they had
All the money that she make, it be comin' to me

And the next for the playa, but I know ho's shit
Cuz that's slowin' down the money that she can go get
She's a polite assassin, always classy
Exotic, erotic, far beyond trashy
Female rider, keep the heat inside
Down with gangsta shit and my getaway driver
She is J's baby, number one lady
Luv the way she play me and drive these niggas crazy
She's a ??? Swiss, and I'm her pimp

Leanin' on the wall what's the use?
To a groove so smooth and outta sight?
Get on the floor and dance all night!

It's a dance tune by the PC
That's the Poison Clan and we
Came to the party to make y'all move
So just get down to the Poison groove

And groove with the Poison Clan
'Cause if you came to sit, make a change of plans
And do what's only right
Just get on the floor and dance all night

All you see is grins
People movin' away from the bass bins
'Cause of that bottom
Most of you even scared to stand by them

Well here's a taste
Straight from the studio known for the Ghetto Bass
Made to invite, no sittin' down
So get up and dance all night

Now dance 'cause I said so
Bust a move and go with the flow
It's the Clan, with a hyped-up dub

Whether dancin' or sittin'

Debonaire? 

[ANGIE:] Debonaire? 

[DRUGZ:] Yeah. 

[ANGIE:] Uh uh. All the girls tell me that he's no good. 

[DRUGZ:] Oh, aaight, I ain't gon' argue, but yo, wussup with me? My name is

[ANGIE:] Look, all you Poison Clan brothers are no good. 



[Verse 1: Debonaire] 



Debonaire's bad and so I'm called the Devil's Dad 

I kick the funky stuff because I'm rough, and I'ma add 

That, girls, I cold leave 'em, I totally deceive 'em 

I soothe and then relieve 'em, and then you best believe I'm, 

Outie-5000, and I find another bitty 

They tell me it's a pity, I want to get the whole city 

Girl, so don't you be shocked, you best to get set 

Women say I'm sick, but ask me have I seen a vet yet? 

Naw, I just keep on, I keep hoe-in' 

I keep goin' nowhere and, I can't stop and so in 

About a two year period I think I'll put Jim in, 

Wait up, lemme see, well, about a hunderd women 

(Damn!) Because of that, lots of women want to hate ya 

But I'm sayin', yo, it's in my nature!

Lovin' and leavin', that's what I believe in 

Yo! I only think about me when I'm skeezin' 

So, women get mad and call me everything from A to Z 

But I don't care, 'cause you know, I'm the J to T, 

To the dollar sign, and you will hardly find 

Another brother with a pipe game as good as mine 

So I flaunt the gift that I was given 

And don't ask because you know how I'm livin' 

(True.) Bein' in love's for the birds; I ain't a pigeon 

They say love is blind; I got 20/20 vision 

(Word.) So if you don't want your feelings hurt, 

Don't be on my back like you a Poison Clan t-shirt 

And when I tell you these things, it's not to make you 

Mad at me, but you should know it's in my nature

It's facts that I'm kickin', so girl, ain't nothin' made up 

I'm talkin' on a straight-up, 

but still you're sayin' to hold up and wait up 

You think I'm lyin', while talkin' of my nature then 

It's not my fault that all the women want to hate ya when 

People can't help it, they shouldn't want to hate ya, 

But they think it's voluntary, not just in my nature 



[DRUGZ:] Yo, now you see what I'm sayin'? 

Yo, Debonaire and JT, they ain't got no flavor, but I'm versatille! 

[ANGIE:] Uh-uh, 'cause y'all run the same ol' game, day after day.

Lie to get down, bang the boots, then I'm outie

As long as there's fish in the sea, I'll be fishin' 

'Cause one's not enough; I ain't a wimp, I'm a pimp, 

And uh, I ain't lonely for no relationships! 

You want to be the girl that I hate? I ain't frontin' 

'Cause this ain't the A-Team, slim, You Gets Nothin' 

No money, no clothes, or a lil' kiss

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth Mart jeans, take that off

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
I said give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

Yeah, save the narrative, you savin' it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you savin' it for karats
You wanna see how far I'm a go
How, much I'ma  spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Crist', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me, c'mon

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me

I said give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
I'm a hustler baby (uh, Hov')
I just want you to know (Hov')
It aint where I been
But where I'm bout to go (Hov', Hov')
Now I just wanna love you (young Hova)
But be who I am (know you love me)
And with all this cash (mo' money, mo' problems)
You'll forget your man

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Ro-mancing girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah, to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L.A., Bubblin' in Dublin
Can't deny me, why would you want to
You need me, why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me, Hov'!

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

Uh, uh huh",I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me) [Remix],2001
J.U.I.C.E.,"Am I happy - maybe not 
But I never wanna lose what I got 
I wouldn't trade it for anything dear to my heart, oh no 
You take the good times with the bad 
How else would you know happy from sad 
Sooner or later 
You gonna have to finally look back 

And you'll look back and see 
What happened in between 
And you'll appreciate 
Each and every single day 

The pop of the cork 
And the cling of the glasses 
We toast to the future 
And we drink to the past 
It might not be easy 
But nevertheless 
These are the best days (of our lives) 

Sometimes the weather can be rain 
But one day it will be sunny again 
Without the clouds of life 
It's just another sunny day 

The pop of the cork 
And the cling of the glasses 
We toast to the future 
And we drink to the past 
It might not be easy 
But nevertheless 
These are the best days (of our lives) 

These are the times 
That I will never forget 
These are the best days (of our lives) 

And you'll look back and see 
What happened in between 
And you'll appreciate 
Each and every single day 

The pop of the cork 
And the cling of the glasses 
We toast to the future 
And we drink to the past 
It might not be easy 
But nevertheless 
These are the best days (of our lives) 

It might not be easy 
But nevertheless 
These are the best days of our lives
",Best Days,2002
J.U.I.C.E.,"[Juice speaking]
""They say there is no hope for the young generation. I beg
to differ. I feel like we gon' go there, you know. You all
just got to trust us. It's like they don't trust us. When
you think about it though, it's up to us to make it happen. For real.""

[Chorus] [Kahea]
Don't worry about what happen then
Just know that we can win
Keep your head up and smile within
YOu know we gon' make it
Doesn't matter if they don't believe
You know we will suceeed
Got through the bad times to live the good times
We gon' make it

[Verse 1]
Now we possessing old souls but we young folks
I figure generation X will give us some hope
We all some lost souls, all seeking knowledge bad
It's all the same, whether dropouts or college grads
And 2001 was timulturous
Tith all these terrorist attacks on our culture, plus
In NY, we had to watch the buildings crumble down
And Lisa ""Left Eye"" is gone, so we humble now
To tell the truth, I still bug on how Aaliyah left
But if you look when it's cold, you could see her breath
""One in a Million"" girl, and there ain't too many flows that I can do
But Ness, he made me hear the soul in the sample
Funerals, the only time the hood come together
And when a kid pass away young, he's young forever
Preserved in the image that the good lord made him
Generation why, they can't fade him, No

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm chilling with this gangbanger from the west side
He ask me why am I alive and all the rest die
Little hustler, he had just lost his best friend
Somebody let the pistol blow like the west wind
I told him, death is like magic, homies disappear
I mean, we know their spirits living, but we miss them here
I told him, ""Player listen, you were blessed to be hear""
Finally, took a puff of smoke to make him see clear, see there
He been hustling for three years, spillin malt cheap beer for this tee's peers
Little chip, so I asked him ""Where's your momma man?""
And he said, ""Well, she's with Dr. King in the promise land.""
I told him, ""Do your thing but never lose your focus
My only hope is that you learn about what hope is.""
And oh yeah, I know about what selling dope is
To tell the truth, we do the same thing in show biz
Now keep living

[Chorus] plus
Though we came to get paid, and sometimes it's not the right way
But if you learn something this day, we can make it

[Verse 3]
I used to hang on the block, with the glock
From six o'clock to six o'clock
I used to tell all the haters, forget me not
Then the whole world found out I MC hot
These old folks call us thugs right
Big rims and froze ropes, we love life
So I have to say something to today's youth
Whether you sipping grey goose or pray to Jesus, hang loose
There's nothing that can stop us, no crooked coppers
It's time to get our proppers, now's the time
Broke, I done been there a million times
Cheese that don't melt, little children crying
And that's why corrupt thoughts fill their mind
Cats come out the projects and still they shine
So whether MVA or NBA, call my niggas on the block
I'll simply say, keep hustling

[Chorus]",We Made It,2005
J.U.I.C.E.,"Alright Mr. Thanksgiving
It's for the money this time (Drama)

Howdy do motherfuckers, it's Weezy Baby
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta tote the cannon
Listen close I got duct tape and rope
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'Bannons
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin'
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it
Bet that baby
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes
Get back get back boy this a set back
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap
You're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again

Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for ya
Nigga talk to the (cannon)
Have a few words with the (cannon)
Tell it to my mother fuckin' (cannon)
Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for ya
Nigga talk to the (cannon)
Have a few words with the (cannon)
Tell it to my mother fuckin' (cannon)

Ayo
I make it hard for rap niggas I'm peer pressure
Matter fact I'm motivation to rap better
I show niggas how to act how to dress better
I stay fresh more fitted caps than bat catchers
I'm the crack 
The smack 
The gun 
The rule 
The gat 
The strap 
The gun 
The tool 
The motherfuckin' (cannon)
Other words I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill
The deal is sealed
Niggas ain't real as Will cause I'm a (cannon)
And I handle well pedal like Cannondale
And I got the fifty cal mag its a hand-held
I'm tellin' you niggas I pop put a shell in you niggas
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas
I got whores in the cannon camcorder bendin' over
Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

From Philly to where I'm landin I'm a cannon
And I'm on that Philly fire shit
Then I come fully equipped
You try me get bodied keep the shawty in the whip
If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him
Sing a long da da da di I'm free got the butters 
Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada
Homie know I'm inside of your house
Tie up your brother
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card
You chumps, you best call General Motors
I will, take control of your soldiers
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken
General toaster

This rap shit like diggin' in the register, dealin' with big embezzlers
Get it right, I'm better and better than my competitors
Ahead, another level up, me, I'm worth eleven plugs
I can stop rappin', ain't I already said enough?
The whole motherfuckin' game owe me, time to settle up
If I move forward a little slower, you'll be catching up
Man that's the shit you need to listen for
'Cause where I'm from niggas dumb, they'll give you what you're itching for
It's a issue with you, best to handle your business, bro
'Cause ain't no politicking when killas comin' to get you, bro
Hey, although, they don't know the whole fire
In the dark, shoot sparks like rim with no tire
I don't deal with the lames, I'd much rather blow by ya
They known to spit a lot of hot air like blow dryers
And I'm really off the wire, look at me, I'm on fire
Here's some useful information if you don't know sire
Snort that cake (cake), and I'm not fake (fake)
So you should strongly consider doin' an about-face
And if not all you gotta say is you wanna get busy
And I'm down, get wit' me, any time, pick a city

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,2005
J.Z.,"[Scoob:]
Hah hah, hey hey, laugh now nigga
My man's right behind you, Kane pull the trigger
I don't play, I'm from the hill where shit is real
And I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
So bring your grip or you can think twice
'Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket
I cut hand, you still can't get no cards
You couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playin cards
But if I got beef and it's time for code red
My drill is like a hoe, and be takin mad niggaz to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join a army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from? England, you somebody great?
You burnin Scoob, ""I don't think so mate""
I got the style that gets you open like a bag of smoke
I have your friends ""Ah-hah man, that shit ain't dope""
Leave me alone when I'm rocking on the microphone
and play like E.T. and phone your black ass ho-wome
Yo Sauce, if you're down with the groo-hoove
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Sauce:]
Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder
how you got dope like Sauce, money you didn't do it
I write my own with bigger hope, drink of Scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
N. B. A. style, fantastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight I write left-handed
'Cause I like, to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win, lose or draw, I'm bookin whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take Eddie
if I was Fred, I think I'd have to bone Betty
Suckin and luckin, hey, niggaz I'm duckin, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So Shyheim, if your down with the groove
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Shyheim:]
Yo, yo
I spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by Tiger
So check me out, as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a Metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killin'
when I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
'Cause I rock the world from U.S.A. to Asia to Russia
If your shit stinks I'ma flush ya, then bust ya
Like a crazy man from Cali son
My jams be packed like a Farrakhan rally, what?
You know my style, I put the F in effin foul
The Rugged Child locks you down like Rikers Isle
And got more girls than a Trailerload with Shabba
More Super than Cat, I'm the punani Don Dada
So Big Daddy, if you're down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Big Daddy Kane:]
Now tell me whoooo is the man?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And steppin to me, thinkin I can be touched? Huh
Not even Michael Jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That is I thrown ya, scold ya, Jones ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What did I just show ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
and see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah that's feared great, leavin rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none! Huh
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me, 
but with with speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better G
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with
The non-resistible, non-competible
No, No I'm not sayin' I'm the best, I'm just sayin' I'm fuckin' incredible!
And let's just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good
So Jay-Z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Jay-Z:]
Uh, one checkin it two, checkin it three
Check out the J, check out the A, check out the why, check out the Z
Hey G!
I'm breaking MC's up like EPMD
And these nuts if you rappers tryin ta see me
I'm buckwild with styles, ta-dow
I've been in it runnin a hundred miles I'm well endowed, baby gal
Uhh, the greatest nigga to touch it, you niggaz can't fuck with
The, incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eatin me up, you fast fuckin with jigga
I'm like Prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it

Get on the mic and show and prove

Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a FLICK, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like ""Well god damn what's the recipe?""
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
she says ""go ask your God damned father!""
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas thing they all that, yo, that shit is G

She was with her mom at Bank of America
I'm with my son cashing a check, so I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world or fly, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, momma looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about his girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever starts
So I zoomed off thinkin' bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (what did she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you Then I say

Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin' off, tryin' to dunk, tryin' to dribble
Break fast threw the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess with it please don't
Told her I'm goin home she asked can she go too
I'm like yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-threw thong on looked at her and I said

Get clout when I'm out, money what I'm all about
In a world that's so shady
Peep this streetness, never had a weakness
Peep this, I do this daily
Follow my whole set, bottles of moet

Six feet in the dirt, I'm the one with the work
Got hits but they try to spray me

Cold with the flow, dro when it goes

Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down 'cause he feel us

But, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge, and we ride to the end

Took alive with live men, my man got three-six to eighteen
And only five in, the belly of the beast
Didn't want to hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets

Nigga, picture me hot, then picture me not
In this spot with this glock and these rocks to cops
I know every basehead from here to the wasteland
With keys, and connects me and Cease ???
Sell water from the cookpot, ain't that raw?
My razors? 20 dollars, here's a case of four
You supply that, shit I put a hole where your mind at
Push your hairline back, fucking with this sly cat
You know exactly what I'm talking about (Clue!)
You know the game and this life, what this thug about
One of the last real niggas trying to get in the game
But the verse on the first on the strip getting paid
You feel me? Niggas spending ??? for the jewelry
Then run around frontin like they money is filthy
I'm in the game to clean minds, fuck you want?
I had coke for too long, I supply that boat

I've been in the spot, pop the buscuit, the coke out the drawer
Here niggas grimy, we take ends out your pockets
I want the kid's pictures and the cars and the wallets
He wants them big things like them ?Tits? and ?Dolly Partons?
Got mad bodies, ?Roy is hotter than Cochran?
Besides niggas albums, a lot about dropping
Fuck break dancing, our guns do the popping
We don't stop, we drop, shut it down
Rock the undergrounds, cock then gun 'em down
Now, you want war? Fuck guns, bring grenades
Fuck all you sons that's dockin that shade
Niggas be fronting, acting like they in Hollyhood
I catch a nigga slipping I'm popping two in his hood

",Crime Life,1999
Ja Rule,"I represent Gangsta Shit 
Niggas that spent time on the brick for keys on the strip 
Loadin' my clips givin' ass niggas the shits 
Life's a bitch got to murder to get rich 

And infamous that's when the game gets deep 
Gotta re up cop heat and hit the streets 
Now the feds is buggin' me D.T. straight fucking me 
The whole operation shook bitches ain't loving me 

No more see I gotta make a switch 
Should I lay low or run wild and stick shit 
Ran up a team, that's strictly dedicated to cream 
It's time to go outta town and wash niggas clean 

For everything they got, leave nothing to spare 
But the shells on the ground when that ass is shot 
And once again it's hot, but this time there's a snitch 
Thought he was dead when he got hit in state Mich. 

Turn states to evidence, we on the run 
Representing all illegal drugs and guns 

[Chorus] 
Where all my gangsta niggas at? 
Supply the town with coke and Hen(Hennesey) and Cuban contacts 
We keep them coming back, plus the one's that copped crack 
Raw cut, overdose off the feedback, alone 
Intoxicated from the Cognac, charge that Al Capone suite to Ammex 
Valley to Lex, that black hand is on deck 
We rollin' in, peelin' notes off of G stacks, We Murderers 

This fuckin' life's got me feeling like a lefty 
It's alright, I'll go hard, make sure this world don't forget me 
It's like my game's virtual, based on reality 
I'm speeding like a bullet at high velocity 

You think you stopping me, I think not 
Ain't too many who known to do it properly 
I'm likely to get so high like Tony be, toasted bein' free 
And trip out occasionally, you know 

'Cause it ain't nothing for me to touch you 
But for you to touch Ja, yet to been proved, I'm still breathing 
Current age, those dopes want to live, gotta get paid to do so 
The average mind can't elevate and grow, calculate the dough 

Analyze and invest where it's profitable, marketable 
Billboards hot shot debut 
Ja Rule Unstoppable 

[Chorus] 

Fear, that is my logic, the suit's made a composite sketch of this object 
Blazing through the projects, E.S. Lex coach edit, new shit 
Got a nice connect, 12, five the brick, Heading o.t. 
With this chick who like to slay, drink baby, snort coke and weed 

Half Trinidadian and Vietnamese 
She made a habit of calling a nigga daddy 
Would die for me gladly, felonious, I taught her well 
Took her heavenly body and showed it hell 

I made a lot of dough with her, she was my top nigga 
Knew the rules to the game but painted her own picture 
She wanted everything black and white 
Never paying attention to the gray areas in life 

Stayed up half the night, wondering is my dough all right 
Is she high on the job, or maybe she's getting robbed 
Quick picked up the mac milli, ready to get involved 
'Cause my .44 revolves around this 

Fucking with Black Gang, all you get is hot lead 
Motherfuckers, cause you know that shit 

[Chorus: x2]",Represent,1999
Ja Rule,"Bitch!
Brick city, yo
Yo, yo funk doc straight lunatic since young
I ate paint chips the rare moon
That pair mics, my maintenance
I battle you and then me and meth exchange shifts
For money, to your house arrest anklet
I take it all, if not, here's a thousand
Bricks, be shooting fair ones with bail bonds men
I'm constant, on that paper chase
Blow zip codes from bricks to 8-1-8
Doc serve til you lickin' the plate
Battle royal, in the ring smoking like doc out of oil
Fire thrown to the roof of you apartment
Hit 95 then I hide with the waltons
Down south, the forty-four feela
I'm a dolo nigga, you a polo nigga
I'm an uptown shopper, you a soho nigga
Westside highway running, homo nigga

I'm the sultan of the ghetto
The homicidal aficionado
I empty niggas out like cristal bottles, uh
When I battle, I'm breaking bentleys down to gravel
I got the heat right here, we ain't got to travel
I'm bigger than producers, I figured out you losers
I knew my longevity confuse ya
Big paper game, come on run into these flames
Recognize the power of the royal king james
Phantom menace, that's why niggas make faces like they drinking guinness
When they realize I'm not finished
I've been paid, I've been platinum, been spittin', uh
Been eatin', been ballin' and you know I'm shittin'
Platinum links, chinky-eyed blonde haired honeys sippin' rainbow colored drinks
Black thugs with white minks, ready to jack the brink
Bend your little wifee over help her stretch out the kinks
That's why ya niggas freeze when I step up in the building
The godfather's here giving blessings to his children
Carats shine, the world all mine
Can't believe these cats is poppin' shit about papers in their rhymes
Or bodies they collect, black gotti shot a tech
Them gangsta visions will have you ass up in an ambulance
Cats ain't live, look up in my eyes
We can do this one more time, I'll let you decide
The alize swigger, I clock twelve figgas
Think giuliani's rough I got some real shit for niggas
Never been defeated, niggas retreated
Made the choice to be seated until my mission's completed
Get loose, get loose, method man get loose
What the world gonna do when my dogs get loose?
(blaze one) blaze one (blaze one) blaze one
Blaze, blaze, blaze one

Now four corners, four seasons
Four mc's with four reasons to bring this game to its knees
And why you down there, suck my dick
My whole motto is fuck it
Hit the smoke shop and blow my budget
Mc's abusing my bitch, using my shit
I'm hanging off the roof with one hand, losing my grip
Now y'all don't wanna see me do that, now do you?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you?
I do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where you'll find my buried treasure
I'm still wild, still tical
Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, individual
Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits
Too many rappers be on john gotti's dick
Now this is something that we don't rehearse
Put that rap shit second, and hip-hop first

Easy, ain't nann niggas spitting like me
Nor murderers motherfuckin' inc
Niggas will pass me, look me in the face, ask me
Are y'all really holdin' weight or did somebody gas me?
Ja be the myth, reggie hand me the fifth let me explain
Your lil' man made me give him a lift
So you ridin' with gangstas
I'm up to a whole lot of other shit
Murderers is the clique, niggas can't deal with
Try it (hataz) you gonna get yours to the heart
Lesson tonight by the four-four
Niggas want more than a little bit, hot shit
L.l. an red
Ja rule with hot nix I'm the best at that shit
So bitches explain this
We ride dick so well, head game from hell
I love making them yell, my name

Look, I'm inhumane livin' in this house of pain
Stuck with a thousand street hustlers
Down on they luck
Repeat felons caught up with the death I was sellin'
And for the past three months yo I can still hear my victims yellin'
But I can't listen to my conscience it's nonsense
If I didn't shoot I'd be the nigga in the suit in the box under the ground
Fox chased by the hound locked permanent frown xzibit get down
By liftin' iron by the pound for the tough individual
Runnin' run his mouth throw some hands with the general
Walk one day in the shoes of a criminal
Death disease keep your luxuries to a minimal
I'm not talkin' about weed, jewels, & bentleys
I'm talkin' about clean clothes, hot food, and dentyne
See what I mean livin' with the scum of the earth
Hit with plenty of time to adjust to life on the inside

Look I ain't do this shit you don't want to hear my side
But you believin' that bitch
You makin' my nerves bad I need to smoke me a jo'
'cause I know y'all ain't even thinkin' 'bout lettin' me go
Where my lawyer, nigga told me juv' I can't do nothin' for ya
Y'all go tell that to my mother & my father
But they gon' cus y'all so don't you even bother
You know that shit ain't right that bitch didn't see nothin'

This is my third felony plus my third strike
Man I ain't goin' home I got 25 to life.

Qu new york, you try to criticize me I criticize you
Been the same muthafucka since in high school
Any beat I shed light to with crazy wattage
Blankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars
Learned who not to trust grew obnoxious
So niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us
Circlin' but they don't slow down take you to court
Think you seein' judge joe brown they just actin'
Indy's throwin' tyson back in another year
Fuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at bust in the air
Give me space beats with plenty bass drink my hennessey straight
'til I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts
And turn killers into girl scouts works of art

Still the thought of murderer true to the sport

Now I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out
Hollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now
Niggas is real wild bangin' before trial
New kicks new trial I don't give a fuck
I'm playin' the yard ox taped to my nuts
Ready to self destruct lord I don't want to die

I know that real recognize every hustle
And die with these niggas in the struggle

Unknown cat never voted picture me on the scene

Mashed down in the fatigues servin' the fiends
Kill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve
In the city slicker bust checks or puff cess
Ruffneck love liquor & act figures bloodsport on the streets
No gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts
Ugh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug

What if he was? what if he was me? (one of us) what the fuck would I do? 
Lord, when I die pacify, crucify me 
I rock a devil cross, one's for the soul one's for the body 
If I'm built then god dies, I want to see God cry 
Real tears from a burned out life in ten years 
I sware I got the devil in me, with no fear

Look at my life style it's dangerous
When I was young this sorta life was contagious
Hustlin' hard like them sharks down in Vegas
My gat and I come bust spontaneous
This world made us to take only what they gave us
The game is our loss
Watch yo gloat
Then show you that this world ain't yours

And leave strips wide open

To the evil of money and drugs and lost woman
But that's what I'm lovin' about livin'
Bein' I see my birth as a givin'
Knowin' my inner limits
This game ain't no scrimmage
Lets play big we're winners

For when I die please take me off your shit list

I got a lust for this money
Admire them old timers
Assume with no conscience
Made a world so chaotic
Opened up my mind and introduced me to narcotics
Brand new whips not this thicks the hottest chicks
I just can't seem to keep them off my dicks
The difference is y'all did y'all thing on the low
Made a lot of doe
We did our thing high pro
Thou we still blew
I wish I knew dirty money was evil
I never understood until I lost a few people
Dead and gone still their memory lives on
Throw a mural up let them niggas them was loved
Now were in to better things
Got our hands on every ring
Crime in the streets
Cause it's my time
I draw the line between love and war really

Pray

Daddy's little baby, must learn this world is shady
And the color of your skin don't make you less of a lady
Degrade yourself, never cuz I'm teaching you better
Life ain't all about cheddar diamonds and leather
Understand you a black sister, in this white man's
World, don't let it get ya, down girl
It's essential that you grow amongst your group
So you don't grow too fast and be doin lord knows who
Cuz daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different
What I, do for a living is a talent I'm given
And I'ma raise you too black too strong beautiful
Tell the truth let you know what women go through
Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gone cheat
So be careful in the heat baby girl wit cold feet
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you daddy's little baby ha

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever

Yo Ja's imagery is somewhat like God and his chemistry
Blasphemy, I tell my baby girl proudly
Put her over my knee and let her know this world is yours
Men are dogs take it from daddy and hold yours
Head high lady, love is bout lies and deception
Will always be seen through the eyes
In my demise don't cry just, hold on
Stay headstrong and live to learn that life goes on
The day you was born God answered my cry for help
I look at you a female replica of myself
I was conceived 2/29 you 9/22
God' whats the science in this sign you threw?
I wanna know just so I can spread the jewel to my youth
So she don't have to come up like I did runnin loots
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
For real

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever

When I look in yo eyes I see stars
It's me and you against the world
Baby it's in the signs
And anything you want you can get it daddy's getting it done
You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones
And go through rain sleet and snow to kiss the sun
Though my travel through the storm has just begun
Swear to god when my sister died, I was only five
Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life
Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me
She came at the time when nobody cared for me
This world's tough, I'ma guide you through it carefully
Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free
My little lady, can't quite understand me now
But baby, in time I'll break it down
So keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
For real

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever

Don't you want to leave tonight and fuck wit me

Its on me, if you married, then get a divorce 
When I hits it, some women get twisted 
Have 'em twitchin', like ""damn look what the dick did"" 
I just want to hit it the worst way, right after a long day 
And put the puss on lay-a-way, heard me?

Baby girl if you wanted ass, why don't you eat it?

Is y'all motherfuckers ready or what?

They got my back against the building
I'm the villian that's creeping around corners
Like shorty you see them niggas creeping around, warn us
We might be coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do
Or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me
Doctor says let them die said his fucking dog bit me
I don't know whats wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turning into murderers
Couldn't fuck with a third of us
Still against me
And wanting to see me in the box
Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.
Leave you Red like Foxx
Ain't nothing funny about that
I see you in a coma, ain't coming up out that
You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and bust another slug on you

I bring beef to a closure
Know somethin?

I leave bullets lodged leave you leaning on your broad
And our punks leave you gagged up in your car
Slumping Kennedy-style with your memory out

Let the gat blow leave you bleeding on your patio
I leave rivals on their backs looking up at the sky blue
Not only do I leave you I hide you

Shot up in broad day

Whenever you see blood

Lay you down for the love
That's us 
Leave the lights on
Knife through your windpipe
Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right
You thinking it's alright 
But it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Giving niggas facelifts and taking it
While making you bleed
And if I got a taste of the shit I'm taking more than you need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up wrap his body up in a area rug
Who holding the heat?
Who leaving niggas cold in the street?

Y'all know who the fuck this is
You know we would kidnap yo kids
You know what the fuck we do
Murder bitch niggas like you
For real, all the time, any place, anywhere
Y'all niggas could get it
Act like y'all don't know

In a world that's ice cold, blacks die slowly
Cats snatch rollies, gats'll leave you holy
My momma always told me the streets will slow me down
Daddy never showed me how the heat will hold me down
So now I rob and steal, spit shit you feel, wit a clique that kills
Yea my shit's that real, I hustle hard all my life
Ran the streets all night
My wife always said everything was gonna be aight
And she was right and that's one reason why I love her
But everything she said went in one ear and out the other
Word to mother, look at it from a thug point of view
When the kids need clothes, what a thug gon do?
Hit the streets and hustle, pick up the heat and bust you
I'm tryin' to eat like Russel
Murda is my hustle But you keep chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch, when the eight (.8mm) spit
You could feel the hatred, taste it
You high right now, you ain't ready to die right now
The .45 will calm you down, you under trauma now
It's drama how a child will shut shit down
Kill a nigga for the fuck of it I get you touched for chips
Fuck that shit, fuck the whip, and fuck you bitch
You can just suck my dick

If you chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker, we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch
When the .8 spit you could feel the hatred, taste it
It's your blood, when we show blood, we murderers (murderers)
We throw slugs, we hustlers (hustlers) we sell drugs
And tell thugs live it up till yo time stops

Yo I give a fuck if y'all niggas hate me
I drop bodies off where the lakes be
But lately, I've been hittin' cribs
And safes where the cake be
I take three to the vest for the love of the dolla
I put that hot shit through you and watch you Holla Holla
The same niggas that I ball wit I'ma brawl wit
I'm a tank running in banks and takin' all of it
Player we're flawless, wit nothin' to lose guns bustin'
And brossen niggas y'all can't live
Funny shit about it, niggas wanna hit me, forget about it
Thug shit I'm still livin' y'all niggas just spit about it
I rob and stomp niggas 2/3rd of my life
The other 1/3 spent sittin' on curbs chasin' those birds
If you ever get the urge to come by and try to test
There's only one and then you get numb and lied to rest
It's murder the only code to the ghetto
It's murder, nigga hand me the Bessel
And dance with the devil, guns rapidly spit
Gangsta shit, attractin yo bitch, gettin head and lean back in the whip
I mastered the chips, Nigga I'm tryin to tell you
You're holdin hammers and nails and
We have you where the dogs couldn't smell you

Any nigga think not, I'ma pop him
Put the lean on niggas the minute I spot em
Who's gettin' it, I got him nigga dead and gone
Gonna guide em to the cross roads show em how those guns blow
I'ma degenerate nigga addicted to hydro, switchin' four lanes
Top down wit my eyes closed, got a death wish
Money, drugs, and murderer shit
What you want with this? We'll kidnap yo kids
And clap up yo crib, It's the murderers

Shall not be condemned
But he that believeth not
Is condemned already
Only because
He has not believed
In the man and the only begotten son
My Lord

For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry 
Cause I live to die
Wit my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky 
And my guns in the sky

Yeah, 
Why would you leave somethin' you love here to die
In the cold
And it grows
Like a concrete rose
You the fool ain't I
Till I withered and died
On the same streets you left me 
And, screamin' Lord let me in
I don't know where to begin
Since I lost yo love
But then again your love
Was strictly for the drugs
I don't know whether to hug
Or to fill you with slugs
Fuckin' them whores
Instead of claiming what's rightfully yours
Holdin' my heart from all the pain you caused
With no direction you left your first born lost
Give or take a few
Cause my hate for you
Grew, over the years
Through blood, sweat, and tears
I wanted to be just like you
My father figure, now I want to fight you 
You bitch nigga, left me 'lone
And parts of me never out grown
The fact that left home 
When moms was so strong
Don't let them get you fed
This world is yours she said
Now nothin that stoppin me but two to the head
In life there's more to come
When its all said and done

Cause I live to die
Wit my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky 
And my guns in the sky

But what a nigga live for
And damn ready to die young
I'm the shadow behind the gun
Look at what I've become
The fear of many niggas
The floss of most bitches
The love that runs deepest
In the hearts of street niggas
Raised in the ghetto
By the ghetto
Was taught young to pop the medal
That's how shit get settled
Learn to cook up the coke
Never leave home without toast
Learn to fly my bitches with birds not coats
Never trust ya, from a toddler to hustla
I was trained as a youngsta, to cock back and slug ya
Love me or hate me, ya only son
Let me live or kill me, the chosen one
Ja, under the gun gotta kill 'em for show
If you want it you gonna get more then you askin for
Lifes got more to come
But when its all said and done
You lost one love
Your only begotten son

For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood

Cause I live to die
Wit my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky 
And my guns in the sky

I wanted to be fam of yours
Looking now at nothin' more than
Two lost souls 
Lookin' to meet at the cross roads
I burn the hydro
Lay back with my eyes closed
In deep thought like Brittany is somethin' I'd die for
How the fuck do you sleep at night?
Knowin' you wrong the only thing you ever did right
Despite the loss I stretch the length of a short
Now I got a new father whose name is New York
Runnin' wild in the streets
With heat, we don't talk
Cause when its cold you basically live life in dark
When light would shine from the heavens
And bless one Ja Rule loved
Your only begotten son

For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry 
Cause I live to die
Wit my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky 
And my guns in the sky

For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood

In my race against time I, can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life 

God, why the hell am I here?
Is it a blessin', or a painful lesson
Of life and its directions?
Date of conception two twenty nine
I was birthed and won't be denied
Lookin' into these eyes
And witness lives' tragedies
The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me
For every lock there's a key
The only thing that ever made me click was ""Cash Money""
So that I lust for
Be it one of my deadly sins
You know the seven 
I got all of them deep within
Sometimes I slip, but you be there
Pick me up, now I'm on my knees like what's up
'Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick
Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence 
Got me to a better sense
Cause what's yours is mine
Hear me lord, I'm runnin' out of time

[Repeat: x2]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light

Even if I'm gettin' too high

Nobody cry for me
Cause I, want to see you smile for me
When I die look through my windows, to the soul
Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old
Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talented warmer world
Which is so cold
Take me 
Save me 
Before I'm crazy
The only reason I live
Is for my baby
Never did you tell me that 
Life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this 
Shit might be changed
But now I'm just racin' against time 
Tryin' to survive
And see why 
Y'all niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie 
Get drunk and stay high
Don't de-nigga-ny 
Cause they'll never take me alive
Feel me lord 
I'm runnin' out of time

Runnin' through the red light

Even if I'm gettin too high
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life 

I fears no man
But when its time to go
I'm gone
Racin' through the darkness
Learnin' what's right from wrong
Lookin' for the light
But all I see is the night
When everything else is bright
What happened to my life?
Is this what I am?
Is this what I've become?
A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin' and no one
Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire within my soul 
I must set this whole world on fire
If I control my destiny
Maybe one day I'll give this world the best of me
You know I never been one to judge right or wrong
I embraced and showed you love
Then I throw slugs
At the other side
Go get 'em in broad day light
What a nigga would give to live my life
You don't want it
Cause if you could get it you would try
Feel me lord

[Verse 1]
I love niggaz who talk drama till the gun is stuck in they face
Screaming for they mama,

Don't let this young nigga decieve you,

I'll bring so much heat, one side of the earth will melt, then step off
Bitty boppin, chain rockin, notch in my belt,

I got plans to spend a million and more
Before I hit a million and four, before death, 
pull a gun on me squeeze one in me
I'm trying to make sure, niggaz want none of me
You just don't know what these streets have done to me, what's become of me
I was raised in a world so cold it's numbened me, I'm so dirty I'm filthy
I done scared so many niggaz, It's gonna take a scared nigga to kill me

Cause you'se a sometime thug, sometime seeking the law
I'ma seek to you it you breathe no more, when we crash the door
It's not a game, Pesci don't laugh no more, black Tahoe
Stashing the door, fitting beautful in it
A nigga jinxed so there's a urinal in it, on the belt do the usual limit
You know, double five, heading to L.I to buckle the pies
Before I die I want you speakers to bleed my name
Cafe, weed leaky K, franchise three of the same
I let my niggaz hit this man, cause ain't nuttin but X's on my hitlist, man
And I'm a business man in the city, don't force the kid

When I pop up, niggaz better head for the hills 
Act up and you gon see how many heads'll get killed
Starter for war, dog I'm holdin plenty of gunz

Why, would a nigga with so much talent 
Want to throw it all away to drugs and violence? 
I know not the answers but I ask the questions 
Do all Muslims really study their lessons?
And how many Christians lie during confessions? 
I know I did when I was just a kid
Never told about the guns my uncle hid under my bed
And at night I played with them
Kind of grew up to be sort of a loose cannon 
Before my sins, I'm asking you to let me in Lord help me,
I been through all the pain now I want to know who loves me

The other night I was up at Farmers, politician wit some bloods
They told me ""yo L, in the streets you ain't getting no Love
And Ever since the X's and the Jiggas came out
My niggas ain't trying to the hear that smooth shit you talk about
What's Up wit that cat Canibus, some played you out
Why you didn't answer back correctly, fuck was that about?""
As I sip on some henny, and try to explain some things
About the life of a legend, and all the Drama it brings
Been gone a long time, had a lot of shit on my mind
I decided I don't want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine
Streets is Hip-hop and I'm Hip-Hop, so the streets is Mine
Ballin' as long as you been livin', that's a long time
Hard to Stay hungry when your pockets are so fat
You hit a hot one in every city on the map
And niggas keep sleepin' and you keep coming back
You know better than the gat, but niggas still want to clap

It feels so good to be back Where I Belong
The Streets is Where I Belong
They Had me locked down much too long
Hey Hey

Some Say ""L that's cool, but see times have changed""
Niggas got red bandannas, and the grill in the range
That gold shit is dead, niggas rock platinum chains
Trade O.E. for Henny, Colt 45 for champagne
Hustling niggas found they way into the game
Extorting all these so called ballers wit big names
And you gotta have a squad, 'cause running from Def ain't safe
I know you living good, but ain't no smile up on our face
I'm like a villain, I'm representing on my lyrics
And force feed the world, even if they don't want to hear it
As far as Canibus go, my man is hittin' his ex-broad
I'm getting head from his new piece
While 20 gang-bangers applaud, you came up with that bullshit
Some heads sucked it up, then you dropped that garbage album
And Totally fucked it up, I coulda told ya I knew your moms
From the after-hours spot, when I used to be up in Canada
With the dreads on a black block, before you dick rode Lost Boyz
For a ticket our to Jersey, but being the man I am
I tried to show ya mercy, I could of told the World
The way ya label hates your guts
And how me and Wyclef, got together to set you up
And how he gave me half your budget, don't believe me look it up
Ya A&R promotion niggas, they helped me hook it up
I hate to be responsible, for destroying your career
A one-hit wonder, huh
No Wonder you disappeared, I could of told the world
You get your lyrics from the internet
Then spit 'em word for word
Like you really a rap vet, How you take metaphors from books
And put 'em in your rhyme, and how you really from Canada
And you been frontin' all this time
I heard your second album, that shit is garbage too
LL Cool J and I did this to you
On that note he said
""Yo L, you the man"", I said peace, one love
And Drove off in the Lex Land

Yea nigga, the jig is up nigga, huh ha
You know what I'm saying?, all that bullshit you was talking
Don't mean shit, you finish now
I'm still the man nigga 
The vanguard award is in my motherfucking living room
You know what I mean? come get that shit, fuck, what
MIC still on my arm nigga, word up
Both arms, I'ma get another one nigga

'Cause I got cheddar to get, I'ma foul and ???
With two co-defenders, drive by, Tah, and I
Said the dead don't die unless they fuck with Ja
If sellin crack is wrong, god forgive me for my sins
I bust my mack ten and them claps I'm spinnin' in

[Chorus]
We different, you can call us the Murdera's
We different, you don't want to fuck with us
We different, how we see the souls through the eyes
Live for life, its murda for life nigga
We different, you can call us the Murdera's
We different, you don't want to fuck with us
We different, how we see the souls through the eyes
Live for life, its murda for life nigga

My nigga silence is the code for killers, we let the chrome speak
And touch whoeva, 'cause no niggas beyond reach
We the drum heat, y'all niggas will fall faster
Spitting like nine raptors, crush 'em like linebackers
Nigga, this shit is a joke?  You die and ??? the laughter
And that's for, whoever intervene or stoppin' the green in it
For the longevity, check the pedigree 
So if I feel you ahead of me, tomorrow you'll neva see
We murderers with money to get, honies to hit
Rugars and dummies to spit, leavin you mummy to stiff
I'm one that'll flip, breakin the law chasin the raw
Beat you with the barrel of the gun, breakin ya jaw
Takin it all, fuck leavin the crumbs for niggas
Slum jones for niggas, now I strap up and come for niggas
And when I'm done with niggas they rest on they death bed
With the doctor pullin lead outta they head
I'll die for the bread

[Chorus]

I  don't really give a fuck about y'all niggas
I'll sabotage with niggas, 'cause niggas actin like bitches
Causing me to start shittin, I'm the Murderer
Who the fuck you thought you was?
Little man shut the fuck up, respect the boss
You gotta be kidding me, nigga you a kid to me
Suckin my dick when I was with the Click in nine-three
Get'cha own identity, you fuckin dick ridah
A year ago, nigga you was a b-boy for lifah
Stay frontin, when all eyes on the Jeeps
The only nigga I see puching somethin is me
I should be sunnin' y'all niggas for y'all cut
Fuckin on y'all sluts, but cha'll niggas ain't worth that much
You should be glad I'm shittin and shed light to the fact
If you shit back then maybe y'all niggas might go plat
I'm the pinnacle of that, young, stressed, and black
Think it out with the mind with the heart, attack
In the soul I tend to get attached, these the things that
Make me different, undeniably gifted
Its scripted that I'ma kill 'em all from the heart
The world's most dangerous, race against time, and march
Y'all niggas want to start the war right now
I hit 'em up and tear 'em right to the ground
Its the Murdera's, nigga you want it with us?
What the fucks up?  What the fucks up nigga?

[Chorus]",We Different,2000
Ja Rule,"Yo, throw your motherfuckin' middle fingers in the air, nigga
'Cause if y'all don't give a fuck, like we don't give a fuck
Throw your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

Motherfucker, the war is on, we're gonna pour it on
Niggas to be feminine, guns rapidly scenative
For the love of the Benjamins
Keep 'em leekin' an' bleekin' to dogs with his broads tremblin'
I'm sendin' him 'til the Lord, calls my adrenalin

You slow mo, niggas gettin' slow dough
Fuck your po'-po', I let the flow blow
Keep em' runnin' like Flo Jo, I flow so
Sickest murder, clip inserter, drop, pop an' rip your word up

We lust for more, can't touch crush the rope
Hit a club, then rush the door, niggas fuck the known
That's why we've been blazed, to you, froze it up
Had your name to the crease so you closed it up

I'm one in a mil, niggas got me gunnin' for real
Leavin' you nothin' to steal, so no pain to feel
So fuck the world, ya either get when you see the sink skin
No more than my thugs than your guns let off

I earned connections, every time I burn my weapon
Y'all niggas gonna learn your lesson
Fuck the Feds, nigga, we spit hollow heads
Our motto is 'Shed blood for dead thug'

That shed blood in hell, when my slugs set bail
Pray for death from your cell, I won't bet we got to jail
From pretty niggas with half a nickel flow
Them bitch niggas, they keep their dimes on the low

Y'all niggas is lame, commercial niggas, get out the game
We here now, shit's gonna change
We spit them things from point blank range at you
Then ask what the fuck you gon' do

Test the mic on your gun, lose your life an' your ones
I don't give a fuck where you from, niggas run when we come
I bust my gun 'cause I'm a bum from the gutter
You better know it's murda, motherfucker

Y'all ain't hear me, y'all with me
Throw your fuckin' fingers up, motherfucker
'Cause if y'all don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Throw your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

Nigga, I'm livin' my life, fuckin' your wife
Bendin' her up while I'm hollerin', “I don't give a fuck”
So I move like like it such and y'all can't get enough
Of The Murderers, it'll murda y'all, nigga, what, what?

I know y'all are ready to die, know why?
'Cause the pain is too much to bare while alive
So I cock my nine then close my eyes
Take another hit an' then creep an' blow minds

These are hard times, niggas, in these streets an' bust blind
Out of fear, out of despair but never in the air
We gonna take to this, point blank range in your Range Rov'
Pistol with the kids an' rape your stray hoe

We The Murderers, yo, what you expect from us?
We niggas you can't trust, that don't really give a fuck
We dedicated to street life, game an' hustle
I don't wanna be white, let them black an' live for struggle

My niggas tote guns for hittin' you an' your squad up
Now we got the upper hand, so keep your palms up
Niggas, if you want it with Ja, come in an' line up
Guaranteed you be meetin' your Maker, your times' up

Negative, I can go into the streets we live
Paper, foreign niggas be murderin' shit
So what, what? Niggas is holla, “Yo, what up?”
Murda Inc. is the movement that won't be touched

Motherfuckers, ya hear me? Murder Inc., niggas
'Cause if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Throw your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

We don't give a what, what?
All of my ladies, it's all gravy
Get your tubs up, it's murder, turn it up
Plus, ain't nobody hotter than Totti, so who you ridin' with?
Ladies hatin' blatantly hatin''cause they ain't hidin'

Dismiss hot chick, straight to the top chick
That'll chase you, that'll strip you
Off your crown an' replace you
When I stay laced, boo, in the top of the line
In the finest designers, from Fendi an' Gabbana

Players, if you want it, I got it, just come an' get it
Thugs, if you hustlin', hustlin', come an' get it
Mommy, if you rollin' with Totti, let's get this dough off
We don't give a fuck, what?

When y'all bitches start strutting I hit it and run
Cause I'm destined to cum on your tongue while we sexing
Like lubricant ruff ryde with the X-man

Know what? I'm gonna kiss you, cause daddy gonna miss ya

But sometimes this love shit is claustrophob
And I love thy, love to send you hoes the money

Are you a figment of my imagination?
Or am I one of yours?
Believe me baby, an hear me, fear me, feel me
That's why they all want to kill me dead
True in the head but nigga not
As soon as I get the drop
I pull up the pop of the test
It's outta the prairie
Bitches style juice running through my head
How many want to die nigga?
My concept It's irrational
My thinking now
I'm erratic like Mike W's whose falling down
I'm losin' sight now I can hardly see
And smoking all this fucking weed
I can barely breathe
I'm like tell a bitch bleed
Squeeze on D
Run up in the deli
Wrung up on D

Are ya watching me?
They be watching, niggas they be watching, keep watching
Keep watching me
Now don't look down
Are ya watching me?
They be watching, Bitches they be watching, keep watching
Keep watching me
Now don't look down
Whose watching me?

C'mon watch as I creep through your block
In the hard top drop
With my bead on knock
Cause cops I ain't standing
And gangstas know
Catching before hanging
And my dogs keep banging
Cause ain't shit changing
And hustlers ya'll keep slanging
We stuck in the game
Wit not a lot to gain
But everything to lose
But we soldiers that front-line
In days to rule
We do homicide drive-by's
Cock and spray
If you the last man standing
You about to lay
6 feet underground
Watch me now
Stop me how?
Y'all niggas trying to cop my style
I spit nothing but hot ones
And pop guns
Make it hard for niggas to function
Who want some of the Rule baby? (None of y'all)
I'm legally considered crazy
But if that's the way that God made me
This world can't change me
And that's the way it'll be
Caught in the dark
Until the light shines on me
I'm a slave to this game
But I'm break free
So keep watchin' me",Watching Me,2000

The, ills of the world 
In heat of drug dealin 
You and I then made a killin 
And tuck together 

I this land of forbidden treasure 
Love is the only evil seed that could sever 
A tied this close 
Not the love between us but your love for the dough 

You went O.T started makin M-O-N-E-Why 
All my good niggas gotta die 
But shit could last forever 
I wish (???) was pleasure 

'Cause when you die 
I cried, we cried together 

[Chorus] 

[Ja Rule] 
Wash away your tears (my love) 
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love) 
I'm putting on everything out (my love) 
And my pain it's my love 

And I want 
This world to smile for me 
Don't shed a tear 'cause the nigga died happily 
My momma warned me life was a muthafucka 

But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin 
And every night she just looked at me 
Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like 
""I don't want me baby to die"" 

Brought so much pain into a life 
Gotta make it better 
'Cause when ma cried I cried 
We cried together 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' Mo] 
Oooooohhhh 
You cry, then I cry 
Then we cry 
When he cries 

I cry together, together 
When I cry, then you cry 
Then we'll cry, together 
Baby, 'cause when 

Ja cries, Mo cries 
We'll cry, together 
If he cry, I'll cry 
Then we'll cry, together",I Cry,2000

Ladies call me white Kane
Pure as snow

Cutie pies powder they nose
I've been preaching to the stars
Ladies be livin real harder
A lot of icons
But consider me god
Born in the seventies
The eighties was growing wit time
Now it's two g nigga
And the world is mine
I was a smart nigga
Figured if he put me on the spot
Wit hot shit bubble me up til I rock
Come put me on the block
In a new form and new sound
For ja rule and I'm feeling like I'm too strong
I move on down to d.c.
V.a.
And I even did as far as californ i.a.
Come to shit

Hustle, bag and mope
For more
Down the freeway racing out of control
It's crazy
When you fucking wit rule it's shady

Never been a nigga, niggas want to play they cards wit

Better go hit the block and tell them bitches that shisty shit
Known the freaks face like that yellow bezel ice shit

Make a nigga chain

Niggas from the east
Christ from the gun to the mics

Go to bed and die
Then I'd wake up breathing again
Cause I'm all in
Even though shit ain't right
I wake up sweatin my life every night
Help me
Is it the devil that going to get me
Or is it god don't feel like being bothered wit me
So hard to hit me
This life a sacrifice
If I grow blind through the dark my kids gonna see the light

Keep up a sane mind, and hand on my iron, I'ma blast off mine

I got a beautiful wife and kids, why me?
y'all cats choose cash and cribs, why me?

If you can feel it in your back (Baby) 
It's the sounds of the motherfuckin' Brat (Baby) 
In the corner passing blunts  sippin' Yack (Baby) 
And if you must play the game 
Then gamble the stake's raised 
Take baby to Vegas I need the paper 
My flesh burnin' 
Niggas got me under surveillance their necks turnin' 
I'm an international playa, close observation 
The best policy is to stay in y'all faces 
The bad seed, I get niggas like I breath it's easy 
Been through niggas lyin' and cheatin' with bitches that's sleazy 
None of it's worth repeatin' 
If you flash money, spend that money or you can beat it 
I'mma star now, so it wasn't really shit for me to get shot down 
Spit illicit, unrestricted game, I'm independent 
Open the door to the bank but g's spent this 

1 - If you out here doing things 
You're a honey getting money 
Playin' all of these fellas like dummies 
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game 
(Tell them they better back up) 
(Playa, playa back up) 
If you out here doing things 
(Doin' doin' thangs) 
You're a playa getting money 
Spending none on none of these hoes 
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game

[Ja Rule] 
For the first time I can see my lifeline 
And you're ahead of me 
Thank God hard to imagine me 
But Lord why me? 
I'm the bad spirit that tortures the souls of the nearest 
Untouched pussy, what'chu want with me? 
Been through lesbianage, menage et tois 
Been even synonymous to hoes that floss and trick their dough 
If you livin' it, my life 
You live it as limited 
Cause too many worlds collide the killer degenerate 
I'll die in it 
As long as I keep my guns burn 
And Brat pushin' the Verge 
And the crack isn't German 
Listen Ja bring the heat catching niggas on their third wind 
We supply the pressure (Baby!) 
Shit it'll never end try to get out 
But baby you're locked in 
My world sip Hen and suffer from sin 
I'm sickening like Heroin 
Ja Rule the veteran, true with you 
But baby girl if you 

Repeat 1

A girl like me need a lot 
So I proceed to plot 
And continue to add pieces to the rock collection that I got 
Shine on y'all light up the whole block

[Ja Rule] 
Shit on a nigga like me you need a lot 
Coming with game, what'chu got 
It's murda, if you don't get shot 
I clicky-clack on those pot post up on niggas 
Fuck y'all bitches

Shit fuck y'all niggas, you can't live without pussy 
Be disrespectful and get no more nookie 
Most of these hoes check y'all cause niggas ain't shit

But live with it if the dick don't fit

But I know you got somebody. 
And I do too but I got one Question. 
Can you get away?

[Chorus]
I've been looking to get away from him. 
I've been looking to get away from her 
But we got's to find a way. Babe. 
I've been looking to get away since I found you.

On the very days you need to hang 
?cause I'm thinking about hanging my name. 
This relationship is getting crazy. 
Lay, lay, lay, lay, lay.
I've been feeling this way from back when. 
Now it?s time I turned you in.
May be now maybe we can be friends. 
Lay, lay, lay, lay, lay.

Can we get away? Get out tonight. 
Meet me up at the club mama.
Can we get away? Get out tonight cause I'm free baby. 
Can you get away? Get out tonight. 
Meet me up at the club mama.
Can you get away? Get out tonight cause I'm free baby. 

Cause I need a career man in my life. 
Baby I give you me, myself and I.
And if you can get near me. 
There will be no more pain. 
Well come on boy and love me, love me, love me. 
After all that has change. I know, I know men play games. 
All I want to know if you are the same. 
Take a chance girl and love me love me, love me.

Can you get away? Get out tonight. Meet me up at the club mama.
Can you get away? Get out tonight cause I'm free baby. 

I'm not your man so I'm feeling like a one nightstand
Might be convenient for the both I know you feel me.
Boy come on lets do it. Step up to it. Lets give our love a chance.
And then you are loving me. Kiss, hug and double me. 
I try to get it where you can't get enough of me. 
Baby girl I just want to be free. 
And come one boy and love me, love me, love me.

Jump outta of the lambo, and the doors go up
Hit you and your ho up
From the torso up
Leave y'all there till the coroner or the law show up
I'm that nigga they say preforming so the whores show up
Why cop?, I rob you, ice your roll up
I pop bottles, ain't no need for no cup
Roll the pure 'dro up, stroll the floor tore up
The difference between fab and y'all, after I pick an auto up
Every month I ain't gotta give more doe up
Fuckin' with this you'll buy a washer when the shore slow up

Goin' gold minutes after the gates on stores go up

Niggas is looking at the chain cause they eyes squint
I pull up, pull out, pull back
Them guys will sprint
Last nigga that talked slick and been replyin' since
Got a deal, no sellin', been supplyin' since
Leave niggas on the ground like tire prints
We done make ya eyes look bent, just by the sense
These niggas don't believe, then they gone die convinced
Once I present the four fifth why comment
I'm the type you tell ya dame bout

What if I had a chance to do it all again?

I push the peddle
Thoughts of your stilettos
Way up in the air like I think he's here
'Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you
Homey be checkin' up on you
But if that nigga only knew
You've got a lot of freak in you, baby
When that startin' to rain
I pop the roof and the champagne
How jay said? ""money ain't a thing""
It's been close to few
Something even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, baby

Every little thing we do
Should be between me and you
The freaky things that we do
Let's keep between me and you

Every little thing we do
Should be between me and you
The freaky things that we do
Let's keep between me and you

Girl it's on again
Every year, we hummer 'em in
Beaches, houses, hoes, foes, friends
And when the day ends
That's when it all begins
You wit him here's my room key (holla at me)
Why you thinkin' thinkin' I'm goin' hit it up
Then look at the nigga ya thinkin' ya love (come on love)
We could go there, me and you
Free for, for a night
If ya love it
In the mornin', awake with new light
If I lookin' like I ain't gonna handle his
Let me handle my bizzz
It is what it is
Nigga livin' his life
And that's my bitch
Ya know I gotta wife
Let's keep this thing tight, baby

Every little thing we do
Should be between me and you
The freaky things that we do
Let's keep between me and you

Every little thing we do
Should be between me and you
The freaky things that we do
Let's keep between me and you

Don't' let the word get out (sh), baby
This is, strictly between me and you, baby
If they, new we were doing what we were doing
It'd probably ruin our creep away summer in cancun-an and I
Love the way we get away
Throw away a whole day
Turn off the pagers and phones, we in the zone like
Fuck life, we live life, this is our life, live your life
See, every time that I'm alone with you
Shorty be checkin' up on you
But if baby girl only knew
You've got a lot of freak in you, baby
Did I ever tell you, my man love what you do
That little thing with your tongue
You the best, who knew?
It's been close to few at times even impossible
But it's been between me and you, baby

Every little thing we do
Should be between me and you
The freaky things that we do
Let's keep between me and you

Every little thing we do

Smile for me, smile for me

Spend ya lifetime tryin? to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

We're always livin' so crazy and sexy and cool
And we begin to love it (begin love it)
Watchin' all the heartache and pain of the world
And think nothing of it (thinkin' nothing of it)
Now baby I got love for you
And I know that you got me baby (got me baby)
But everytime the sun shines bright it gets socloudy


Mary: 'Cause nobody loves the rain
Ja: can't stand it
It always seem to fall
Mary: Baby handle it
Baby didn't we tell you before about chasin?those waterfalls?
Yeah
Mary: Nobody loves the rain
Ja: Can't stand it

Mary: Baby handle it
Baby didn't we tell you before about chasin?those waterfalls
Yeah

Mary baby, sometimes the Rule don't mind the rain

It kinda feels like I'm drownin' in the Lord's pain
Until the sun comes out and shines again, smile
Gimme reason to keep believin' that everything ain't is mean and
I kiss the clouds on the rainy days
And smile for you when the skies are gray
Baby 'cause I'm a teardrop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'
Dear Lord would you shower my pain
Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel- that can't soar, can't fly
And I imagine the Lord knows why


I feel like an angel in my broken wings
So I can soar again, Lord let me in
And through all the passion and the pain and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin' (yeah)
Makin' promises of love to those that spread love
And for those that can't take it, stand up

'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Sprawled out on the bed while I'm yankin your braids

I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share, somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business

And a nigga already fixing to leave

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
Lost little girl
I seen how love can turn to lust inside a
Lost little girl
I seen how pain can turn to trust within a
Lost little girl
She can get a man to do anything but she's a
Lost little girl
This sexy thing is only 17 and she's a
Lost little girl

I admit I get a lot of love from women
It's only cause if I put that thug lovin' in them
It's hard as a mitten
Gotta hit the club and bang out
Song after song till I end up in the wrong route
Tank top, sweat it out
Where she's shakin' that ass shakin' that ass
And got her breast pressed to the glass
Strobe lights flashin'
That X is kickin' in
And I'm orderin' the chrissy open bottles of tin
On our stairway to heaven baby bring a friend
Putaya sayin', fuck in a stretch Benz
You know me I like it wet, rode slowly
By the way baby, how old is you codie
You lookin' a little young to me
And how many you had that girl on, two or three
It's a damn shame
But she could of had the world
And now she's nothing more than a

[Chorus]

Chill little girl put up in a world of confusion
Pop was abusin' one of gods children
Can't wait for losin' my soul is dead
And she's feelin' like her worth is between her legs
She start fucking niggas and learn to show 'em respect
They a father figure she honor love and protect
To your down ass bitch
One you could cuddle up and wile out with
We call it thug love
Hot sex and hard drugs was a thing of the past
But look here murder inc nigga bringin' it back
We got them stressed strung out beatin' to be hung out
Cry in their crib backs when they say why
Would I get involved with niggas
Involved with killers
Involved with dealers
Involved with niggas that make millions
She could of had it all Including the world
Now she's nothing more than a

[Chorus]

She can't deny, she ain't livin' her life right
She got a man but her mans livin' his own life
With his wife and kids his crib and Bev Hills
The benz that only spins on them chroamy wheels
What has he done for you lately
Only remind you of when them times a little bit rider
A dick and he's crazy and will reminds us 
And then he hit you with that one last promise
You want it to be the truth so bad
You lookin' in his eye and your cryin', sayin' he ain't lyin'
But you know he is
But your a glutton for punishment
And you know pain is love
So what's wrong with sufferin'
The hard times have past, the good times are comin' (comin')
All over your chest baby that's how your lovin' it
And its sad cause you could of had the world
Now your nothin' but a

Those same mistakes keep callin' us back, pullin' us in

Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
It keeps callin', it keeps callin', it keeps callin'
Never again
Would I run down a road so dark, hoped to die, cross my heart
Never again
But the streets keep callin', they keep callin', they keep callin'
Never again

Will I look a nigga dead in his eyes and know he's dead wrong
And don't leave him dead to realize, it's a fucked up world we live in
I'm tired of feelin' the pain but ain't fightin' the feelin'
Niggas can you feel me?
'Cause in this world I'm alone, and trapped inside this body that's out of control
I'm hittin' these streets daily
Know when I got babies to feed rarely seein 'em rarely
This game inhaled me, and like Christ on the slate, nailed me
God, please don't fail me
But it's crazy to ask upon the Lord for help
When I got guns to bust and drugs to sell
I see you in hell, motherfuckers, I ain't bitter
'Cause I know snakes and snitches get it where they slither
My niggas, doin' life in the pen
This gotta be what y'all thinkin', shit

'Cause these hoes keep callin', they keep callin', they keep callin'

Will I make you cry baby
You know I lie, you can see it in my eyes baby
But the truth is when a woman's fed up
There ain't a damn thing you can do about love
What about us?
Why must our lawyers discuss
Who gets the kids, who gets the cribs and how we should both live
When I love ya, when we apart all I do is think of ya
But you think I'm fuckin' everything that's walkin'
Either skirt or the thong
It don't matter, 'cause in your eyes I'm dog, fuckin' 'em all
I got a woman that's gone and a passion for bitches
If you lose one the other becomes your religious
So what am I to do but get the wind behind me
Ground beneath me, make it hard for hoes to reach me
'Cause the Rule ain't easy
Babe, unless you're freakin' please believe

But the game keeps callin', it keeps callin', it keeps callin'

Will I think these niggas friends and they foes
'Cause in this rap game, you never know, just let it go
If my pain is love, my brain's on drugs
And may all my hoes thug on
And keep these punk niggas paralyzed, from the waist down
I got 'em face down is the equivalent of where I'm at now
Over the top of y'all niggas
Just a little quicker and smarter
Enhancin' the game makin' it harder
For niggas that freeze again like Braxton
I be hittin' niggas with thrillers like Mike Jackson
I'm a problem
Number one with a bullet, I keep it up in my gun
It's hollow so when I pull it it numbs
Your whole body
Give it or take a few seconds
You'll probably, be the same nigga to dick ride me
Never again would I close my eyes
And walk through the dark backwards blind

It keeps callin', it keeps callin', it keeps callin'

Never again

Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why

I sit alone in my four cornered room staring at candles
Gettin' hot tryin' to handle, this hand that's been dealt to me
I don't need, especially in this world overwhelmed with greed
See we cut from a different tree
Why'all niggaz hope and I wish a nigga would fuck with inc
Went through the troubles and the struggle of hustlin' and runnin' (what)
So the ones that come behind don't' run through nothin'
They would fear no man but God and do a lot of frontin'
And I'm here to tell the world that pain is lovin'
Like when I die I hope it rains
'Cause if it does, that mean the Lord shared them niggaz pain
Here lie our man slain
And I would get out the game if I could
But I promised all my life to my kids I'd make good
Can't stand my father and love my momma
Still I try, god can you explain why

[Chorus:]

I live my life under pistol, 'cause lately love ain't been a issue
With who's gone miss you, when you dead and gone
Will my name live on? or will I be the last to die and breathe and eat
'Cause I need a little love and affection and baby
I live like every day was my last one
Dang, I've been living my life...(haha, yea)
Like I'm a leave this world unmarked, smiles combed to horror
For all them days when it rains
And it feels like thangs ain't gettin' no better for me
Nobody loves me, sometimes I wish god could come down and hug me
And wipe the tears from eyes
'Cause in my heart I know only the strong survive
And I die for my family, so they can live a better life
I try, god can you explain why

[Chorus:]

I'll sacrifice my life, fuck all the dumb shit
'Cause being black and broke's gettin' redundant
My grow to be a world leader like x and king
If I can live a longer than pac and big
What do (?) niggaz run red, you could tell by the lives we live
If it changes it'll be God's prediction, so pain inflicted, like Jane's Addiction
Live right like Christians, but dance with the death
It's like callin' stones a devil, the road is unlevel
Still I walk through the valleys of shadows of death gasping for air
Breathe in my last breath
My daughter told me first words, my son walked his first steps
And all through life we anticipate death
And if pain is truly love, for my family I die, god can you explain why

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my fo'-five
Cocked on these niggas time to die
Even as a lil' nigga, you could picture me hot gun in the rain
I shed the tear, cause this nigga here inherits the pain
And now I'm labeled as a thug nigga, you know the game
Smokin' weed, fuckin' hoes, slangin' things, that's the life I live
Even if I tried to go back I'd get lost (come back)
And everything I seem to love I done lost
Fuck the world if they can't understand me
What else could I do? I had to feed my fuckin family
Yo' lies is my truth, so I'm a drug to your youth
And you don't want 'em nowhere near me, now that they can hear me
I spits razors, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of tote-slangers and chalk lines
Why do we die at an early age?
Nigga so young, but still a victim of a twelve-gauge
Feel the rage this world has bestowed upon me
And I don't give a fuck 'cause they don't give a fuck 'bout me
So I keep, drinkin' Hennessy, bustin at my enemies
Will I live to see twenty-three? There's so much pain

I've been cursed, for what it's worth I feel dead
Spittin' to you, I know I'm in way over my head
But Lord hear me, I believe in your ""7 Day Theory""
Three souls done sent this whole world teary (can you hear me?)
Too hot for you to stand near me
It's so much pain, and niggas wanna kill me
I'm tired of the stress and the strain
But my, grimiest grimeys got love for me
They're blazin', sendin' shotguns up above for me
My face in, Hennessy with no chaser
Coke rises on every way in, keep us hustlin' nigga
Me and my man got a plan to get this paper nigga
So if you owe nigga, look for the gauge to blow nigga
I figured I'd be considered a killer
Doin' crime excited my mind and leadin' the blind
I, can't express my compassion, my satisfaction
For gettin' fucked up and blastin', we all been there
Taught from young to shoot, show no fear and lie
And wipe the tears from yo' mother's eyes - so much pain

Trust, I got my glock cocked, playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a, passion
Better duck 'cause I ain't lookin' when I'm, blastin'

And gettin' high on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why?

What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong

I'm real they can not see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets
And I be, ballin' loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckers 'til you buried

For niggas that ain't right they get it upon sight
If ya know me then you know we pop away
Cock and pop again baby, men will be men
I spit off 10 fuck it give 'em the 16
Like my guns dirty and hands clean 
Loose bitches in tight jeans
Old money and crack fiends was a fetish 
Before Guliani got into office and deaded shit
Fuck it I'm living my life on the edge
Got one in the head plus a nigga's fed 'nuff said
I'm gonna behead niggas that don't believe this
Rule baby, 3:36

[Chorus]
[O1] 
We are the world's most dangerous niggas alive
All of my niggas bang with us and let's ride
Muthafuckas will war but not many survive
'cause 50 shots tearing through the side of ya ride
'cause we are (murderers)
Muthafucka you heard player (murderers)
Popping collars in air
Popping shots through ya rearview
Bullets, they tear through
Got niggas wondering like ""What the fuck did I do?""
So niggas want to go and get they man 'cause they can't do this shit
Because they ain't got no heart for this, bust a gun and body shit
Niggas like you probably snitch, do a nigga then get rich
Niggas like you always fit 6 feet deep inside a ditch
There ain't nothing fucking with this ya know why?
Nigga I just came into the game ready to die
Ready to hold heat, drive-by with Rule
Popping shots through the sun roof screaming ""fuck you""

Ooh and darlin', where would I be?
(Yeah, Vita Ja Rule)
(Where would I be without you?)
Be, be without you

Where would I be without my baby?
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

Girl, it feel like you and I bein' born in together
Inseparable, you chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind body and soul ain't no I in we, baby

When you cry who wipes your tears?
When you scared who's tellin' you there's nothin' to fear?
Girl, I'll always be there when you need shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowin' you can call on

Your soul mate and vice versa that's why I'll be the first to
See Jacob frost your wrists up
Now ya own me, I know you're tired of being lonely

And I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And the house on the hill when you dropped like 80
On a down payment thinkin' damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey, I've been twice the lady

What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in the storm
And I except who you with when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip 'cause our love is strong

And when you hit the block I watch for 10-4's
And when my pop's was sleep you snuck in the back door
Baby boy, we've been down since junior high
So when life gets hot in July it's the world against you and I

Be ballin' tied together and never
Part from the heart knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy, put it on me

Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear baby, I won't cry
And you know that my heart don't lie
If you leave me lonely 'cause you not just my love you my homie

Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control hold me, my love 'cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours

A thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
'Cause every thug needs a lady

Feelin' you baby 'cause them eyes ain't lyin'
Wash away all them tears there'll be no more cryin', baby
And you complete me and I would die if you ain't with me

Enamorada, de ti

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Oh

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right, no no
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart, oh yeah

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny how

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try (though you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel (baby)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it's strange how fate can play a part

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part",Ain't It Funny,2002

But there ain't that many rappers out there scraping and keep it cracking
We keep it happening

No scratch that eight from CD's to tapes we rock like earthquakes

Wit a sawed off kick It's like they fall off cliffs
Y'all call it off before all y'all get stoned
Like you're fallen off in a raw mosh pit
Get tossed in a ditch your coffin is sick
While I floss in the awesomest whips and I toss in your chicks
Your caution when your calling your six
Cause your talk can get you crossed and lost in the mix
I'm a pause in the bitch bossed in the pits

On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin' to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me
Cause every woman just wanna be happy

And there's a better day, a-comin', I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin' half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen

Like when we kissin' bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me baby

Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win

You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
(BABY, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thing
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin' different boy, stick to the plan
(You be my down ass, wit'cha round ass)
I know I'm feelin' you (like you feelin' me)

I can get above it, it's my life and I dug it
Even though I live it close to the edge
I'm gettin' closer to death, with every little step
that I take, in the awake of my last days
I hope the sun shines with a light rain
That would mean the world shared my pain
And now the world could be happy again, smile

Cause in life and in music I'm poised and I'm focused
And the world should take notice

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
Underworld ties, is where my heart lies
They do the drama, makin songs like ""Ol' Blue Eyes""
that make the whole world sing..
It's alright if you don't understand me, it wasn't meant to be
Cause it's hard enough for me to fight for what I believe in
Than have to look in the mirror and see demons
Now everybody's talkin rhyme over reason
My only reason for rhymin is cause I bleed it
Here come the leeches; they gettin paid
off my talent, my love, my pain - am I a slave?
Bein cursed in my own brain
For this life I embrace and I praise
A nigga stuck in his ways
As the remix plays
Rule and J. Blige, ""Rainy Days""
I think about life and music and how to stay focused
And the world should take notice

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
Hey, this is a message to mankind
I bust clearly you shoot blind, not in my right mind
Lord if you love me please throw up a sign
And take a nigga off the path of destroyin his life, and
This life we're livin the sign of the times
Where buildings take on planes, babies born with AIDS
And we all need change
So I became a rock star bay-bayyy (rock on)
Now they all gon' hate me (hate on)
But from the bottom of my heart I pray
That in life and in music the world stays focused
And I hope you all notice

I know you're livin' your life faithfully, safely, away from me
But you miss bein' next to me, don't you?
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you wanted
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere
or intervene on me
Peelin' your wide body out of them tight jeans

Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with

On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent
Maybe I'm true generous
Generally believin' that all women want me
They don't want to get even
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God
Betrayal or trust, sustain your vows
Secretly or sacred
Cause I love it when you rock your body-body
Move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi
And roll up along side me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is that you need my heat
Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
Lovin', thuggin' and I know you

And I know you're gettin' bored

Baby, here I'm holdin' your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless
Cause you been gettin' at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck them strays
Cause I been in a rage lately
Hopin' God'll forgive me for all the sin and all the woman
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginnin'
I hope your watching so you could see that nigga ain't built
like me!!
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love lookin' somethin' like soft porn
Tell me, baby, do you really want to go home to him??
But the brightest of your days just goin' look dim
Cause you fuckin' with a loser, baby, you can't win

Hope you got yourself a gun niggaz

Go on out, six feet deep and slump niggaz

But I'm strong, motherfuckers can't break me down 
Niggaz really gonna hate me now 
As I'm givin a fuck 
I'm tryna get my life together 
Shit a nigga can't ride forever 
Tryna see a hundred mil' or better 
Befo' I die 
Don't ask me why, I 
Got a fasination wit for freak ho's 
New whips wit two seats and two do's 
I've been waitin so long to explode 
Now watch me cock back and unload 
Bullets goin threw the chest and out the back 
Shit is usually how the babry acts 
Now the look in your face is so relaxed 
Now your family moans and deals wit that 
But me, I'm a survivor like Destiny's Children 
Til the day of my demise 
I'm gonna ask the lord why

So I'm gearin up to get into some shit 
Niggaz better kiss the wife and kids 
It's just the way us niggaz live 
And I run wit real niggaz that run wit big guns 
That are designed to pop ya lid (Shit) 
Never met a real nigga I didn't like 
Never met a bitch nigga that I didn't fight 
Now niggaz gon get down, and a nigga gon lay down 
Dependin on how niggaz view life 
And you'll never look in my eyes 
And you'll never, ever smile

And you can't touch me 
But if you really want to fuck wit me

Rather cop real estate then ride big whips
Rather trick on my wife and go real a dick or hips

Go 150 months, and come home gettin rich again
Nigga it's sicker than, I hope you listenin
Nigga we glistenin, pop off and leave you in the dead man position
Black Child is Murder, why'all forgettin
The work I put in, the dirt I done did
On this earth niggaz lives is worthless
Unless you worth a few million, school your children
Let the game get to 'em, then they brain get ruined
Mine speak foreign languages fluently
Hoodstock exchange ain't nothin new to me
Cop and go, set 'em shoppin up to Unity
I've been ticklin clit ever since puberty
Might taste it if it smells clean to me
Mama lean with me, holler and scream with me

This cash is aimless, cop the new yellow Vanguish
And I ride swervin down the westside highway
Get high like a G4 on the runway
I can't land it man with gun in hand
A hundred grand in escrow tryna expand
A million niggaz that brick, whole bricks to grams
Just leave with money, its seems like its Uncle Sam
So keep (hustlin) I done roll that comes from all the pain and the (strugglin)
(Look at here) federal agents (runnin in)
Come again, it must be mistaken identity
Like when Oswald took the rap for killin a Kennedy
We in the street, not industry niggaz
And because we're called ""the Murderers"" that don't make us killaz, now does it?
Now it's not home but still them trumpets blowin
Hold on cause the leader of this mission is a pro

Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder
Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners
Cocked and let go!

Fuck all y'all motherfuckin' bitch ass niggas
I'm talkin' to whoever wanna be ridin' my dick
And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it
It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with
If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths
Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment 
To see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
Like when I come through with spinners on the six
And got bitches bouncin' like Ronnie in Tricks
But some whores in this game really don't make sense
Bomb roof and via Cal's and clonin Ems
But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs
A horror show, yeah picture this
Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again

[Chorus]

Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos
Cause I don't love these hoes
I'm above and beyond everything that your seein'
And I'm the only real nigga left rappin this freakin'
If I could be one of the seasons, you'd call me summer
The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer
The bull just move like runners from city block to city block
Layin' down the foundation for what's really hot
Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)
I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)
My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art
And nobody can really tell the twins apart
I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria
I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya
My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia
Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads
So I push the Porsche high and truck to court
Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision
I feel like the nigga that triggerin' guns with mittens
It's hard to get done, I'm hearin' that security runs
Around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin' another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably
If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee
Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up
Snow cone the country leave no market untouched

Now before they start runnin' they lips
I thought I should warn these motherfuckers, there's a gun in this bitch
And I know he's got one on his hip
But I got the drop, and outside, rule got the drops
All it takes is a cock and a pop
Money for bail, ain't seeing no more sales
Instead, I'm poppin' on yahts
They told me j.prince runnin' the south
And I'm beast from the east, that'll come and put a gun in your mouth
I got bricks for days, dicks to make a bitch behave
Had to baldhead my shit threw, had to switch the waves
Just that quick, slip and the mac spit, bladdat
Four up in they chest and reload while they back flip
We in this together, bad weather, rippin' the storm
They some dictionary rappers, they just spittin' the norm
You supposed to know the la costra nostra flow
I did it, cause I lived it, you can quote the flow
Hit your six up with sixteen in sixty seconds
Get your whips up, we split beams, keep fifty weapons
To you coppers that's posin' a threat
Fire up the air, wholes in the tec
To put a hole in your neck
See I rep for the four forty but I'm about the five
Ride by, blazin' out the five, nigga I'm so cool

When you cookin' up coke to sell
It be the little statistics, some pictures, some prints
Some informants to get the operation pitched

You don't want us to strap up and bang the strip
But if need be, we'll bang out like Bloods and Crips

[Verse 1]
Guess who's back to personify money, power, and bitches
But when bitches been gettin money, that when shit get ridiculous
I'm hittin switches like six fo's, bouncin and leanin
The west coast seemin, keep the fo' fo' demon
And the rock is all stashed up
Roll up a little diesel, keep it hashed up
Then +Holla, Holla+ at the whores, is hollerin back
Let 'em know a few facts like if your ridin, your back's slidin
This is the 'Race Against Time' and I ain't got time to waste
To give chase, I put a hole in your fin
But your head to the barrel like DJ's is spinnin
Backward, to blow off the backwood, I'm so hood
But what's really hood, when you ain't doin your hood 
no motherfuckin good, and bein misunderstood
I would die if I could, Rule the lion
And I'ma keep ""ri-da-da-da-da-in""

[Chorus - 2X]
Race against time, I - can't stop
Runnin through the red light - livin my life
Even if I'm gettin too hot
Still I can't stop - ""Ri-da-da-da-din""

[Verse 2]
Bless the day that the God was born two, twenty-nine, seventy-six
This cocaine was heavily mixed
And all them niggaz had a fixation for bad reputation
For pimpin hoes, and shootin fo, to bring the free basin
If this is time erasin, the devil is runnin like Bettis
And got his guns out lookin for ways to behead us
You can die in a matter of seconds, so I'ma slow it down
Turn back the hands of time with the 40 Cal
Claimin your style is the realest, so I'ma define the meanin of murder, it's killer
You outta your mind, the burner's designed for the fill up
No gas, and when I spits like acid
smoke weed, but blow ether, spit ashes 
cause young Rule in his prime like 'Clay Cassius'
Hated by the masses, but overwhelmed with love and passion
For when I die niggaz keep ""ri-da-da-da-din""

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If Jesus Christ was criticized, then why not me
What the fuck am I special, I struck a deal with the devil
Haha, every kid a prophet, which one seem like its logic
Me in church, or me in bed with bitches managen
I can chase like sergeant, addictive like heroin
Outsiders just lookin in, through a barrel that's pinned to the peep hole
They seein all or nothin like Jazz from Clisco
Hit 'em up and let's go, jump over the threshold
I just got married to bangin pistol, drugs and other shit
Feel in love with a bitch that I call crime
She reminded me that nobody can beat time
If you get enough of it nigga
So I looked her dead in her eyes and pulled the trigger
Thinkin that the music we feel would be somethin different
But this the same old criminal vibin
I ain't hidin, I'ma keep ""ri-da-da-da-din""

That's how I live
I had to get rid of a lot of fake homies

Not how it is

When I'm rolling through your city
Show me love
And ladies when you see a boy
Give me love
And though I'm not conceited (right)
Its just my space sometimes I need it (right)
Said I got so many friends in them area codes
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows
Ja lets break bread together
Pray together
That we grow strong together
Its clear forever
Help each other through the stormy weather
Lets hurt together
Lets cry together
And even if we grow together
Then together we'll make it better

The Rule be ""In Da Club"" rude motherfucker poppin the bubbly
When shit get ugly I hug the snub closely
But usually we still see your bitches
That's is known for quick shit, trying to ride my dick
I can't handle it, lower their manners
To get they ass in front of my dick to dance, the bitch want more chance
Catching hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggas is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit his thing
Give bitches the back hand, pimp shit, it's not realistic
The game is helpless, let's not get it twisted
I'm young, wrapped, and gifted, but still at the bottom
And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Saddam
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem
Fuck the Dog beware of Rule, cause I'm the problem

Like Bush and Saddam, I'm a find out
Where Em Laden's hiding and bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than yo scrubs
Mask and glove, gun hot from burnin' ass up
I'd rather be bossed up, wit a bunch of broads
The preachers daughter screaming out ""Fuck the law!""
I play a struck chord, wit the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessings to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he goin' meet the mistress
And ""Clap that boy"" like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggaz all over my dick, like hoes
I'm the star at these shows, I must be as hot as they come

I, got a fetish for f***in' you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
but patiently waitin' for you to tell a n**** to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin' to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed a n**** go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me
Cause every woman just want to be happy
And it's crazy, but BAY-BAY, I (love it when I'm witchu baby)

[Chorus]

I want to get away, cause you know like I know
And there's a better day, a-comin', I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin' half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin'
Like when we kissin', bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll, ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me baby

[Chorus]

Shorty, are you really gettin bored with me, or him?
Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
(But then again I'm still young and I'm livin my life)
You know you're right and I'm the type
to pull up to your bumper, get your bumper
(BABY, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin' different boy, stick to the plan
(You be my down a**, witcha round a**)
I know I'm feelin' you (like you feelin' me)
The way you're holdin' my body, the way you touch me

All over my body baby
I love when you kiss me baby
All over my body baby

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same

This perfect romance that I've created in my mind

I'd live a thousand lives each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance

Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

Wanna keep you flawed with no dough
Pimpin' ain't easy
Trust me I know
When gangstas and hos
Go go go go go go together
Like chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, chedder and glamorous things
Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
'cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness
'cause I want the p-you-s-s-why
Got a lotta niggas wonderin' it ain't just I
Gotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
Shit, she probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy
Sip seraphin
Who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-n-see

I'm at the top of the world and life's a pussy buffet
And that's why I get m-I-a
Shut the game down so the busteras can't play
Hell yeah I splurge money
Hell yeah I act funny
Look at you like fuck you
All the shit I been through
It's a wonder why I'm still here
Said I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its mighty strange how you right back here

If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)

And why you wanna take it all from me

My life is dark but its lovely
Crimes cars cribs ain't that right Kelly?

Y'all bitches don't know
Money ain't a thing
Mami need a lil change
Girl I'm pitchin' quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New Benz's new Porsche's
New cases new lawyers
I'm becoming the infamous notorious rule
Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggas don't possess the heart that I do
And it's a wonder that I'm still here
Thought I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its kinda funny how you right back there

Over the rocks while the crowd is rockin'.
Everybody rollin' like my life I wouldn't stop

The rule and the (Ashanti: princess).
And everybody with a two step (Ashanti: get up dance),
And all my gangstas that don't dance (Ashanti: lean back).

[Verse 1]
Nobodys livin life the way that I live it
Nobodys spittin and doin it, I spit it
But who fuckin admitted
I'm one of the bigger biggest of niggaz that done did it
Been hated and delt wit it, when agents tap in my lyrics
So by the time that they hear it, the crime's already committed
Natural Born Killa, but that I'm already and then
Murdah was the case, but I-N-see's been acquitted
The Agency's gettin livid, They wanted us to be finished
But we got unfinished business, Sned God as my witness
This is another testimony to my life and my story
Askin you hoes, Why should I talk when I got guns to speak for me
don't come at me homie, Especially tryin to act like you know me
Only if you can control me, Know where you been chosen befor me
To sit in ya grave, homie dig it, I'm hearin its lonely, But see
Nobody...Does it...Like Me! And they know it they can't spit it the same
But still they try, 'cause that's part of the game, WHUTS MY NAME?!

[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
These niggaz incredible, throughout the ghettos of America
People, see these window I see through
Off they mirror they evil, jealous bullshit that men do
Had I known it was you, there'd be no clue on who done killed you
Like when Kane murdahd Able, Niggaz must have been able
To put caine through they nasals, They so high they see angels
I see life from all angels, tangled, webs and weaves
Now niggaz is able to kill like Kane all over the streets
100 degrees Ferenheite, hot as the hottest summer night
Heatin up desperatly in the need of some ice, I'm nice
Nobodys quite like, flow like rare blood types
I be wrong if I'm right, right if I'm wrong, I was the RULE born
When my legacy is left through my boys maiden name live on RULE
Niggaz is foolish tryin to do whut I do, 'cause see
Nobody...Does it...Like me! And they know it they can't do it the same
But still they try, 'cause that's part of the game WHUT MY NAME?!

Matter fact call me Frank Love 'cause I'd love to fuck ya
She said slow baby don't rush
I promise if you be patient I'll let you tear it up
And nigga sho nuff
We decided to keep in touch with each other you feel me
I didn't know we'd be touching ??
I'm serious, and I'm so sincere
My object is to stay in the clear
'Cause we find fuck and flee these broads round here
I done made so many women shed so many tears
Sittin' home all alone getting drunk off of shots of Bathome
Decided to call let her feelings be known
In a slurred tone, she said I always get what I want

You calling me constant telling bitches that I'm ya man
I thought we was just friends conversating
Gettin' to know one another on a friendly basis
Lets face it we from two different worlds that don't collide
But when they do the crash is more like a biz-omb
Your favorite seasons bigati and mines is summer
You use credit I rubber band wrap my hundreds
What we got in common is minimal right next to nothin'
And I think that's what's subliminally keepin' you comin'
Back to the one you been fuckin' but never thought you'd be fuckin'
How often do you think about the awkwardness of it
I know you love it to say the least
And I ain't just sayin' that contrary to some beliefs opposites attract
And my track record is something to be expected
Money cash hoes you know how it goes

Who would have thought that something so simple would turn out to be detrimental
Now I'm feeling like I'm caught in the middle
Of this love triangle between she me and reality
Reality is tellin' us that we could never be
'Cause I come from the streets and you come from a rich family
But I don't think that your family would understand me
It's the little things you overlook when you're around me
Drugs guns bitches and needless to say
You're a pimp in your own way
Baby you're makin' it hard for me to look in your eyes and tell you to move on
I'm gone (I'm gone)
But then I'm back again
Money and good pussy's a fatal attraction for men
She hits me every night quarter past ten
And with every call her voice got a little more intense
Now we involved and it really don't make no sense
So be careful what you ask for you just might get it biaaatch!

Umm hey
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Oh yea
Oh yea

Kids get killed in ghettos, shot up over their carmelo's
While they mom was at home, tears hittin' the pillow
Reverend in the middle of a sermon and funereal
Shed a tear 'cause they lost a son the same way a year ago
It's the same ego spiritual, we thuggin' in harmony
They say death brings life, there exchange no robbery
If I'm wrong then pardon me, I'm just tired of poverty
Why them niggas in the hood never hit the lottery
Unless they go lottery, first round in the draft
First we dustin' off the rounds and we slip in the mag'
Then slip on the masks, and go out and mash
And we call it feeding our family, ya'll call it a tragedy, damn
How I could just kill a man
Watch his blood flow like a river and rinse his blood off of my hand
If you hearing me speak please lord give me a chance
And forgive for my sins, 'cause we cleansed where I'm from

Me and my niggas ride even when the sun don't shine and it's cold outside
I never run in or hide, 'cause some niggas hate it
But I can't be fadin' 'cause I done made it
Instead of struggling, just strive
Find my way out these ghetto streets of mine
This is coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
We all walk back in line

Everybody know that everybody said nobody can hide from beef
Except but us, who surprised when these kids get killed on the streets
Look how these animals eat that's how they talk bout us
While they shed they joke and laugh puttin a choke round us
Can I get a moment of silence
'Cause they claimin' it's the murderers that's causing all the violence
But what about the ones that protect to serve our honor
Poppin' that blue colla', with shots soon to follow
The ghettos in horror, 'cause in this boy shot went back
And now the neighborhood's hot and he can't move the crack
When it's all about the dollars
And he'll individually get murdered 'cause money is power
But then these snitch's get to talking and it's colder than ours
Cuffed and crimed on the bus heading straight to the island
He was only thirteen, but tried as an adult in the highest of courts
Because ain't no more children in the ghetto where I'm from

We all walk back in line (yeah)

We ain't all killers in prison
Matter fact that's a stereotypical thought of livin'
'Cause they don't know about the hood and them love in it
Summer time top down with the wood finish
Pushin' hard uptown windows slightly tinted
Back to back Benz' and Jeeps, blowin' weed with my niggas
On our way to a house party, gonna fuck with some bitches
Let's get some liquor for shorty who said she make us some chicken
And if we get 'em drunk enough we probably could freak 'em
And do it every other weekend
If I don't have to kill niggas, I never would leave the ghetto
I'm like an angel that put on a halo
Cradle the grave of my niggas that we lost in the ghetto
'Cause where I'm from in the ghetto we rock white tee's and Nike's
Roll three dice and name our dope ice cream
Set trends and ya'll follow our lead
But in New Yitti niggas follow they dreams, where I'm from

Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness

I got a knack for pushin crack, and cookin raw coke
Fresh off the boat, no vest but I tote, and wear it like a coat
I'm starin through the scope, with one eye open and one shut
Zero in on the target, spark him and watch his head bust
Ain't s*** to discuss, unless it's moneybags
or the SK-8, drop Jag with funny tags
Homey laugh now but die later when the lead dump
And double barrel slugs like Elmer Fudd, I'm handsome

They claim they gangster, lettin mens give brains to them

Bang bang dangerous, my gun gang famous

Come over, they claimin they models
Until they want a drink they ain't even know who I was
Until I took my hat off, and then they started backin that ass up
Whoa! She did this dance with her hands up
Then she touched her toes and made my thing stand up
Type of chick that'll have a nigga in handcuffs
Taste but don't swallow, look but don't touch
Forbidden, not to be eaten, but she is
Feedin me rotten apples that fall from the tree
Why don't we leave, just us three, and get acquainted

Rubbin on bitches like full body massages
And takin dead aim on all open targets
Soon as I walk in I see the one
That I want to be humpin, bouncin, and grindin on
Her lowrider sit low, you can see her thong
And she like to get low on her favorite songs
I'm like don't stop, get it get it, let me get up on it
Let me see how bad you really want it
Like, them cold nights when you're hot and lonely
Give me your pager, pick up a phone and call me
I was thinkin that maybe we could have an orgy

Filled with fast women when they stop intervene
Tanned up and their walk is mean
I don't wonder how she got in, I want her out of them jeans
It seems, me and my team got a routine habit
Of gettin rid of sweaters as soon as we snag 'em
In the club, gettin high, relaxin
I see a few asses that's pacin backwards my way
The DJ spinnin it backwards
Givin shouts to actors, athletes and rappers
Now, let's get it crackin, you know how it happen
After the party there's an afterparty happenin

This tough load, the 3 8 o's, I let my hoe's hold
Keep it in them working, In case I'm legal searching
They got worship god, and trust the gun
Ask for your forgiveness, and send n****z up

F***ing stick n****z up, these b**** n****z touch
It's all about violence, real n****z is silenced
And know these n****z whoes guns got low mileage
Got ducked taped, all tied up in their houses

How many hoes, and how much blood has been lost of

You talk too much s***
You know n****z always talkin bout b****es ain't s***
Money over b****es
But give all our money to the b****es any f***in way
(I love my b****) So I'ma send some love out
to the b****es, holla

[Verse One]
S***, here's somethin to remember
When we met that day in September
But, you've been gone since November
Had to finish out yo' last college semester
Her major - brokerage investor
She probably go broke tryin to invest her
time and money in somethin that she call love
Cause, she love f***in with thug n****z
That always get high and had to be drug dealers
Eventually, she hooked up with some hood b****es
The hood b****es turned her on to strippin
Now the, gettin is good and it's well understood
That money on the wood can make things get harder
Be glad I'm not a pimp, if I was I'd charge ya
But for all that you go through, just thought I'd let you know
Hoes need love too, I'm f***in witchu

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
N****z need to read the man-you-al
To separate your housewife from a hoe
Cause there's no rules to this s*** here
Am I makin myself clear?
What she don't know won't hurt her why'all
So keep big pimpin on the low
Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too

[Verse Two]
You know what they say right? B****es ain't s***
And all men are dogs cause we just want to f***
Sundown to sun up, one up on a hoe
I might go down on the low, that's just me though
From L-A-X to Heathrow, I'm one of them n****z
that really doesn't need no, introduction
When I met her she was ""Girl, Interrupted""
Grew up became a woman not to be trusted
Frustrated and flustered, living amongst
these thieves hoes and hustlers, I'm diggin what's next
She had a studio apartment in the projects
With her and her girl from D.C. used to bus checks
And hold the coke, her n****z ain't sold yet
In hopes the copes don't know about all this
Shiiiiit, for all that you go through
Just want to let you know, hoes need love too

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Fake nails, fake breasts, fake eyes too
It's oh-four, and that's kinda what we used to
But you don't holla back like you used to, but I ain't mad at cha
I'm happy for a b****, even if I can't have her
I remember when you was down in Atlanta
Workin gentlemen's clubs and you didn't even know what a gentlemen was
Forty to love and I want to serve
That body like Serena's with less curves
But actions speak louder than words, and you gettin your money
Mami every month, 15th and 1st
S*** could be worse, you could be in the struggle
Or born with no a** and have nothin to hustle
Go on flex your muscle, cause that ain't the case is it?
Go on get your paper keep flossin on these b****es
Cause for all that you go through
Just thought I'd let you know, hoes need love too, I'm f***in witchu

Ja Rule,"[Chorus:]
Nobody loves me
Sometimes the world can seem so cold
Looking through the windows of my soul
I see, the true fan now I know (I know, I know, I know)
Why'all gotta love me
When the weight of the world was on my shoulders
You were there
When it got heavy, I held it
You were there
The ones that stood by me like soldiers
You were there

I know you love me

But I'm still waiting for the Lord to come hug me
Send a sign or somethin'
This is all for nothin'
The talent and passion of mine
I'm sick of sufferin'
I know your plans is greater than mine
So I'm asking
Why do you want me dead or alive
And how could you let the people see me through the enemy's eyes
Like, jealousy, envy, Feds want to convict Gotti
I'm thinking probably we was gettin' too much money
Too many niggaz in whips sittin' on twenties
Too much connections to the streets, why'all niggaz doin' somethin'
And after overall assumptions, or it's all or nothin'
Ain't nothin' stopping the second coming, except the coffin
I may be encased, but even from there I still touch 'em
Niggaz ??, that's why we still hustle
For all my niggaz that can't be here
For every tear, send my a prayer, I swear

[Chorus:]

But what's love, when your friends become enemies
Your nightmares are no longer your worst dreams
And as bad as everything seems
Keep hustling
We gon' get it by any means
How unfortunate, January the sixth
Federal officers, raided our offices
Making it hard for us to eat, and breathe, and live
And they swear they got niggaz asking for relief
They've been handin' down indictments for about a year
And they send nobody to jail yet, we still in the clear
And the Bible that said, ""Thou shall not fear no man but God""
Whoever said that, ain't never faced the law
And why all this fake ?? going on
I'm fighting niggaz, swingin' back against the wall
That's for my niggaz that can't be here
For every tear, send my a prayer, I swear

[Chorus:]

How could you hate me, why would the Lord forsake me
Put the weight of the world on my shoulders
I thinkin' I could brush it off and nobody notice
Keep raisin' my kids: Britney, Jeffry, and Jordan
Keep coppin' new whips: Bentleys, Benzes, and Porsches
My niggaz, and my fans is the only thing of importance
It's crazy how the world turns
Sometimes, you gotta light up and let it burn
Sweep up your ashes, put 'em up in a urn
On a mantle from memories
I hear you callin' me, Lord knows you love me
The passion of Rule is so real, just lend me your ear
You'll feel what I feel, you'll tear when I tear
The vision's real clear, just look in my eyes
I believe in putting my life in the hands of God
For all my niggaz that can't be here
For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear

When shit get ugly I hug the snub closely

That's is known for quick shit, trying to ride my dick
I can't handle it, lower their manners
To get they ass in front of my dick to dance, the bitch want more chance
Catching hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggas is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit his thing
Give bitches the back hand, pimp shit, it's not realistic
The game is helpless, let's not get it twisted
I'm young, wrapped, and gifted, but still at the bottom
And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Saddam
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem
Fuck the Dog beware of Rule, cause I'm the problem

Like Bush and Saddam, I'm a find out
Where Em Laden's hiding and bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than yo scrubs
Mask and glove, gun hot from burnin' ass up
I'd rather be bossed up, wit a bunch of broads
The preachers daughter screaming out ""Fuck the law!""
I play a struck chord, wit the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessings to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he goin' meet the mistress
And ""Clap that boy"" like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggaz all over my dick, like hoes
I'm the star at these shows, I must be as hot as they come

Nobody cares
Trouble's like a cancer, you gotta get it early
You don't get it early it gets to big, it kills you
Nobody cares

That's why you gotta cut it out
Nobody cares
Capeesh
Worry about yourself, your family, and people that are important to you

Let me tell you something
When your alone late at night in the bed
Just you and her under the covers
You're only allowed three great women in your life

(Is it better to be loved or feared?)
They come along like the great fighters, once every ten years
Nobody cares (That's a good question
it's nice to be both but it'd be very difficult)

That's it, capeesh
(If I had my choice I'd rather be feared, see fear last longer than love)
Don't forget where you came from

[Beat Begins]

[Irv Gotti talking]
Yeah, hell yeah
I'd like to welcome everybody
Inside the world of Murder I-N-see
And I'd like to introduce to why'all
My nigga, ATL's own huh Lloyd, Lloyd

[Lloyd]
Ladies come step inside with me
To take this ride with me
To see the top of the globe
Courtesy of Murder I-N-see's

Provided privacy
Nobody'll know
Yeah I know I brought the mob with me
'Cause obviously

A lot of niggaz snitch on the low
Just open your eyes
And see all these blind lies he done told
I realize how niggaz fantasize

And the unreal truth gets sold to the youth
While others try to provide their souls to the booth
Fuck that, I'm bustin' back through the roof
Thugs tact or not, hard top or drop

Show em' how to rock and rock and roll and rock
How to breed low cake and open shop
Bringin' everything I know I got

[Chorus]
Ain't no stoppin' what we doin'
Oh, feels like I been waitin' a while
Know it's been a long time comin' so ride
We gon' keep on movin'
It's my time to steer it now
Oh, right here and now

[Lloyd]
Niggaz come and take this ride with me
Break some pies we'll see on the side of the road
Where everyday different bodies decay
Niggaz is rotten in graves gettin' dropped in a hole

Follow me and come ride with this
Hide with and keep your eyes on watchin' for the po's
'Cause they don't know about
Where we be hidin' out better turn up your jets

Headed right there yet, better build up your rep
'Cause my niggaz cash checks from Hollis to the Dec
Holla at me my nigga I gotta good connect
Outbid for the complex, polishin' the Lex

Redbone bagets, French robes is fresh
Love money and sex, the best of the best
When it's all said and done it's your time to invest
You just got to do it for yourself

[Chorus: Lloyd]

[Ja Rule]
Yeah, yo
Look here my lil' nigga, let me talk to you for a minute
I'm a tell you about this business and these cash incentives
About these fake ass bitches and these bitch ass niggaz

How to spot the cowards from the killers
The flowers from the spitters
This industry is all smoke and mirrors
But we in the street niggaz so our focus is to finish niggaz off

How often do we put a nigga on
So you must be the chosen one
Your priority concern is never leave your residence without your gun
'Cause you'd rather be caught with than without one

Trust me I'm like that old gangsta named Lucky
Niggaz know that my hands are dirty but still can't touch me
In this game, if you clean, you can get all the money
When it starts gettin' dirty they look at you funny

'Cause it's ""A Bronx Tale"" like Calogero and Sonny
And that bus don't stop for everybody, call it
Keep your nose clean fuckin' with addicts and alcoholics
'Cause I'll have us on the bed with some hood bitches from Georgia

That's ATL for you, New York's no different
It's L.A. and Miami that's how they visit
Keep your eyes on these snitches and fraud ass niggaz
They claim to be gangstas as soon as you see em' split em'

It's a cold world, be grateful that the Lord's forgiving
And be happy you ain't dead, sick, or in prison
My nigga

In the ride it?s as rough as the ride gets
And you know that they all want to murder The Inc
But they can't kill us and now we got to finish these niggaz

And if finish it means murder

Then leave them in memory of

And no, this ain't a movie, dog
This is murder

We had some good years but I'm tired and ya niggaz despierin'

And trying to put the dalce to the fire, it?s like an episode of the wire
The only difference is the vengeance is taking us in real life
Now, everybody wanna look at us and think twice
And point there fucking fingers like damn the bad guys

why?all nigga?s don't know, we them niggaz, man
Murder INC we done bin through it all done n seen it all
There ain't nothin' you can tell me, nigga
I just wanna let y'all know man I've been through so many things

N if it wasn't for the way I live life
Would a nigga pray every night to Christ?
Jesus I'm just asking
'Coz my prayers never seem to get answered

Ma mama didn't raise no bastard
I was born with the talent you can't touch
I call magic, you call it music once it get remastered
I got with Gotti started makin' classics

It?s murder, it?s the courses of traffic
Trust was my only niggaz force of habit
At the time in the game everything was average
Pac catches die, big catches die
And my nigga had a plan to keep Def Jam alive

First he sign D then he sign me
Then he introduced Jay and the rest is history
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the misery
Reminiscin' the Spike Lee them was the school days
We graduated with A's

But these niggaz make you wanna bring out the are's and AK's
And till they back up 'coz that what they gave us
When they read the vendikas and various papers
But no heart, no foul y'all, niggaz is funny style anyway
Now, we go hard shit till the edge

that's a good question though, see I don't understand
Why they would think what they thinking about
It's just not the case though I love my niggaz that's all I'm guilty of
And that all that I ever was guilty of is the love for my niggaz

It's all good though I ain't stressing that shit man
Sometimes God has to put you through things
That bring out the best, very in who you are nigga

Sam said it to me, he said, ""Sometimes greatness
Is not what you accomplish, it's what you overcome""
Still breathin', feel me?

Ja Rule,"My nigga Buck 3000 over here, you know, 
My nigga Gotti, the Princess, Momma, what's up baby? ha ha, 
Brooklyn son, what up what up? 
My nigga Lloyd, my nigga Caddy, my nigga C. Gotti, 
My nigga Young Merc, my nigga Blackchild (Exodus), 
My nigga Cool Joe, this is a new beginning, 
You know, I see everybody in the building, my nigga L, 
My nigga Gab, my whole Murder Inc. mob, 
Yo, you know how we do, yo, yo all my niggas

This here is exodus! Say goodnight to the legend,
Cause lord knows the world gon' miss him,
Universal the system is similar to institutionalism,
And I just did 7 years in prison.
Now I'm a free parolee and time spent, its money they owe me
Give me my space don't crowd me homie
I'm a motherfuckin' hustler.
Pushin' rhymes like weight, but sometimes its slow,
It's up and down like the Dow Jones, shit fluctuates 
But my real niggas still keep their stock in me,
Feds investigate, the monopoly,
Preme team, Murder fuckin' I-N-C, there's no stopping we from
(EXODUS)

You know what I think, I think the world doesn't have a clue, 
On what its like to be a, a superstar in the spotlight, 
And and, everybody is lookin' at you and everybody's, 
You know, scrutinizing you and they got their lil opinions and shit. 
I came in this game, you know and got in this music business to do what I do, 
To make music for the people to enjoy, for the world to love, 
You know, and and somehow I became a motherfuckin' criminal ha ha

Yo, damn I remember when it was on UPN News
And I refused to start losin' and hopped in my WHO
Got a recruit from this (nice?) and peeled back the WHO
Niggas listen in I'll tell you how it all began (gun shots)
That's how it sounded when I-N-C came into the game
On 10th of murder then them, them,
Well we, we, we, cause these boys is hot
These boys got glocks, these boys send shots do you know what its like, 
To live your life hard knock?
I think not that's why you live it safe through mine
I think plot then kill, you think suein' them blind
You think life's a bitch? I think the bitch is mine!
We'll never see eye to eye, y'all corporate, we gangsters
And niggas tryin' my patience is gettin' me anxious,
To speak for my defendants, that say that they plaintive
Guess we guilty by song, but yo the government must be on
(Exodus)


I mean to think that we would jeopardize everything that we built, 
To motherfuckin', sell drugs and launder money? 
I mean are you fuckin' serious!? 
You understand, I-I mean, we-we're a company you understand, 
A-a-a record company, that wants to show love to every nigga that cant get love, 
That cant receive love, from, from motherfuckin', 
The corporate world, that cant go get a job, 
Cause they been in jail, they did a 3 to 9, a motherfuckin', 
A bit or whatever the case may be they did for their time. 
We give these motherfuckers the opportunity, we give them jobs, 
Cause y'all ain't gonna give 'em the jobs, so we give it to 'em. 
And motherfuckers wanna look at us and down us for what we do for that! 
They wanna call us motherfuckin' criminals and crime family for that! 
Well if they wanna call us criminals and crime families, 
Then so be it motherfucker! Cause these is my niggas 
And if nobody's gonna stand up for my motherfuckin' niggas, 
Then we gon' do it ourselves, we goin' police ourselves, 
That's how we been getting down nigga, holla back at me, Rule. Exodus!",Exodus (Outro),2005
Ja Rule,"Do you love me, do you hate me
Do you love me, do you hate me
Do you love me, do you hate me
Yeah, yeah

This world loves me, this world loves me not
I'm torn between the best of both cus I'm hot
In this game so brittely, literaly
I got niggas wanna riddle me, get rid of me
R-U-L-E, need I say more?
World, hope y'all prepared for the chaos
Cause y'all want the beast in me, so I'ma give it
Paint pictures vivid, live high as a spirit
Y'all can all jump in it
That's what you might as well do
If you gonna live life timid
And I ain't never been intimidated
Believe me, and I don't wanna fuckin' breath easy
I wanna make it hard for these niggas
So when they can't stand me
I'ma make it so these niggas can't feed they family
Now do you love me, or do you hate me?
C'mon and get me, I keep it off safety

[Chorus]
Do you love me
Do you hate me
Ready or not
Here I come

There's nothin' but love spread between me and my niggas
We bust guns together and fuck so many bitches
But I know that Hell is callin'
In the name of the lord just let a nigga in
Cause I ain't done nothin' wrong, but love thy self
And harm other niggas that wanna stop my health
Is that healthy?
Cause love'll never be hand over hand
It's man versus man
It's Murda
If I'm gonna be hated or to be loved
I prefer ta live wild and die from slugs
What you want from me?
Lord I'm only a human
Tho I bear your name, I'm a devil in chains
Release me, cause Lord only knows it ain't easy
When I'm scarred for life, I know that he sees me
Now do you love me nigga
Or do you hate me nigga
C'mon and get me
I'm waiting nigga

[Chorus: x2]

Y'all just wanna watch me rise, then watch me fall
Before it's all done I'ma die from it all
I might OD in a club off drugs like River Phoenix
Or get shot down like BIG and Pac for my genius
I know this worlds seen it before, and here I come
I know y'all fiendin' for more, and I'm not done
As long as I can run through current like state times
Keep up a sane mind, and hand on my iron, I'ma blast off mine
Look in the eyes of a nigga who seldomely cries
I got a beautiful wife and kids, why me?
Y'all cats choose cash and cribs, why me?
If this good livin' Lord, why me?
When I live so dirty yet I'm worthy to be
Number one, the world's only begotten son
Here I come

Do you love me?
Do you hate me?

Ja Rule,"I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me

[Chorus]
How dare these niggas try to fuckin' hate on me
Come out and make records sound just like me
But nobody does this here quite like me
Now let me tell a little something 'bout me
Pops tags, things fresh to death like me
Who pulls more whips out the stash than me
Y'all bitches wanna ride, c'mon it's on me
I guess it's my time, all eyes is on me

Man everybody wanna rhyme like Rule, sing like Rule
Talk some shit to get they name on the news
Papers, haters never pay they dues
Always got their feet in somebody shoes
Walk with me, or ride this old Bentley
With the rims you can sit in
Or the Enso with them TV's that's hidden
I stay in menages with various women
Huh, I'm just kiddin' that's not how I'm livin'
The realest, the nigga in the realest state
I got real estates in different states, go figure
Cause I ain't singing you'se a ""Gold Digger""
But bitches, ""you ain't fuckin' with no broke niggas""
That's why I ride, ain't you see I put you on the CLS
We on the point your voice sound like sex, yes
There's no real way to stop me, that's why y'all copy
I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me

[Chorus]

Yea, I know, one more gin, bitch you better come on in
Relax a while, sip on hypno and henn
I like your style, you're so old school
In them Sasson Vidals, fifty four eleven
Reebok classics Remind me of '87 when
Niggas was playing with blocks like little kids and
Even though we men we still big wheelin'
Still cop cribs, six beds, four baths, high ceilings
All of the art of drug-dealin' cause every mil
Is two for me, when it's all tax-free
Pray for God's children, all except for me
I'mma walk in the path the Lord has paved for me
One foot at a time, niggas follow my footsteps
Put the world on my shoulders, leave one set of footprints
Man, y'all motherfuckers can't stop me, that's why y'all copy
I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me

[Chorus]

I know what a nigga that do right, can't do no wrong
And everything's alright, till everythin' goes wrong
No part to piss in, no shoulder to cry on
You get to thinkin' why can't we let by-gones be by-gones
Rule the icon, who killed the industry like iPods
Had these niggas runnin' like track stars
Except runnin' backwards when I sit back rollin' the backwoods
Loadin' my trey-deuce for them niggas that act hood
Ridin' my six-deuce uptown, I'm so hood
Bitches love the coupes when them doors swing upwards
Money long, I'm putting from the green like T-Woods
Hard white is not to be confused with white good
White gold should never be perceived as platinum
And cubic-zirconium never gon' shine like diamonds
Cause, no matter how hard they copy, they still not me
Y'all bitch niggas ain't fuckin' with me

Beaches, houses, hoes, foes, friends
And when the day ends that's when it all begins
You wit him here's my room key holla at me
While you thinka think I'ma hit it up
Then look at the nigga you thinkin' you love c'mon love

We could go there me and you creep off all night
If you love it, in the mornin' awake with new light
If you lookin' like I ain't gonna handle his
Let me handle my bizzz, it is what it is
Nigga livin' his life and that's my bitch
You know I gotta wife, let's keep this thing tight, baby

Now every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, me and you
'Cause every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, baby

Don't let the word get out baby
This is strictly between me and you baby
If they knew we were doin' what we were doin' it'd probably ruin
Our creep away summer in Cancun's-and I, love
The way we get away throw away a whole day
Turn off the pagers and phones, we in the zone like
Fuck life, we live life, this is our life, live your life

'Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you, with you
Shorty be checkin up on you, on you
But if baby girl only knew, only knew
You've got a lot of freak in you baby
Did I ever tell you my man love what you do
That little thing with yo' tongue you the best, who knew?
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, baby

Now every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, me and you
'Cause every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do

I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)
(And I know)

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Why'all niggas is pussy, poonani, (Vagina)
Your (Monologue's) getting tired, now it's time to ride
You're print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane
Let east coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin' at the speed of sound
Tryin' to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin' their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out
Leavin 'em laid out, dead, in just a sport
Cause we ain't playin' up here in New York

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find god
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringin' the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to (Lean Back)
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin' them Howard niggas, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the x is where the team be at

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doin' shit for nothin', it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas want to murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

Ralph Tresvant
Biggie Smalls
Listen

Uh yeah baby ooh, listen to me, oh yeah

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the 'Thriller in Manila'
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' ""Ay papi!""
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drug flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin' mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed

With some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known to bustin' in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love to hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to comin' together is crazy
How come you and your sister make similar faces 
When y'all cummin' y'all be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches
Knows there's a bigger picture than the camera rollin'
'Cause I don't think y'all be knowin' how the shit's unfoldin'
Back shots to the rear, got the MAC unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
But we so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back (Shit)

I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E&J and Ginger Ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hun's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressin' 'em, I'm undressin' 'em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
Fulfillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split, shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin' for an intermission

Purr when wet, worth puttin' diamonds on your collar

We down, hittin' switches like a 6-4
Follow me and you against the world, baby girl

Your 6 with wide-screen TVs, in the head

You like the livin’ dead ‘cuz you won't be back
The cat you thought was on throwin' you off-track

Can't do that, love's like a tug-a-war match
You can't win, you fall in, get too attached

You wanna be where I'm at, feelin' me without climax
Nails diggin' in my back, head board outta wack
What you love about Ja is what caught your eye
Painful lies and sweet goodbyes, baby, why?

Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

You were the generous type, you brought me things I didn't need
Promised to take care of me but then I pushed you to leave, yeah, yeah

You don't even wanna call at all, but you come around tryin' to hit me off
You don't wanna go out with me, I can't stand to see you outta line

Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel- that can't soar, can't fly
And I imagine the Lord knows why


I feel like an angel in my broken wings
So I can soar again, Lord let me in
And through all the passion and the pain and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin' (yeah)

And for those that can't take it, stand up

The moon turns to sky
The sky turns to you
I’m falling, I’m falling with no parachute
I’m falling for love with no parachute

All the way form the heaven to the stars, to the moon, to your heart
We only fail to get up to you
My world is new, I put it on the cross
Get thanks to the Lord, the legendary fall
Fuck you, no pause, niggas make God bless us all
Form the.. to the roof, to the head, to the floor
It’s a long fall and a lot of nigga fall short
And a lot of niggas fall off
But not me, I could never see the ball drop
Unless is new year in the heart of New York
If you’re new to the block, get a little rough
Especially if the heart ain’t wide enough
'Cause I’ve been through it all, and it’s even more
Only niggas get the fall.

[Chorus]

If I get it from the Heavens above to the fire to my ass
Nobody surpasses death, it don’t lasts
Now you kill me
I’ve already been dead, I’m a wholly spirit
Watch my flow fly around like a G6
While my body stays down in the audience.
I’m living this life limitless
If it ain’t fly has no relevance
If it ain’t domestic, it’s not intelligent
You should be smart and jump of the…
The dark side, is a long ride…
Just to been through it all, and to see even more
To fly, the niggas get to fall.

Pray for the day, your pain goes away
And for the time, wasted on goodbye
Can't get back the time, but you stay on my mind
Forgive me for the lies and all the tears you've cried

Yeah; so I pray, every night for a better day
It's like the world's Ike and I'm Annie Mae
But ain't no bitch here, though I shed so many tears for ya
Only cause a nigga care for ya
I'm talkin' 'bout the world over, wake me when it's all over
I don't know if it gets any colder, or any warmer
I'm weak but I'm gettin' stronger
Forever young but I'm gettin' older, lend me your shoulder
But I don't wanna cry on it
But at times I feel a need to lie on it; closure
And some things will never change
I could be last but still way ahead of the game
I do my bid to go hot like 'Pac like Wayne
Like Rick like Ray even muh'fuckin' James

And all I ask of y'all is keep Rule in your prayers

Yeah hope to see you when I get there

On my way to St. Elsewhere

I guess that's why I'm so scared
But I refuse to die and I won't die
Until history records my greatness, Amen
I see angels, I see demons
I hear laughter, people screamin'
Makes me wonder what's my reason for being here
And so I'm kneeling

Sing a prayer for me
But don't nobody shed a tear for me I'm dyin' inside as it is
If, lonely is the way of the walk
Then, I'm practically lyin' in a coffin

I bet not as often as you say you love summer
And it's gonna be the coldest winter ever while I'm locked up

You know they say everything we hear is an opinion not fact
And everything we see is perspective not truth
The fewer the facts the stronger the opinions
And opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance, bitch

I’m hoping in heaven got a ghetto
So when I get there I can tell you to smile whole hearted
I’m back where I started
I’m prisoner of my own success
But hardly caring enough to know that I’m dead without it
No cribs, no cars, no champagne
No bright lights, no bitches, no big stage
But f-ck it I’m in a better place
And I’m talking in third person in case you couldn’t relate
Diary of a monster
Sometimes my mind fades to a place not even I can explain
'Cause there's a thin line between genius and insane
Guess which one I am, I think it’s obvious that

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

Yeah, And I say that to say this
Man if life is a bitch I’m gon fuck her then tell her that I love her
Not beneath her or above her but inside no rubber
That's my interpretation of mutherfucker
No lie, no truth my life is a little bit of both
Who’s who, who knows anymore
My choice is to get it in real moist so I can come hard
And the world is ours, better yet bitch mines
Shot at the moon just to be among stars
Then God alienated it and ended up on mars
Serenity understand it extraterrestrial that I is
Think I do it all because it’s obvious

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

Yeah, uh huh
Let me, I’m seeing my whole life ahead of me
And I’m feeling like this life can never be (naaah)
'Cause a nigga on a whole nother pedigree
I’m so far from home it feels like a million miles
And I’m long gone and ain’t no coming back
But really I never left
I’ve been silent yet at my the best
Ya’ll haters spread hatred like ?
And I still find ways to make crochet hearts
Like Kanye my 808?s is heartbreakers
Maybe me singing to your heats a mistake
Nah, Maybe I’m just before my time
Or maybe it’s just that obvious

I said you were a dear sweet mama
But I ain't gonna call you sweet, no mo'
Say you used to be a sweet mama
An I can't call you sweet no mo'
An ev'ry time I come to yo' house
It's a man standin' in your do'

I said I'm goin' up the country
Where the Southern done cross the Dog
I said I'm goin' in up the country
Where the Southern done cross the Dog
If you don't see me tomorrow
You won't have no man at all

Baby, If I had wings like a bullfrog on a pond
Lord, If I just had wings, mama
Like a bullfrog on a pond
I would ride right 'chere
And lie in sweet mama's arms

Lord, said the blues just a rabbit
Runnin' for a solid mile
Said, the blues just a rabbit
Runnin' for a solid mile
Lord, that fool couldn't catch him
And he sat right down and cried

I said, 'Look-a-here now, baby
There's somethin' really worryin' me'
I said, 'Look-a-here, sweet mama
There's something really worryed me'
You know my plan need a future
My old time used to be.

There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow

We would have such a very good time such a fine time
Such a happy time
And I remember how we'd play simply waste the day away
Then we'd say nothing would come between us two dreamers

Jace,"Oh well, I'm ignorant
But not to the fact that I'm ignorant, of course
I know that, I'm indifferent
I don't care to know what I don't
I don't care 'til I'm coming home
And my dad tell me some shit about when he my age, he was doing shit
Protesting about something that I forget currently
But that's not the point, the point is
To my pot, the boy is in the crowd devoid of giving a fuck
I would call his bluff but I've been thinking 'bout it
And shit, he ain't wrong, though
I don't vote but I think I did at prom, though
I don't know about a world if it's not home
I don't even know the first thing about what Obama do
I'm better off telling y'all what Lebron been doing
I don't even know what my mom been doing
I hit her up every Sunday
And we talk, but the call's going one way
In the dark, if it's not what I'm doing
Never been aware from the start, but I knew it
I don't even care how my tech work
If the shit work, put it there, turn it on, we can do it
Funny thing is I could look it all up today
And placate the debate within my brain waves
But the shows I watch all start at 8 so

Oh well
It's the season finale, so
Oh well
I kind of have to watch live, people are gonna tweet about it
Oh well
But I'm aware of all this stuff, I'll figure it out
Oh well

I do care when my phone's dying
Like, when that shit's red and I can't text
And I can't check what my fans said
I get mad stressed
Laying in the bed but I can't rest
Till my gram checked, wish I cared less
Leave it at the crib, I'm a damn mess
I should stop for a day, wanna try that shit
Drifting away, I wanna ride that ship
Dinner on the table but I'm unable to be tasteful
Underneath, I'mma like that pic
Watching the show on a phone, filming Coachella on phones
Hoping I capture the moment so I could post it
Don't live in the moment, hoping I'm still in control
But I'm praying I'm not alone
All the fans say I'm great at talking to 'em
They don't even understand I am not the man
I just can't go a day with being alone
When I'm with friends, though, why the fuck am I still on my phone?
Wishing I could look this shit up on Chrome
Wishing I could take a second to stop and reflect it
But someone just texted me

Oh well
It's actually like an important text
Oh well
I'm trying to solve, like, logistical issues
Oh well
It's time sensitive is what I'm trying to say
Oh well

I was gonna do a line, but I sneezed
I was gonna smoke, but I need weed
I just wanna roll up and then leave
But everyone keeps on talking to me
Like ""How's Mike Will? You know Rae Sremm?
I like ""No Type"" but I really hate them""
Like I asked for your opinion when I barely even know what day it is
I'm passed [?} loans and my rent
But I just bought new J's and shit
Going way fast on a one way road with the window down tryna wave at them
My mom says I should go back to classes
But I'm in the strip club and I'm tapping asses
And bitch look like Jacqueline Onassis
But she lies a lot and can't kick the habit
I've tried to stop giving passes to those who front it cause that's living backwards
And they give two cents when I ain't even ask them
Treat them like exams and I need to pass them
I twitching dutches, I don't do the backwards
But this gas station don't carry those
And I'm tryna smoke, man, how traffic
Here's a 20 and some change, man, you can have it like
No

Oh well
Oh well

When I was all alone
You came down
And saved my soul

When I found my world was crashing
And I thought I'd lost my passion
You came and laid a hand on this little girl
When I thought my dreams were fading
I looked up and saw you waiting
You reached your hand down
And you made my world

I never thought of where I might be
If I turned away from You
I never thought of all I would need
Without you
You came down 
When I was all alone
You came down 
You came down
And saved my soul

To the sound
Comin' after me
Step back

It's a mystery
Is it something?
Probably nothing
Still I find a way to scare myself

This all feels familiar 
And I know better

They are only paper tigers following me
In the wild imagination of the make believe
And there's a fighter, a survivor, arising in me
I'm not afraid of paper tigers

Night brings creepy things
And I hide away
False fears disappear
In the light of day
The sun is rising
I'm realizing
The only thing to fear is fear itself
Now I am certain 
That my beast of burden
Isn't worth a worry

Your poetry and your sensation
Are within me

My heart dances happily
And my being is free in you
Look what you have done in me

I know that once
I breathed in much solitude
That did not feel
The beating in my chest

Today life gives me a kiss me
When breathing
I feel the result of a thousand butterflies
That are flying within me

Look what you have made in me
With your immense love
Your poetry and your sensation
Are within me

My heart dances happily
And my being is free in you
Look what you have done in me

And not yet do
I know if it were only a violin
Or if you spoke to me
If maybe it was a ray
That I fell
Or if it was your hand

Por salvar también la mía

Lo que nunca cambiaría
Por tener siempre tu amor
Que la luna sea del día
Why que la noche sea del sol

Lo que nunca cambiaría 
Por tenerte una vez más
Que el mar sea de agua dulce
Why que el río del sal

Lo que nunca cambiaría
Es la alegría por dolor
La ternura que me inspira
La simpleza de tu amor

Si vuelvo a nacer
Why me obligan a escoger
Daría hasta el alma
Por seguirte siendo fiel

Siempre diste tu vida
Por salvar también la mía
Lo que nunca cambiaría...
Dejo atrás esas voces de maldad
Ansiedad, sólo siembran al pasar
Me enseñastes la pasion (ohhh)
Lo que nunca cambiaría...
Es la alegria por dolor

Eres la luz del sol, why mi lucero

Eres tú la estrella de mi noche
De alegría tu eres mi derroche
Tu mirada me lleva hasta la luna
Has llenado mi alma de fortuna

Cada noche sueño
Que eres tú mi dueño
En todo camino
Siempre vas conmigo
Eres mi mejor amigo

Sin ti no puedo vivir
Eres la luz del sol, why mi lucero
Dueño de mi corazón
El infinito amor
Que yo más quiero
Que yo más quiero

De tu lado yo nado el mar entero

Lluminas el cielo why mi sendero
Por amarte doy hasta la vida

Yo quisiera entregarte sin medida

Yo voy de tu mano

Every time I fall a little bit harder
Every time I fall a little bit farther
Every time I fall
I fall right back into your arms

Every time I try
To explain the reason why
I have let You down
I fall to the ground

What is it You see in me
That makes You believe
No matter how far I stray
I will still find the way

Just when I think I'm not strong enough
You reach out to me and You lift me up

Time and time again
When I think I've reached the end
It's Your voice I hear
That draws me near

I don't know what makes You stay
When I act this way
No matter what we've been through
I can turn to You

Just when I think I'm not strong enough
You reach out to me and You lift me up

You find the beauty in my imperfections
The guiding light in all my misdirection
And when I think You've finally given up
You fill my heart with unconditional love

Every Time I fall
I fall back in Your arms",Every Time I Fall,2002
Jaci Velasquez,"So many different religions
And so many different churches
And if God really loves me
Then why does life keep hurting me?
Have you ever asked any of these questions?
Well my friend I've got the answer just listen

You have the power
To make the seasons change
The river flows for you
The wind whispers Your name
For me you left Your throne
And traded crown for thorns instead
I'm safe within not by Your skin
But because Your blood was red

Some say You're black, you're white
They question if you're real
We treat you like we treat ourselves
I wonder how you feel
To see your children fight in spite
of the tears for us you've shed
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

We may be different but
The God we serve's the same
Yet every Sunday we separate
And bring the Father pain
Your name is higher than any other
Yet You took my place instead
And now my sins are washed away
Because Your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red
Doesn't matter what color you are
As you are as long as your blood was red
Doesn't matter what color I am
As long as my blood was red",The Blood Song,2002

There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
",There But for You Go I,1988
Jacinta Mulcahy,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love [From Brigadoon],2009
Jacinta Whyte,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [From Cats],2004
Jacintha,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999
Jacintha,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

Jacintha,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999

But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

All up in my arms, you know where you should be
Now just give me the word, I’ll be your melody
'Cause you I know I could see us livin’ happy everly
After

I now what you wanted from the very start
And I can tell you feel it too when we’re apart
But we’re here right now with the lights turned down
And the night’s still young 
And it’s clear right now how you feel right now
Tryna have some fun

Let’s go over the top
Talkin’ out of control

Drop that thing to the floor

Beating like a 808
Beating like a 808
Beating like a 808
Beating like a 808

I see ‘em talkin’ but I’m hardly phased
I can’t hear ‘em got the bass pumpin’ louder than a Harley race
And what we got girl is far from fake
I wanna take you out shopping and buy you Cartier
That’s just how much you mean to me
When I’m with you I don’t go outside for beautiful scenery
Come over you don’t need a key cause I gave you the garage code

Jack Adaptor,"I don't know what you want from me
Or what you think a love ought to be
I want something that's open and strong
As the country this road's moving on

From the mountain to the valley
From the ocean to the alley
From the highway to the river
One emotion to deliver
One heart, one way, one love
To share but not to chain
That's freedom

It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom

I don't know why it takes so long
To remember
What the world's doin' wrong
Never wanted to shove my plan on another
Who can't understand

All I want is a fast lane to
Where the road across this plain
Won't take you
I want something you understand
To make us stand proud
As nothing else can

It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom

It's a measure of trust

It's tender and tough
That's freedom
It's all love is about

And that I do respect

How can we connect 
I realize this is strange love 
But we should let it flow 
And you don't need to say anything 
'Cause I already know 
Don't it feel right dear 
Now we're making eye contact

Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)

She's got lots of udder stuff

Who gives me hoof and mouth disease?

They're fun to pet or roast or bake
They got no hair, and they got no teeth
Damp and fuzzy underneath

Got no ears and they got no feet

That's something brushed away the bitter tears you've cried
If you feel something touch your face and disappear without a trace
And leave a warm familiar feeling by your side

Jack Blanchard & Misty Morgan,"I like cows, I think they're cute
Walkin' in their big cow suit
They give me milk, they give me cheese
They give me hoof and mouth disease
I like cows and that's no bull
Around the cowhouse, I got pull
If cream and butter ain't enough
She's got lots of udder stuff

Who gives me milk? Who gives me cheese?
Who gives me hoof and mouth disease?
I like to have my friends around
(But) I'll take cows when the chips are down

I dig the ducks down on the lake (quack quack quack)
They're fun to pet or roast or bake
They got no hair, and they got no teeth
Damp and fuzzy underneath

I think that worms are hard to beat
Got no ears and they got no feet
Pop 'em in the ice cube tray
Drop 'em and they ricochet

Who gives me milk? Who gives me cheese?
Who gives me hoof and mouth disease?
I like to have my friends around
(But) I'll take cows when the chips are down

We're leaving this whole fairground behind
It's a dream that's going cold

The circus never dies
The act forever haunts these skies
I know we cannot stay

Farewell to the fairground
These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town
Until the ice begins to thaw

This place used to gleam
I see it in my hopeful dreams
Now I have to get away

We move towards the stars
And all that we touch becomes ours
Let's keep warm till it's day

Farewell to the fairground
These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town
Until the ice begins to thaw

We'll head south, just hold my hand now
I feel like I'm casting off my clothes
And I'm running through the snow towards the sunset

Can't find curtains to shut it away

And the Milkman that nobody knows
Leaves bottles of tears
At the house full of laughter
Nobody ever hears 

O the grass is burned black
By the ships coming back from the stars, golden stars
Sea turned to steam
When we boiled the dream of tomorrow, tomorrow 

When it gets light
Some of them always stay
She's dressed in white
Till then smoke turns her grey 

Falling, stumbling, feeling it's way
Morning nighttime moves into day
Can;t find warmth to keep it away 

Used to be alone on the waves of cloud
Now the flotsam dawn brings in the crowd
And the angel who sits in the car
Full of desire
But the hoses who came from the town
Put out her fire 

O the seas have run dy
And the sun's one good eye is to blind to see
Sky has gone bad
From the good times we had burning bright, such good times

Some of them always stay

Till the smoke turns her gray",Morning Story,1972

Don't seem to have any feelings

Bending the time
Just a little so we can get by

People say it won't last

Leaving our hearts in a thousand towns
Sleeping when dawn comes around
Staying there just for a moment or two
Together

Leaving our place in a thousand rooms
Breathing in gasoline fumes
Laying there just for a moment or two

In the middle of the floor.

[Chorus]

When a girl reach the age of 18
She begins to think she's grown,
And that's the kind of little girl
You can never find at home.

[Chorus]",Early in the Morning,1999
Jack Bruce,"I feel free, I feel free, I feel free
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free

Feel when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road, my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud, yeah

I feel free, I feel free, I feel free

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road, my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud

Dance floor is like the sea
Ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free

I feel free, I feel free, I feel free
