Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,2008
Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"Savoy, the home of sweet romance
Savoy, it wins you at a glance
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Your form, just like a clingin' vine
Your lips, as warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine, divine.

Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"Picture you upon my knee
Just tea for two
And two for tea
Just me for you
And you for me alone

Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and you'll awake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For me to take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you, a girl for me
Oh, can't you see how happy we would be",Tea for Two,2008
Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"Here we are, out of cigarettes, 
Holding hands and yawning, look how late it gets, 
Two sleepy people, by dawn's early light, 
Too much in love to say good-night. 

Say, here we are, in this cozy chair, 
Picking on a wishbone from the Frigidaire, 
Two sleepy people, with nothing to say, 
Much to much in love to break away. 

Do you the remember the nights we used to linger in the hall? 
Papa didn't like you at all, 
But I was crazy 'bout you, baby! 
Do you remember the reason why we married in the Fall? 
To rent this little nest, and get a bit of rest! 

Well, here we are, just about the same, 
Gawky little fellow, dizzy little dame, 
Two sleepy people, by dawn's early light, 
Much to much in love to say good-night. 

Good-night!",Two Sleepy People,2008
Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"You left me and you went away,
You said that you'd be back in just a day,
You've broken your promise and you left me all alone,
I don't know why you did dear, but I do know that you're gone.

[Chorus]
I'm walking the floor over you,
I can't sleep a wink that is true.
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two,
Walking the floor over you.

Now darling you know I love you well,
I love you more than I can ever tell,
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine,
But you went and left me here with troubled mind.

[Chorus]

Now someday you may be lonesome too,
Walking the floor is good for you.
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry,
Remember that I love you and I will until I die.

Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove the little boys wild
And when it came to winning blue ribbons
You must have shown the other kids how
I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
I bet you made the cutest bow
Oh you must've been a beautiful baby
'Cause baby look at you now

Does your mother realize
The stork delivered quite a prize
The day he left you on the family tree?
Does your dad appreciate
That you're merely super great
The miracle of any century?
If they don't just send them both to me

You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten

And when it came to winning blue ribbons

Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"I could dance nightly
Just holding you tightly
My sweet
I could keep right on
Because you're so light on
Your feet
You're easy to dance with

There is no doubt in
The way we stand out in
The crowd
Though it's called dancing
To me it's romancing
Out loud
You're easy to dance with

Loving you
The way I do
Makes you easy to dance with
That is why I'm always right on the beat
All those charms
In one man's arms
Makes you easy to dance with
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet

Let's dance forever
Come on, say we'll never
Be through
It's so easy to dance with you",Your Easy to Dance With,2008

Bing Crosby And The Jesters,"Oh, me name is MacNamara, I'm the leader of the band
Although we're few in numbers, we're the finest in the land
We play at wakes and weddings and at every fancy ball
And when we play the funerals, we play the March from Saul

Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band

Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair
The annual celebration, all the gentry will be there
When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the hand
Says he, I never saw the likes of MacNamara's Band

Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band

Oh, my name is Uncle Julius and from Sweden I did come
To play with MacNamara's Band and beat the big bass drum
And when I march along the street the ladies think I'm grand
They shout, there's Uncle Julius playing with an Irish band

Oh, I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a uniform of green
And I'm the funniest lookin' Swede that you have ever seen
There is O'Brians, O'Ryans, O'Sheehans and Meehans, they come from Ireland
But, by yimminy, I'm the only Swede in MacNamara's Band

Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band

That's MacNamara",MacNamara's Band,2005
Bingo Hand Job,"Up in the morning and out to school
Mother says there'll be no work next year
Qualifications once the Golden Rule
Are now just pieces of paper

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because you're going forwards
Doesn't mean I'm going backwards

If you look the part you'll get the job
In last year's trousers and your old school shoes
The truth is son, it's a buyer's market
They can afford to pick and choose

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because I dress like this
Doesn't mean I'm a communist

The factories are closing and the army's full
I don't know what I'm going to do
But I've come to see in the Land of the Free
There's only a future for the chosen few

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because you're going forwards
Doesn't mean I'm going backwards

At twenty one you're on to of the scrapheap
At sixteen you were top of the class
All they taught you at school
Was how to be a good worker
The system has failed you, don't fail yourself

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because you're going forwards
Doesn't mean I'm going backwards",Tom's?,1991

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

""It is always
Nice to see you""

Of an actor

To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies

Someone watching me

I raise my head

On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?

No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection

Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt

And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet

It will continue
Through the morning

To the bells
Of the cathedral

Bingx,"They tell me life is short
In the blink of an eye we come and die
Keep it in mind that life is war
Stay grounded, fly and soar
Always know what you fighting for
Aging fast, gotta pave a path and go figure out what my life is for
Quick witted and everyday I gotta switch lanes
Fuck race, no pigment
I got thick skin, making big waves
Positive being positive is my legacy
Pray for me, or make way for me
Because I'm setting out to go change the earth, and I just may
My life is was I call it, and I call it successful
Now everybody wanna eyeball it, like ͞""how the fuck he do that though?͟""
Take pride in your every action
Everyday of my life is work
They say time is money and I know what that time is worth

Even if the sky was falling down
Even if the sky was falling, I'm not falling down
I stand tall through it all, I've risked too much to just give up now
I'm pushing on through

Sure as the tide rolls in at night
I'll still be here at the of days screaming at the sky
Let the fire consume and cleanse what's before me
Behold, I'll build my empire before the ashes hit the ground

Life inside a piece of paper, live it through my pen and pad
Lead inside my pencil like the hammer on my pistol back
There ain't no hitting back
Life it ain't no tennis match
All over the net but that ain't where I do business at
Face to face with adversity and intimidation
This is real, this is raw, ain't no imitation
No limitations ain't a ceiling in sight 
There ain't no rules or regulations either yield or you fight
Just take a look at where I been that's some appealing advice
͚'Cause you can build until it falls or keep it real and you rise

The echoes of failure inside someone

Nightly fading, just what are you celebrating?
Old fashions burn your short fuse dry

Endlessly trailing my dreams
No need to pretend I want you instead
To council her excellency

Can’t be the first to say you're the worst
Surely there's one or two
I care more if you act as though you like me
Then if you really do

Living a lie to a song you can’t hide
The paintings are still in the tube

Biohazard,"I found a way out, a solution inside
From the things that are bathering me
It's been too long since I felt this way
From your sad life I broke free
Don't ever think that you ripped me apart
And walked away with a price
Cause you can not penetrate my cold heart
ANd fill it with your disease

I wonder now how I lived before
Deaf, dumb, dead and blind
I moved my life forward and I'm never goin' back
And I've left you far behind
There's a lot of things that I've now realized
From the way that you treated me
It's bullshit and it's hatred you epitomized
You were blessed to have been with me

[Chorus:]

You filled my life with your disease
I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
Disease is flowing through my veins
I'd rather die right now than live in pain

[Lead]

Looking around at the past and the present
Things are so much better now
Your misery wanted my company
But you can't keep a good man down
Whatever made me want to be with you
Is something I can't understand
'cause if I never saw your fucking face again
I'd die a happy man

[Chorus 2x]",Disease,1992
Biohazard,"Not even for a second when he wake up did he ask
If today was gonna be his last
An average day in the middle of a life
Terminated by a sharp knife
Killing, spilling the liquid blood
As his boyz found him lying face down in the mud
You might say this song is in poor taste
But I must discuss the waste

[Chorus I:]

Of lives of friends that I have lost
Who pays the price, who pays the cost
Can't cry, just anger till the end
It burns inside to lose a friend

Walking thin lines, anything to cop a dime
Labelled habitual, a loser three times
Just fucking' around, knuckles bloody to the bone
Whatever, the future's unknown
Unless you believe in predestination of fate
The letter read termination
It was fucked up I couldn't make out his face
Through the blod, what a fucking waste

[Chorus I]

[Chorus II:]

My friend was there until the end (my friend)
Can never be replaced
The pain that I taste (It's over)
What a fucking waste

[Chorus I]

Cold blooded murder, suicide, another body laid to rest
Untimely demise, homicide, my faith is put to the test
Is there a god, sometimes I just can't believe
My friend who is dead was shot and then robbed
Something quite hard to conceive
People dying everyday there's got to be a better way
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay
Like the memory of a friend who stood with me until the end
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay

[Chorus I]

[Lead]

It's not for me that I grieve, but for the families left berieved
I question whether life is fair, I wonder if I even care

He says I can't make it alone, not without him
But I've always been on my own, he doesn't know who I am
And now I'm starting to see just what you are to me
A parasitic leech of my life

[Pre-chorus:]

You feed off the art that I bleed
You're a man with a promise but you ain't shit to me

A man broke his promise and he wants reparations
He sold me up the river, cause me grief and frustration
I gave him all my trust and got stabbed in the back
A lucky motherfucker that he hasn't yet been whacked
You ain't no fucking artist, spend your life exploiting others
Try all you want, you can't break me or my brothers
A business man vulture,no honor, no class
Take your money and your lawyers and shove 'em up your ass

Black Sabbath 1994 Motha Fuckas

Have you ever thought about your soul, can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay your grave
Is God just within your head or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a namethat you read in a book when you were at school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope---Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have the truth. Yes I have seen the light and I've changed my ways.
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scaredat the end of our days.

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believed in God above
They should realize before they criticise
That God is the only way to love.

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer whemn death is near
And say they might as well worship the sun.

I think it is true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad that the opinion you had was the only one voiced.
Will you be so sure when your day is near say you won't believe?
You had a chance but you turned it down now you can't retrieve.

Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize that he is the one,
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate.
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes---I think it's too late.



",After Forever,1994
Biohazard,"Sometimes I feel it's a waste of time
To listen to your shouting a wordless pantomime
Can't you see it falls on deaf ears
Filling me up with your point of view
Your opinions are your own, I got mine too
What I think don't mean nothing to you
When the shit hits the fan
And you're forced by the man
Who holds the key to our promised land
Don't misunderstand what's in the man's hand
'Cause it's all been laid out in the New World Plan
Makin' me feel like a laboratory rat
Without a mind of its own - diseased and fat
I can't let my life go out like that
'Cause I'm an extra skeptic, a true eclectic
I find it hard to trust all the people we've elected
Take a look around, do you feel protected
Like garbage in a dump our lives have been rejected
A blind man leading the not so blind
Creating false truth to fill our minds
To listen to yourself would be a crime
It all comes back to you some time
Like it or not, they got a number on me
I will not break for your demands
Rabid, defensive, in the corner I stand
Caught in a trap, the bait was free
Like it or not, they got a number on me
I can't trust anyone, they're all out to get me
Gonna run until I can't run from the laws that ruin me
Faster and harder so God help me flee
From the lies that we're free and the powers that be
That push the rich forward between you and me
But agree to agree with no guarantee
Of something to live for I'll die if need be
I stand up for all as I fight to be free",Cornered,1994
Biohazard,"If you were to ask for a favor
There is no such thing, just natural behavior
You see we're family inside
To say we're down with you, yo we say it with pride
Because to us you're real people
Never talkin' down, always as an equal
We're brothers of blood, we share the knife
And now we'll see, Who is down for life
But you front and leave us in doubt
We know who you are and what you're all about
Not sharing mutual respect
And Having to worry about stickin' out our necks
Instead of crying about the loss
We're thankful for those who are down for the cause
We live our lives full of rage
Keepin' ourselves down, mentality of the stone age
Negative emotions project zero
Worryin' and hating, you'll never be a hero

And knowing exactly who's down for life",Down for Life,1994

To try and make things right

I am aware

I'm not worried about tomorrow
Don't give a fuck about yesterday
To get through this day of sorrow
I must face what comes my way

To pull the trigger on my soul and

Half a wise guy makes the wrong connections
Flooding our streets with your want to be bullshit
Who whacks who, don't matter who gets hit
The space between the death of our friends is so close
This month it was neglect, our boy died of an overdose
Last month a gunshot, a typical story
That's just the way it goes in a failed territory
No hope, just dope, and your chances are slim
To grow up and get out 'cause you're already in
The vacuum of the street so powerful
Sucking you in it drains your mind by the hour fool
Still smoking dippers our friends are all dusted
Slave to a bottle of juice, fucking disgusted

And the odds are that we'll never grow old
Young guns scam running on a get ahead quick tip
With your pretty ass crimes, you're on a blind road trip

So close yet so far, just a block from the station
Standin' on the corner, I might get taken out
Five blocks to the subway, just five blocks away
Five blocks to the subway, I can do that any day
There's a local wise guy he owns the whole damn block
It's easy doin' business when you're payin' off the cops

You get to play these games when you pay transit fare
Trials and tribulations, a journey made each day

Ain't no time to change your mind when your head begins to sag
Should've known better, ain't working for you now

So change your ways before you ways change you

You're looking up and you're looking down
Shot's are rippin' out from all around
You're crying out for help but it can't be found
The voice of regret is the only sound

And you're goin' with your crew whichever way the wind blows

But as soon as we leave they talk behind our backs
Low selfimage of the way things are
Either way we lose and we can never go far
'Cause always we'll wonder as to just what's the deal
It just depends on what you feel is real
Perception is everything inside our brains
With much bigger problems, no time for games
Of people acting down but it's just a facade
Can't say it to my face, isn't that odd
Just what exactly does trust mean
Is it about being down with the scene
Or is it about following your own true heart
And being true to your friends to the end from the start
Just what is wealth it's just how you view it
It's not having to wonder whether or not you might lose it
It can't be about material gain
If you're drowning alone neck deep in pain

May not be the nature of most humankind

Knock you down, across town all around the underground

Denying, glorifying your way of life while crucifying
Close your eyes for the ride while you glorify your false pride
In any case you're blue in the face 'cause you lost your place in the human race
That pushed you to do what you do so fuck you and your point of view

I used to doubt myself because I lived without
What I needed inside

Nothing to hide enough tears cried
My pride won't be denied
Moan and groan and chew the bone about the zone you call your own
Grow your own backbone hold your own and stand alone
Why pretend and be content with all the hate you hold innate
Pull your weight, it ain't too late to recreate your inner state
Discontent with time ill spent time has come and time has went
Now you vent while you torment why resent ? misrepresent
The scene between the lean and mean serene, extreme, the American dream

Live alive revive and thrive on life deprived as I survive
I'm fuckin' pissed off I used to be so angry
I'd disagree with anything that went against inside me
But things have changed I've rearranged in exchange for all the pain

I kept inside and tried to hide denied and lied, but kept my pride
By my side in good supply all the while, hostile
And senile, I never smiled at anyone but now I'm done

Wars within wars, within wars
To survive you made your own laws
Every day and night to stay alive
You kept your head down and your powder dry
Memories of families
It's God i've known
Take me home
Now you live asking God why
He didn't take you when your brothers all died
Explosions shake the dreams in your head at night in bed
Don't wake him up or you'll end up dead
Try to understand his pain
He still sees blood stains that remain
In his heart and mind, try to numb the pain
People think they understand
Sat watching TV back on quiet land
They spit on you now we'll spit back for you
Our hearts, our voice, gift of our hands
What can they do for you and those who served
And died, we pay respect to the families
Who still cry
Your kids are now full grown
With the love and pride you should have known
Back when your country brought you home
Still now you fight the tears and face your fears each day
But the horrors of fact won't go away
For 2300 MIA's or POW's to this day
We remember and pray for you",Remember,1994

Why don't we stop and think
At the current rate we're sealing our fate
It's much too late for a world based on hate
We've entered the time of quarrel
Human beings can't coexist
No more respect for morals
Our values have been dismissed
It starts in vicious circles and then it filters down
From governments to local gangs
Confrontation all around
State of panic we hang by a thread
The earth will be safe when we're all dead
Call me pessimistic, the glass is empty

Happiness comes from these and within
But we will never find it if we're boiling in sin",State of the World Address,1994
Biohazard,"Your cards were dealt when
You drove through the night
As a man in dark clothes came into your sight

You reached the window lock

And leave it in the crosswalk
He climbed into your seat
And dropped a vial of crack
Pissin' down your leg, you're a victim of carjack
Feel the cold steel as I pull the hammer back
Bang! You're fuckin' dead 'cause it's like that

Are we mentally sick
Feeling inside that drive us like pride
Or emotional scars from our friends that have died
And make us build walls so incredible high
They exceed the ceiling from the terrified feelings
Which we often repress and end up depressed
Some vent it as rage, it's the fashion these days
In a twisted society, we drown in anxiety
Has push come to shove, have we killed the dove
Are we caught in a fit, what makes us tick
Has man gone insane, are we feeling the strain
We must dig and must pick at what makes us tick
Has push come to shove, have we killed the dove
Are we caught in the thick as to what makes us tick
Can you feel the pain that I feel
No
So let me tell you about what is real
Go
The pain inside, it kills me, I cry

Just never push my back against the wall
Beaten senseless, violent relentless
No hope defenseless, beaten senseless
Now you pushed me over the edge
Can't take it no more, I'm seeing red
Beaten senseless over the head
Never gonna stop until your all fucking dead
Vengeance is my only thought
Rage, abuse, the wars I've fought

It's just too late to remember who I am
The things that I believe in and the way that I stand
About peace, harmony, respect for fellow man
All that shit just got thrown against the fan
In my violent rage, they say that I am a criminal
There ain't no labels within the human animal
In this world of bigotry and pain
The violence spreads and terror reigns
The opinions in our minds replace our souls
As the human animal takes control
The path of self-destruction has brought me to this point
As modern day society cracks arthritic joints
No mercy is shown, it's hitting all my weak spots
I never had a gun, but now I want to hear gun shots
I sleep not for fear, I get no rest
Twisted in a sense, 'cause my button has been pressed
How many ways have you shown me that you hate me
And then you wonder why what have you done to me lately
I am an animal
The human animal
A human animal
Tension building, I'm being pushed too far
I need a release, take the lid of this jar
My voice seems useless in this situation
Time to take action, release frustration
Everyone has limits, only so much you can take
Antagonizing pressure is the icing on the cake
Physical abuse, induced or subliminal
Open the door, unleash the human animal
Flashes of red my vision of distortion
Like a virus, it spreads, giving each his portion
Contagious psychopath, the vibe is in synch
Movin' like a pack, we're back to basic instincts
Wild at heart, now we show our true colors
In the path of desperation, we forget about our brothers
Who would die for us, now, we die for no man

you can conquer the world or wander around all starry-eyed
I laid there and dreamt, along for a ride

I await new journeys asleep I remain

To be your own man no matter what
To never back down, and follow your gut

Something that I'd carry wherever I go
He told me someday I'd have to fight to be free

In my eyes, who really pays the price

My lament, for the human race
Guilty, punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done
Sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got
Though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar, as I kneel down and I
Confess to the father that I'm suffering a burning question of
the truth, whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right
off the roof, 'cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
but now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact that the majority
of the people are out there smoking crack, getting doped up,
shooting that shit into their veins, the question must be asked if
we have any brains left, or right or wrong in this son, a
question we all ask and must answer before long, 'cause no one
is safe in this world, what's the deal, the sentence is death and to
what court do I appeal?

Pissin' down your leg, you're a victim of carjack

Mouth locked shut my mind won't swallow

Beat you down, drag you round, break you
Refuse to bend, never ever let it take you

Locked up at war with the demons within

You're cryin' out for help but it can't be found
The voice of regret is the only sound
You play the game and you pay the price
For hustlin' in the gutter with the motherfuckin' street-lice
(You're runnin' and gunnin' and whatever else goes
And you're goin' with your crew whichever way the wind blows
'Cause you got their backs and they got yours
And you live for yourself and you make your own laws)
But sooner or later what goes around comes around
You wind up dead, buried in the hard cold ground",How It Is [Remix],2001
Biohazard,"I question not me, it only happens to others
I can't deny reality as lite gets smothered

If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
'Cause he who paints the big picture
Runs the whole scene

Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous, am I better off dead?

Punishment for all my sins

A burning thought inside my mind
Has me full of pity for all of human kind
As we move forth, we fall further behind

Fear of death, will my life go on?
Controlled fate on the corner rolling dice
Punishment but I've done nothing wrong in my eyes
Who really pays the fucking price

My lament for the human race
Guilty punishment for all my sins

Dread the day that brings the truth
Punishment for what I've done, sentence me for all my sins
Bound in fear for what I've got though not much it seems a lot
Life is death and no one wins

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar
As I kneel down and I confess to the Father
That I'm suffering a burning question of the truth
Whether or not to pull the trigger or to jump right off the roof
'Cause I did things normal and just like all my friends
But now I'm positive and life it all ends

Punishment, for all my sins, I repent

In reality, we all must face the fact
That the majority of the people are out there smoking crack
Getting doped up, shooting that shit into their veins
The question must be asked if we have any brains left

Or right or wrong in this song
A question we all ask and must answer before long
'Cause no one is safe in this world, what's the deal
The sentence is death and to what court do I appeal?

Punishment for all my sins, I repent
Punishment

Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee

Biohazard,"Biohazard - Sellout Lyrics 
So many times I've been lied to, blind to
The ways of the world I've been lied to, blind to
I never understand how this master plan speaking man to man
Could ever give a damn
Hypocritical stance don't make me piss in my pants
You never care unless there's money to make
I'll never sacrifice, I got no time in my life
To fuck around with something that I know is fake
You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

You never understand exactly what kind of man that I am
'till you wear my shoes
You think I envy your life but you never realize I always live the
 way that I
choose
Feel so much regret but you never let
That make you live the truth
You point fingers and lie, the harsh truth you deny
Life is a game that you don't want to lose

You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

and be the one you disrespect and lie to
the one you really want to live your life through
the soul you sell is really your own
because I'm the only one you can never lie to

Chorus:
Sellout-you want to sell your soul
Sellout-you want to take control
Sellout-you want to play that role
Sellout-I'll never sell my soul

Sellout-sell your soul (x2)
Lead
Sellout-sell your soul (x2)

Since back in the day, I've been up in this game
Doing much of the same way, real, I never did it for fame or glory

For all these years, with no respect from my peers
I kept it real and told my story
Sellout-This shit is real and I can never be fake
I'll do whatever it takes within reason
Sellout-Made so many mistakes, never caught any breaks
I live and die for whatever I believe in

Sellout-You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul
and be the one you disrespect and lie to
the one you really want to live your life through
the soul you sell is really your own
because I'm the only one you can never lie to

Biohazard,"Population control. The only alternative left was to increase the death rate,
No one wanted to pick people out of a crowd and line them up for execution,
Neither did they relish the possible consequences of an enraged public upon
Discovering that they were being systematically murdered. A very short but
Very deadly global war was contemplated. Something else had to be done that
Would absolve the decision-makers of guilt, something that could be blamed
Upon Mother Nature. The answer, a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
Does not naturally exist for which no natural immunity could have been acquired.
The United States population was infected. The vaccine was administered by the
World health organization. Whatever causes AIDS was in the vaccine
I'm the first in line with a sentence on death row
Take a look around and feel the wind blow
And to those motherfuckers who decide our fate
Annihilate, come together and kill their hate
Cut their heads off and put 'em on a stake
Stuff their bodies in a barrel and throw 'em in the lake
Let the leaches feast on their own
Motherfucker you're wrong, your on your own

[Chorus]
We all go to fight for our rights
Stand against those opposed
We all go to fight for our rights

Population control 
Population control

Over population is the most serious threat to the whole future of our species.

Rip their arms off from limb to limb
Make them regret they thought they would win
Cut their tongues out to stop spreading lies
Their poisonous venom has kept me blind
Open your eyes don't you realize
Come together, it's time we rise

Wide awake I open my eyes into a nightmare of a life that I despise I gotta,

Filled with dread - gun under the bed to clip all the motherfuckers trying
to keep me down, I ain't fuckin' around.
Wide awake my eyes are open I can't breathe my heart is choking and I can't speak
the words unspoken and I can't believe my life is broken again... (my life is broken)

Keep trying to tell myself ""everything will be OK, everything will go my way""
'till life steps in and slaps on the strangle, tears flow and fists start to mangle.
I wake up screaming everyday, nobody pays attention when I'm writhing in pain,
I got a glitch in my brain I gotta break free from anxiety, I gotta let go of life
'cause it's killing me

Wide awake my eyes are open I can't breathe my heart is choking and I can't speak

talking shit about who?

Three, two, one, go

Only God is judged, never plea the case
Oh, reason where is the truth we can never erase?
I've fallen from grace, black nor face
Ounce of green smoke, jack wit no chase

Peddle on the floor, thirsty for score
Fastlane destination, top of the cash game
See keep like a missile with mad aim
You can't blame missin' spirits who campaign

A mystery at most, universal most steel is hot
Yup off in the knot
Vision clear like a Hindu with the third eye dot
We be wig, nah baby that's my word I got

'Nuff rhymes, tuff times, try talkin' to kids
Who walk around thinkin' that doesn't forgive
Life in itself is like a bid
And if you scared to die then you scared to live

Ain't it a shame dealin' with the remain?
Hennessey on the brain, travel the plane

Will the copy cats twist the def traps?
Bliss the sex raps blind to jet black
The matters awake in response since came to life
Singin' a seance, escape the realm

Bly swift like 'o' at, fake jacks a cast
Catch two smacks, gentlemen relax
Blaze trails that haven't been traveled in a while
Scatter clues for those who equate the style

Cruisin' in the Lex out the window seat
While I be trippin' off the rhyme, bop my head to the beat
I can't speak on delirious mood swings
True crowns, a helmed at the true kings

Tell ya take it back, straighten
Money makin', light we sign awaken, idle mind oversaken
No debatin' on the vessel that we navigatin'
Gravitatin', schemin', leave 'em standin' waitin'

Specialize in futuristic mental picture paintin'
We are slave to sick ways, I'm quenchin' with thirst
Gift of a new day they seem like a curse

What we made, penetrate the charade
The incision is barely felt from the sharpness of the blade
Movin' motionless through this masquerade

Loomin' in the dark but justice save a spark, rock
Like a match made in heaven and hell apart
But still one, if it's life we start

So real reveal, sign is sealed
What we feels translates to meals
That nine to five shit is no joke, muscle in scientist
But don't look upon my hustlin'

Will the copy cats twist the def traps?
Bliss the sex raps, blind to jet black
The matters awake in response since came to life
Singin a seance, escape the realm

Bly swift like 'o' at, fake jacks a cast
Catch two smacks, gentlemen relax
Blaze trails that haven't been traveled in a while
Scatter clues for those who equate the style

The one with the three heads is King Geedorah
And that one's Gigan, we are controlling them

Bionic Jive,"My approach to danger
Political sabotage for death in front of abortion clinics
The American pastime is murder at high schools
And pipe bombs at the Olympics

Hate crimes in federal buildings, terrorism abroad
Killing children, now they all Atheists
Unlawful Aryans with Matthew Hale
Want wars of race to make space

The confrontation is global
Then it's apartheid became the suicide bicoastal
So much drama and stress inside the world for real
Got God looking through his bifocals

I'm ready to die give me the word
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to kill my enemies and put 'em in a body bag
While I'm looking at the President and burning the flag

What!

Go against the grain, break the chains
Get out escape from the killing fields
With the power to form storms
I'm gonna hit 'em with rage and keep on

Go against the grain, break the chains
Get out escape from the killing fields
With the power to form storms
I'm gonna hit 'em with rage and keep on

You in a dominion of Holy War
Tension keep the Jews and Palestinians hard core
This is Biblical conspiracy
Written in religion to keep the world in division

Listen in the streets they collide, turn rivers to blood
And peace treaties to napalm theories
Governmental to presidential they lie
America still high, the killers they multiply

This is final defcon of the Omega
Denominations gang bang for their savior
The wicked supersede the lost system
With diplomatic immunity to murder your community

I'm ready to die, give me the word
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to kill my enemies and put 'em in a body bag

Go against the grain, break the chains
Get out escape from the killing fields

Strike my enemies and break the teeth of the wicked
Stand and deliver me

Be hanging off the ledge, they fall, they fall, yes, y'all

Bionic Jive,"I sit I'm my room claustrophobic,
As I watch the walls breath succumbing to self pity,
And these voices wont leave.
I got a revolver in my hand with six chambers and they all full,
Every bullet contradicts the contemplation of suicide.
I wanna die.
So I sit and clinch my bible until my palms sweat,
And blister, cause I hate my sister.
First I'm gonna light a candle in the form of a seance,
And see the light on the wall reflect all this childhood neglect.
I cock the hammer,
I let the steel touch my tongue and taste the metal for the first time,
I see the faces of my loved ones, but fuck a note,
Cause when I do it,
I want it to be a mystery,
And let them feel the same pain that I felt, this is the remedy.

[Chorus]
Goodbye, sad days,
I'd rather sleep my life away goodbye, heartbreak,
I found my own way, suicide

I get on my knees and say a prayer,
I tell god that I cant handle all this pressure,
I wanna kick it up there.
Why should I wanna live?
When my mother used to molest me in front of my stepfather,
She beat me and he undressed me, see.
He took my manhood before I became a man,
So now I sit here at 16 with this gun in my hand.
Death is the only way out,
The murder of myself will show em all the there's a way out,
I cry for my soul.
Depression has taken a toll on my every existence,
So when I think of humiliation I can't breathe, its time to leave. 
Cause I'm gone show what you did,
For tormenting me as a kid, you raised me,
Now look what I did

I wanna breathe again,

Shut em down, shut em down, give me the mic,
Just give me the mic, and watch me cause catastrophe.
Shut em down, shut em down, give me the mic,
Just give me the mic, I'm raw with it, raw with it.

Lyrics run in africa, side by side with a panther, 
Mad dogging all national geographical cameras, 
Deep meditation in a scrap yard, with two rottweilers on guard, 
Foaming from the lower jaw is how I stay hard.
If you diagnose bionic it will give your brain a biopsy, 
We hit the stage and make em pit, open up the crowd like a autopsy, yo.
We shut em down, verbally cut of your skin, 
Give your bones osteoporosis, then we see it it again, what.
You don't wanna deal with the underwater, heat seeking, intercontinental, 
Ballistic missile with the sasquatch reasoning, 
Who told you you could fuck with bionic? 
That's misleading, self defeating, and wrong formula in the teaching, we.

[Chorus]

Set if off, let it off, its a lyrical bomb 
So get down, and get down, and get down, and get down. 
Set it off, let it off, are you ready for war?
Lets get down, lets get down, lets get down. 

Shut em down lock em down lock 'em down shut em down 
Shut em down, lethal and hard-core material, what, hit em up, 
Bionic rippin it through your stereo 
Nobody leavin alive we shut em down
No way out now we

Bionic Jive,"Cut him
Somebody take flight from this stage to the crowd below
And expose a bloody nose from the the flows of your elbows
No crowd control

This is no holds barred, we gonna brawl
Until you knocked out, sprawled
In your socks and draws with the paramedics involved

Engage the mosh pit and lose control until the stage fold
Because bionic ain't leaving until you suffocatin' in the front row
I wanna see shoulder blades ricochet off the ribcage
This is new age, stress age for boogie down renegades in rage

You wanna body bang, this is insane
War games with nothing to gain but pain

If you ready for war then hit the the floor, everybody come on
You're in the swarm, you're in the swarm
You wanna bang, let's go, bring the pain, let's go
You hit 'em high, high, I hit 'em low, low

If you ready for war then hit the the floor, everybody come on
You're in the swarm, you're in the swarm
You wanna bang, let's go, bring the pain, let's go
You hit 'em high, high, I hit 'em low, low

This section is reserved for those hard to kill
So shove him in his chest hard enough to turn his lungs to gills
Dislocate your shoulder is the quota
These blows send your head to nova scotia
When animalistic impulse take over

Mosh monster, behold the head trauma, get down
No do si doe, this is the true essence of the underground
From sunshine or rain, we toss on asphalt terrain
Till we levitate over the crowd with your eye balls gouged

You wanna body bang, this is insane

If you ready for war then hit the the floor, everybody come on

You hit 'em high, high, I hit 'em low, low

I'm goin' insane
I feel the temperature rise but can I maintain?
All the pushin' and shovin', it's like we gang bang
It's a thin line between livin' and dyin'

I'm goin' insane

And see who be the last man to stand with it

Bionic Jive,"One day on the block
I was speaking to a close partner
A black Caddie rolled up
(I shot ya)
I felt my soul reach back through times
With my youth was cold and gritty
On the south side of the city
Read the sign it says 'Town of no pity'

First grade was vague
Eighth grade bounce to the east side
(From Negros to essays)
Scuffle from Sunday through Saturdays
In alley ways, shady ways
When my Mom wasn't lookin'

A midnight marauder, life was part of
Me dippin' out the window of your daughter
Days come and gone, define who we are
There I am at age 19 a ghetto super star

(Bang, bang)
Angel of death came to claim
(Bang, bang)
Holding a bullet with my name
(Bang, bang)
Life is over, too late to change
I'm walking with shadows
To the Valley of Death, come on

Yeah I'm a dead man walking out
Yeah too late to change

So many escapades led me astray
Look there goes the time I first held an A K
Aimed at your way, itchy finger
Lookin' to turn y'all to dead weight
No role model, living life at full throttle
Mind gone doing wrong, passin' out with a 40 bottle

(And I tell ya)
I kept trippin' as my soul kept drifting through death
I'm remenising my life of non fiction
Globe still spinning witnessing what I'm missin'
And that made me yearn addiction to money, weed and bitches
Game brought me the riches, sabotage from snitches
This is just a chronicle of days come and gone, now

Quando eu te encontrar
Molhados de prazer
Vão querer beijar

De se apresentar
Por ser lugar comum
Deixamos de extravasar, de demonstrar

Quando a saudade acorda
A beleza que faz sofrer
Nunca me disseram como devo proceder

De outras roupas, outros temperos
Para formar minhas ideias e meus sentimentos

É porque trago tudo de fora

Trago a imagem de todas as ruas por onde passo
E de alguém que nem sei quem é

Crio um romance.

Me arrependo do que digo em frases incertas
Se eu tento ser direto, o medo me ataca
sem poder nada fazer.

Sei que tento me vencer e acabar com a mudez
Quando eu chego perto, tudo esqueço e não tenho vez
Me consolo, foi errado o momento, talvez,
Mas na verdade, nada esconde essa minha timidez

Eu carrego comigo a grande agonia
De pensar em você, toda hora do dia
Eu carrego comigo, a grande agonia
Na verdade nada esconde essa minha timidez

Talvez escreva um poema
No qual grite o seu nome
Nem sei se vale a pena
Talvez só telefone
Eu me ensaio, mas nada sai:
O seu rosto me distrai.

E, como um raio, eu encubro , eu disfarço , eu camuflo, eu desfaço,

Feed this lie, standing brilliant with this body, 
I prostitute this face to every household,
You may purchase this product for the mere fact 
That I've tortured starved and beaten this body to market this item, 
How much did you pay for this body? 

As I slice away another layer, I know it's not your fault, 
We are indeed your new role models, in the cruelest form, 
The most beautiful creatures, how you have passed logic so many punctures ago,

For trading your dollar to bleed a thinner you, what are you worth?

Is that fashion?",Mannequin,2000

Two bare arms spiraling to the floor,
Beautiful blue veins thirst for, 
Beautiful blue veins something more, 
Cry for your attention, go ahead give them love, 
How they need your sensuous touch, 
You take such good care of me

I'm not addicted, I'm just happier this way, 
I'm healthier than ever, I'm superman, 
I can take you out with just one blow, 
Just help me get up first

Back stretched across cold wet floors, 
Quench this thirst for something more,

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Stabbing at shadows
Blank eyed, just staring out windows
He's gone, left me again

Have got me lost and wondering
Where he's been

And who he's kissing
Come home
Come home, stop wandering
Come home,

Back to the home of me
Just like a nicotine addict
I'm craving drama for my fix
My past has seized the day

Filling the silence with static,
Sifting through his shiny garbage
I can't win the war
When I'm fighting myself

With the shells of my own thinking
Come home
Come home, stop wandering
Come home, back to the home of me

Waiting for the dark to burn away
Counting on your heartbeat's constant rhythm
To carry me back to myself
All of my thoughts, like junkyard dogs, guarding scraps of nothing
Filling my head with senseless things that keep me from you
But I found the remedy
I found the cure for everything
Take me into your hands
Help me love a world that I don't understand
Lying in the grass I listened
Underneath a black sky soaked in stars
Til I heard the sound of my heart spinning
All my panic into love
Out of the fire of false desire
Beat up but I'm breathing
Trying to stay wide awake
While all the world's asleep
Chorus
And you're taught to want
All of life's shiny trinkets
And you're hoping that they will save you

Bird York,"In the afternoon
She sits and waits for him to come
Two swollen ankles count the time
Nervous fingers trace

Across the cold linoleum
The kitchen wall receives her sigh
""Oh, can you hear me, Joe?""
She tries to call across the veil

Her lips are trembling now
Can't hear his voice , can't feel him near
She says ""Save me, save me
Why don't you save me from the pain of losing you

Save me, save me
Why don't you save me from this hell I'm going through""
The dinner table looks so strange without him sitting there
The bed is empty on his side

For forty years this house has held the fire of love they shared
But now the garden slowly dies
He said he'd never leave her alone to face the day
What kind of God is this that'll take him back

And make her stay
""Save me, save me
Why don't you save me from the pain of losing you
Save me, save me

Why don't you save me from this hell I'm going through?

Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch

I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it

Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him

Bought mami the matching shit and plucked her feathers

You drive by the hood and bird shit on a bitch
Drive anything you want cause you the Birdman's bitch
Get anything you need and you roll with the clique
Go to the club and get a front row seat
Pop mo Don P just shit on a bitch
See your fly now mami used to be a dirty bitch
Got all these hoes trying to ride your dick
You maintain mami you never just wild out
That's why Stunna put you in that big ass house

It's the kid still holdin' the crown
Now that they give it I'm holdin' a pound
And I'm lookin' for some bustas who be actin' like them niggas do dirt
Come to find out they ain't put in no work
An now my feelings is hurt
Cause they decided that they wanted to murk
But I'ma chase 'em to the end of the Earth
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' rider
You can see the pain in my face
Got no problem exchangin' the hate
They got me fightin' a case
And if I blow will I face a fifteen
And I'll probably do it all in the pen
But yo I'm livin' with it
Death before dishonor for my niggas that ride
A thousand deaths if ya sellin' ya pride ha ha ha
Death before dishonor for my niggas that ride
A thousand deaths if ya sellin' ya pride
You motherfuckers need to know that

Hey Joe
We gon' ball like dogs but keep it gangsta nigga
I'm a guerilla on the streets but it's time for the fun time
Out of line, I bust with my tech nine
Choose ya loose, I give ya the blues
Ol' pussy ass nigga with his pussy ass crews
It's the murder man mack, I stash in the Lac
I bought my bricks from these dro back stacks
It's the Birdman baby come and holla at me later
Duck ass niggas, we deal with 'em later
First you, go to the mall and you ball like a dog
And we drop the car, then holla at ya boy
Tell them pussy ass niggas, break bread with the boy

Tell Big Pun nigga, Stunna ride for the boy

Niggas tell me money talk
But bullshit is walkin' out on four feet
That's why I'm ridin' on ya whole street
I'll be a nigga till it's said and done
I'm from a section where ya fight till ya die cause ya never run
I keep my forty cal cocked cause these niggas on my block bang
Right up the street from where the cops hang
And in my head I hear Pac sang
And then them rushin' memories make me cry till I can't stop man
Tell my mama I'm a killer if I happen to die
That's how I lived, ain't no sense in me lyin'
My whole life's filled with danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My neighborhood's full of gangstas and drive-bys
And niggas fightin' for position
The demon has risen from out of prison
Now I'm losin' my religion
That's how I'm feeling when I'm fuckin' with you
Cause I don't fuck with you, now I'm bustin' at you
So fuck you dude

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do
I'm serious and focused to you, know I am over do
The first nigga to park a Rolls Royce in the bricks
While I fly private jet out of town by a bitch

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
Tryin to be here to see my seeds, when they have they seeds
Long as I breathe ain't nothin in this world that they can't be
Yeah I done fucked up, slipped and sniffed that coke
Started tweakin and broke in them people house next do'
Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip, 
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?
Huh, y'all don't understand you shoulda seen my plate
Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it
Be serious about your money and right now I'm tryin to get it

Nigga ridin threw the hood and we blowing on candy
Stay G'd up from my head to my feet
I was raised in the 3rd that's the heart of the streets
Saw death and crime for the first same time
Them rims don't shine just a vision of mine
Put this shit back together cause I stay on the grind
Nigga know I gets me I stunt all the time
For the dead and the gone, the young and the grown
O.G. mother fuckers who be getting it on
Niggaz stunting and they shining bling blingin all the timin
I hold my hood down for the shit that I'm driving
Nigga thug to death, remember the projects

Knowing niggaz after me, gonna rehearse my grind

And how to put some money in your pocket
You see something you like go 'head and cop it
But watch it, niggaz gone knock it
Trying to get you for your paper when them bitches is jockin'

Look, I'm wild Magnolia, she better get in her place

I got a trail of niggaz telling cops what I did to them
I ain't lookin for no poppers, ain't looking for no partners
I'm looking for mo' choppers to get rid of mo' problems
All I got is my ball and my words

Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought ain't it? 
How the fuck would I know?
Nigga I been gettin' my Cher 
Like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets, check my bio
I started high wit' two O's just like Ohio
I'm fuckin' nuts, cashews
But I'm so D-C like fat shoes
I skate away, like later dudes!
Never get caught baby I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped, I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog, no Asian food
I wet up the party so have a bathin' suit
And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga

[Chorus]
Keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'
And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga, keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'
And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga, 'Cause you ain't really even 'bout all that
You ain't really even 'bout all that
And don't'cha forget
I know ya you ain't 'bout all that
You ain't never been about all that, fall back

Niggas must want Joey to lean on 'em
Flash the blinky splash his dreams on 'em
Let 'em sleep on it, it's nothin' to Crack
Lay the murder game down back to hustlin' packs
Yeah Weezy homie's got yo' back, whether raps or macks
Either way they both spit like brrat!
Nigga, them mu'fuckas is broke like them levies
And we done sold so much dope ain't shit you tell me
Nigga, how you want it ? coke or dog food?
My shit'll have you runnin' naked like in old school
And yeah we 'bout it 'bout it and you ain't ridin' on me
Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal army
And I'm a rider homie 
And you can find it on me
That forty cal'll get you shirt picture ironed on it
This shit is funny to me
All these niggas frontin' war but they runnin' from me, 
Crack!

[Chorus]

Nigga,
I had 'em as lil' niggas raised 'em 'round real niggas
Poppin' bottles fuckin' wit' them bitches nigga
Made money to the ceilin' me and my young nigga
Chillin' I'm in the streets hustlin' gettin' money nigga
Changed all my new shoes nigga got some new tools
Nigga got some mo' jewels we was gettin' money
And ain't nothin' ever changed still doin' the thing
Still gettin' money still spendin' change
We hustlin' from Sunday to Sunday
And we grindin' everyday like the money ain't comin'
Nigga, yeah we ridin' woodgrains and minks
Got the dope in the Hummer cold case for that thing
I hate the law for what they done did they broke in niggas cribs

If there's a throne, you're looking at a chairman
How you want it? Show me my opponent, show me my opponent
I'm still balling, a bullet gotta get me

Nigga, I ain't got a money printer
So for this paper chase I'm out runnin' sprinters
Yes, the last two Cash Money members
Shout out to the new Cash Money members
Baby and Slim still point guard and center
So much money on my mind it's all I remember
And I just bought a gun wit' a extender
And that bitch hold me up like suspenders
Cut like a blender, sharper than a bitch
They got so many pussy niggaz I can make a list
Niggaz wonder why I stress that I am the best
'Cause even bobble heads tell me, ""yes,"" ha ha
Put it on the hood; I'm Holly grove to death
I'm already good; I'm workin' on my left
A jungle on my wrist, a circus on my neck
Don't forget the Baby, and don't forget the F

Comin' through my neighborhood wit' fours on the Caddy
Limo tints out the pound and Uptown crackin'
Red bandanna duckin' feds, and the money stackin'
Rest in peace to Miss Gladys like everyday
We on the grind for the shine, and we gon' get paid
Spent a mill' on the wheels, custom wit' the navi'
Two of the same whips; we doin' it big, livin' lavish

This is a Scott Storch, and I'm a hot torch
And gettin' money is my sport
And understand the rap game is my court
So I shall walk and come forth like a Rockport
Or some sort of matchin' slippers or yacht shoes
See, I don't cruise control, I control the cruise
Yes, I gets throat on a boat
And I vow to never fall like soap on a rope, and

I got a lot of loot, and I ain't lookin' for a lady

Fresh wit' the hustle, so we bounce back on them suckers
Blowin' big, doin' gigs, got it ran in hundreds
They reppin', layin' here; we stuntin'
On the grind all the time, homey, gettin' money
Third Ward soldier, thirteenth gangsta
Seventeenth hustler, known top ranker
Money go getter; them clowns can't figure
Poppin' at the mouth like this cutter won't split 'em
Know how to survive hustlin', stayin' fly
My whole hood cried when my lil' brother died
Know I had to ride, never let it slide
It's just the G in me, and I'm a get it till I die, daddy

But we still strong because of the loyalty that we have, the trust
That's how we stood all these years

Rest in peace to my momma, rest in peace to my daddy
Rest in peace to my homie, rest in peace to my family
Rest in peace to my D boy, my OG boy, told me be a B boy
Rest in peace to my cause, money is the love
Disrespect me bitches its murder up in bloods
Rest in peace to my homies in the pen,
Ain't comin' home and that they cant win

My homie momma died he was 5, 
Brought him to the street life taught 'em to survive
Block was his daddy, tatts in the caddy now
Blowin' on that gonja lil' homie had to have it huh
Full of that aroma, gun alone taught 'em the corner
Nigga life in the streets homie up in the mornin' 
See we G's fuckin' with these flees
Work in they house and you know we got to eat
Youngster wanna be, a gangster like me
I let 'em all see so they know how it be
Streets is a motherfucker game of life
Playin' the hard part of it is livin' it twice
Fresh with the money now, cruisin' in the Lambo
Time to change hoe, but money still the same though
Bitches with the murder, murder with the bitches
Homies in my hood nigga trippin' bout they riches

[Chorus]

See my homie caught life, couldn't do it twice
He held court on the street that night
Nobody trippin' but the hood be flippin'
On the laws, fuck 'em out they jaws
Fuck 'em in they cars
You know my hood, we don't spare nothin' blood
You know my streets nigga fucked up in the mud
You know the cost when you playin' with the boss
Your life is lost when your playin' with boss, 
We in the club, showin' some hoes love
Nigga want trip but I keep his hoe hugged
He killed my homie nigga but he didn't kill his family though
I'ma real nigga so I'm ridin' for his family hoe
Got to get the cheese flippin' these B's
Fuckin' with these hoes, burn a few G's
Playin' the game right while up in these buildings
Tryin' to be the next billion

[Chorus]

So I roll with my heater, ridin' with my heater
Never leave my bitch, call her millimeter
Cruise with my hoe, on the road with my hoe
Nigga hustle with my hoe, nigga fuck with my hoe
Never leave my bitch she hard core rich
Purely white top nigga, ain't hit quick
16 nigga better yet banana clip
Gotta brother names chopper nigga break down bricks
45 snub met his whole blood, 
2, 2, 6 nigga that uptown plug
Flippin' through the curb, gave the homie word
Penitentiary chance when fuckin' with them birds
Back to my block though, millions wont stop hoe
From the bottom to the top with this cash flow
I'm in my caddy bitch, livin' lavish bitch
Livin' with the homie nigga quick to grab my shit

You know I'm dubbed out, on every ride that I drive
Let me take a moment, to introduce myself
Cause baby girl I see you want it, and I could tell you on it
It's the millennium, I'm trying to light up the stage
And I be taking it to the max, because I want to stay paid
You know the album is hot, I'm in the spots you not
And if I pull a gun to shoot, then best believe you shot
Cause I'm a soldier a vet, with no time to sweat
From the store to the deck, and checking on internet
I be going off, girl you ain't heard about Lil' Keke
From the Dirty South, he got a bad mouth
It ain't no thang mayn, a bunch of haters in the world
Say it's a damn shame, but I just maintain no game
Get your cash and mash, on your plan
Cause the G in my life, stands for gangsta my man

You know the Eastside, they putting it down for the cheddar
And the Westside, you know they down for whatever
This another chapter, of the life after
Selling dope on the block, but now a paid rapper
I'm not a high capper, but I do get plex
Am I living like a baller, then the answer is yes
Listen up n****, I ain't tripping when I tell you I'm about my scrilla
And I ain't tripping, when I tell you I'm a mad killa, but I'm a O.G
And when I'm gunning n****z running, cause they know me
You better show me, cause all that chatter don't just matter
N**** homie, cause you gon owe me
Cause this the damn song, you playing games with my family
You get stepped on, so n**** get gone

House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid

Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

And, then I leek a tub in the boot, I leave a blood bath,
Sorry there's a tub in the boot, now where the drugs at?
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe
No nigga fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot, 
Now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I, I must ask

Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem,
I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I've graduated from hungry,
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm a need cheese if I'm bakin' a ziti
You niggas want beef?
I want a steak in the weed B
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be
Hard body nigga, takin' it easy
All about my paper, bout my paper like Eazy
Why do rappers, lot of rappers, lot of fans, lot of rappers, lot of rappers
Lie like actin', cut the motherfuckin' cameras
Cut the check, nigga fuck your pops
And make it out to Mr. Hip Hop

Copped baby girl what she desired 
It's chump change ma, Marijuana skyler

Times in a room

One fo' creeps one fo' freaks
Too much legal tender
So its raining bubbly

So it have to make sense

When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying ""50 you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go

If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned

Its for my L-A girls getting them implants,
And all my D-C girls getting them ass shots,
Got em for a reason shortie, go ahead buss it open,
I keep a secret baby, nothings heard when nothings spoken,
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion,
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean,
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star,
Are all that fuels the conversations between y'all,
And dog that's funny, pay me what you owe me nigga,

Blew a couple of hundreds

Bugatti for 2, on the hill
Shining with my strap in my right pocket
Hundred thousand a day on that sky rocket
From round the block doing this shit round the clock
Million dollar nigga doing this sh-t non-stop

Popping bottles, celebrating living life
Blowing big, freelander down ?

Birdman,"Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans,
But neither was making it and here I am
In the presidential do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aliyah's precious life go too soon,
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing

The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?
Well fuck let's get it then

I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time

Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine

Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga man
You keep talking that ""You was this and you had this
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it.""
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now.
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said ""you're such a dog"" I said ""you're such a bone.""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying ""Show me something.""
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then fuck let's get it then

I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time
(Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine
(We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time
(Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine

Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it or better yet forgot it

Hit a punk in the back with a pump in the back, till he's off balance

And I'm in the back in the back of the block with a cop wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block G watch for the block or whatever

Ya know!
The time is money and money still was made baby
Eight months ain’t stop nothing nigga
It’s like jail was third base and my lil’ nigga still came home, ya understand

I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That’s why when the babies grow up damn they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I’m so happy my lil’ brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and Fail Boy
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can’t withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force

To thanking God I’m in a whole ‘nother tax bracket, amen",B-Boyz [*],2012

I'm gettin' money, I'm ballin' hard
Heard them niggas hatin on me, cause they fallin' off
Honestly bitch, I'm ballin' hard
Yeah It's my time, and I'mma shine just like my Audemars, my audemars
Bust down, and iced out
Just hit the switch, that bitch be shining when the lights out
Bust down, and iced out
Look at my wrist, that bitch be shining like a lighthouse

I spit a verse, that's like a point
I do it short, that's like a joint
That's like a bird, oh nigga you ain't heard
I'm in the mixin like a saute when it's gettin stirred
Pull up in the Maserati, got them bitches lookin' at me like I shot somebody
I'm stackin' paper, I need that dropped Ferrari
Got them trying to claim a nigga and we not on Maury
My AP, cool as an A/C
Look in the magazine, the same exact as Jay-Z (Same one)
I'm gettin' money, nigga you straight flea
That bitch be shining thunder up I call it KD
I'm ballin' in this bitch like it's my motherfucking born day
Bout to get a swiss account, so fuck bout what the forms say
I just did 100 shows, ain't never get a tour date
MMG we winning bitch, go check what the score say

Hundred stacks, Frank watch
Mill at the crib with them tools out
Money nigga, head huntin'
Big timer, rap hunter
Uptown soldier on the battlefield,
Big timer blood gettin killa kill

Flippin' birds shippin' how we did this shit
Swag dawg, the money hangin'
A hundred stacks, been bangin'
High roller, shock collar
Ferrari speed, niggas been ballin'
Cherry on them flakes when we on the mound,
Fire on that candy blowin' out the pound
Bad bitch stand 6 feet, standin' on this money bought a new fleet

[Chorus]

Look at my wrist, that shit 200 hundred thou'
Cut the lights down, look at me now
Back then they didn't want me, now I'm hot and they all on me
Pull a bunch of these white bitches, I'm chillin hard at the Pink Pony
Gucci Mane and Meek Mills, I'm ballin hard, I'm too trill
New ride with new money, so I had to put it on new rims
Hawks game, I'm court side
Red bottles on the wet floor, give them up to the athletes
Smellin' like a pound of dro, Versace shades I'm yoked out
Rolls Royce it smoked out, parked in front your whole house
I blew the horn, she jumped out
Maybach on cascade, the one on down my west side
4 girls, only fucked 3
Cause one left, and she missed out

I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes

I got a house on my neck, my Panamera my pet
We bought ringside seats, and got a brick I can pet
Money, power respect, I took your bitch with finesse
Chickens jumping like checkers, but this game is chess
What's at stake is your freedom, niggas paying the price
When the judge drop the mallet, all he said was life
Nigga damn near fainted, barely stare at your wife
Brother took all your clothes, whip, sneakers, and ice
Got me holding my nuts, while I'm rolling the dice
760 new Beamer, got me rolling in white

I heard them suckas was hatin', I'm fucking all of they hoes
So I don't blame 'em, no I don't knock 'em
But if they play my dogs, we slay 'em, I'm talkin' pop 'em
Want some attention, hall-of-fame 'em, they talkin' bout us
Acting like bitches 'til we spray 'em, get the coffin out ya
We all about it, ahhhhh

I hustle like I'm on my last check !!

All I see is this money, never hate with your niggas
Better pray to your maker, before you war with the sinner
Ask forgiveness for mine, so I know that I'm good
All them niggas we robbed, trips T man took
Talkin' panhandle pimpin, niggas Chevy was lemon
Nigga dressing in linen, bases loaded first inning
Taking over the checks, relocating the tenants
Pulling open your vest, motivation is spinach
I gotta handle my business, I pay my mortgages first
When you cross a super-soaker I bet your water get burst
Ain't no love on this side, just jealous niggas who ride

Dark beef fountain and my cocaine mountain
Bought a the mountain bike just to ride through that shit
Gotta put my goggles on just to drive through that shit
When they come and serve me dinner, man, you know them bitches naked
Red tatted on their ass, you can see it when they exit
Marble floors, marble counters, chandeliers on the ceiling
? on the penthouse, I bought the whole building
Tell them to re-up, so I met them on the boat
The Coast Guard tripping man I hope them bitches float
Know some real life niggas smoke diamonds indigo
When they praying for forgiveness they go and see the pope
Cross my heart hope to die Lord knows I seen the dough

Birdman,"I've been logging in my bed, crying til my eyes are red
We both said that things will change
But it's still the same shade of gray
I get mad you walk away
When it all just start to fade
I know you're fed up so am I
But we just can't say goodbye
Boy, you know I love you
But I just can't go on no more
Feelin' this way

You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right?
Just can't get it right
Don't know why, why, why?
Can't we get it right
No matter how hard we try

I got her looking at me sideways
Live every night like it's a Friday
My conversations are so monumental
Licking on her ear, I'm whispering a couple riddles
She fell in love with my technique
I made her call me boss when in the bedsheets
We both coming from the same place
All in her both coming at the same place
Still on my dope boy swag
Top down on my Cam'ron, Oh boy swag
Played the hand we were dealt from the beginning, baby
You the dealer, cut the deck, while we winning baby

You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right?
Just can't get it right
Don't know why, why, why?
Can't we get it right
No matter how hard we try

Can't we turn love around
We build it up to break it down
If you knew the way I feel
You would know that this love is real
But live in heaven, go to hell then
Go right back, across the lesson
Tired of stressin', get the message
I can't live in this depression no more
Boy, you know I love you
But I just can't go on feeling like this no more

You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right?
Just can't get it right
Don't know why, why, why?

Niggas all talk, it'll never change

Drowning in that pussy, and I’m a soul survivor
Vodka, hunned flavors, GT watermelon
She always do me favors, and I don’t never tell her
GT yellow mango, I love to drink juice
Owe her 100 favors, I call her my 100 proof

The music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
And me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick
Confusing, you like my style even though I was broke and doing
Stick em ups, you wanna pick em up
Inside your Civic Plus the difference was
I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us
And I missed the crush that we had every time winter December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, end up shootin' himself
And the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
And I'm losing now too looking at you boo hoo from what's dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Baileys
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your page got that pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day you'll reap what you sow, now I reap for us both

Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him

Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say?
I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes
I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that?
Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold

We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari
With all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me
New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce
And a new Ferrari, that's a new Bugatti (I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!))

H-U-S-T-L-E gang
For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

This the school of hard knocks, graduation

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it

Birdman,"I couldn't have done it better
I couldn't have done this shit any other way
I made it now when they tried to convince me to make it another day
Glad I can see another day
I do this shit for my squad, my home team
My family, fuck what another say

I'm here now, it's all clear now
Somebody pour up
I'm eating good y'all can't see my competition til I throw up
I'm tore up but I keep shit 100
That's from the toes up
Last night it felt like I ran through four clubs
Stood on the couch and everyone of em' screaming out
""Hoes down and bros up""
It's different when we show up, kicking doors up
I'm a young Stunna, young Wayne, I'm Young Money
I'm growned up like I'm new here but I'm nuclear
That's a bomb threat mothafucker, watch how blow up

I'm good, I'm reminded I'm good
From time to time I'm fine
I be spending time with the Greatest Of All Time all the time
And ever since I'm living life every night like it's '99
I'm way ahead of my time I think I was only 8 at that time
I rep them five letters forever
Will someone just tell the bartender to mix my drink
While I mix my thoughts of business in pleasure, I'm clever
Long money all around me
I just hope I live long enough, long enough to measure
We should take pictures sippin' Cristal in COOGI sweaters
And I'm still getting better nigga, what's better?
They said I never do it now I'm looking around like, nigga what's never?
And now they run from us when they see us, boy that money's pressure
Plots on the wall of every building that I walk into
Phone taps 'cause they curious, careful what you talk into
Living the star life you'll never know you'll run into
Like baby I can change your life
Just leave everything that you been through and rise

Long as my niggas right then we alright
Long as the women right then we alright
Long as the drinks on ice then we alright
Long as these private flights then we alright
Long as we living right then we alright
Long as it's high life then we alright
'Cause I love it more than anything (anything)
Boy it's money over everything, we've been alright

Yea, it's money over everything
We motivated, flying over everything
We make something out of nuttin, what up 5?
Bag full of every president that ever died
Yea, spraying everything that's in the way
We eating over here extended clips, 50 plates
It's a lifestyle, stunna life, everyday
A million ones we can throw this shit a million ways
Youngin, if you alright then we alright
Night life GTV popping every night
Fly rich in a different city bright lights
With my niggas, rich gang and living high life
Yea, guns in the basement, millions in the wall, GTV cases
If it's fuck em' then it's fuck em' all
Audemars and cigars and them new toys

Long as my niggas right then we alright
Long as the women right then we alright

Do this shit for riz-zeal
Young Money, Rich Gang, ya heard me, with big ears
You just a crocodile, I drink a full cup of his tears
Can’t recognize you nigga, like Santa cut off his beard
And Tunechi, he gon’ be alright as long as he got his pills
I’m higher than my bitch bill, stop cryin bout' em', bitch chill
And I'm working on that Carter 5, I got this bitch in fifth gear
I can't stand these niggas, I'ma lie down or sit still
Get tied down with that fucking steel, at your eyebrow or your fucking grill
Catch you while you layed up, straight up, bunny ears
I shoot your fucking fade up, badges don't touch me
If that pussy smell like cat fish salmon trout or guppies
I ain't trippin on no ho, treat that ho like a servant
I know that ho better know, how to deep throat like a serpent
But lose lips shink ships, but I just let these hoes Worship
She think I'm a window of opportunity, close curtains, Tunechi

Birdy,"Could you keep your head up?
When you're losing ground
Could you keep your head up?
Everything you once loved
Like your own blood
Comes crumbling down
Could you keep your head up?

Sometimes the tears we cry
Are more than any heart can take
We hurt, just keep it inside
Small wonder that it starts to break

Many moons will lighten the way
And sure this night will follow a day
And everything you once loved remains
Unbroken, unbroken

Could you find a daydream?
In the dead of night
Could you find a daydream
Keep a quiet victory
To a whisper
In an uphill fight
Could you keep your head up

Sometimes the tears we cry
Are more than any heart can take
We hurt, just keep it inside
Small wonder that it starts to break

Many moons will lighten the way
And sure this night will follow a day
And everything you once loved remains
Unbroken, unbroken

Everything you once loved lies unbroken
Many moons will light us
Many moons will guide us
Everything you once loved lies unbroken
Leave the past behind us

Many moons will lighten the way

And everything you once loved remains

But it's hard to sleep when your head's not in it
I've been restless
'Cause you disappeared and that's all that's missing
The Earth is loose under my shoes
There's an angel
And he's shaped like you, and I thought I knew him
There's a window
And it's dark inside, but the light was in it
This can't be love if it hurts so much
I need to let go, oh

I will survive and be the one who's stronger
I will not beg you to stay
I will move on and you should know I mean it
Wild horses run in me

I remember
How we danced so close, I would stand on your feet
And the phone calls
That would last all night, they were lifeboats to me
Our fading scars just shooting stars
They're here, then go

I will survive and be the one who's stronger
I will not beg you to stay
I will move on and you should know I mean it
Wild horses run in me

Our human hearts forget how strong they are
And they get lost along the way, hey
It's not giving up, it's letting go
And moving to a better place

I will survive and be the one who's stronger
I will not beg you to stay
I will move on and you should know I mean it

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus

You've just got to see me through another day

A bad influence on youth
But we're the message of the truth
Teen-see power unites us all
And all the kids have got a rebel soul

Our spirits will never sell out
But your mind is a shadow of doubt
Won't be diluted to satisfy you
No matter what you think is true

Give a little rebel soul
I'm not your play toy
Give a little rebel soul
The rebel soul boy
",Rebel Soul,1997
Bis,"You said they were your lifelong passion
You bought them in the height of fashion
Went to Argos just like your friends
Looked to see the most you could spend

One girl was different on your street
She bought a skateboard from concrete
Everyone laughed, skateboards are out
She didn't belong to the Rollerblade crowd
Yeah

No Rollerblade zero

Four little wheels all in a row
Strap 'em up and you're ready to go
She didn't listen, she just ignored
Her only friend was her hook-ups board

She can use it even when her feet grow
She loves skating, it's not just for show
Until there becomes a new street trend
Her Rollerblade hell will never end

No Rollerblade zero

The wise men say, ""Hey
That fashion comes and fashion fades""
Why don't they say, ""Hey, there's no room
For your Rollerblades""

No Rollerblade zero

The wise men say, ""Hey
That fashion comes and fashion fades""
Why don't they say, ""Hey, there's no room
For your Rollerblades""

Okay, okay, yes, fashion comes and fashion fades
But please refrain from wearing your Rollerblades
Okay, okay, yes, fashion comes and fashion fades
Please remove all traces of your Rollerblades

No, Rollerblade zero
",Rollerblade Zero,1997
Bis,"Skinny Tie says we forgot the eighties too quickly
Like when the aesthetic mattered
More than the content and the streaks in your hair
Were louder than your guitars

Or more lately your synthesizers
Skinny Tie says that he wants to
Look like Simon Le Bon you know
Eighty one, eighty two kinda time, maybe later

It's the sound, it's around
It's Skinny Tie Sensurround

Skinny Tie says that his mum is worried about
The eye liner in his pocket, says, it's not natural
And that his dad would be turning in his grave if he knew
He comes across some sort of half-baked

Half hearted point about sexuality
Knowing full well that he'd never deviate
No matter how much he convinces
Himself otherwise

Skinny Tie reckons it impresses the girls
How he's free thinking and stuff, not like these lads
That are so common you know, only he doesn't realize
How much we see through him

Skinny Tie is just someone you know
And not someone you'd call a friend
You wouldn't notice if you hadn't seen him for weeks
But you know you'll see him again

It's the sound, it's around
It's Skinny Tie Sensurround

Skinny Tie always asks where the cool party is
But never goes because he chickens out
Of wearing that gold silky suit
That he saw Spandu ballet wear on

Top of the pops and sounds of the eighties
Skinny Tie doesn't realize that no matter
How defensive he gets about it
The eighties probably sucked if you weren't a kid

It's the sound, it's around
It's Skinny Tie Sensurround

Bis,"Yeah, we wanna star in an eighties movie
American brat pack members, truly
Yeah, we want big hair, permed and curly
So we can wear shades, looking mean and surly
Yeah we wanna car with a removable roof
So we can air our big hair, bypass the truth
That these things never happen in reality
But we'll be pretty in pink, just wait and see

I'll be the starbright boy
And yr the starbright girl
I'll be the starbright boy
And invade your world

Yeah, we wanna star in a skateboard movie
And be bad at the stunts like all amateurs should be
But we'd have so much fun playing lets pretend
That we'd get good at the stunts, showing off by the end
Yeah, we'll steal sport cars from our dads
And we'll fail our exams cuz it's cool to be sad
Yeah, everyday could be a holiday
No school, no rule, just me to say

I'll be the starbright boy
And yr the starbright girl
I'll be the starbright boy
And invade yr world

We'll be hanging around with Ferris Bueller
Meet Drew Barrymore cuz she's way cooler
Buy all our clothes on Rodeo drive
Never flatlining, we'll be alive
Upside down like we're the lost boys
Endorse the starbright fake plastic toys
Until the white flag must be unfurled
Just like Superman, we'll invade your world",Starbright Boy,1997
Bis,"Got no gaps in your teeth? You must be happy
Cola bottles, sugar coated
We've had sugar to eat, don't try and stop me
Flying saucers filled with sherbet

We want the right to eat sweets without yr frowning
Don't tell us what we can't do now
And we see the powers that be in sugar, drowning
Ten pee mixture for the way home

This is an advertisement
Hey, make way for the sweet shop avengerz
So make the sweet adjustment
A-okay, we're the sweet shop avengerz

Never too old to eat sweets, unless you feel it
Chocolate mice with strawberry center
Reclaim the rights to rot teeth, you know you need it
Candy shrimps, they're foamy inside

It's not a crime to be seen sucking a lolly
Vampire sweets that stick to your teeth
And it's hardly obscene to fill yr trolley
Ten pee mixture for the way home

This is an advertisement
Hey, make way for the sweet shop avengerz
So make the sweet adjustment
A-okay, we're the sweet shop avengerz

Kneejerk, it's a sugar fascination
Kneejerk, that infects the teen-see nation
Kneejerk, but we love the sweet sensation
Kneejerk, as it rots the population

Bis,"Let's go, Bis go

We use the freedom from the sonic pollution
To operate the sounds, hail our revolution
Just 'cause we come ablaze and you can't keep up
Won't sink to your level 'cause we've had enough

We want the static, the disco
Yeah from our radio-o

If you hate us, we don't care
There's teen-see kids everywhere
We want you, do you dare
Life for live, are you scared?
If you hate us, we don't care

There's teen-see kids everywhere
We are gonna hit you where it hurts
Let's go, Bis go

We're at the party and we're ready to disco
Need inspiration, there's no style, oh no
More plastic people and they're coming at you
Better make an exit 'cause we're coming through

Bis,"Sci-fi Steven, a secret vampire by night.
Ears and eyes always on the lookout for conspiracies against the teen-c nation.
Lives by the ethic, 'keep yr friends close but yr enemies closer.'

Manda rin, seeker of the truth.
Hair clips and screams used as deadly weapons.
Childlike appearance used as decoy.
A warning to all saboteurs, 'be fooled and be dead'.

John disco, all hail the disco king.
Gaze in wonderment at his skanking ability, but don't stare too long.
His disco feet can hypnotize.
Hear him say, 'travolta ain't got nothin' on me'.

And now coming through the airwaves into yr home.
Introducing the new transistor heroes.

Tell it to the kids, tell it to the kids.

Hey you! fascist man, working on yr master plan.
We know what we saw, won't let you do more.
Hey you! homophobes, life without yr frontal lobe.
Yr prejudice lies while innocent die.

Hey you! it's the sound, in yr head goes round and round
You want it some more, yr life is a bore.
Hey you! don't be scared, bis are here and we don't care.
We'll expose the lies. it's the defense for the kids.

No use running now, we know what you did

You think yr the best, now here's the prole press.
Hey you! businessman, getting as much as you can

Hey you! backstabber, we know who and where you are
You let down the kids, yes that's what you did
Hey you! listen out, teen-c nation gives the shout
Retain the youth. it's the defense for the kids!
