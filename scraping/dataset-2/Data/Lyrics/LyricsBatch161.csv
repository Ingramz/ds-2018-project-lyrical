Dog Age,"There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep.

Now it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep.

Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the breath of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way.

Dog Boy,"Now who say Dog Boy only come 
in a reggae fashion?!
My Mom say ""Never Judge a Book by 
It's Cover.""
Turn the page to discover,
You got the reggae on one and 
the punk rock ragamuffin on the other,
Richter...!

You know it's time to leave my house, so I slid out the door,
Had this hole in my pocket so my sack hit the floor,
Now this ain't nothing new I've had these jeans for years,
Hopped into my bus and started banging the gears,
Took it on the redline then I slapped into,
Reached in-between my seats and I pulled out another brew,
But now I'm 5-0-2 it ain't the route for me,
So I grab some chicken littles from KFC,

I'ma go to Mickey D's get a burger with some cheese,
Discuss these plans how I'm flippin' these keys,
Capisce, a 'cause a 'cause you don't' know him,
I'll give it to my friend, know him, we spilt the door,
Back in the bus we puffs, kept rollin',
Scoot Dog Boy, Daddy X is holdin',
There go the potion look you're frozen,
Damn this bud's good

BUMP BUMP!!
You know how the sound flows,
BUMP BUMP!!
Yo it's like that you know,
BUMP BUMP!!
Babylon beware we got one microphone for the world to share!

I got a '85 caddy with the Clarion Amp,
With some 10's in the trunk for punks who want to bump my shit,
Bang, rattle your chest and brain,
Frame by frame rearrange your shit,
Adjust your amps and your shit might hit,
Don't quit to the beat, the bass gets deeper,
Listen to the tones as they crush your speakers with the little thump,

Well yup I'm still drunk with the humps in the trunk,
You hear the Kottonmouth Kings yellin' out BUMP! BUMP!
I flew through a yellow then I ran a red,
Grabbed a bev saw a cop then hit the clutch and breath,
Knew I had to slow down so I smoked a bowl,
Picked up D-Loc and told him start to roll,
Freeway was packed so I paid the toll,
Four joints later my bus was fishbowled,

Jamaica island of the sounds
And all you ever hear is the bass and drum
I said the ?????????????

?????????????? ragamuffin
????????? wicked rhythm
??? ride through Jamacian countryside

When it come to music lord we love it
Any style we ???????????
Bump 2000 lord here we come again
First time around we rock all across the land

How's that sound with the tick and the bump,
I puff the skunk while I'm settin' off alarms,
EQ my Mid so my highs don't twitch,
I drop bombs while your sounds blown to shit,
I like to sip on my binger,
Ice water rips are cleaner,
Push the bowl down with my finger,
Then i snapped a load,
The bud i got is meaner,
Felony no misdemeanor,
Got a Beamer same as Zingers',
With the system full blown,

Daddy X, correct, Who'd You Expect?
The mans ???????? connect,
????????????,
X is for ecstasy,
Is that why the fucker's standing next to me,
Or is it because I'm a Kottonmouth King,
With pounds and pounds and pounds of Florida keif,
Naw no thang smoke ring coinsure,
You'll never find my bong water dirty like the sewer,

The ones you never look in the eye
We The People, The Uninvited
The ones that see right through your lies

I'm living in peace decease all evil
Honesty's the policy it never be equal
Sinful people fall down first
Disperse my actions they speak louder than my words
Observe, learn, it always comes back
Like a mouse in a maze you're caught up in a trap
Feeling the vibes that you can't escape
Intake injection poisonous perfection
Calm down, concentrate, I can't relate
Loves great when you only got time to tell fate
A place to lay, some tape to break, some goods to bake, some babies to make
Don't take it for granted, you got one life to live
I know you didn't plan it, so you're forgived
We were put on this earth to show goddess to the youth
Test the planet and speak the truth

Propaganda in the can got your hand in the fan
I run my own planet live my life rebellious

I got fat sack for all the fans who felt us
The ones who smelt us
And called the police, time to legalize weed
Signed the Kottonmouth Kings

I got the universal key so I had to unlock it
??????????? blown up like sky rockets
Anything you can buy I had mad fat pockets

You walk the globe acting like a fool,
But what you're doing comes back to you.
Just remember rule number one
When you're a dick, you'll be treated like a dick.

A dick, a cock, a piece of shit,
'Cause karma has everything to do with it.
It's not where you're going, it's where you've been,
It's not what you're doing, it's what you've done.

That's right, you'll never be the little one,
Never give in and never say you're done.

Nobody ever wants to sacrifice
Nobody ever gonna pay the price.
Nobody ever gonna understand,
Nobody ever gonna lend a hand.

School your differences on right and wrong.
You teach, you learn, you gain insight
I'll show you the difference between wrong and right.

One is wrong, and one is right

I can't see how such a lying , cheating son of a bitch,
could have ever been a friend of mine.

Are you so blind that you can't see,
look at what you've done to me.
All of this time I called you my friend,
now I see your true colors showing in the end.

Good times and bad times took a turn for the worst,
but looking back on it now,
wonder why somehow I could ever hitten all the hurts.
Took something from me that you can't give back,
it was yours as much it was mine,
but in the end I think you've got what was coming to you,
I got love you got nothing but time.

you never had the balls to stand and fight me.

Breaking through cities and rippin' through town.

I spy like James Bond. N to the OR. I'll put you in the ER,
Fuming like a cigar, screaming like a marshall.
Electric guitar strap me in there, a true circle, the perfect square.
Hot like flares, danger, beware you must prepare.
Only strategic affairs turn boys to millionaires.
We got to keep moving/forever staying in motion.
Papa never gave me tools to the trade, yo, I'm tryin' to make the grade.
Suckas think I got it made. I won't trade or give aid.

Was left sitting on a car hood
With a paper tiger 
That he used to play with 
And a picture of his father,
Whose memory was a whisper
That sang to him daily
As he ran away

It started out so simply

To where you're going,

Something we deserve,

Hold us down the ground,
And show us who we are.

With our fear,
Our hope,
Our love,
And our pride,
Two steps forward, no looking back.
Every chance to fall through
Then its one look and the world becomes you
Untouched,
We know we're on our way.

By too much time inside,

Hold us down to the ground,

Do we want to let go 
Of this magic,

From mystery,

You got the reggae on one and 
the punk rock ragamuffin on the other,
Richter...!

You know it's time to leave my house, so I slid out the door,
Had this hole in my pocket so my sack hit the floor,
Now this ain't nothing new I've had these jeans for years,
Hopped into my bus and started banging the gears,
Took it on the redline then I slapped into,
Reached in-between my seats and I pulled out another brew,
But now I'm 5-0-2 it ain't the route for me,
So I grab some chicken littles from KFC,

I'ma go to Mickey D's get a burger with some cheese,
Discuss these plans how I'm flippin' these keys,
Capisce, a 'cause a 'cause you don't' know him,
I'll give it to my friend, know him, we spilt the door,
Back in the bus we puffs, kept rollin',

Yo it's like that you know,
BUMP BUMP!!
Babylon beware we got one microphone for the world to share!

I got a '85 caddy with the Clarion Amp,
With some 10's in the trunk for punks who want to bump my shit,
Bang, rattle your chest and brain,
Frame by frame rearrange your shit,
Adjust your amps and your shit might hit,
Don't quit to the beat, the bass gets deeper,
Listen to the tones as they crush your speakers with the little thump,

Well yup I'm still drunk with the humps in the trunk,
You hear the Kottonmouth Kings yellin' out BUMP! BUMP!
I flew through a yellow then I ran a red,
Grabbed a bev saw a cop then hit the clutch and breath,
Knew I had to slow down so I smoked a bowl,
Picked up D-Loc and told him start to roll,
Freeway was packed so I paid the toll,
Four joints later my bus was fishbowled,

Making sure to laugh; while we experience anti-gravity.

So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A f***in menace, usin' hoes like tennis rackets

It's on again, it's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I want to see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton

(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin' out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes

Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the f*** of it
Ruff and rugged s***, it's un-explanatory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it

Check it, I'm runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin'
Hit the button, and light s*** up like Red Dawn

Peep, the ma**icre from a verbal a**a**in
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you f***in wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin' out looney like O-Dog

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Tell when (till the early morn)
It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)
The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg s***)

Diggity Daz out of the motherf***in cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
'Til I die I'm still screamin' that (b****es ain't s***)

Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about 
The city where I'm from, dumb diddy dumb
As you groove to the gangster s***
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-you-N-D, the gangsta clique

Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the f*** you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die

Coming with a group of gangsta shit for ninety-three
So ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there
Wherever I bails, I put it down on the ground
'cause ain't shit for sale in the Coupe
With the beat flossing off gold D's
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for getting us all fucked up
Now check it, it's a calling for niggas like Doggs
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitching like hogs
(Yes y'all) Walk the Doggs (yes y'all) Yiggy y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball

I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this
Now how many bitches must get dick?
Before they say, that Daz is that nigga from back in the day

The kinpin of the clique, top notch
17 shot Glock cocked, so all nigga drop
The run of the mill fool get broke off for trying to serve
The best Kurupt's era, peep the terror, 'cause it's a murder fest
I smoke chronic everyday, so what have we
Another motherfucker, getting served like some cavy
Now who, drops (ruff rhymes) I got full Juice like 2Pac
(plus I'm) rolling with two Glocks
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Hell-raising like Pinhead, beware I'm tearing shit the fuck up
Slow your roll, like your legs was broken
Who's joking? Rakim never joked, so why should I loc?
Now that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe
Running em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die 'cause I'm serving it
They can't fuck with or see me I'm mass murdering

Take down, when it comes to the mic I'm putting my weight down
And that's 175 pounds of beed
Beating yo' ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with no where to go, so
What's a girl to do
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you want to do?

Throw your guns in the motherfucking air, we don't care
(Niggas don't give a fuck nigga)
About nothing at all, just my Doggs and clocking the grip bitch
(Niggas don't give a fuck nigga)
That's why I can kick it so tuff, 'cause when times get ruff, my

Dogg Pound Posse,"Six million ways to die, choose one

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flagging me down
Saying, ""Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga snoop alright? Hey yo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?""
I said, if you ain't up on things
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thing, to gang-bang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton, and Watts, see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
Pump pump, put 2 slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker, creepin and sleepin
6 feet deep in, fuckin with the Pound is

Suicide, it's a suicide

The cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon 'cause
I drops bombs like Platoon (hey nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't want to be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
Now roam through the depths of hell
Where the rest your buster ass homeboys dwell
Well

Suicide, it's a suicide

Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa

Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta, now picture this!
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fucking chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruff-neck
Now everybody scream 'nough respect to the X
'Nough respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living

Be trying to do they own little dissing
But they can't do it, you know, so we gonna, do it like this
Sit back relax and get a cool one

Have you ever heard of a slughter? I oughta start dippin'
Sippin' on that S T get's me to trippin'
I don't slips, I bangs with that mad ass Dogg Pound gang
It's a DPG thang, Kurupt from the S.C
You wanna test me, let's see if you'll survive .45 times
Like a hollow point headed for your dome
Take a couple of steps, turn around and it's on
Couldn't withstand the murderous mental

I subdue and then take two to your temple
When I cause holocoust from what's spittin'
Niggaz collapse and when the straps is clickin'
Look, this is how it's done nigga
(One, two, three)
I grab my strap, you best run nigga
I gives a fuck, Kurupt's the kingpin of the click
Littlest G, with the biggest dick

Shit, a motherfucker betta recognize
With a twist of my wrist like O.J. you all die
I snack on motherfuckers like a bone
Known to be the shit upon the microphone

Ever since I was bown, not to ever love a bitch
Learned game after game, that's why we are the best
Motherfuckers be gankin' styles minute after minute
But soon as you did it I smelled the niggaz shitted

Now what would you do?
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't, so don't even think about
Steppin' in the motherfuckin' house

Now what would you do?
If you could fuck with me and my crew

Every single day in the LBC
Cruisin' through the East side, me and Lil' Style
When I back up a green six-fo' bustin' free styles

There's no escape, give me the papes and the tape case
How much money can a nigga make in one place?
The review, ain't shit new
You stupid motherfuckers can't fuck wit' my crew

I see all these niggaz tryin' to get with my kin folk
Get so many busters on the West Coast and then to say the least
I see a few trick ass niggaz layin' low on the East Coast
And the question is asked

Do you wanna rap, scrap or blast to that nigga Daz
I'll be the first one to him 'em
Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knockout and every nigga down with him
'cause I'm a natural born killer
And I steal a half, motherfucker 'cause it's like that

Now what would you do?
If you could fuck with me and my crew

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include
Whose quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud
It doesn't make a difference 'cause it's about
Who's the quickest on the draw to end all existence

For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools
These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room
Assume, it's only for conversation, so let's
Conversate slip a nigga the .38 then dip
Empty out the clip
Mind on stead-trip, 'cause niggaz talk shit

Now if a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive?
And if I was in your shoes, would I survive?
Probably not, you'd probably let your glock go pop
Now drop, to your knees
And picture Dat Nigga Daz flowin' in the breeze
(Flowin')

Now what would you do?
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't, so don't even think about
Steppin' in the motherfuckin' house

From the twitch of the eyes
You can see the line, just know it when you see it
'cause it messes up the flow to the real fillings why'know
And I'd rather be sipping on a glass of wine
Can you feel yourself in the room with Everlast
Trying to steal a flow, I don't think so
Cock-blockers come with their hearts beating jealousy

In the way like a stray dog
Trying to climb, every bitch on his arm
Cock-blockers, come in every color
Even blue, now this is true
Trying to fuck your woman and even you
Now what the fuck would you do, motherfucker?

What would you do? Mmm
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do?
If you could get with me and my crew

The weak ones stick and move
What would you do if you could get with my crew?
Why don't you tell me what?
Tell me what you would do if you could get with
The weak ones stick and move

What would you do if you could get with my crew?

Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di
I rock them, mighty hardy, like la-di-da-di

Ma con gli affari era il più bravo

Nel substrato anche suo padre ha sempre sudato
E ora che è sciupato non si regge sulle sue gambe
Fra cosa ti ha lasciato? una tv più grande
Potrei fare come Pietro andarmene lontano
Dove il mondo è più indietro e un po' meno bastardo
Ed abbandonare la gara ed abbondare le canne
Lasciare che sia lo spirito ad appagarmi
Fra anche lui stava in via dei poeti saccente
Ed ha scelto una giungla vera al posto di una di cemento

Fumavo con loro le canne la sera sulla Lancia Tema
Potrei spingermi in vena la stessa di Antonio, la stessa merda
Surrogato della pace in terra
Ed allentare il guinzaglio da questa sofferenza
Ed aspettare che il taglio zittisca la coscienza
Potrei chiudere con le donne, farmi solo le troie
L'amore spezza gli uomini e non solo il cuore
Potrei far l'avvocato come Teo con la testa che ho
E gli stronzi che ho visto in ateneo

Forget about the good times?

Hope I'd never see it through...
Never even think it -- you.

Always feeling trapped inside.
Broken promises provide, years of torment gone astray...
Responsibility, too much to pay.

Inside a boy who's without you,
Without what's left I'm left on my own,
Bitter view of an american family.
Create my own redemption.

The only thing I need

I hear you calling me
Haunting me

I am hypnotized
Mesmerized
As I walk toward the fire

The fear comes over me
And then I see
The meaning of desire

If you could see my face
Hold my hands
Look into my eyes
I would show you

That, you are
The only
The only thing I need",Without You,2005

I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.
Then escape to the summer sands, 
Until my time has expired I'll be trying and
I finally found something I'll never give up, 
Finally found something I can be proud of 
(I finally found something I can be proud of)

Hustling, money coming in, 
There ain't nothing worse than watching mummy struggling. 
Suffering, and I can't tell you how easy it is 
But I can tell you how tough it's been. 
I know you're wondering, well first off, 
I would need a warehouse to store my troubles in. 
Nobodies aware of what I'm covering up 
But one thing I'll erupt my bloods bubbling. 
I'm stressed out, frustrated and hungry 
That's enough to send a man over the edge humpty. 
And if it ain't me against the world 
Then I feel like I'm going against this whole country. 
Nobodies on my side they wanna take my soul, 
Body and my mind but I still got a problem with authority 
So what should I decide?

How different is my life to another mans,
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.
Then escape to the summer sands, 
Until my time has expired I'll be trying and
I finally found something I'll never give up, 
Finally found something I can be proud of 
(I finally found something I can be proud of)

First off, for too many years I've been worse off now 
Every single verse is bloody worth dosh, 
It's hard to always stay on track sometimes I swerve off, 
Life's a lesson, in one second you could learn a lot. 
Give me the chance to accelerate and I'm burning off. 
Because I've been left too long to rot in the eternal fog 
And I was always told to aim for the stars 
Now I'm cruising through space like Scotty and the captains log. 
Deep space mind, don't hate me just make yours how I make mine? 
Take time to stay tight, 
And when times get messy like a cage fight, 
We will soon see which individual suffers stage fright. 
I'll be ready on the double, 
My flows flexible and supple leave you buried like a dead man in the ruble. 
Fully proud how my teams emerging from the tunnel full of never ending trouble!

How different is my life to another mans,
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.
Then escape to the summer sands, 
Until my time has expired I'll be trying and
I finally found something I'll never give up, 
Finally found something I can be proud of 
(I finally found something I can be proud of)

I was on the road all day or I was getting locked up. 
Had find some other way to change my life up, 
I was on the path but sometimes I fucked it right up. 
I was either thinking I should leave or I should quit, 
But something always telling me I don't know what it is, 
I got something I am proud of, I'm enjoying this, 
I know, I know, I know. 
I would always try my best but nothing ever worked, 
So someone please just tell me straight 
'cause now I'm feeling worse. 
Now my pockets on fire all my credits burnt. 
I always paid the price and I never learned. 
I was just a crazy kid, broke and I was lost, 
Cause anytime I would flip and they would call the dogs, 
Always scrapping, always fighting, 
Show my teeth music changed my life now I'm never lost.

How different is my life to another mans,
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.

Yeah, I cried

So hot
Stone cold
Why'd you let me go

You got a heartless heart
You got a heart of stone
You got a heartless heart
And it's just gonna bring you

Baby go all night
Turn on the action

Dokken,"You didn't see me, but I overheard
A short conversation was just a few words
A lie and a whisper, a knife in my back
The things you were saying lead me to believe
You want no part of me

Leave me go, turn and walk away, turn your back on me
If you stay, there's just one thing that I've got to say

Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Just don't lie to me
Like the way you used to do

Voices that whisper, dark deep despair
Burns me like fire, these things that I hear

Leave me go, turn and walk away, turn your back on me
If you stay, there's just one thing that I've got to say

Don't treat me like a fool
Just don't lie to me

Tell me it's over, don't tell me you care
Don't want to hear it no more
Don't say you love me, if the feeling's not there

Dokken,"Clouds roll by as I look to the sky
And then the feeling comes, it comes on again
You know desire burns like a fire, fire of sin
Oh, will I ever learn
You're the only one I could call my own
But then the shadows fall and I'm gone again

I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for things
That I might never find again

Care for you, you know that I always will
I know it's hard for you, my taste for the kill
But then it calls to me when the moon rises full in the sky
You know it's not denied
Will I ever find love and peace of mind
On these streets again, will it ever end

How I wish I could take you away
I would show you that my love's not the same

Will the sun rise, will there be a sky

You'll come my way

Maybe tonight you'll be gone

I can't explain
I hear the voices callin' out
Callin' my name

Break the spell of illusion
Bound together waiting for you

Tried to find a rose without a thorn

Keeping me from the other side
Satisfy what my soul believes
If it could only see

On a red sky
In a green sea
On a black night
I fell to my knees

Save it for the innocent
Save it for the cruel
And leave it in the shadows of life
On a ship full of hopes and dreams
Took a trip down to misery
Realized that I'd been before
I found it hard to believe

On a red sky
In a green sea
On a black night

Can you see the darkness that was left me over time
Bordering on sadness / no tranquility
Look through my mirror and you'll see

[inside] nothing was clear
Saving grace / forgotten road
I was lost / but now I'm home
Saving grace / a ray of hope
When I hear a voice of the soul
Sold my religion / sold my candles too
Knees have been bleeding / praying over you
I search the heavens / all I ever see
Dust from the ashes / misery

Saving grace / forgotten road
I was lost / but now I'm home

Then the sun began to rise
Still I haven't gone to bed

All I want to do is close my eyes and go to bed
Let tomorrow bring the answers that I need instead
And let it go / let it go
Is there anybody who believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
Set me free / set me free
Hope that I can sleep tonight
Close my eyes and slip away
Dream about some other place
Where the sun shines in my head
Out of all the people in my life I love you more
And I hope that time will find a way to make it sure
That we stay one and the same

That the questions and the answers will come easily

It was late like the storm
Finding it hard tried to carry on
Without fear or the shame
We could walk in park without being afraid

Was a time I believed
As the story unfolded so free
Now the passion is gone
All wrong
Down to the lake moonlit dawn

There was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need
They say that it's starting to show
Should have seen it long ago
There was a time I believed
You were everything I need

As a child
We believed
We could wake from the night and the dawn it seemed
Was so warm
So warm
Into His arms like a child I was born

Was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need

Interlude

You took me like the sage
Searching for some absolution
Hard to know the reason nobody cared
Once upon a time

Take me right away
Let me know there's still a season
Let me know there's still a reason to live
I'm running out of time

There was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need
They say that it's starting to show
Should have seen it long ago
There was a time I believed
You were everything I need

So now I'm taking a chase of Cavasier
With all of those words that we shouldn't have said
Walking the beach for the last time again
Missing you more than I should

Wait for me, can't you see I'm still sad
I'm still I'm sad
All hope was lost, I found reason
To look in your eyes and find something
It's was like two days apart
From the truth
Was my soul the piece you been missin

You've got the gun pull the trigger
Strait to the heart of the matter
If it's all been in vain why do I remain
Watchin you leave me for others

Wait for me, I'll come for you
Wait for me, this day is not through
Wait for me, it's about time were through
Wait for me, can't you see I'm still sad
Still I'm sad

Wait for me, I'll come for you
Wait for me, this day is not through
Wait for me, it's about time we through
Wait for me, can't you see I'm still sad
Still I'm sad


Still I'm sad

Still I'm sad



Still I'm sad


Watch your life through your window
Shadows fall
As the darkness falls to gray

Though you're next to me
Can't taste the tears anymore

What do you want from me

I need to get off

I need to feel it once again

contradiction, trepidation, different points of view
Sitting in a place I said I'd never go with you 
Given half a chance I guess I'd throw it all away

Live my dreams the way I like
Give no reasons for what I am

"Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart","We were speaking of belief
Beliefs and conditioning
All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning
Thus the study of history is simply the study of one system of beliefs
Deposing another and so on and so on and so on
A psychologically tested belief of our time is that the central nervous
System, which feeds it's impulses directly to the brain, is unable to
Discern between the real and the vividly imagined experience,
If there is a difference, and most of us believe there is
Am I being clear?
To examine these concepts requires tremendous energy and discipline
To experience the now without preconception or belief
To allow the unknown to occur and to occur requires clarity
For where there is clarity, there is no choice
And where there is choice, there is misery
But then why should anyone listen to me?
Why should I speak since I know nothing?",You and I,1976

Our only concearn was diggits and comsumers 'cause we had athis lil city down in
Alabama Boomin' so we just do it
Did it like Nike
And even wit this wifebeater on

It sounds so hard talkin bout guns

Get drilled, tip toein by the minute

Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around

Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

I'm still back for the first damn time
So grab a hold of your seats while I open your mind
And take you back to when I dropped down from heaven
And I came out my moms and had a mic as my fucking weapon
When I was three I was just a little G
But if you looked in my eyes you'd see the future of a real MC
And at the age of nine I wrote my first rhyme
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pastimes
Every where that I went spitting and babbling
Showing my ass, growing up then started traveling
From one city to the next, Luda landed in the ATL
Where the pimps and the players dwell
I made a tape, did shows and got exposure
And kept learning as my black ass got older
No matter what I just kept at my trade
I made mistakes but stayed sharper then a Ginsu blade

It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around

Age fourteen, my talent show a beast outta cage
I would of won but disqualified for jumping off stage
But I ain't care, cause this game has started to open it's arms
When I was at Banneker High School pulling fire alarms
So I could get a crowd around me, make a name for my block
People told me ""keep flowing,"" they ain't want me to stop
Was back when Big Nose John was my human beat box
We'd skip school, hit open campus and watch out for street cops
Now I'm known around the town as that nigga that raps
From the hills that made high to them G roll traps
And I was still making demo's, perfecting the craft
And some said I wouldn't make it, they would giggle and laugh
So I picked up a couple books by Donald Goins
Bout the business of this shit, how to flip a few coins
Before the age of eighteen, I was destined to make it
My bank account read Disturbing The Peace, incorporated

It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets

So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

Age eighteen, I'm strugglin', just to survive
But got a gig workin' for change at 97.5
Now I'm rapping on the radio, increasing their numbers
Still Ludacris but alias was Cris Luva Luva
Late nights I'm in they studio and using they tools
Me and Puma smoking weed and breaking all of their rules
And I was krunk, all the big wigs was hearing my songs
But nobody did shit and they was taking too long
So three years went past, and I saved enough cash
To make my own record label and put myself on blast
The album was independent, it was just for the streets
I sold a one thousand copies in my first fuckin' week
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand
All the record companies bite me, but I chose Def Jam
And the main reason that I made it and I love the A-town
Was 'cause the block had its eye brows down, ya heard me?

It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

Then he turned around and died on me
So I didn't know what else to do
But motherfuckin' cry, homie
Oh yeah, I'm God's son
Tell Nas he got more than one
And me, I got more to see, more to be
Order three, started with a quarter key
I'm so ill I need penicill'
Rockin' ice cubes, talkin' kill at will
And these days you can't tell who is really real
Ridin' on some Emmitt Smith's, long way from Emmett Till

Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will

Live long enough, it'll happen to you

Streets love a nigga, got a D-boy membership
We do it from the heart, I hope the aunt will remember this
Coke on all sinisters, cold but no fridge in this
No to all witnesses, lie or die infamous
My style is so infamous, my style, it needs censorship
Dealer what's the business? Don't call, I'm busy bitch
Unless you 'bout your business, I'm tryna get some benjamins
Niggas say a lie on their way to the top
But you know you're too hot when they kidnap your pops
I guess that's sayin' a lot
But we ain't sayin' much, we just sendin' them shots, nigga

Death over dynasty, I'm talkin' major, not the minor league
And you the last of a dyin' breed
Follow caine like a menace to society
The richest nigga in the city cosignin' me
My shampoo days done showed me the way
As I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague
How can there be closure when the shooter's still in questionin'
Your niggas got rich, but when you died them niggas owed you
And everything I see is adding up to what you told me
I'm ramblin', tryna keep it to myself
I'm scramblin', still hard to hold the tears back
Never saw what I became, can't get them years back
Death before dishonor

Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will

Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will

Dolla Will,"[8B] Space, Age-in baby
[TS] Right right right right
[8B] One time
[TS] Beyotch!
[8B] Yeah, you know how they like it baby, nigga you can't retire!

Verse One: Too $hort, Eightball

From nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight
I Don't Stop Rappin like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell em instantly (instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (pimp in me)
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin to sleep with me
Every night, sold out, turnin young hoes
Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin on twenties wearin nice clothes
but ain't nuttin like pimpin hoes, and ridin Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin this
opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song

Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin white boys, bumpin dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin sellin cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin raps
All about my snaps, tryin to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
$hort Dawg, I don't know why you tryin to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin more than them niggaz movin weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin game, now let's get out here and make this loot

Chorus: Too $hort, Eightball, MJG

[TS] I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
[TS] I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
[8B] We some presidential players, with money by the layers
[8B] Ain't nuthin you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
[TS] I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
[TS] I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
[MJ] I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
[MJ] and meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes

Verse Two: MJG, Too $hort

I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin eyes scarred, bein weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
was rappin, sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game

I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
I live the fast life of a MC
and I sell a lot of records makin pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin, sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway

Verse Three: Eightball, MJG

My way (pimp til I dieee) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin, how far this shit is goin
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJG 

Here comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too $hort, we all must be
the pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too deep
So I hooked up with my comrades so we can all get rich, nigga

Chorus

[8B] Yea yea, one time, for your motherfuckin mind
[TS] Pimp shit bitch
[8B] Eightball and MJG, now what you weigh me
[TS] $hort Dawg in the house, slammin Cadillac do's, pimpin hoes
[8B] Nuthin but the real shit, nine-eight, for these tricks it's too late
[TS] It's that old school pimpin all the way from Memphis, to Oakland

Dolla Will,"Why..
Why..

I'm a junkie, lookin through my book
I can't be cured, I know I'm hooked
I gotta get out the house, I'm so hard
Chasin that cat all over the yard
But why, do I chase the cat?
Been at it so long since way back
Why would I want to be a player for life?
Spittin this game every day and night
I'm talkin, body language, facial expressions
Fuck a flight attendant on a layover session
She's servin my dick
Fallin in love, but she ain't my bitch
Why do I need to be in between her
Since the first time I seen her?
Hit it from behind, now she want to be mine
I'm all up in her feline

[Chorus]
Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money
Why must I, chase the cat?
You see ain't nothin changed, but the game, pimpin ain't easy

Uh, bein settled down, just ain't for me
Hold hands, walkin down the aisle, bout to get married
I thought that once, will never think it again
Cause I'm a player in the game and I'm playin to win
It's too many fine hoes to be stuck with one
Too many wet pussies just to be fuckin one, shit
It's like a disease, like JT in ""Five Heartbeats""
It's impossible for me to be with one freak
You can't live with me, you can't live without 'em
I never would trust a bitch and I don't doubt 'em
Cause I'm a dog that love to chase the cat
If you a fine bitch, I might put my face in that
If you do me first, then I'll do you
And the game jumps off when the bitch is through
Hoes nowadays be as bad as us
They love to suck fuck and bust fat ass nuts

[Chorus]

Ever since I was a youngster, new to the game
I was goin to the mall, baby what's your name
And your number - I never been under
Always been a outright player no wonder
I been through so many hoes in the last 20 years
Bitch gettin fucked, bring her ass up in here
I keep two or three hoes on deck
Too $hort baby don't take no shit
I'm a pussy junkie, and bitches always want me
But my first love is money
And I'll forever be faithful to her
I won't give her to a bitch just to do her
And play with her kitty
Got some nigga's name tattooed on her titty
I see a gat and jump the fence
My name is $hort Dog and I'm a pimp, bitch

[Chorus]
Why must I, chase the cat?
Cause you know.. she's a ho..
Why must I, chase the cat?
Whaddya know.. she gives me dough..
Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money",Chase the Cat,2001

Starin' at your booty 'cause it moves like jello

You don't even notice 'cause you doin' your thang
Shouldn't have came here with him, you knew he couldn't hang
I love the view, but that just ain't enough
I can hear it beepin' like you backin' up a truck
You need a special permit to operate that ass
I'ma hit it right girl and make it last

I like the way you shake and you bounce that back

It's on once again, come and roll with a pimp
I ain't mad at ya girl, get your money, go and strip
Extra shots of Patron just in case you wanna sip
Smokin' grapes, pay security so they won't trip
The way you're dancin', how ya move your body so swift
Ass big enough to hold a glass with no coaster
Seen a little bit of cash now you're movin' closer
If you wanna we can leave from here and go somewhere
(That's right) It ain't nothin 'cause I'm into that

When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round Midnight,1994
Dollar Brand,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

It's enough to make you cry

Always looking for a sign
Miracles won't change your mind
Tell me how much evidence you need
Turning truth into a lie
Hardened heart and blinded eye
All you need to do is just believe

Never mind what you think that you had seen
It all can change in just a moment
Here before you is all the proof you need
Why can't you ever just believe it?",Believe,1997
Dolly,"Angel came down from heaven yesterday 
Stayed with me long enough to rescue me 
And she told me a story yesterday 
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea 
Then she spread her wings high over me 
She said she's goin' now, come back tomorrow 

And I said, Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky 
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side

Fly away, high away, fly away 

Sure enough this morning came unto me 
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise 
And my angel she said unto me 
Today's the day for you to rise 
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise 
Then she took me high over yonder 

And I said, Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky 
Fly on my sweet angel 
Forever I will be by your side

Fly on through the sky

Dolly Collins,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those, who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you, that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen",Young John [*],1970

Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard,1989

You're A Sweet-heart if there ev-er was one,
If there ev-er was one it's you.

There are blossoms on Broadway 
When I'm walking with you
Blossoms where trees never grew
I forget the crowd and the loud rumble of cars
And all the bright lights turn into stars

There is magic on Broadway 
When you're smiling at me
Magic my heart never knew
What a joy to be blissfully wandering through 
The blossoms on Broadway with you

Dolly Houston,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way,2012

She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA
Now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away

And shouldn't wodow Jones be told to keep

Now Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you'll smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin

And when you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that I ain't fit

Singing in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world 
And I'm glad that I can't see the boy that offered me his name 
For I was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame

Dolly Parton,"As the snow flies 
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' 
A poor little baby child is born 
In the ghetto 

And his mama cries 
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need 
It's another hungry mouth to feed 
In the ghetto 

People, don't you understand 
The child needs a helping hand 
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day 
Take a look at you and me 

Are we too blind to see 
Do we simply turn our heads 
And look the other way 

Well the world turns 
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose 
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows 
In the ghetto 

And his hunger burns 
So he starts to roam the streets at night 
And he learns how to steal 
And he learns how to fight 
In the ghetto 

Then one night in desperation 
A young man breaks away 
He buys a gun, steals a car 
Tries to run, but he don't get far 
And his mama cries 

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man 
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand 
In the ghetto 

As her young man dies 
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' 
Another little baby child is born 
In the ghetto",In the Ghetto,1970

Heating up the meat loaf and stiring up the gravy
Is kind a messing up my mind

I remember what I forgot.
Stepping on the gas and driving kind of fast

Hoping I won't get stopped.
Better move it on home, better move it on home.

Trying to be a good mother and wife

I used to stand on a corner when I was a child 
And I'd play my guitar and sing as the people went by 
The sidewalks were crowded but I'd just sing louder cause I didn't mind 
Just spending my time, spinning my rhymes and singing for nickels and dimes 
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes 
I'd brighten their day as they go on their way and they'd brighten mine 
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind 
I knew that someday in my own special I'd repay all their nickels and dimes 

I recall the sidewalk each night as I stand on the stage 
As I play my guitar and sing for the people who paid 
Cause I finally made it to what they all call the big time 
But I still remember I still owe some nickels and dimes 

Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes 
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind 
So if you remember a child on the corner of time 
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes 

Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes

Mama, I remember what you told me 
You said you wait for love before you fall 
But, mama, I am sorry, I guess it's gonna be love after all 
'Cause mama, when he holds me 
The air is thick and sweet 
He asked me if I'd come tonight 
And hold him in his sleep 

And I'm almost in love 
I can feel myself fallin' 
Yes, I'm almost in love 
I can hear my heart fallin' 
'Cause I'm almost in 
Yes, I'm almost in love 

Mama, I've grown into a woman 
I been growing stronger and stronger day by day 
Mama, you know about children 
You raise them then they'll go away 
Mama, when he holds me 
He thrills me through and through 
So dry your eyes and teach me how to say goodbye to you 

And I'm almost in love 
I can feel myself fallin' 
Yes, I'm almost in love 
I can hear my heart fallin'

From daylight till dusk we've been a workin' in the dust
Pickin' cotton workin' side by side
Oh I can't forget I still remember yet the way my daddy looked at me and cried

You know we can't be slow take the kids and get below
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all

Come and listen you fellows 
So young and do fine 
And seek not your fortune 
In the dark, dreary mines 

It will form as a habit 
Seep in your soul 
'Til the blood in your veins 
Runs as black as the coal 

There's many a man 
That I've known in my day 
Who lived just to labor 
His whole life away 

Like a fiend with his dope 
And a drunkard his wine 
A man will have lust for 
The lure of the mine 

It's dark as a dungeon 
Damp as the dew 
The danger is double 
And the pleasures are few 

Where the rain never falls 
Where the sun never shines 
It's dark as a dungeon 
Way down in the mine 

I hope when I'm gone 
And the ages shall roll 
My body will blacken 
And turn into coal 

Then I'll look out the door 
Of my heavenly home 
And I'll pity the miners 
A-diggin' my bones 

It's dark as a dungeon 
Damp as the dew 
The danger is double 
And the pleasures are few 

Where the rain never falls 
Where the sun never shines

I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.

Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars, by night I ake the bars
If only they could read between the lines.

I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.

Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I think I'll take my foolish pride
And put it on the south-bound freight and ride

Nothin' can turn me away
This livin' with you is like a dream come true
And it grows more and more everyday

Ooh, I'm reachin' the highest of highs

You ask how I feel, I can say it out loud

When my day's work is all through
The sun and the lights, well, I wish I could fly
To get back faster to you

I waited all day by the telephone
Starin' at the clock on the wall
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms
And I just can't wait to hold you

Cause I love you I knew you well your heart
Could melt like caramel your eyes was deep like

Child begin child you sleep

Us out in preach from search lights that the sky
Would sending

You waltz right in the door

You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.

All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again and here I go

Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)

I used to sit for hours as a kid 
Dangle my feet from an old flat bridge, 
Seein' myself in the water below 
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw 

I recall a vacant old shack 
Down by the edge of the tobaccer patch 
A child's reflection in a dirty window 
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw 

A long time gone and a long time ago 
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw 
The world is cruel and people are cold 
They shatter my image with the stones they throw 
Shatter my image with the stones they throw 

I'm far from perfect, but I ain't all bad; 
It hurts me more than it makes me mad 
You gather your stones by stoopin' so low 
Then shatter my image with the stones you throw 

If you live in a glass house, don't throw stones 
Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own 
Look at your reflection in your house of glass 
Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash 
Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash 

A long time gone and a long time ago 
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw 
The world is cruel and people are cold 
They shatter my image with the stones they throw 
Shatter my image with the stones they throw 

A long time gone and a long time ago 
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw 
The world is cruel and people are cold 
They shatter my image with the stones they throw 
Shatter my image with the stones they throw 

Shatter my image with the stones you throw, 
Don't shatter my image with the stones you throw 
Shatter my image with the stones you throw, 
Shatter my image with the stones you throw, 
Shatter my image with the stones you throw, 
You shatter my image with the stones you throw 
Shatter my image with the stones you throw, 
You shatter my image with the stones you throw 
Shatter my image with the stones you throw, 
You shatter my image with the stones you throw 
Shatter my image with the stones you throw, 
You shatter my image with the stones you throw

That the best is often hidden from another's eyes

And every night I'm thankful that you're mine mmm that you are mine
Cause you were born to love me in your gentle way
Born to love me each and every day
Born to love me born to hold me tight
Born to love me every night every night every night

Self pity and sorrow was all I could see
Tears I was crying,
Kept me from seeing, I didn't love

To keep myself in a constant doubt
After all my searching and undo hurting.
I nearly lost the only good thing I ever found

Take away the rain.

Dolly Parton,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below;
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul.
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain.
But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.

Oh! she said, casey it's been so long since I've seen you!
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile!
See she said, I've put on new stockings just to please you!
Lord! she said, casey can you only stay a while? 

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the golden crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone.
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home.
Standin' in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye.

Oh! she said, I suppose you seldom think about me,
Now she said, now that you've a fam'ly of your own;
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body!
Lord! she said casey it's a shame to be alone!",Casey's Last Ride,1982
Dolly Parton,"When I look out over a green field of clover 
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day 
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain 
Or see April showers bring flowers to May 
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm 
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away 
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger 
The storm's even beautiful in its own way 

When I see leaves drop off from the treetop 
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day 
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder 
God made all things beautiful in their own way

Then suddenly I realize, I only hold a pillow
You're not there, you're not there

I call your name and hear my voice run searching through the hallway
To return alone confirming all I've known for so long
I'm alone you're still gone

Still half asleep I stumble to the kitchen for my coffee
My footsteps match my heartbeats, funny heartbeats on linoleum
The sounds all wrong you're still gone

The sounds outside reminding me the world won't wait forever
And understanding saves don't stand by empty graves
You're on your own all alone, she's still gone

As we go along,

As we dream by the fire

Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""You Hoo""

For a sleigh ride together with you

Lord, what I'd give to see an Alabama sundown 
The sun just seemed to drop in Mobile Bay 
New York town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down 
But that never was the Mobile way, no, no 
That never was the Mobile way 

A flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar 
In anybody's town, that price is cheap 
It's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards 
Cause I need ninety cents to go to sleep 

[Chorus]

I felt so big the day I left that Mobile couldn't hold me 
I thought there had to be a better way 
But if I could find that man that first called Lady Luck a lady 
That gentleman would surely learn to pray 

[Chorus: x2]",Alabama Sundown,1985
Dolly Parton,"Like someone drowning I reach for a straw
Grasping for love where there's no love at all
Slowly I'm sinking as time drags by and sometimes an old memory gets in my eye
I struggle for strength to face the dawn
And I'm freezing to death without you to keep me warm
I hold an arm full of nothing close to my side
And sometimes an old memory gets in my eye
Sometimes an old memory gets in my eye
And when it's ours it's hard to keep my eyes dry
Don't think you see tears for I never cry
But sometimes an old memory gets in my eye
Yes sometimes an old memory gets in my eye",Sometimes an Old Memory Gets in My Eye,1985

Of all the roads I've traveled and all the sights I've seen 
The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams 
And anything is possible for those who can believe 
Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities 

For us to make love work 
We've got to try a little harder 
And for love to work we gotta hold on 
A human heart is just too precious 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work 

It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye 
And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try 
There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue 
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you 

For us to make love work 
We've got to try a little bit harder 
And for love to work we gotta hold on 
A human heart is just too precious 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work 

Oh I do believe in miracles 
But I know they don't come easy 
So why don't we give destiny 
A helping hand 

For us to make love work 
We've got to try a little bit harder 
And for love to work we gotta hold on 
A human heart is just too precious 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work 

Life is just too beautiful 
To spend it feeling hurt 
Let's start to take the chance to make love work

I can't even begin to tell you 
How I've been feelin' lately 
But I have stumbled across something rare 
And you use it to bait me 
Something tells me go 
Everyone says no, no, no 
How can they be so cruel 
When they tell me don't touch you 
I tell them I'll die 

In your red hot screaming love 
In your red hot screaming love 

If I'm losing my senses 
They're lost in your deepest emotions 
And the jets in my heart 
They won't start till you set them in motion 
Something tells me go 
Everyone says no, no, no 
How can they be so cruel 
When they tell me don't touch you 
I tell them I'll die

In your red hot screaming love

Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die

There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there

Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us

I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough

I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked

And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me

I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me

Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep

Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me





",My Dear Companion,1987
Dolly Parton,"This is how I learned it from a Time-Life Album in about 1958.

There's a little rosewood casket
Lying on a marble stand
And a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand

[Go and bring them to me sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes] I did not know this verse--Thanks!

Last Sunday I saw him walkin'
With a lady by his side,
And I thought I heard him tell her
He would never be his bride.

When I'm dead and in my coffin
And my shroud's around me bound
And my narrow grave is ready
In some lonely churchyard ground.

Take his letters and his locket
Place together o'are my heart
But the golden ring he gave me
From my finger never part



",Rosewood Casket,1987
Dolly Parton,"The gates and doors were barred 
And all the windows fastened down 
I spent the night in sleeplessness 
And rose at every sound 
Half in hope of sorrow 
And half in fear the day 
Would find the soldiers breakin' through 
To drag us all away 
And just before the sunrise 
I heard something at the wall 
The gate began to rattle 
And a voice began to call 
I hurried to the window 
Looked down into the street 
Expecting swords and torches 
And the sound of soldiers' feet 

But there was no one there but Mary 
So I went down to let her in 
John stood there beside me 
As she told me where she'd been 
She said they've moved Him in the night 
And none of us know where 
The stone's been rolled away 
And now His body isn't there 

We both ran towards the garden 
Then John ran on ahead 
We found the stone and empty tomb 
Just the way that Mary said 
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in 
Was just an empty shell 
And how or where they'd taken Him 
Was more than I could tell 

Oh something strange had happened there 
Just what I did not know 
John believed a miracle 
But I just turned to go 
Circumstance and speculation 
Couldn't lift me very high 
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him 
Then I saw Him die 

Back inside the house again 
The guilt and anguish came 
Everything I'd promised Him 
Just added to my shame 
When at last it came to choices 
I denied I knew His name 
And even if He was alive 
It wouldn't be the same 

But suddenly the air was filled 
With a strange and sweet perfume 
Light that came from everywhere 
Drove shadows from the room 
And Jesus stood before me 
With His arms held open wide 
And I fell down on my knees 
And I just clung to Him and cried 

Then He raised me to my feet 
And as I looked into His eyes 
The love was shining out from Him 
Like sunlight from the skies 
Guilt in my confusion 
Disappeared in sweet release 
And every fear I ever had 
Just melted into peace 

He's alive yes He's alive 
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive yes He's alive 
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive He's alive 
Hallelujah He's alive 
He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive He's alive He's alive 
I believe it He's alive

As cold as that look on your face

You'd always love me 
I know that it's true 
But it's hard to believe

And what about all of those warm tender nights 
Did they mean nothing to you 
And where are the feelings I thought that we shared 
Or have you forgotten them too 
Did you think I could just put your memory behind 
When your words are still so very clear in my mind

Daddy sold the house 
They split up the money 
And went on their way 
And all the king's horses 
And all the king's men 
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again 

Starting over again 
Where should they begin 
Cause they've never been out on their own 
Starting over again 
Where do you begin 
When your dreams are all shattered 
And the kids are all grown 
And the whole world cries

She moved in with her sisters 
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends 
While she sits at home 
Just sorting out pieces 
Of left over memories 
From thirty odd years 

Starting over again 
Where do you begin 
You've never been out on your own 
Starting over again 
Never any end 

What will the neighbors say? 
They're talking talk, it's small town news 
Facing fifty years old 
Making up a happy home 
And this far down the road 
You find yourself alone 
Two fools 

Starting over again 
Now where do you begin 
When you've never been out on your own 
Starting over again

Ever since the moment that I met you

I can give you more than you'll ever need 
Sooner or later every heart needs some company 
When you think about love, think about me 
When you think about love, think about me 

We were strangers 
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger 
Oh what's a heart to do 
'Cause it lingers 
And the thought of you 
Wantin' me as much as I want you

And let's make it now 
Like we made it then 
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again

Dolly Parton,"The first noel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
This star drew night to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon their knee;
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.",The First Noel,1990

Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born

Rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Savior's birth

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

To hold your hand like I used to, I'm through with you
You're a heck of a singer and powerful man but you surround yourself
With people who demand so little of you

You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along right with you, you said
""I need you"", then you changed the words and added harmony
Then you sang the song you had written for me to someone new

Oh, but nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel things are right
When I know they're wrong, nobody sings a love song quite like you

Sing your song sweet music man, travel the world
With a six piece band that does for you what you tell 'em to
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun came back on you

Sing your song sad music man, makin' your living
Doing one night stands, they're through with you
They don't need you, you're still a heck of a singer but a broken man
But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to

Oh, and nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along and nobody else
Can make me feel things are right when they're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you

Sing your song sweet music man, I believe in you

In your big, black fancy car 
You were dressed up fit to kill
With a pretty girl on your arm 
You spun around and you headed up town 
Where the neon lights all shine 
Left me choking in a cloud of dust 
You never pay me no mind 

Chorus: 
You're livin' in the fast lane 
I guess I'm just too slow 
I never wore silk or fancy furs 
Just plain ole calico 

I'll never be a fast lane lover 
And they're the only kind you take up town 
I am just a country road 
That you keep turnin' down 

If you ever hit a dead end street 
If it's love that you're looking for 
You can always turn around 
And beat a path right to my door 
Do I have to draw you a map 
You seem to know your way around 
So when you're tired of spinnin' your wheels 
Baby, we can go to town 

Repeat Chorus 

I'll never be a fast lane lover 
And they're the only kind you take up town

That you keep turnin' down 

Repeat Chorus",Country Road,1991
Dolly Parton,"Well, I met an old man walkin' down the street
His clothes were torn and tattered
With sandals on his feet
And I stopped to help him
And lend him a hand
He said, I love you so much
But you must understand

Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world
They won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

And he said to me, let's rest for awhile
For I have some good news to share with you, child
He said, you can't change this old world
The people need to know
That a dear savior died here
A long, long time ago

Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world
They won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

His eyes shown like diamonds
And his smile was heaven sent
His hair was long and flowing
And his back was slightly bent
And I knew he knew it
For that day I changed
As I watched him walk on
I forgot to get his name

He said, silver and gold can't buy you a home
When this life has ended
And your time is gone
But you can live in a world where
You'll never grow old
And things can't be bought there with silver and gold

And time can't be bought back with silver and gold",Silver and Gold,1991

I thought I saw the promise of forever in your eyes 
I thought that I was sure of what I saw 
You led me to believe that I was special in your life 
So I left my heart wide open for the fall 

I thought I'd found a safe and loving place inside your heart; 
And I was warm and willing any time 
The same soft lips that kissed me sweet were lying from the start 
But I swear I thought your love was genuine 
What a heartache you turned out to be 

What a heartache, what a heartache, 
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep 
Oh, what a heartache, what a heart break, 
Love ain't always what it appears to be 
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be 

It just goes to show that you never can tell 
'Cause I really thought that I knew you well 
I still can't believe I could be deceived so easily 
Are all these wishes I'm wishin' to myself 
Just rusty coins in a wishin' well? 
Wishes come true, they come false as well 
It's too late for you and me 
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be 

What a heartache, what a heartache, 
Love is two-faced and easy to deceive 
Oh, what a heartache, what a heartache, 
What a mistake to think I could believe 
What a heartache, what a heartache, 
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep 
Ooh, what a heartache you turned out to be 
What a heartache, what a heartache,

Dressed up and feeling good
Eyes full of stars a heart full of dreams

Struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflecting off the cars

And dreaming of a white limozeen
She wants to have a white limozeen

Well, the days to come were long and dark
And the nights were hard and cold
She met the devil in the City of Angels
But she never lost her soul

She kept her dreams close to her heart
Like a family photograph
She cried sometimes and died sometimes
But still she knows how to laugh

Dreaming of a white limozeen
Dreaming of a white limozeen

Now she's a living her dreams like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good
From the breadlines to the headlines
She's the toast of Hollywood

White limozeen

Now she's really ridin' high
She's a woman of the world
But deep inside she never changed
She's the same old down home girl

And when the airplane brings the kinfolk
To visit for awhile
There's a friendly guy in a red bow tie
To take 'em around in style

He drives 'em in a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen

When I look at you 
I melt like a candle 
You light a fire in me 
What am I to do 
I just hope I can handle 
The heat and the smoke blinding me 

This feeling, this fire 
This burning desire 
Is raging its way through my soul 
And if you feel the same 
Help me fan the flames 
'Til we're burning out of control 

Burning to know you 
Burning to show you 
And I've felt this way from the start 
Burning with passion 
I do hope it's lasting 
And it's burning a hole in my heart 

You kindle in me 
A warm glowing feeling 
A spark and a flicker of hope 
It's more than a game 
And like moths to a flame 
We're drawn to its warmth and its glow 

These embers of love 
Are fueled by the notion 
This could be an eternal flame 
Consumed by the blaze 
I fear it's too late 
'Cause this torch that I hold bears your name 

Oh, and I'm burning to know you 
Burning to hold you 
It's grown to a flame from a spark 
Burning with passion 
I do hope it's lasting 
And it's burning a hole in my heart

I can't believe 
That I've been such a fool 
I thought this time 
I might find 
Someone who would play by the rules 

My mind said no 
But my heart said go 
And again I've made the wrong turn 
Now here I stand 
My heart in your hands... 
And I've gone from burning to burned 

Ah, you'd think by now 
I'd know how 
To keep this heart of mine safe 
It goes to show 
You just never know 
Who can you trust these days 

How could I make 
The same mistake 
But as far as I'm concerned 
Got myself to blame 
Got to close to the flame 
Now I've gone from burning to burned 

Everyone knows 
The old saying goes 
That a fool in love 
Never learns 
But I guess I forgot 
'Cause the fire was too hot... 
Now I've gone from burning to burned 

Oh I guess I forgot 
'Cause the fire was too hot... 
Now I've gone from burning to burned

With this high society 
These high fallutin' people 
Don't know what to make of me 
I feel like a minnow in a sea of Moby Dicks 
A small fry in a big pan 
They're caviar -- I'm fish sticks 

Fish out of water 
I know I don't belong 
Fish out of water 
Everything I do is wrong 
My style of hair, the clothes I wear 
The way I speak, the things I eat 
The way I act, my lack of tact 
Nothin' seems to fit 
Fish out of water 
Flounderin' round 
Out of my element 

But I'm just as good as they are 
Why do I feel second rate 
It's like, ""Sorry Charlie, 
We want only tuna with good taste"" 
I guess you could say Wal-Mart 
Is quite a way from Gucci's 
I'm Timex, they're Rolex

A catfish in a goldfish bowl

Save me, save me 
Somebody rescue me

Somebody throw me in 
Fish out of water 
On a scale of one to ten 
I'm a two, perhaps a three 
Compared to the big fish in the sea 
I'm washed ashore so save me please 
I'm in an awful fix

Spotlight's on, it's shining bright 
And I like standin' in it 
It's only superficial light 
But I don't want to end it 
It's warmth and glow has taken hold 
And I'm caught uup in it's shine 
A Cinderella fairy tale 
I want to claim as mine 

Fancy clothes, a magic coach 
And happy ever after 
Like something from a story book 
The Cinderella chapter 
But when the clock strikes midnight 
And I lie awake in bed 
Things my Daddy told me 
Keep running through my head 

You gotta walk the straight and narrow 
And to thine own self be true 
Gotta aim straight as an arrow 
All eyes are up on you 
But sometimes it feels so good 
That I can almost justify 
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie 
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie 

Is it wrong for me to want 
The sweeter grass that's greener? 
To chase the all-American dream 
I've always been a dreamer 
At the top and still I've got 
A heavy heart inside 
I keep remembering 
Things my Daddy told me as a child 

You gotta walk the striaght and narrow 
Gotta hold fast to the right 
Gotta aim straight as an arrow 
Walk onward toward the light 
Oh, but when I'm out there in it 
I think I might get by 
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie 
But I don't feel right livin' a lie 
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie 

All the fame and fortune 
Glory and prestige 
Can't make me happy if it goes 
Against what I believe 
And I've sacrificed my honor 
My values and my pride 
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie 
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie 
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie

'Cause I like to know just where I stand
I don't like guessing games
And I hate a bunch of gibberish
So just spit it out real plain

Don't use big educated words

Don't try bossing me

Straight talk, straight talk
Turn loose and let it go
You can tell me anything
Just like on Oprah's show

Just tell me how you really feel
Be on the up and up
With questions I can understand
For answers you can trust

Pick up the 'phone, you're not alone
We've all got something to say
So listen in and listen up
We'll find a better way

With honesty and common sense
It's really hard to miss
Straight talk, straight talk
Just tellin' it like it is

Straight talk, straight talk
There's nothing like the truth
Just tell me all your troubles
Pretend I'm Donahue

So don't be shy, 'cause we can talk
You know you've got a friend
Call me, call me
For simple straight talkin'

What's cookin', America?
Straight talk, Straight talk
Straight talk, Straight talk

So come on let's talk turkey
Just straight and to the point
About passions, about problems
About noses out of joint

Now I want you all to know
I care and I do understand
And hey, thanks for lending me an ear
Out there in radio land

Give me some straight talk, straight talk
Don't sugar coat it please

Sounds sweet enough to me

But don't talk to me in circles
In your mumbo-jumbo jive

Trapped in the suburbs of wonderland, lost in her own fantasy
Somehow my heart never grew up, no one ever burst my balloon
So here I am swirling in star dust, slow dancin' with the moon

Still believe someday my wildest dreams will all come true
And I'll find someone who'll make me 15 again

But I'll never stop believing in your smile

You were the best thing in my life I can recall 
You and me, we had it all 

I know that we could never get that far again 
So I let these memories take me on back to where we've been 
And I stay there with you just as long as I can 
Oh it was so good, it really was 
It was so good, oh oh

We'll sing in the sunshine 
We'll laugh every day 
We'll sing in the sunshine 
And I'll be on my way 

I will never love you 
The cost of love's too dear 
But though I'll never love you 
I'll live with you one year 

And we will sing in the sunshine 
We'll laugh every day 
We'll sing in the sunshine 
And I'll be on my way 

I'll sing to you each morning 
I'll kiss you every night 
But darlin', don't cling to me 
I'll soon be out of sight 

But we can sing in the sunshine 
We'll laugh every day 
We'll sing in the sunshine 
And I'll be on my way 

My daddy he once told me 
Hey, don't you love you any man 
Just take what they can give you 
And give but what you can 

And you can sing in the sunshine 
We'll laugh every day 
We'll sing in the sunshine 
And I'll be on my way 

And when our year has ended 
And I have gone away 
I'll often speak about you 
And this is what I'll say 

You know we sang in the sunshine 
We laughed every day 
We sang in the sunshine 
Then I went on my way

The dirt was clay and was the color of the blood in me
A twelve acre farm on a ridge is southern Tennessee
We left that sweat all over that land behind a mule we watched grow old
Row after row trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't
Grow
There was one old store in the hollow we all called town
It belonged to a gentle old man named Henry Brown
He gave us credit in the wintertime so we could live through the cold when the
Wind brought snow
Trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
The one I loved walked through those fields with me
She was a hard working woman true as one could be
But then one year death was going 'round and swiftly took it's toll
Janie had to go
Now she lies asleep under ground so poor that grass won't grow
As I stand here looking over this part of Tennessee
The fields are bare as far as the eye can see
And over the grave where Janie lies there's a beautiful sight to behold
And no one knows why there's flowers blooming on ground so poor that grass
Won't grow



",Where Grass Won't Grow,1994
Dolly Parton,"I wanna feel this way
Longer than time
I wanna know your dreams
And make them mine
I wanna change the world

I wanna kiss your smile
And feel your pain
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
Here in a world of lies
You are the true

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you

When you tell me that you love me

I wanna make you see
Just what I was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everything's easy now
I have you here

Who is sailing all over the sea
And I'm thinking tonight of him only
And I wonder does he ever think of me

Could been better for us both had we never
In this wide wicked world had never met
For the pain and the pleasures he's brought me
I am sure I will never forget

So I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes...

Oh you told me once dear that you love me
And you swore that we never would part
But a linking the chain has been broken
Leaving me with a sad broken heart

Yes I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes
And I wonder does he ever think of me

Someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Well, I might try to be
Your friend again
But your restless heart
And rovin' eyes
My jealousy, these endless fights
I've got to get out of your life
Or I will never mend

I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And I don't have the heart to
Stay, and I can't take the pain
I know we've tried to no avail
Our heaven now has
Turned to hell
The same old hurt
We know so well
And something's got
To change

We both know it's got to end
The passion's gone
It's just pretend
And one of us have got
To make the move
We might as well just give it up
We've lost respect and
There's no trust
And without this, there's
No real love
It's just some sad excuse

I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And there's nothing left but walk away
Ain't this a crying shame
A change of pace
A change of heart
A change of place
A place to start
And we'll be better off apart
Our only chance is change

And we never wil
But something has to change

But someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Then I will try to be your friend again

That uproots the harvest and hurls it away

I've tried and I've tried for so long to please you 
Gave you every bit of my time 
Gave you everything I could possibly give you 
My body, my heart, and my mind 
I turned my family and good friends against me 
Listened to my own heart break 
And I did it all in the name of love 
Gave up myself for your sake 

And you never cared about me 
You only hurt and deceive 
I realize after all of these years 
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears 

You've cheated, you've lied and you've hurt me 
Over and over again 
You promised to love me forever 
But forever reached a bitter sweet end 
Been blinded by love to your actions 
But at last I can see my way clear 
I've cried and I've tried, and I've tried and I've cried 
But you, you've never shed one tear

Perhaps he has stopped at the store 
It's a great big store full of bottles 
And I wish he wouldn't go there anymore 

So out in the night with the baby 
Her little heart beating with pride 
'Til her tired feet entered the gin palace 
With music all radiant with light 

Oh daddy she cried as she reached him 
I think that the music's so sweet 
But it's almost suppertime daddy 
Little blossom wants something to eat 

A moment his blurred eyes gazed wildly 
Down into her face sweet and fair 
And as the demon possessed him 
He grasped at the back of a chair 

A moment a second was over 
He lifted her fair golden head 
A moment the baby's left trembled 
Then poor little blossom was dead",Little Blossom,1999

To someone who is just like you
The day I fall in love

That the bells will ring
The birds will sing
The skies will open
I wonder where's that great big symphony
Roll over Beethoven
Won't you play with me

Unless it's you

That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in it's own way

Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day

Riding this run down track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back

Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown

Faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Flora Grey
The gossip of Madison County died with child
And although your skin was black
You were the one that didn`t turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

Reuben James
With your mind on my soul and a Bible in your right hand
You said ""turn the other cheek
A-there`s a better world a-waiting for the meek""
In my mind these words remain from Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed field of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Reuben Jame
One dark, cloudy day they brought you from the field
Until your lonely pinebox came
Just a preacher and me in the rain
Just to sing one last refrain for Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed field of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed field of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James",Reuben James,2001
Dolly Parton,"You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair,
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down,
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war,
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore,
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be,
Oh Ruby, I still need some company.

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed,
And the wants and needs of a woman your age really I realize,
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around,
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.

She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door,
The way I know I heard its slams one hundred times before,
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground,
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.

Oh Ruby, for God's sake, turn around","Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town",2001
Dolly Parton,"Sunshine, you may find my window
But you won't find me
And sunshine, I've got my friend of darkness here
Tonight to hide me.

So sunshine, as far as I'm concerned
I'm where I want to be
And sunshine, as far as you're concerned
Don't be concerned for me.

Cause she doesn't love me anymore
She doesn't want me, Lord
She doesn't need me anymore
She grew tired of chasing rainbows
But I loved her true
And God you know I tried.

And I guess she was right
Cause I'm at the end
I found the part but there's no golden sun.

So sunshine, can't you see I'm not alone
Don't bother me
And sunshine, pick up your dawn
And move on down the street.",Sunshine,2001
Dolly Parton,"Last night, my tears they were fallin' 
I went to bed so sad and blue 
Then I had a dream of you 
I dreamed I was strollin' in the evenin' 
Underneath the harvest moon 
I was thinkin' about you 
And then you met me in the moonlight 
The stars were shining in your eyes 
But another was there too 
I don't believe you've met my baby 
You looked at her, you looked at me 
I wondered who you were talkin' to 

I shook the hand of your stranger 
But I was shaking more inside 
'Cause I was still wonderin' who 
Your arm was restin' on her shoulder 
You smiled at her, she smiled at you 
Her eyes were filled with victory 
She said my brother wants to marry 
And then my heart was filled with ease 
I knew that you would marry me 

Oh, I don't believe you've met my baby 
You looked at her, you looked at me 
I knew that you would marry me 
I don't believe you've met my baby",I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby,2001
Dolly Parton,"I get no kick from champagne 
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at'all 
So tell me why should it be true? 
That I get a kick out of you 
Some people go for cocaine 
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff 
That would bore me terrifically too 
Still I get a kick out of you 

I get a kick every time I see you 
Standin' there before me 
I get a kick though it's clear to see 
You obviously don't adore me, aww 

I get no kick in a plane 
Flying too high with some guy in the sky 
Is my idea of nothin' to do 
Still I get a kick out of you 
Yes I get a kick out of you",I Get a Kick Out of You,2001
Dolly Parton,"There's a land that is fairer than day 
And by faith we can see it afar 
For the Father waits over the way 
To prepare us a dwelling place there

[Chorus:]
In the sweet by and by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore 
In the sweet by and by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore 

We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
The melodious songs of the blessed 
And our spirit shall sorrow no more 
Not a sign for the blessing of rest

In the sweet by and by, oh",In the Sweet By and By,2001
Dolly Parton,"There are stars in the southern sky 
Southward as you go 
There is moonlight and moss in the trees 
Down the seven bridges road 
I have loved you like a baby 
Like some lonesome child 
I have loved you in a tame way 
And I have loved you wild 
Sometimes there is a part of me 
Has to turn from here and go 
Runnin' like a child from these warm stars 
Down the seven bridges road 

There are stars in the southern sky 
And if ever you decide you should go 
There is a taste of time sweet as honey 
Down the seven bridges road 
There are stars in the southern sky 
Southward as you go 
There is moonlight and moss in the trees 
Down the seven bridges road

Dolly Parton,"As you walk away 
As we say good-bye 
What I wouldn't give 
For a tender lie 
Say you'll never stop loving me 
Just as if it were true 
How much more damage now honestly 
Could one tender lie do? 
When we fall so far 
Are we wrong to try? 
To keep out the truth 
With a tender lie 
Say you're gonna come back to me 
And I'll believe that it's true 
How much more damage now honestly 
Could one tender lie do?

Dolly Parton,"There is a diamond inside of me 
That lights up the sky of my soul
Where fell the diamond when I believed 
That all of the hurt was my fault

[Chorus:]
I'm opening the heart door
Letting in the light
Opening the heart door
And giving life to me that died

You ended up so with that person 
Who comes home too late from the bar
I ended up so when my courage 
Could finally walk on its own
When I finally opened the door

You ended up so with that person 
Who comes home too late from the bar

Could finally walk on its own

Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)

Some chewing gum and candy, some magazines and snacks, 
Some startin' over money that I've been holdin' back, 
A change of clothes and notepad to write a letter back to say so long 
A one-way ticket sayin' good-bye to everything 
Threw my weddin' band out the window of the train 
All I want's my freedom, reclaim my maiden name 
I'm movin' on 'cause I'm gone 

You can tell the truth or you can lie 
You can say I left you or I died 
Say I'm in the Himalayas on some spiritual quest 
And could spend years lookin' for the light 
Say I'm in the witness program with the F.B.I., 
Say a U.F.O. abducted me from home 
You can say what you chose, but I tell you the truth 
You can say for sure I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone 

You think that you're above me, like I'm not good enough 
You make me feel unwanted, unwelcome and unloved 
You're selfish, vain and greedy; you're hateful, rude and rough 
And you're so wrong 
But you'd rather live unhappy and tolerate the pain 
Than separate and have me takin' half of everything 
Well, I'm leavin' your possessions, left on the good-bye train, 
Left you alone 'cause I'm gone 

You can have the house, the car, the boat, 
My records, books and stereo, 
The dog and the cat, my ceramic shop out back, 
My doll collection and my clothes 
You can keep all our friends and all the pictures in the den, 
And the fluffy pillows you sleep on 
But when you lay your head on that big feather bed 
You can rest assured I'll be gone; I'll be gone 

You can tell the truth or you can lie 
You can say I left or I died 
Say I'm in the Himalayas on some spiritual quest 
And could spend years lookin' for the light 
Say I'm in the witness program with the F.B.I. 
Say a U.F.O. abducted me from home 
Well, you can say what you chose, but I tell you the truth 
You can say for sure I'm gone 
You can say what you like, but I'll tell you twice 
You can say for sure, say for sure I'm gone, gone 

Some chewing gum and candy, magazines and snacks, 
Startin' over money I've been holding back, 
Change of clothes and notepad to write a letter back to say so long 
I got a one-way ticket sayin' good-bye to everything 
I threw my weddin' band out of the window of the train 
All I want's my freedom, reclaim my maiden name 
I'm moving on 'cause I'm gone 
Oh, I'm gone, gone, gone; I'm gone 
I'm so gone, I'm gone; gone, I'm gone

Dolly Parton,"If a picture paints a thousand words, 
Then why can´t I paint you? 
The words will never show 
The you I´ve come to know 

If a face could launch a thousand ships, 
Then where am I to go? 
There´s no one home but you, 
You´re all that´s left me too 

And when my love for life is running dry, 
You come and pour yourself on me 
If I could be two places at one time, 
I´d be with you 

Tomorrow and today, 
Beside you all the way 
If the world should stop revolving 
Spinning slowly down to die, 

I´d spend the end with you 
And when the world was through, 
Then one by one the stars would all go out, 
Then you and I would simply fly away 

If a picture paints a thousand words, 
Then why can´t I paint you? 
'Cause the words could never show 
The you I´ve come to know 

And one by one the stars will all go out, 
But you and I will simply fly away 
We'll fly away",If,2002
