2Pac,"Welcome to the house of pain, Just Blaze niggaz 

[Intro: Mary J. Blige] 
Theres no we, it seems I can't get free 
Sombody tell me what's happenin to me 

[Notorious B.I.G.] 
The country bud got me chokin 
I'm on a mission to the point motherfuckers think I'm smokin 
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the H-shot fifth 
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit 
Don't you know that killin is thrillin 
All the blood spillin, is all up on the drug dealin 
A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug 
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug 
So when he lit shots 
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor 
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes 
Payin dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's 
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster 
Got the Mac .11's swingin from my shoulder 
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain 
I'm livin in a house of pain 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
Is anybody listenin and tell me can you can see this God be surroundin me 
Now it's gettin colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin hard to breathe 
And it's gettin blury, I'm gettin worried cause it's gettin hard to see 
When your lampin in the house of paaaiiinnn 

[2Pac] 
When the motherfucker dust kicker, who can you trust? 
Who gave you the heart to see a nigga? 
Before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue so many foes 
Bustin motherfuckers out the blocks and I ain't even go 
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame 
From doin fix to bustin tricks out the fuckin frame 
Got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block 
Jealous ass suckers got it duckin for my fuckin glock 
And bustin niggaz ass is to stay alive 
Skinny ass playa watchin victim motherfuckers fry 
They ask me how I'm livin? how I'm a hustler? 
Buckin busters ‘til they die 
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard? 
Niggaz got they AK's headin for the bird 
Aimin at free ass bitches let 'em rain 
Givin 'em, wettin 'em, welcome to the house of pain 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 

[Nas] 
MJB, be worried niggaz, yea, Nas... 

Wendy Williams say I stayed dust maybe I should 
cuz these rappers'll have your phone tap like Savion Glover 
And on the West the police corrupt, some are bloods 
But these Teflon I loaded explodin some mugs 
I'm like Furious in ""Boyz In the Hood"" 
But at the drive through I'm ain't runnin I'm dumpin 
Crazy like a paru and load up, know how Nas do 
I'm callin Henchmen to save shit, to organize a black truth 
And we party hard party wit Nas 
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras 
And Bush won't apologize 
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize 
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize 
Ya'll yellin my name but y'all soon die in 
Tryin to portray real but they be ly-in 
Cuz they want the real niggaz to die so they can game 
But neva that, this ain't neva lastin this is the house of pain 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]",Living in Pain,2005
2Pac,"Now here's the perfect niche to let it bubble and foam 
Wait these seconds then watch the microphone get blown 
It's the mischievous, lyrical genius on the loose 
And I pack the deuce deuce of some act right juice 
I'm in my own, space and time 
The elevation of my rhymes elevates your mind 
It's a clear blue sky and a clear blue day 
Foe a G from DPG to wear clear blue and gray 
I come I came, I am I ain't 
The nigga ya wants ta fuck with, get peeled like paint 
Bottoms up, nigga give it all ya got 
From the bottom to the top or get shanked get shot 
Provocative footage, of this lyrical abuse transgression 
From this infectious enemy, they on the loose 
And unstoppable, Daz 
My motherfuckin nigga from back in the past 
Now imagine yourself in a bottomless pit 
With no way your climbin out, and this ain't the punishment 
Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react 
With intentions to keep on mashin, strap to strap 
Is this my boundary from county to county? 
Your homies want to try to soak me like Bounty? 
Dogg Poung Gangsta all day all night 
Partyin like a motherfuckin now all night 
But uhh, simple as fact I been wantin to serve your whole fuckin crew 
Now whatchu want to do? (Hmm, whatchu want to do? Yeah) 
Land up your weapon slowly step in caught your homey straight slippin 
You shoulda known from the jump nigga that I was trippin 
I gets to bustin (blaow blaow) you gets to duckin (blaow blaow) 
Dogg Pound Gangsta gets to dippin in the cut 
My performance is enormous the way that I stayed up on em 
I catch em and let em have it what's up, with my opponents 
I hold it down for the two and I'll be gunned down by no one 
Forever I reign, top Dogg number one 
My rhyme ?To some inflanable? And Doggs that's untrainable 
Uncontainable, my mind state's so strainable 

I'm a D.P.G.C. For life 
I do what I feel and, I do what I like 
I'm a D.P.G.C. For life 
I do what I feel and, I do what I like 
I'm a D.P.G.C. For life 
I do what I feel and, I do what I like 
I'm a D.P.G.C. For life 
I do what I feel and, I do what I like 

I hits it like shots, from the homey strap 
I smoke indo, and I sip Cog-nac 
Give a fuck whatcha name is, I tell ya quick 
Face to face, punk you can eat a dick 
'Cause you're all out of time, out of sight 
Out of mind, somethin I wouldn't do without a nine 
I got a pocket full of papers and a trunk full of beat 
Mashin all through the streets rollin wit some heat 
I'm heated, repeat it, day after day 
Daily survival tactics in L.A. 
I'm on point and alert 
With skills like a huntin expert, fuck around and get hurt 
Lurked, I puts in work like a chemist 
Mentally known to cause motherfuckin dilemmas 
See me in black and beware 
It's a Dogg Pound Gangsta on the loose out there 
Now here's the kickoff, as I'm about to rip off 
Rage is knockin lips off, travellin like a spitball, I hit y'all 
Right between the eyes, smack dab in the middle 
With my rhymes or my riddles, ain't got no time to fiddle 
Faddle, dibble, dabble 
Gotta Rock like Fraggle 
I'm hittin so hard I'm leavin that I'm leavin em snaggled 
Like Leon Spinks this black cat's got ya jinxed 
Fuck around and you'll get chipped off like the Sphinx 
Think, about it, better yet forget it 
Uhh, play like En Vogue cause you're never gonna get it 
The style, the flavor, the flow, the so-lo-ist 
Hit you in a second, one two mic checkin 
That's my lethal weapon like a chain and ball 
I'm wreckin, shop, tech and, glock 
Not in my pocket, no need for cock and 
Gauges just flip the scripts and rippin pages Rage is 
The amazin, trail-blazin 
Flows shavin like Norelco you can't let go, hell no!

Aiy baby, aiy baby... aiy baby get some bubblegum in this motherfucker
Steady long, steady long nigga

With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin up with funky ass shit like every single day
May I, kick a little something for the G's (yeah)
and, make a few ends as (yeah!) I breeze, through
Two in the mornin and the party's still jumpin
cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the living room gettin it on
and, they ain't leavin til six in the mornin (six in the mornin)
So what you wanna do, sheeeit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what) we don't love them hoes, yeah!
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]

Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this types of shit, happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
who listens, to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
and get to mackin to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze

Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]

Later on that day
My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'

2Pac,"As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me",Murder Was the Case,2005
2Pac,"Yo be (turn your speakers up man) 
Turn your speakers up money! 
Yo God! (Yo God?) 
Yo I got mad skills. 
Isn't that money? 

[Chorus: Snoop]
New York New York big city of dreams 
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound 

[Verse One: Kurupt]
It's the incredible, the lyrical 
You can't be me like Niece, to see me is gonna take a miracle 
I'm driving motherfuckers hysterical, with a 
Touch of this twister, stylistic mixture 
What I create pulsates, there is no escape 
Annihilate your mental mind state 
Dre labels my vocabulary abusive 
I packs more knowledge than Confucius, I'm deadly 
Induce you like Medusa, with thoughts to shed 
And niggaz throughout this hemisphere, far and near 
Prepare, catch me chillin' like the winter 
Up against the number one contender, as I enter 
Cause I gets heated like friction 
Motherfuck your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction 
Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital 
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals 
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys 
To the average motherfucker's minds these days 
I'm all ready to put work in 
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin' 
Give a fuck, what's your name, what you claim 
Or why you came, motherfucker don't explain 
Simply, don't tempt me, cause I'm simply 
Layin' hoes lifes empty, the invincible MC 

[Chorus One]
[Chorus Two: Snoop]
Too much, I serve too many people, too much 
It's too much, I serve too many people 
And when I finish servin' ain't gon' be no sequel 

[Chorus One and Two]

[Verse Two: Kurupt]
Gimme a couple G's, for every MC, I knocked to his knees 
Verbally useless, oh you got the juice? I squeeze you juiceless 
The barbaric, versatile, you're no kin to me 
So how the fuck you inherit my style? 
Now, out the clear blue sky, I can't deny 
Not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why 
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones 
Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis 
Gets me into verbally vindictive 
Violent vocabulary bobs to existence 
Catch me in the pitch black path 
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental 
Till I hear an instrumental 
And detrimental verbals get to spittin' 
The highest in intellect, try connectin' with the written 
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen 
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war 
Dips like a low-low, with my verbal fo'-fo' 
The cocoa complexion MC with the slow flow 
Fo sho', I takes it to you from the do' 
Motherfucker, mentally I go hardco' (you know!) 
I disconnect ya, Kurupter, MC to vocally 
Bore your whole molecular, structure 
Catastrophic, mystic as Mixelplix 
Hittin MC's like picks the deadliest lyricist 

[Chorus One and Two:Repeat x2]

[Kurupt] 
We live, tonight I serve two thousand MC's 
We live, cause can't none fuck with the DPG'z 

[Daz] 
We live (baby) because tonight I serve two thousand MC's 
We live (baby) none can fuck with the DPG'z 

[Snoop] 
DPGC, ba-by 
ABC the DPG'z 
Ba-by

[Verse Three: Kurupt]
Everyday, I bust rhymes and recite 
In ways that make MC's stop in daylight 
I'm the deadlies MC you want to see on the streets 
Invincibility is what makes me complete, compete 
Nah you can't even fade me 
I fuck, you, your momma, your auntie, and your lady",New York,2005

At the same muthafuckin' time 
Ya'll niggas about to feel this

Bombin' hooties with percision

To help my fuckin' homie 
You's a cold ass nigga on them all 

Sure enough I keep my hand on my gun 
Cause they got me on the run

Free tupac is all that's on a niggas mind 
But at the same time 
It seem they tryin' to take mine 
So I am get smart and get the best of this shit 
And put together a million march plus some gangsta shit

And I think I got a black beama' 
But my dream is to own a fly casino 
Like bugsy segal, and do it all illegal 
And get scooped up, by the little homie in a regal

Who can fade the thugs? 
You thought it was but it wasn't 
Now disappear 
Bow down in the presence of a boss playa 

It's like 'cause, blood, gang banging 
Everybody in the party doing dope slangin' 
You got to have papers in this world 
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl 
Ya doing ya job 
Every day 
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray 
Let me tell you about life and 'bout the way it is 
See we live by the gun so we die by the blood of kids 

They tell me not to roll with my glock 
So now I got to throw away 
Floating in the black benz 
Trying to do a show a day 
They wonder how I live with 5 shots 
Niggas is hard to kill on my block 
Scheme for currency and dough related 
Affilliated with the hustlas 
So we made it

2Pac,"You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

2Pac,"Woke up one morning out some bomb ass cock
My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone, floatin on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto', so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Seven, eight, nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the hoe out
I fixed me some food, then go the hell out
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg!)
(And you never gave a fuck about a bitch;
'Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay

(take money) Yeah, I'ma do this track
West side!!
(take money) MOB, Bad Boy killers
(take money) Hahahaha, hey fat boy...
(take money)

Verse One: 2Pac
First off, touch your chick and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I bust your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, brothers touch for life
Plus Puffy trying to see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass tricks
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Little Ceaser, go ask your homie how I'll leave you
Cut your trick ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil Kim, don't play around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly hair off the streets
You Little weave! I'll let them suckas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride the night haha
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Mess with me and get your caps peeled
You know ... see ...

Chorus:
Grab ya Glocks, when you see 2Pac
Call the cops, when you see 2Pac, uhh
Who shot me, but ya punks didn't finish
Now ya bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Busta, I hit em' up...

Interlude: 2Pac
Yeah, straight out on the Bad Boy camp
You know how we do it
All my real homeboys in New York keep thuggin'
All the rest of you bustas die slow!

Verse Two: Fatal
Get out the way yo, Hussein Fatal
Biggie Smallz just got dropped
Little Moo, pass the Mac, and let me hit him in his back
Frank White need to get spanked right, for settin traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard-a ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin ya
Spank ya shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank, cause I'ma slam you ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than a block I run on you
And I'll smoke ya junior mafia in front of you
With the ready power tuckin my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Ya clout, pretty sour I get packages every hour
And hit em up

Chorus
Grab ya Glocks, when you see 2Pac
Call the cops, when you see 2Pac, uhh
Who shot me, but ya punks didn't finish
Now ya bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Busta, we hit em' up...

Verse Three: 2Pac
Peep how we do it, keep it real, it's penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle, all you suckers gettin
Killed with ya mouths open
Tryin to come up offa me, you in the clouds hoping
Smokin dope it's like a sherm high
Brothers think they learned to fly
But they burn little suckers, you deserve to die
Talkin bout you gettin money, but its funny to me
All you suckers living bummy, why you're messin' with me
I'm a self made milionare
Thug Livin out a prison, pistols in the air, hahaha
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on tha couch
And beg the trick to let you sleep in the house, ahh
Now its all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it, and smiled
Now I'm bout to set the record straight, with my AK
I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Little busta, I hit em up

Verse Four: Kadafi
I'm from N-E-W Jerz, where plenty murders occur
No point to comment , we bringin drama to all you herbs
Knuckle check the scenario, Little Cease
I bring you fake G's to your knees
Coppin pleas in de janeiro
Big Momma, is you coked up, or doped up?
Get ya lil Junior whopper clique smoked up, Please tell me
Is you STUPID?!?! I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my clique lootin, shootin and pollutin ya block
With 15 shots cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw mafia clique movin up another notch
And you bast stops squaws get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass east coast props brainstormed and locked

Verse Five: Idi Amin
You is a, b writer, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to ya face you ain't nothin' but a faker
Softer than Alizee with a chaser
Bout to get murdered for the paper
Idi Amin approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Prodigy in a choke hold
Totin smoke, Outlawz we ain't no joke
Thug Life, cowards betta be known, we approachin
In the wide open, guns smokin
No need for hopin its a battle lost, I got em crossed
Soon as the funk is poppin off
HAHA I hit em up

2Pac,"Every night - a different town - I sing my song
I play and sing - pack my things and move along

A pretty face, another place I never get to know
A one night stand, another show

My guitar - a railroad car - a bus or plane
Chocolate bar - and there you are - the price of fame

If I could do what I want to, I'd stay and never go
A one night stand is all I know

I wish that I could be two people
Instead of bein' on my own
I wish that I could be two people
And then I'd never be alone

Photographs of where I've been and all I've done
In this whole world - is there a girl - no, not one

Goodbye, hello - I've got to go - I hope you understand
A one night man is all I am
A one night stand, a one night man.

Doo doo doo...
Goodbye, hello - I've got to go - I hope you understand
A one night man is all I am
A one night stand, a one night man

One nation... twenty-one gun salute

[Chorus]
I'm hopin my true mothafuckaz know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke

21 gun salute, dressed in fatigue, black jeans and boots
disappeared in the crap, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas thinks he live like me
Talkin bout how he left the hospital took five like me
You living fanatasies, nigga I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now we out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why nigga blowed them out
Next time grown folks talk, nigga close your mouths
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
I see too many real playas fall to let these bitch niggaz to beat me
Puffy, lets be honest you a punk
or you gonna see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said in vibe about me being a Thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But, you and I know what's going on
Pay back I knew you bitch niggaz from way back
Witness me strapped with macs knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas looking like, Larry Holmes flabby and shit
Trying to playa hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known this is how you made me
Love it how I got you niggaz goin crazy, against all odds

[Chorus x2]

I heard he was light skined, stocky with a haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashing (what's his name)
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale, about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was working for the feds, same crime different trail
Niggas picture what he said, and did I mention
Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchmen, in due time
I knew you bitch niggaz was listening, The World is Mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggaz stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine on everything I own
I'll destroy everything you touch, play the game nigga
All out warfare, Eye For An Eye
Last words to a bitch nigga, why you lie?
Now you gotta watch your back nigga, watch your front
Here we come gunshots to deck, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game nigga, nigga This M.O.B
So believe me, we enemies, I go, against all odds

[Chorus x2]

Puffy gettin robbed like a bitch, to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldn't have did
So we ride em for that
And that nigga that was down for me
Restin dead, switch sides
Guess his new friends want him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend or even the dead
Lord listen to me
God don't like ugly It Was Written
Hey Nas your whole damn style is weak
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-in with authorities, felonious capers
Now you want to live my life, so what's the deal
Niggaz that don't ride right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie, you die, goodbye
Let the real life niggaz hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me (nigga), against all odds

You don't want to fuck with me 
Got the police bustin' at me 
But they can't do nothin' to a G 
(Let's get ready to rumble) 

Now you know how we do it like a G 
What really go on in the mind of a nigga 
Got the police bustin' at me 
But they can't do notin' to a G 

That get down for theirs 
I constantly choose money over bitches 

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah 
You don't want to fuck with me 
Stay on your grind nigga 
Got the police bustin' at me 
But they can't do nothin' to a G 

My ambitions as a ridah 
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah 
You don't want to fuck with me 
My ambitions as a ridah 
Got the police bustin' at me... 

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars 
'Cause life as a rap star is not'hin without heart 
Was born ruff and rugged, addressin' the mad public 
My attitude was 'fuck it' cause motherfuckers love it 

To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease 
Though life is complicated, only what you make it be 
Uhh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her 
while she hot and horny, go up inside her 

Then I spit some game in her ear, 'Go to the tele hoe' 
You put what money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke 
I'm smokin' bomb ass weed feelin' crucial 
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual 

From hustlin' them bread, to breakin' motherfuckers to payin' 
I got no time for these bitches cause these hoes tried to play us 
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil, so I'm wishin' 
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin' (boo-yaa!)

I'm a ride though, clown hoes like it's mandatory 
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted 
Now it's on and it's on because I said so 
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row 

Now these money hungry bitches gettin' suspicious 
Started plotin' and planin' on scemes to come and trick us 
But Thug niggas be on point and game tight (yeah) 
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night 

Got problems then handle it motherfuckers see me 
These niggas is jealous cause deep in they hearts they want to be me 
Uhh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya 
Hopin' ya listen I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah 

[Chorus]

(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah) 
It was my only wish to rise 
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise 
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine 

I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfucker they life 
That's what they screaming as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill 
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel 
Spittin at adversaries envious and after me 

I'd rather die before they catchin' me, watch me bleed 
Mama corrected me I'm suicidal thinkin' thoughts 
I'm innocent, said there will be bullets flyin' when I'm caught 
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice 

Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson 
Thuggin' for life and if you right then nigga die for it 
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it 
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave 
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah 

[Chorus] 

My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me 
Pay off the block evade the cops cause I know they comin' for me 
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years 
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears 

Question my methods to switchin' keys, sure as some bitches bleeds 
Niggas will feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed 
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers 
So now I'm back to be a motherfucking menace, they cowards 

That's why they tried to set me up 
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team, so indeed, they wet me up 
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated 
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it 

Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary 
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been) 
gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it 
Knowin' when I get out, they gonna feel it 

Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside 
Then cry from all your people when they find her 
Just remind ya, my history will prove I been it, revenge on them niggas 
that played me, and all the cowards that was down with it 

Now it's your nigga right beside ya 
Hopin' ya listenin' I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss, on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how you want it (Tell me how you want it)

Did you think I come to talk am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic
Ironic 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'ma rider in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alize, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggas play these Cali days
You'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggas top that
They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in Hell, only a few of us'll live to tell

Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, SkyPager
Gang rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetary
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'mma mash out, and peel out
I'm with it quick that's quick to whip that fuckin' steel out

2Pac,"I couldn't help but notice your pain
My pain?
It runs deep; share it with me!

They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker; who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb ‘cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me; what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family; what else could I do
But be a thug? Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club!
Got my mind on danger; never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive bys
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin back to court, so fuck what you thought!
I'm drinkin' Hennessey, runnin' from my enemies
Will I live to be 23? There's so much pain

Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

Years and years of that rough life
Runnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife
And livin' trifed on the regular, buckin' out competitors
See 'em fake a move and chase them down
Like the fuckin' Predator
Get in trouble everyday in school, act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin' off for the bitches, ‘cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop, pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo, currency kept passing me by, but I didn't cry, broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke
And now the money's looking lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game, it's all the same
I kick it back, yo; give 'em slack, yo
And now they label me the mack, yo, people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
You know you get your ass twisted, so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust
So if you're on, nigga, look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game
And my mama always cryin', yo, there's so much pain

Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

They got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed, ready to get my slug on
And I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust – I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me
Bust – on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck, ‘cause I ain't looking when I'm blastin'
I'm a nut, and drinkin' Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
Tell me why, ‘cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep
I'm real they cannot see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother I'm trapped, I'm kickin' dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene, steady muggin' mean until they kill me
I'll be livin this life, I know you feel me; there's so much pain

Ohhh

While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried

Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfucker's die

We had no intentions of becoming homies
But at no time at all, you became my dog
You showed me how to roll blunts, we used to bounce and ball
I was living on wilshire in the penthouse suites
Had my lil' cousin daz hook you up with some beats
It was outlaw, dogg pound, death row records, man we tore up the town
Snoop dogg and dr. Dre and now we got Pac, it felt like a drizzeam
Remember when I told suge to put you on the tizzeam
And you know that I was true
Cause I took the focus off of me to put 'all eyez on you'
And we became the most hunted together, '2 of amerikaz most wanted'

So get your mind on official business
You can be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave
So get paid
My niggaz do this every fuckin' day
We parlay
Through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggaz in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction
What's needed is unification
Cause the world ain't hardly scared
If not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares it's there to share
All we get is stares
Because of fear we'll evaporate
Say your prayers

And what's next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

(Aye its on A3)
Makaveli tried to warn us
But niggaz ain't listen to Pac
Naw (listen listen) nigga really listen to Pac
Shit yean got it yet (no)
Then you won't get it
Might as well measure 'em up
And have his ass fitted
Why
Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane
Never will change niggaz wit' no name no shame
Might open ya head foe mess broke change
I stay posted like a flag (flag)
Starin' through my rear view ballin' in a jag (jag)
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now
Time foe a change
Real niggaz rollin' wit' me
Money makin' swift decision we controllin' the streets
Side track by the broads and the frauds
Ain't it strange
It's the reason so many niggaz get scarred in the game

That money gotta make it
What I gotta do to make it
Do I really gotta take it
Put this mack up to you face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive
Just ask Kweli doin' what we do to get by
Some niggaz stick to the crime
Pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck we s'pose to do
Who gon' give us a job
So I tried and tried
Tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin' me back
Fiends kept on callin' for crack
So I supply 'em wit' that
Gave 'em a reasonable fee
Nigga don't blame it on me
Shit just look where I'm at
Niggaz in gardens
LAPD is the target
Niggaz is heartless hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin

Hard livin' got me goin' insane

2Pac,"Everyday it's been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle, cause that's how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block, to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On yo' block you prolly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B.I., ya homeboys from knee, high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dogg, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was Creepy, if Black June could see me
He'd be tripping, and I'd bet he still try to tease me

My block, we probably done it all homey believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

On my block, we duck the nigga, haters and the cops
Fuck a hotrod, we race Impalas, chromed, out
On my block, it ain't no different than the next block
Ya get drunk and pass out, and they back ya to the house
And when you wake up on the couch you going right back at it
On my block when ya that fucked up they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my Mama goes
Back inside ,, then we can fire
Pass it around a few times to get high

Cause if ya told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once ya mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set yo' ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets shell, shocked
Who never quite got right, now they inhale rocks
On my block, , it's like the world don't exist

2Pac,"Late night coolin' with my homies
Drinkin' Hennessey an' cold brew
After smokin' stopped in Oakland
Got the munchies for some soul food

So we stopped to get a bite to eat
At the local barbecue
It's just another borin' Monday
An' there's nothin' else to do

Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fightin'
So I turned to look and find out
What's the cause of this excitement

One brother was a dopefiend
And the other was a dopeman
And the dopeman had a AK
Said he'll spray an' he's not jokin'

Well, it seems to be the dopefiend
Owed the dopeman for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
He would end up gettin' shot up

Now I could not walk away
'Cause I got caught up in the scene
Wonderin' what would happen
To this poor and helpless fiend

Well, my homie Michael Cooley
Said let's go and make our order
What's the use in watchin' two men
Stand out here fight over quarters

Well, I walked inside the diner
And all the dopefiends waved to me
Heard the sound of several gunshots
And I ran outside to see

(What's goin' on?)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another siren rings
(What's goin' on?)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on?)

'Cause another innocent dies

All the people in the diner
Ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
For them to see just who they would know

But for me I held concern
I wanted to go see the outcome
Would a mother have a son tonight
Or would she live her life without one?

I made it to the streets
I almost cried right on the spot
Not only had the fiend died
But a small girl had been shot

My heart could take no more
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddy's bullet
But she took it in his place

Tried to make way through the crowd
So I could go help the baby
She could barely speak but she whispered
""Mister, can you please save me?""

So I screamed out, ""Someone help me""
But I don't think they could hear
And if they did they didn't care
Oh, how I hated everyone there

The baby lie here dyin'
And I wondered what could I do
The cameraman and newspapers
Had come to get their interviews

To them it's just story
And they can't see the tragedy
To them it doesn't matter
'Cause hey, it wasn't their family

I don't think I'll be back
'Cause it'll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
And leave the scene the way I came here

Though some people say it's crazy
And the food could have been finer
I'll never forget
Never forget the night at Dopefiend's Diner

2Pac,"Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out mansion in paradise
In the sky

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm coming from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream, ""Peace,"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out mansion in paradise
In the sky

Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'

I love you

You are appreciated

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
(I know it ain't easy)
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
(Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slanging
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Don't you know I love you?

(Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you 
Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

I appreciate you
I love you
I need you
Oh mama
I love you
Appreciate you
I need you
Oh mama

I appreciate you
I love you
I need you
Oh mama
I love you
Appreciate you
I need you

2Pac,"Come on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor & even worse I'm black

My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares

One less ugly mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope & let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said

2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes

Learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids

But things changed, and that's the way it is

Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted

Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'Cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other

And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks

But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you

You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today"" But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid. "" I gotta get paid,""
Well hey, well that's the way it is

Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

We gotta make a change...
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other.
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive.

And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets & the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me

And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the blacks givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,
Crack you up and pimp slap you up

You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this

That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back

'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh",Changes,2007
2Pac,"Resist the temptation of the beast
You'll slip and lose your grip and forever fall asleep
The venom is contagious, beware of its spell
What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell

I wonder if she knows the devil's taken off her clothes
Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control
Poppas doing worse, a victim of the deadly curse
Wouldn't be the first to leave the ghetto in a hearse and oh, how it hurts

The children pay the biggest price
Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life
Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap
Someone's at the top supplying us with much crack

Keep them in a daze, don't let them see the other way
Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day
See they never got a breath of the sunshine
Now the kids addicted and only hit it one time
We are destined to be dead as a nation
Don't let it come to this, resist the temptation

Gamble for your soul with the devil
You wonder how low can you go before you reach the lowest level
As everybody sits and stares
There's no use looking in you eyes ?cause there isn't anybody there

And though it may make you wanna cry
Got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why
I guess you think they will understand
You feel cold ?cause you sold your soul to the dope-man

Now there's no turning back, in fact
It's decided that would live and die for the crack
You got no friends ?cause you cheated them all
You feel lonely, low, defeated and small

No one was there when I took the wrong path
And nobody cared if I died in a blood bath
But is this my destiny?
Tell the Lord they got my mind but he can have the rest of me

'Cause I'm ready to end it all
One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all
I didn't mean to be a bother
A failure as a son, a husband and a father

I wish I could turn back the time
Go back and let it find why I let it crack my mind
And my only explanation, it came to this

2Pac,"(What y'all want?)
Unconditional Love (no doubt)
Talking bout the stuff that don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm a still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love

[Verse One:]
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live
This life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama I got this urge to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes
Before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it
A player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try
Maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare
S*** with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it
The fighting and the hurting
In my room crying cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried bout a damn thing, with unconditional love

[Chorus: 2x]
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

[Verse Two:]
Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
Cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation
If could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make somethin' out of nothing
No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
If they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing
Sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)

[Chorus]

[Verse Three:]
I'll probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency
I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters
Cause after all the lights and screams
Nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days
Maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry
Cause everything gonna be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry bout a thing baby
Girl I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love

For all my niggas in the hood,
Livin' the life of a ghetto star.
Ha, ha, ha, Makavelli...

Just holla my name
And witness game official.
Niggas is so shame;
They stare stiff like scared bitches,
While I remain inside a paradox.
Gone my block;
Though gun shots is promised to me; when will I stop?
I hit the weed
And hope to god I can fly high.
Witness my enemies
Die when I ride by;
They shouldn'ta tried me.
Send they bodies to they parents, up north,
With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off.
Fuck 'em all, what I scream as I dream in tones, 
Fuck a trick, get me rich 'n the bitches'll come, 
Bust ma gun; make 'em all scatta.
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatta.
Eat her dead, biatch, mercy, neva that.
You said you comin' back; bring it on, fo'ever straped.
Introduce ya to tha pleasure 'n tha pain, 
You could go so far; just sell me ya soul; live tha life of a ghetto star.

I live the life of thug nigga, drug deala, livin' game tight.
Mug nigga, slug nigga, split tha fame like...
Laced with game; practice on takin' pain; equipped same,
And let it rain through ya brain.
Street smart, proficient, intellegent, and keep suckas hittin' till snitchs start smellin'. 
Movin' niggaz with telekinesis; keepin' channel at work feelin' different features, 
Leadin' niggaz to an early death with they head blown,
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue,
Which is dead 'n gone.
And hope niggaz got fun, kidnapped, jacked in the back with next to they cataracts?  They get done, 
Back chat, they toast his ass out.
Mob related momma, my nigga, found shot up with his dick in his mouth; print it.
My name in these streets, as a mutha fuckin' g, now the next generation's lookin' worse off than me. 

Walkin' through tha cemetery; talkin' to my homies that was buried.
Say my enemies want to see me dead; I ain't worried; forgive me.
Please give me shelter; calm my fears.
Lifted my head from my hand that'll ball me tears.
I see bodies gettin' splashed with acid.
Two shots ring from the plasted guy wrapped in plastic;
Bury tha bastard; time to notify
His family...shit.
Ain't nothin' left to be identify.
Evacuate the crime scene fast; why? 
I heard the feds have a warrant fo' my ass; fly.
I won't touch down till I see tijauna.
Setup a shop sellin' them crooked cops marijuana.
Label me a success; I made tha switch; retired from the life that neva gave me shit, 
But cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars, and adict fo' a wife; to my life as a ghetto star.",Thugz Mansion [2Pac Original/Acoustic],2007

""Nobody's, closing me out of my business""

I played the cards I was given, thank God I'm still livin'
Pack my nine til it's time to go to prison
As I'm bailin' down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin'
But I'll be hustlin' til the early mornin 'cause I'm strugglin'
Like drinkin' liquor make the money come quicker
Gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a ho, make the dough
Break a ho when it's time to make some mo'

Ridin' down the block lickin shots at the punk-ass cops
And spittin' game through my mobile phone

They're quick to pulle a nine when it's time do niggas
Comin' through like I'm two niggas, a true nigga fuck a Zig Zag
Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
I'm drivin' drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
Lookin' for a new face to skeeze me
Everybody's lookin' for a nut but I'm searchin for the big bucks
Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
In a one-room shack, and, kickin' back
Daydreamin with the nine in my lap (huh)
So how's that from the mind of a Thug Nigga
Bought a fo'-five 'cause I heard that the slug's bigger
Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
Gettin' swept off his feet by the pump

Make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime
So here we go, we in the inner city
I keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty
Niggas don't like me 'cause I'm makin' ends
Roll in a Benz and I blaze a blunt, 'cause I'm all in
And any nigga trying to take what I got'll
Hafta deal with the sixteen-shot Glock (huh)
So here we go, I can't be faded
Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it
Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I ain't takin' shit from no niggas
I'm just tryin' to make some money right
Put some motherfuckin' food in my tummy right

I'll never call you bitch again

Damn, gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin bout this shit, we been through
We close like kin but you remain my friend to
This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin over childish issues
Swear I can't live wit' you but without you every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-ich
You always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' wit' you
Though not the man of your dreams, my plan and schemes
To be rich like a king, and live my life, trouble free
I see yesterday I called you names, and played games on yo' mind
I promise that I'll change in time

Out befo' them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

To throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came.. Way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)

I know, I know
All that is dead though, I'm changed, I'm tellin you..
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
To grow up ya' know what I'm sayin'? That was way back then

You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you a bitch again

My life just hasn't been the same, oh baby no 
When I looked into your eyes the moment that I let you go I just broke down 
Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice 
'Cause the feeling that I feel within 
No another man would never make me feel so right 
Its nice to smile when I get your phone call at night, 
But I rather have you here with me, 
Right next to me and that's the way you hold me tight, 

I got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch 
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much 
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny 
For you id cross the world for you id do anything 
That's right baby I'm going crazy 
I need to be your lady 
I've been thinking latley 
That you and me, yes we can make it 
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby 
That's right baby I'm going crazy 
I need to be your lady 
I've been thinking latley 
That you and me, yes we can make it 
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby 

Brake it down now tell you what I feel, 
From the moment I met you its been so damn real, 
My heart seems to skip another beat every time we speak, 
Can't believe I feel so weak 
Tell me that you really need me, 
You want me, you miss me, you love me, 
I'm your lady, 
Ill be around waiting for you, 
Put it down be the women for you 
I'm falling so deep for you 
Cause your you 
I'm callin, callin out to you, 
What am I gonna do 
Its true no frontin

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady
Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't ya know we love ya?

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slanging
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady
Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't ya know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies

Throw it up fool, hey n****
Tell me how you feel homie
Yeah

It took a week to go down, you recollect and see how crazy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents, penitentiary bound
Now introducin' young Trigga
Since birth, eyes set on gettin' bigger

Just another wild a** n****
But he was fiendin' for Precious, what?
But Precious was a ghetto girl
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus

But lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers
Seein' visions of people smokin' and n****z catchin' vapors
Got his man from around the corner, we'll call him 'Lil Mo
Been in so many reform schools, they had to let him go

Here's where the plot thickens
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin'
Somebody's gonna die tonight

Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin'
Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars, will they survive?
Two semi automatic nines, them n****z died
Plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate

To death and wish they could die, so peep the lesson

Was the victim, from a dime to a nickel
Hopin' God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin' bigger

Familiar face, but a man now, it's lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
All he wanted was to be a thug

Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
Here's where it gets ya
Now Precious is pregnant, lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now, not knowin' he ain't the daddy

But precious was lonely while lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin', now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'

Hand in hand, couldn't understand
How his baby's mama could disappear
With another man and his best friend
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me

Then watch the way that this story ends, and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'

Now with the problems of poverty, and the tricks to these tales
How many people will die? How many will live to tell?
Although best friends before, Lil' Trigga and Mo
They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know

Behind the curtains, their privacy, lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out
Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out

Think it's Lil' Mo, was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger
Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga

All the while let's look at Precious
Too dumb to see what's goin' down, too doped up to ask questions
Used to be comrades, but now we blast on sight
What could be so bad?

God, will we last tonight?

Come get a blast of this thug passion that'll blow your mind hey!
Throw up yo' legs, wrap them shits around my back
It's a Westside thang fuckin' hoes around the map
Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin' down hotties
And they, seduce my jimmy, out and screamin' ""Gimme body!""
Make 'em all scream my name out, gimme my props
And don't cha, love how this thug nigga, be at the cot
I'm at the Rican Parade, I'm watchin' caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas, bullshit'll never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black teen
I fiend for hoes cross country like a greedy crack fiend, now c'mon!

Baby you know, and I know, we need to get right
I'ma call you, and I'm comin' through after midnight
So be ready, to get sweaty, speed up or slow down
You want it, get up on it, it's 'bout to go down right now

Look here shawty, lemme tell you what the game is (game is)
And while I'm at it, lemme tell you what my name is (What?)
Bun Beeda, big D up in my drawers
When I pull out my piece, it make the girls all pause
Y'alls, niggas, better recognize
When ya bitch choose me, shouldn't come as a surprise (nope)
Knew she was a freak, I could see it in her eyes (yep)
And I'ma bring it out her when I get between her thighs
God-damn! That's what you call a home-run
I knock it out the park when I give her a long one (a long one)
It's on, I'm ready, it's strong, it's steady
First I'ma, give it some bacon and beat up the belly
When the sheets start shippin' and the bed starts rockin'
And the headboard's bangin', playa don't come knockin'
It's a grown folks party, we don't need no kids
And I ain't tryna blow you up, but gurl yo' pussy the shit!

Through up and downs
Tribulations and trials
You been there for me
You been there for me

Through my ups and downs, tribulations and trials
When so-called friends was nowhere to be found
You been there for me, Lord
You been there for me

As I reminisce on past times down and feeling lonely
After being done wrong by those I thought I could call my homies
When shawtys' love flipped and was proven deep infatuation
But like Pimp Squad ""I still loved her"" though she seemed to hate me
Same ones I uplifted to keep fighting through their times of pain
Left me in the dust with no protection in the hurricane
Plenty days I felt that rain symbolized my tears
Who knew real niggas would be crucified by their peers?
I've made mistakes like any man, but I kept my soul and character
And never switched on real friends for a false sense of acceptance
Never thought one minute I'd be stuck and left in this position
What was a perfect painting has now become a tainted picture
Living my life solo, for love I'm no longer seeking
Focused on making music the real can feel and believe in
Through ups and downs you remained when all others left me
Lord I thank you, for your blessings

Through my ups and downs, tribulations and trials
When so-called friends was nowhere to be found
You been there for me, Lord
You been there for me
Through my ups and downs, tribulations and trials
When so-called friends was nowhere to be found
You been there for me, Lord
You been there for me

Remember the times inside I felt that I wanted to die
'Cause it seemed for me there was only negativity in life
Daily seeking for what's my purpose and reason for living
Only finding vanity and insanity, lacking enrichment
If one deep how I gots to ride then I'ma roll nigga
Gave love before and got done wrong, made a cold spirit
Emotionally frozen from being scorned in the war
Catatonic state of mind resulting from a broken heart
Was I cursed to suffer hurt though I speak truth and not glibbery?
'Cause I speak from my heart instead of cliches and fake imagery
Betrayed by those I only sought to encourage and love
Got me thinking Lord, tell me, what have I done?
Presented myself as kind, friendly, loving, and true
And in return got betrayed, battered, spit on and used
These are the truths of a nigga feeling lost and encaged
Who any minute could've hit that kill switch and then dissipate

Through my ups and downs, tribulations and trials
When so-called friends was nowhere to be found
You been there for me, Lord
You been there for me
Through my ups and downs, tribulations and trials
When so-called friends was nowhere to be found
You been there for me, Lord
You been there for me

As times it seems I'm lost without a penny of direction
Asking questions bout why it seems down a hellish path I'm headin'
Seeking refuge in a world full of traps and snares
Where many talk 'bout showing love yet so few seem to care
In living hell or some type prison it feels I've been placed in
Finding no trace of hope or guided path to help escape it
So many tears shed from a spirit turned brittle and hopeless
Empty shell feeling like a ghost for which none care or notice
Have I been left alone to struggle and left out to dry?
With fruitless visions, a broken heart, and a scattered mind
Many nights this life do truly seem to fiend to take my vision
While alone and trying to hold on by the skin of my spirit
Maybe I'm tormented by demons deep in my inner most parts
Living outcasted from all lavishness of joy in the heart
Even though I feel like Jesus screaming ""God, why forsake me?""
Somehow I still feel that He'll save me on the daily

Through my ups and downs, tribulations and trials
When so-called friends was nowhere to be found
You been there for me, Lord
You been there for me
Through my ups and downs, tribulations and trials
When so-called friends was nowhere to be found
You been there for me, Lord
You been there for me

And protecting me
And being there, for me",Been There 4 Me,2016

Can you hear me, as I rip flows from the depths of my soul?
Can you feel me, with the vibe I bring from 1 double 9-0?
I refuse to promote stupidity putting wisdom in a prison
For a fatter pocket helping bring upon the demise of my niggas
Hold up freeze it, listen to me, 'fore you start speaking
Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished, NIGGA, believe me
Peep the game I'm giving ain't to inspire felonious living
But to help you grow to become one walking in the ways of dignity
Seems discipline morals and being true has fallen off course
'Cause many are blinded by dollar signs letting their vision distort
As for me, that boy named 2Ru3 (true) be deemed scott free
From living fraud and acting hard, but still keeping it G

Precious jewels of wisdom and truth are all I'm aiming to lend
'Cause I wanna see you grown and thrive instead of struggling to live
Conquering obstacles often made to blockade my way
An individual with a vision to bring change and be great
They say blood thicker than water, but no it gets thinner
Same ones suppose to uplift you eat your dreams and spirit for dinner
Try to tell you who you are, question then assume your intentions
Looking at you sideways all the time like the got their vision from Biggie (baby baby)
Let's take it back to the essence, reuniting rap with a message
Embedding motivation in our youths brains helping them reach higher levels
It used to mean something to walk with honesty and love
But nowadays everybody wanna be a thug
What's so fun bout packing guns, slanging drugs and ducking the law?
Chances of your life being taken plus everything you hustled for
No matter what they tell you, better days can be achieved
Without seeking riches by way of illegal deeds

Recognize your inner greatness, stop being brain dead, nigga wake up
There's more to life than hustling hard daily trying to, get your cake up, we can't just
Keep blaming our failure and mess ups on another
When we speak, but don't seek to be true keepers of our brother
Tell me what's come of, our current, state of mind
Promoting foolishness through music leaving behind our children blind
Is we scared to actually grow up and be what we oughta
Give the people what they be needing so they can grow and move forward
It's like a trap without drugs or a jail cell nigga
Where keeping it real means living broke instead of excelling in living, who built this prison
Is it truly the ones we loving to blame
Who no where to be found when it's your own that's causing you pain

Remember the music that used to encourage you through knowledge and wisdom
While at the same time still dropping boombastic bomb lyrics
Tunes that used to have you teary eyed 'cause it resonate with your suffering
Gave you strength to keep on fighting when this cruel world you had enough of
Gave you lessons you sometimes never find in those you confide
That you often find yourself using through your day to day life
Whatever happened to the soul once interwoven with rhythm
Authentic representation through open statements from within
Lyricism so frigid it'll give old man winter the shivers
But never sacrificing realism just for figgaz and women
Music with meaning that felt tangible though you know you can't see it
Promoted peace, unity and love and wasn't deemed made for weaklings
Those before us paved the path and set the standard to follow
Have we forgotten our responsibility to the youth of tomorrow
Nothing wrong with having fun, kicking back and chilling
But remember keep it real, baby, hip hop still living

To busy and caught up in nonsensical childish bickering nigga
Forget the gimmicks and imagery used as tools to get you loot
'Cause if you get rich off that then you can't say people feel you
Keep in mind when you rhyme how you wanna be remembered
An MC spitting in vain or authentic and genuine
When you speak is it for hoes or from the depths of your soul
Is your music for the love or the fame and zeros
Don't you want a legacy beyond time measured in glass
'Cause people's hearts you truly touched in ways they'll never forget
See as for me, I aim to spit lyrics that'll move a nation
Put love and truth in men heart destroying lies and hatred
Bringing changes many for years have only hoped and dreamed

Standing on principles breaking fictitious and fickle brittle images

2Ru3,"Ay, you know, as I look around
See the news, hear people talking about what's going on
I can't help but think it's time for a change
But we can't make that change
If we always pointing the finger
We gotta look at ourselves, too

This is for the people, all of the people
Not just black, white, and latino
But all of the people
This is for the people, all of the people
I'm hoping that you hear me, I hope you hear me

Many opinions and estimations, while lacking truthful statements
Fantasy living used as tools to escape real life situations
We went from morals and principles, to immoral yet legal existence
Yet wonder why it seems the hearts and minds have died of our children
Stuck in a place where love is distorted and genuity scarce
Where truth is choked for standing and speaking leaving us needing repair
Never once looking in that mirror, willing to make changes
Payin' no mind to the youth therefore we the reason they seemingly crazy
In a world of misconstrued truth, where hate and evil run awry
Masked blind behind digital screens, sowing discord and folly
Promotin' senseless, bitterness, ignorance, just wasting our lives
Losin' our minds here on earth, ignoring her cry

This is for the people, all of the people
Not just black, white and latino

Countless murders continue occurring as the world keeps on turning
Some feel so weighted down and oppressed they seek to bring their death early
Virginity stolen with innocence, leaving folks broken and bitter and
Never quite knowing what living is with a soul flowing with liberty
Imprisoned within a system built off lies and greed
Where the poor steal from the poor instead of unite and succeed
Our children hear our words and grow, from that which we show
Yet we push 'em aside, abuse 'em or raise 'em in the ways deemed wrong
We've assumed roles of sovereignty in spaces we ain't created
Neither has that power given us the authority to rearrange it
We talk bout peace, love, and charity while holding in hate
People we living in spiritual slumber, wake up, we've gone astray

This is for the people, all of the people
Not just black, white and latino
But all of the people
This is for the people, all of the people

Words of doubt and fear proclaimed amongst todays' generation
Parents mourn, children scorned, and others die daily
Crooked laws abusing authority through militant methods
Leaving citizens vexed and stressed to the point of amassing mass weaponry
Our world's crumbling to utter ruin before our eyes
Unmistakable signs more than ever show we in latter times
Living in a paradoxical and troubled state of existence
Objecting truth therefore we lack the jewels to give to our children
Do we not recognize the days and times in to which we've entered
Warfare, against dark forces, in the realms of the spirit
Let us combine so we can find a better route in life
Picking up peace, love, and unity throwing hatred aside

Not just black, white and latino (the balls' in our court)

Dying is easy, Living is hard

Laid back, thinking 'bout life
Hoping for better days I'm trying to see the sunshine, hey
Laid back, thinking 'bout life
Hoping for better days I'm trying to see the sunshine, hey

Daily I strive to push forward and pave a new path
Accomplish goals and gain new riches yet still stand as a man
Though opposition seek to destroy my mind is made
To find a place where the sun shines though time to time it rains
Seems my life's fabric has been sown with lesser hills than valleys
But with perseverance with faith, somehow I still manage
Treated lesser than elements taken to shape my physical form
Beaten with words of degradation though love I gave from my soul
Joyous times seem out of place when compared with my burdens
Feels I been shot deep in my soul, but the bullet keep turning
Thinking of my juvenile years, flooded with tears
Who knew with pain you be repaid for keeping it real with your peers
At times it seems my life's been laid out and setup for failure
Causing confliction deep in my spirit 'cause deep in me I feel greatness
I'm tired of working hard seeing nothing come to fruition
Let me get mine, 'cause time is ticking

Laid back, thinking 'bout life
Hoping for better days I'm trying to see the sunshine, hey
Laid back, thinking 'bout life
Hoping for better days I'm trying to see the sunshine, hey

Seems I'm imprisoned within a paradoxical state of living
'Cause it's so much more in this life I want to achieve and witness
Like being a beacon of light, bringing positive change
Lifting up spirits of the sorrow ridden, broken, beaten and chained
But I feel stretched beyond my capacity, truly weary
Yet still hoping for happiness though my days seem dreary
See I envision me mic ripping kicking lyrics to rhythms
With so much soul I can touch and move a crowd of a'bout a hundred million
As my strength from above mobilizes me I follow
Rivers and roads never known by those whose souls and hearts deemed hollow
Laying foundations for present and future generations to come
Making known what it means to keep it real and walking in love
Gaining respect from those deemed my enemies and opposers
Labeled a legend repping truth even in the midst of the phonies
Never known for kicking gibberish or presenting false imagery
Showing music from the soul, still alive and kicking, baby

Laid back, thinking 'bout life
Hoping for better days I'm trying to see the sunshine, hey
Laid back, thinking 'bout life
Hoping for better days I'm trying to see the sunshine, hey

Picture me flowing with more strength, and grace then a river
Throwing lyrical haymakers, knocking out instrumentals
Remaining humble, meek and lowly though compared with those before me
Never switching from my intention to help your spirit move forward
Though figgaz and cheese beyond my dreams may accumulate for me daily
I'll strive with all my heart and soul to never let money make me
Boasting and bragging never identified as one of my actions
Just a man of love as shown to God my fellow man and my family
Who went from sitting in class writing lyrics peaking out windows
To gripping microphones and ripping flows with soulistic rhythms
Inspiring minds of juveniles to stand for truth and be greater
Elevating the degraded through my soul shown on paper
Reflecting on times past as I stare through my rearview
Thanking God I'm seeing the fruit for all the things I pursue
And to homie who ain't here with me, I'll be seeing you nigga
In a place of perfect peace, for eternity nigga, ay

Sometimes you gotta live what you believe
Open your arms cause that's where it starts 
Right here with you and with me

Savoir ce que tu penses fait pas partie de mes ambitions

Hard up the high hills
Of Charlemagne's driveway
I climb up the trellis
Lock fingers into lattice work
And watch as she takes off her shirt

And the war began on sacred ground
Funded by the green silk gown
She slips right into
And she needs to sleep
And he needs to wake up
He wanted to try the space that she takes up

This is Earth to astroknot
There's not a lot of hope for you tonight
And I believe the sun can stay
And rise you through the gray

Well, I'd like to join the circus
And what did I do to deserve this
Hole in my life?
Well in the morning when you wake up
You better check the space you take up
Now isn't that nice? You're bound to your fate

And I won't be coming home tonight
I've hanged myself upstairs
Inside her bedroom closet
And she needs to sleep

Start again, start again  With no one to blame but yourself

I've been waiting so long just to hold you
And to be back in your arms where I belong

But everything I've ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love

All that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you right here by me

I am the reaper of souls
Cold iron blades, they cannot stop me
Where I am from no one knows

I am in command

Treachery stalking evil command
Cloven hoofed steed I ride
Armies of horns descend on the gates
Hatred burns their eyes

Impervious to fire, impervious to steel
Merciless vengeance dealt by their strike
Impervious to fire, impervious to steel

Walls of stone cannot stop them
Too weak are the spells of old
At the sound of their banshee cry
The hearts of all grow cold

Claiming their god is the one to believe
The beast is emerging, a danger untold
Trying to suppress what can't be controlled

Can you explain how it is the lord's will?
A plague so vile, none shall survive

A curse on their blades, a hex on their swords
Unholy minions they blood mark heaven's domain

They'll die on their knees when the lies have been shown

He practiced scales while pressing tails and sang at local shows.
His friends and neighbors praised the voice that poured out from his throat.
They said that he should use his gift instead of cleaning coats.

But music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.

His friends kept working on him to try music out full time.
A big debut and rave reviews, a great career to climb.
Finally they got to him, he would take the fling.
A concert agent in New York agreed to have him sing.
And there were plane tickets, phone calls, money spent to rent the hall.
It took most of his savings but he gladly used them all.

But music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.

The evening came, he took the stage, his face set in a smile.
And in the half filled hall the critics sat watching on the aisle.
But the concert was a blur to him, spatters of applause.
He did not know how well he sang, he only heard the flaws.
But the critics were concise, it only took four lines.
But no one could accuse them of being over kind.

Mr. Martin Tanner, Baritone, of Dayton, Ohio made his
Town Hall debut last night. He came well prepared, but unfortunately
His presentation was not up to contemporary professional standards.
His voice lacks the range of tonal color necessary to make it
Consistently interesting.

Full time consideration of another endeavor might be in order.
He came home to Dayton and was questioned by his friends.
Then he smiled and just said nothing and he never sang again,
Excepting very late at night when the shop was dark and closed.
He sang softly to himself as he sorted through the clothes.

Music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.",Mr. Tanner,2006

Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no! not in spring-time.

3-2,"Listen up I got a story to tell
Ay fool, listen up I got a story to tell
Say dog, listen up I got a story to tell
Say man, listen up I got this story to tell

Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
Now this was not a hoe in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense, tryna push me
He used to hold dick now he wanna be in my shoes
Hatin' like a baby mama 'cause I'm payin' my dues
Tryin' to hold on to my little chunk but not a punk in the parking lot bumping his gums
With his Ki's in the trunk, oh what I'm supposed to jump 'cause you got a pump
You aimin' that bitch in the sky you chump
Point that motherfucker this way and dump
Oh what you scared to go to the pen?
Thinkin' them niggas gon' tap your rump?
Man I thought he played bold but he ain't even fuss
Man the nigga was way swole actin' like he wanted to buss
But his trigger stayed cold I wasn't surprised
I recognized that fast breathin' and fear in his eyes
Unmask his disguise a sheep in wolf's clothing
On the prey, who tried to hunt the hunter
And got hunted down his goddamn self in PA
Niggas it's where we stay
Ain't none of that K-K-K'n or playin' so see A
Or E about your life 'fore you test yourself
And make a nigga break you off some peace to rest yourself
Oh yes your health is what's in question
And I hope that this ass whippin'
Teach you a motherfuckin' lesson

Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
'Cause deep down in the South boy's comin' up cold
Talkin' down on my name and what it's all about
You niggas better be gettin' some cut and get my name out yo mouth
'Cause I dunno why you got flex with me
Testin' me but I'mma pull my shit and let you see
That all that carry the jack ain't able to survive
So you haters need to quit with that po' hustlin'
And take another ride

Niggas jumped and crossed the line
The movies got these boys fucked up in the mind
Not to mention the wine and codeine syrup combined
Easy access to 9s
And shit talkin' hoes that's fine
And all they got time for is pourin' Swishers down
Committing crimes amped off water
And some exaggerated rhyme
So if bein' hard ain't in your heart
Then don't start niggas'll tear your weak mind apart

Bitch, your old man talkin' to me like I'm in school
He don't know I hang with killers we'll erase that fool
Wouldn't give a fuck about him but he kin to my son
If you think that I'm that nigga then you picked the wrong one
'Cause I live by the gun, die by the gun
Hot bullets burn some say that them bitches stun
So raise your own children don't try to raise mine
And when you see me step with caution 'cause I'm buckin' for mine, bitch

Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You done crossed the line now you gon' get fucked
I already told you before but you ain't barring that
So this time I'm handlin' mine and gon' erase you off the map
Such a shame but it's all in the game
And since the early 60's ain't a damn thing changed
We got haters over here and haters over there
But I got my pistol and it ain't pointed in the air

I see you trippin' off that water and you feel like you bad
'Cause yo bitch done chose a pimp and that pimp was Chad
I see you hurt 'cause I fucked your girl
Put big dick in her world, bust nuts in her curls
When I hit it from the back she said ""baby I can't take it""
Push my dick up in her harder bitch I'm straight up tryin' to break it
You a simp-ass nigga you told that bitch that you love her
But I'm straight up fuckin' that pussy like that nigga off they colors
But I ain't gonna get shot 'cause you ain't shootin' shit
The best thing you can do is go and try and beat that bitch
'Cause this man's style showstopper pistol popper you ain't ready
If I let this hot thing hit you fool, your stomach like spaghetti
Fool you talkin' loud but you move too slow
Tellin' niggas all your plans got you tied up in a van
Nigga what the fuck is up (up) in the place to be
First I want the money nigga then I want the fuckin' Ki's
Kidnap robbery 'cause you said you wanted me dead
Since you want a nigga dead
Buck that bitch off in his head
Just like E-40 nigga I be comin' fed
Got the sawed off pump with night vision infrared
So play me like a pussy and you will get fucked
Nigga I'm hangin' out the truck b-buck buck
Hit your nigga in the leg hit your bitch in the gut
But we know where your ass stay
So your ass will get touched

Speak the wrong words I'm high on them herbs
And you will get touched cause yo ass deserve
To get done real bad in front of yo kids
To show 'em what real type of bitch you is
And it's that boy named 3 to the 2 forever stayin' true
Just a player makin' do and I gotta tell it to the
Whole wide world how you got bitched razor necked just like

(Bun B) 

I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin 

had to find my place 

But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue 

had to dodge a case 

Had to dodge a bullet 

And the nigga that tried to pull it 

The streets is throwed 

If I don't get lean and blowed everyday 

I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive 

All my life this drive I tried 

I seen a lot of good niggas die 

Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched 

Or somebody's a bitch 

I wish I could change the past 

But I gots to live in the present and pray 

that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast 

Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me 

But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself 

I found out she had to told me 

Just to show me just how good I had it 

I guess I couldn't see it 

Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it 

But that was just the way we used to G it 

One of the wrongest niggas I see 

Or one of the strongest niggas I know 

Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know 

So I put weed in the bong and I blow 

Stay cool calm and collected a neglected 

Child that grew into a man that's widely respected 

Too real

We blow big everyday 

But that don't stop our pain 

Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game 

Got niggas doin 40 

When you 25 that's life 

I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price 

These bitch ass niggas shife 

Niggas might snitch out they momma 

That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama 

Cause we ain't promised tomorrow 

But nigga you promised to die 

Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry 

At night I talk to God and try to understand 

How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man 

I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back 

So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks 

I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones 

But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun 

I guess that's true for some 

But them hoes will never win 

Out here just hustlin and grindin

See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last 

Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass 

And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up 

No respect for your family that's dead

Fresh braided, player made it, deuce out the roof

Suicide doors, dubs and twin cams

Watch us be the star traction and a harder night
More than Sprite, plus my neck and wrist are cold
Ice cubes in my watch and the piece is just froze
These hoes, all on a nigga dick cause I'm young, fly and rich
Escorting a bad bitch, doja lit, I ain't worried about the laws
Hoes whisper to each other girl I think he played ball
No bitch, I'm just a rapper out the hood
And I'm wrestling with the wood, powered up feeling good
Little engine that could, beat the block for it's stock
Turn around and swap game for a political job

Head to the town and watch 3rd Ward Billy
Knock a nigga out while pouring up a drank
Got my mind on the bank, in the jail I use a shank
I sip that, flip that, wood grain grip that
Go to the Papa Do's yeah I'm gone tip that

Looking for some head in a little bitty shop

Running up on my car, wanting a contract
I ain't looking for no acts, but you bout to get slapped
To a coma, gone on a, get to stepping
Down the yellow brick road, 'fore I pull out my weapon
I done told you once, won't tell you twice

All that grabs handshakes, all that's fine

to find out I was still me, 
Last night should've killed me.
Took a shower couldn't scrub it off
Tried to scream, I could only cough

Exhausted by the effort it takes to breathe, 
The Whole world is against me
That's what I belive, 
don't waste your empathy on me

I'm through puttin one foot in front of the other
I'm do wanna run for cover 
From the moment I wake up til I'm 
starin at the ceiling trying to sleep
I wonder if I have a soul to keep.

Voices in my head will not turn off
There's a heavy weight on top
of my chest today, 
I don't want it to go away because,
the moment I let down my guard, 
life will hit me twice as hard
My mistake, I thought I could have
just one day off
From pushing boulders up steep hills,
playin in traffic for cheap thrills 
I don't know what to do
that's why I'm tellin you that

Which feelings to show
But they cannot grow
When it's safer kept inside

Show the people we know breaking up underneath the weight

Fall back on guarded sentiments from a distant happy time
Experiences watered down
When the past still runs your life
Your only living half the time
Half dead or half alive

When I see your faith in me
And how heavy your leanin' on this skinny boy
Over employed, tryin' to help you do your job
I wanna find the empty pieces of your heart 
And fill them up with life
But it's so hard to hold to bigger dreams
Nightmares cloud my sight

Nobody calls
I stare at the walls
And sleep alone again
You're only livin' half the time
Half dead or half alive

Micro dans la paume j'pète les putains d'portes
Tu comptes aller où? T'as que 5 rapports
J'ai traîné dans la boue pour mettre un putain d'score
Qui reste ici quand c'est corsé?
La concu' à poil sans son corset
T'es censé écrire des textes censés
Le peura dans l'sang est mon ssence-é
Suffit d'une basse pour m'enclencher
T'entends les grincements sur ton plancher

Faut rentrer d'l'oseille, s'mettre en retrait éviter les procès
Dangereux quand on procède

Tu cours après les jupes et le putain d'succès
Les mecs, sautez-le, il est grave suspect
Maintenant qu'ils savent tous que j'suis dans l'jeu

Loin d'ici je veux m'arracher
Dans le même turf toute la semaine
Quelques bad bitch qui me collent à la semelle
De janvier à février
Je taffe au studio comme un ouvrier
Et je ne veux pas oublier
Tous ces hypocrites qui analysaient
Car on s'en bat les reins de ton opinion
Si tes négros ont attrapé des champignons
Tu nous vois vissés mais pas en Vuitton
Quitte à cracher l'venin, tout ça comme un python
Je viens représenter SOV mothafuckin' label

Quand j'suis pas dans l'turf c'est que je ride sur la capitale
Avec mon clan, ça fait longtemps qu'on perd les pédales
Je détaille cette merde comme en cuisine
Y'a trop de fumée donc j'hallucine
J'veux pas les clés d'une caisse en leasing
Ni tirer et blesser des civils
Je sirote le rhum comme aux Antilles

Ramène une pute et les negros grattent
Si tu viens pour nous signer ne crois pas que c'est gratos
J'en ai, j'en ai, j'en ai rien à battre
Certains keufs rêvent de nous abattre
Certaines meufs rêvent de nous khabate
L'important c'est pas ce qu'écoutent les ados comme rap
Nan, c'est leur couteau dans le sac à dos
Dis-leur que mes négros veulent une villa
Arriver dans ta ville et tout casser comme Godzilla
Faire bouger tout le pays jusqu'aux Îles
Et faire danser un keuf sur le mia, même sa famille, sa fille
Ils mettent 5 minutes quand tu fumes mais en mettent 50 quand ça pète
Quand nos HLM seront vides comme nos bides
C'est là qu'on fera péter tout le reste
Je roule avec les best
Déstresse, on va pas en club
Je déteste si elle a des tresses
Et peu importe le poids de sa fesse
J'aime les cheveux lisses qui font des pastas fraiches
Pas besoin d'sucette pour que tu lèches
Vos rappeurs comme vos sachets sont beaucoup trop leg'
On dit que l'herbe est toujours plus verte ailleurs
Mais votre beuh est beaucoup trop beige

J'mets la pression
Comme une pucelle qui va s'faire prendre en missionnaire
Un défenseur face à Messi Lionel
Un récidiviste en conditionnelle
T'insultes un frère, ça devient personnel
L'aigle n'est plus royal quand il perd son aile
J'en ai rien à battre que tu joues l'te-traî, poto
Moi j'préfère quand tu restes honnête
Tu t'prends pour le best, on t'next
On ride, même jusqu'à Brest, dans l'ouest
J'bois d'la Badoit j'mange du Babybel

Laisse les brebis galeuses on est à pas de loup
Fais pas l'relou, j'ai des gars ches-lou
Mais si t'es un brave, c'est mes bras que j'ouvre
Ramène d'la chatte et, un jour, on t'ajoute
Par contre si t'es un trav', c'est une balle dans ta joue
J'ai la main dans ta choune
Donne de la viande hachée qu'on graille comme Mouloud Achour

J'rappe tout en restant poli
Je les crame, je les blase, repars dans mon bolide
J'rappe souvent de la folie
J'ai les plav', j'ai les bases, j'repars dans mon bolide

Just this life and no more. 
All come within this world there's only one for me.

The sun's goin' down for me it's goin' down for me.
He and she are what I need yes they're what I need.
But I'm gonna buy a ticket I'm not gonna even pick it.
I heard it he said it I heard it.
But it we but it went something like.

Visit.
I wanna visit the world.
So now I visit the world.
With my time on this world.

Because livin' when you're hungry is a dog in an alley.
Now I mind my business cuz I'm rhymin' down in Cali.
I ain't playin' when sayin' kings of the ghetto feel they losing ground.
Vato's goin' loco because everyone's brought down.
This is a visit then we dead fade to dust strickin'.
I'm wearing my Doc Martens cuz I'm always down for kickin'.
This my friend the city pity everywhere the enemy.
Ready or not homey stompin' everyone in front of me.

Jump up and down cus that's the 311 style.
Cruise on by the frowners float follow me now with a smile.
Looking at the ocean I say there's plenty.
Looking at the river I say there's plenty.

[Chorus]

Jump up and down cause that's the 311 style.
Cruise on by the frowners float follow me now with a smile.
I got a golden ticket I'm not gonna even pick it.

Spinnin' all around as we dust a melody
Groove as your soul sings. 
Spinnin' all around

Welcome to this groove you can move right
We gonna take you higher not caught in the quagmire
I can't survive on a stupid nine to five I'd rather be poor
Writing tunes livin' on a commune
Kickin' it with my brothers and significant others
Life in pursuit of only money we think it's funny
The only thing that money it could ever bring to me
Would be some gifts for my friends follow me now
Trips for my family

The only thing I love is freedom the people around me I need 'em I'd
Like to build the world a spliff but like I said I said
You could never get me interested in dreams of wealth
Myself my birthday happens to land on April twelfth whack

A Coney Island of the mind it's mine
I swipe the sweets strip the beats in the sunshine
Loco holmes I stroll because I'm thinking
A tone poem alone is love medicine then the demon
Spring revolution in my spirit here it is and I will kill with it

Traveling head spinnin' from the medicine
Illusions fadin' out an comin' on again
Unwind your mind then find entire minutes abstract
The tract of sight day breaking in it
Doles out my share of the world ocean and sun
Rising with whirling motion

I fought kicked and screamed my way to getting born now I feel
Warm and I say come on the night won't save anyone
Won't you roam
We've grown so we can write again our soul select its own way for
The travellin'

First to flow Nickel my brother, so wise
And then I rise

Don't do no cocaine that come from Columbia

Mash up your body and mash up your culture

Not talking small just skip the bull

It's seventy three degrees

Stranger flowers still
If you're gonna want to go another day I will

Sealed with a fell of impermanent bliss

The fabulous drama maker
A cracker on a truck goin', ""breaker, breaker""
Listen to everyone (uh huh), then disregard it

The meaningful shit comes back, back to where it started

The only survey is when our heart pays no attention

Yada, yada-da-da, oooohh...

Move with persistence, cover much distance
Knowing no perdition, that's my game for instance

And the 311 crew not down with convention

So I make not attempt to try and suss the stupid out

And no we don't have guns hidden

It don't matter whether
We sport the dread locks or a shaved head
Or if we have a sticker from the dead

Funky gas by my way all the day I couldn't laugh

Bare ass in my face I'm ok but Chad's like ""Uh-uh no he isn't""
So I proceed to hear him get loose with the
Fartin' all over my face sometimes my tummy

He fucked with my flow although I thought it funny
I probably wouldn't care if I smoked more kind bud
But that wouldn't do me shit 'cause then he'd fuck me more up
Crazy ill and chillin' rude but I'ze a real cool dude

He didn't believe the day would come when he would get his top
But then one day right in front of his face I got him
He looked over said ""God damn get me some water""
The one time I hadn't wasted till I got mine

Smeared his nose with my armpit funk slime
So you get it the picture just how sick we were then
But before I jet ""Hey yo Chad sniff my finger man""

I can see a lot of people who feel like I don't

I know I must be laying a pipe you got a gripe
With the way I get high

Order of the pain that they cause
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law

Our star has long bust but now reappears
In your sky at night rising and immense
Yes you see ourselves in the shine of it

Where death reborn into the world is a gift
So the future with no voice of its own will uplift

Swimming through the darkness, I'm a ghostly shark
Developing like a photograph, slowly in the dark
The hereafter, the action, the main attraction
One love in all of this that I'm going after

Now there's fire inside, but black space surrounds you
You think, ""Where, oh, where am I"" but even your light continues
See through us, see a soul we have not yet
Learned to harness, see the next world inside it 
We are the people of skin who left water
Inside the dark womb, inside of our mother
Prone to the beat and vibe of our tribe
We catch the drift and ride moving tides
Out from a love that will keep on burning
Now see yourself to the next world, returning 
This life, an old place we face to live again
What is it to understand the hereafter?",Taiyed,1994
311,"Ooh, you know we pepper you
With a sonic assault sidestepin' you
I cannot think of a better way
That we could celebrate freedom
Than make up a set of goals and cold beat 'em
See dumb verbal tags like audio spaghetti
Give a shout to the one they call Yeti
I bet he put the cabash on any foes whatsoever Like original brodel Trevor
Positive vibe merchant grandson of Lord Buckley
Scottish Ralston shows up if you're lucky
Ad Raspler the Swede, a friend indeed
He's keeping an eye on the other guy's greed 
These are 311 characters I dubbed everyone
The story ain't over but my rhyme is done

It was the year that I first touched ground
So I grabbed the microphone and I got down
Just like James Brown gather 'round of our sight and sound
Pound for pound we throw down rather profound
I'll put you in another world, I can't hear you
Like having phone sex with a deaf girl
No doubt, we got the jams that'll smack ya
I penned three books of lyrics two for action, 1 for backup
'cause I'm a cold rockin' brother, got transistor tunes
And it feels real good to get close to you

The brodels is the nazz, and the nazz knows where it's at
The brodels is the nazz, who knows a cat who can feed a cat
The goal is to be a poet and a carpenter
To be one who loves, to be one who works
The nazz not something that can be given
The brodel is inside you, it comes from within

When I feel into the sea
When the world came and kissed me
Transformed my shit, told the shark I was a dolphin
Swam quick funny though
Piranhas chilled and laughed at
The way that I took off my polka dots on top of that
The whales know I'm quick, watch out
And I get funky fresh, as for the fishes, I'm lit luminous
I'm not nouveau techno, I glow like a glacial
In skin that swims faster than speed I am
I be dropped out of nothing I will return to nothing
Rotate my style, my rhyme, my way, magician of a rhythm
Lover of animals, damn, I want to hear 'em
Aquatic my way, I got soul shape

Well I'm 6 six foot three and like Mohamed Ali
I float like a butterfly and sting like poison ivy
Drive a '69 Lincoln, suicide doors
Around the town, I'm slinking fat subs of course We're the greatest show on earth
You know we turn it out daily
In and out of town like Barnum and Bailey
I know that is a simile, but I couldn't resist From Solomon Roadie for the PJ's
I don't think he'll be pissed
I eat a Cobb salad, smoked fish, duck, or clam chowder
Chill with Indica and Guinness
Steer clear of white powder
I run into my brother, give him a pound and a yodel
They know my word is bond, talkin' bout the brodels

The brodels is the nazz, and the nazz knows where it's at
The brodels is the nazz, who knows a cat who can feed a cat
The goal is to be a poet and a carpenter
To be one who loves, to be one who works
The nazz not something that can be given
The brodel is inside you it comes from within

And we're fresh, dude, just check my man P
He said, ""I will not muddle my mind with impertinency""
Lost a lot in Vegas, plays a lot of Sega
Saw a phrase that he likes and put it on his leg And we're fresh dude just check my man D he said
Comin' in ruff and tuff, all systems are tweakin'
People all over the world, they must be thinkin'
All the shit that we kickin', our shoes must be stinkin'",Brodels,1995

And the stupid mother fucker who made you so
That punk is a coward let that be told
I hear voices in the night that are electric
He kicks the shit out of her because he's heartless
She won't leave she has low self esteem
He's got good gravitational pull
Sucks her body till her heart and her limbs grow cold

Hang in there use your head
How can I love you after you're dead
Hang in there, keep trying
How can I love you after

Here's what you got to tell him
I'm thinking of a picture that's keeping me in stitch
You're causing me a mental glitch
'Cause jealousy is such a bitch
I hereby emancipate myself from that
You can consider yourself free to flirt and chat
With who ever you want
It should have always been that way
The way that you want, the way that you play
My mind is blank slate I'm pretending you're erased
You cannot let me down when I cannot see your face

Hang in there use your head
How can I love you after you're dead
Hang on in there, keep trying
Wow can I love you after dying

Ode to a beat up girl, I know you're out there
Stronger than you think, stand up if you care
Get up off the ground, don't let me down
Get up off the ground, don't let me down

Hang in there use your head
How can I love you after you're dead
Hang in there, keep trying
How can I love you after

And you, and you
I'm a let you pass without kicking you're ass
Because I'm above it you hurt someone I love
It takes two to make a thing go right and that's trite
But one just to sneak and weasel through the night
If you hurt her again I'll fuck you up
If you hurt her again I'll fuck you up, fuck you up
If you hurt her again I'll fuck you up
If you hurt her again I'll fuck you up, fuck you up",DLMD,1995

Pretty older women in skirts, conversation frisky
Stinking cigarettes and plenty of bourbon whiskey
Sad classical music on the jukebox of doom

Some just having fun opening the steam valvage

Had to pull up the reigns or else smother

Don't want to be unprepared

When I describe I'm a scribe with a metaphor
I use a simile lightly 'cause that shit's played
The common way most rhymes are made, ya know
I rock like this I flow like that
But all those comparisons are just that
Kickin' different styles I'll be right here
Today, tomorrow, next week and next year
I always say what I feel and that is a promise

Like a bomb I'm dropping yes a ton of lead

I'm a redwood I love to be a tree yes I'm a druid
My words are flowing out like a fluid
Never give in never conform
I'll be bustin' out rhymes in a triplet form

Dead leaves on the trees in spring can't hear the birds sing
A light powdered snow on the ground is glistening
Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver
A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver

While I doze I suppose I could get lost
With a brown skin friend claiming kin to crazy horse
I stink of vino my greasy clothes are rancid but
I tip the bottle back the spirits are in me kid

Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature
Firewater the world's a mixture
Of broken liquored people get the picture

Firewater call it liquid rapture
Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature

Whiskey be spittle at the corners of my mouth
I'm rather liquored light flickers, I got the shakes and jitters
I roll I'm like raging bull bumrushin' the show
Hand to my head sway in the fire I've waded into

All alone except for the whiskey voices
Whores laugh, neon signs flash other choices
I stagger stumble to toast the past while I mumble
Slur my song slow porno show marquee words crumble

Steady drinking smoking the green weed
And head is sort of blinking you're going with the flow
And everybody is getting plowed

The voices and the music and the noise is getting loud
You got a heavy buzz on when seven o'clock rolls around
So you piule inside the clunker start heading downtown
Only nineteen but you know where you can get it

So you slide inside the bar and everything is hitting
By about eleven o'clock your brain is near dead
You really can't remember who was the one that said
Let's go into the bathroom and meet this guy Chuck
He's got a thirty dollar white powder pick me up

Ten minutes later the whole vibe had changed
You try for conversation but you know you're acting strange
Your eyes are wide open but your smile is gone
You just keep fiending 'til the fucking break of dawn

All my friends excitable they'll tell you so
So let the cards fall and fall where they may
In checkin' on our conviction dick
We run from the shit our own way
So what you will so what you wish
Follow your bliss on everyday
Never ask for an advantage
Let the cards fall where they may
So let the cards fall
And fall where they please

I am a simpleton by choice not speaking to hear my voice
Sunshines, why are you sleeping?
Gotta get outside

Cover the ground on foot
Not hitting around your spur
Over the river and trough the woods
I've come this far to bring in the goods

I get high, even when I don't try
Let 'em pass by with a wink to the eye
I reserve the right to be stoned, I reserve the right to take it
To collect them sums, I have the right
Don't try to be, there's really no point in you biting me

I'm glad to see that it's easy for me to be an MC
Let me tell you a little story
Like my dog Bobby, he hated the pool, man
So I tried to play Kotter and make things cool

And I said, ?Just let him smell you, hold out your hand?
He reached it on out and then bam
He bit him, he bit him so fuckin' hard
Blood was steady gushin' all over my back yard

I kept apologizin', I felt so fuckin' bad
The dude was so cool, he didn't even get mad
He said, ?Man, don't sweat it, that's the dog's meaning?
Took some Neosporin and went back to his cleaning

Thought I had a dream or else it was a movie
Your mind can have a joint easy like jungle boogie
600 dollar freebie and I gots my job
Would you mind? Come but I gots my dog

Come, you can foam the water with the bone
I wanna tell my mom, ring her on the phone
Cherry popsicle, icy, cold, freezing
Loves on his gums now that he is teething
Got a wee-wee pass, lay them by the door
Nasty little shits, he dropped them on the floor

I am a simpleton by choice
Not speaking to hear my voice
Sunshines, why are you sleeping?
Gotta get outside

Smoke the weed that come from Northern California
Don't do no cocaine that come from Colombia
That the thing that mash up your nature
Mash up your body, and mash up your culture

I give complete props to the one that rocks steady
With dexterity and goes on, and on, and on

In a minute, things you thought were tied can come straight undone
How about some knocks on wood, some so far, it's so good, any day
What you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out
To the north and south, that's what plates are about
Nature has no conscience, no kindness, or ill will

But the dreams they had make me sad because of the vibes of them
When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened
To me and my family, my bros and I were driving The RV bleeding flames, us leaping through fire, surviving
Zoned with no home, there was fire all on it

Son of a gun, but there you drifted

Deeper is the light to open up the sky
Look into my eyes and see them dilatin'

Embedded in our souls, it breathes out from this band
We always knew that we could
Thank you if you, too, felt we would

How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew
My dude, on the one, come off like Teflon
Rock your shit and you will rise on  If you're a farmer out standing in your field say (uh)
Do as you will do as you wish follow your bliss say (uh)
We travel 'round the country, giving it our best 
We like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest
The hammer and the chisel and the rule and conquest
We forged the sword, the chariots of war, our battle axe 
There's much power in anger, but love's a bigger banger

Not the possums playing dead messing with my head
X amount of action, X amount of games
For years again I tell you the same

Gone already to the bored of it all type, lingo
That I'm seein' every single night I'm out
Bustin' head for it but your's gets busted
Right back lip split and

I messed up but I got back tryin'
Don't bother lyin' 'bout constant disappointment
But the fun is in the hunt so quit actin' on a front
And you're unmotivated, sorta faded
But the remedy is not so, get on with what you got

Remember Lady of Guadeloupe, the times my mother made mole
After mass we would get home, the girls are runnin' to the phone
And I'm in my bedroom the 45 on my record player
Was we're in this love together

At the time I never realized how songs haunted
The ones that I heard I played because I wanted
Drawin' on my wall from time to time coolin'
Makin' creatures come alive with no schoolin'

When I'm on the microphone
The method that I make is much patience
The method that I make is much patience
I'm waiting for the beat and then I make sense

Ain't comin' in hot, forgot you definitely got no clue
Ain't comin' in hot, you got, you definitely got so rude
Boy, actin' coy but you got nuts like Almond Joy, I tell ya
This is a tribute

No one looks as foolish as the excitable ones
But then again there's no one that has this much fun
X amount of action, X amount of games
For years again I tell you the same

Once I met a man who made nearly no mistakes
He would never bet on a long shot and he never bet on a break and
He's condescending and talks gossip galore
But the dude was definitely such a bore, hear me now

I messed up but I got back trying
Don't bother lying 'bout constant disappointment
But the fun is in the hunt so quit actin' on a front
Yeah, unmotivated, sorta faded
But the real man is not the one hiding behind the gunshot

Time travelin' through my memory
There's a younger dough gazin' at the galaxy
Space trippin' veto of the stars
Searchin' for UFOs from Neptune and Mars

Ode to an alien, I know you're out there
Cosmic, lonely heart tell me if you care
I'm listening for your sound, here on the ground
I'm listening for your sound, here on the ground

When I'm on the microphone
The method that I make is much patience
The method that I make is much patience
I'm waiting for the beat and then I make sense

Ain't comin' in hot, forgot you definitely got no clue
Ain't comin' in hot, you got, you definitely got so rude
Boy, actin' coy but you got nuts like Almond Joy, I tell ya
This is a tribute

I'm vexing many mofos but I'm wishing you the best
I keep 'bout half my lyrics and I throw out the rest

Leaving charred wreckage from my latest eruption
Unpredictable, my erratic demeanor
Bobbing and weaving as my mind gets leaner
Though I'm trippin' on legs that stumble but I don't fall down
You know I'm singing out things you mumble for a lack of resound
Pissed off mist lifts to honesty
Now come down motherfucker with your philosophy

I'm at ease when I feel there's a breeze
Give me a little please

So are you ready for your lesson blood?

We'll pacify the bullshit built up in your brain

Throw down, fuck the bullshit, we're still the sound

A long way from sad
Lookin' good like you should, you're bad
An itinerant dimension mystic is your spirit see
Like color absolute bodiless, indeed
Casual kindred spirit past
All the obstacles you're dealin' with at last
The nasdaq, two puppies, baby needs new shoes
Car alarms, your rent, wedding bells, the blues

The tragic fucking comedy that was last night
Unfolds to my inner devils sheer delight
A pointless fucking banter in an endless bout
With whiskey soaked frolic room tobacco mouth
Then a sickening trip to what I call the elitist cesspool
Beckoning all the sycophants and defeated yes fools
Hung over, broke, and a round of apologies
Now come down Martinez with the modern mythology

Can't nobody do it like 311

Losing yourself in the flavor of the month
Gotta be a better reason to colonize a star
Gotta be a better reason man's come so far

A moment of bliss that we hold
A firecracker flash of light then on
To the next plane soul remain
Come along if you dare
It's gonna be that you're scared
Lovely life I thank you
For the reason to see the pain through

Light a candle for the dead
The wick is burning returning what we have
It's who we are
We'll reach you if you're beyond the furthest star

Don't give up the fight to stay alive and even if
you have to
Find the reason of another's pain if they lose you
If not for your self then those around who care
like I do
One day you'll see the clear blue

Beyond the Gray Sky

The wick
It's who we are

One day you'll see the clear blue

What made you want to end it all
Wasn't there something I should have tried
To help you see beyond the gray sky",Beyond the Gray Sky,2003
311,"I want the words, something you haven't heard
Will I find them and will I have what it takes to say them?
In the world beside this one, there are no lies
And no suspicion, only dreams without end

You gotta feel what I mean
Look into my eyes and know 
I'm trying to come clean but I stumble every time
And then the words they escape, fail to take shape
It's all in the code now, come again

Look into my eyes and know 
I'm trying to come clean but I stumble every time
And then the words they escape, fail to take shape
It's all in the code now

Will you let me retract, let me take it back
Sometimes my words lack and my mind flies off the track
What I'm trying to convey is miles from what I say
And you slip away

In life there are times when nothing will rhyme
There are days I slip when I know I should climb
Breakin' the vows I swore I'd never break
A harsh word, a white lie, easy to mistake
Where have you been, haven't you noticed?
There's no map that exists to point us out of this
My heart was the target, it found your arrow
Baby, you know I want to be your straight and narrow

I been trying to transmit a feeling
I been hoping you receive what I'm revealing
See the main thing is hang with me and relate
As we communicate watch out 
Fenced in like a dog between houses
Balled up by the trouble my mouth gets
Wrapped up in the things that I don't know 
Don't you know 
Hoping that you crack the code oh

The first to crack the code
You may not think I'm ready to have your love again
Oh, whoa, whoa (you may not think I'm ready)

I'm trying to come clean but I stumble every time
And then the words they escape, fail to take shape
It's all in the code now 

Didn't I know I'm wrong, wrong, wrong when you knew
You didn't have to give me so long, long, long to see through
Not predictable what I will do, but you know
Cause you cracked the code

Your body is a country that you know I'll return to
Craving like a family heirloom that I am into
No, baby, how could I follow everything you do
Just remember when we touch, I feel so renewed

The first to understand me, that would be you
It can't work if we can't be open and true
The best thing to happen to me, let it be told
That would be the moment that you cracked my code
Oh, whoa, whoa

You may not think I'm ready to have your love again
Oh, whoa, whoa (you may not think I'm ready)

Guess that's why I live it

Followed by weeks of thrift 
I land on earth's hard face

And now a pointless display

Carry on and you won't feel withdrawn

Tim is from the '70's and so we live it
SA has the wisdom of a nobel laureate
I'm down for our days of glory

A rhythmatic genius, turnin' up the next one
Would you know, you're a bro, I flow in that circumstance
You'll get your chance

Because payback is a motherf**kin' mission
To the sharp-a** rocks slippin' on us but we rock
It comes to writing on us derision
Sendin you a voice now we're sending you a vision

Try to bring us down but in reality it make you look like a clown

Are rumbling through this cursed universe where death is birth
Think not but what your manifest is worth
Giving up a verse the curse occurs a thirst
To burst first breaking through the center of the universe
Slamming down on the lingo flow so jam to the bumrush single
Long ago has been become now when you find out there's no break

Here's an ill kid, pimpin' 'cause he is so slick

Steps from darkness, his body electric
A drone buzzes the air, a cracklin' tone
Then boomin' like thunder in a cosmic jungle
Death defyin' like Knievel, he feeble

Words that will wobble, awkward and evil
'Cause he flow and rock the hardest of the crowds A marvel pow, how you like me now?
I've returned, the kiss of death, the last Damien
From the abyss, fresh eternal alien

Now famished from pathless way, I may do damage
To the whack MC's, I know you can't stand this
Right about now, get down, I'm the annihilator Rockin' with the rhythm of my rhyme detonator

They spent contemplating, formulating, theory siring above me swimming
Pay tribute to the few we look up to

Walking and talking
Low down and evil

Would everybody just look at the hook
I took it strait from my brain
Reminds me of the time I was insane
And so I wrote it when I was loaded
And voted the least likely to turn out like a square

I'm singing it for your mind and no
I'm singing it for your ears
Jump up and down and leave the ground and know that's why your here
And they say down diggey down down, down diggey diggey down,stronger, longer
Line up your ways of know what I'm thinking say it again

And now I'm with my home team back with a good seat
I gladwick like chadwick to tell you what I mean
Were laying back on it just like good sex

You'll maybe get dizzy with a scence of vertigo

But love
But love in my blood sonic in the vortex

Believer (what's up)

In a minute, everything you have can all be straight gone
In a minute, things you thought were tied can come straight undone
How about some knocks on wood, some so far, it's so good, any day
What you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out
To the north and south, that's what plates are about
Nature has no conscience, no kindness, or ill will

But the dreams they had make me sad because of the vibes of them
When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened
To me and my family, my bros and I were driving The RV bleeding flames, 

Us leaping through fire, surviving
Zoned with no home, there was fire all on it
Umm, let me have my life, I want it

[Repeat: x4]
(I'm gonna...)

I'm gonna let you know that I said

And I say know no critical border â??cause
We do what we want
Got more funky styles that my laser jet got font

Not one to get over sounding like the norm Friendly to the radio, all that s*** is corn
All we coming with is a little bit of swing
And we go on like it ain't no thing
Omaha Stylee, did not think there was one
Where you know the radio's weak and the shows are more fun 
But you know we f*** up the dancehall since 1988
Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state
Still we're down like that x3
Makin' the funk that smells of skunk

But you know we f*** up the dancehall since 1988

The dancehall that we come from was a pool table basement
The fun was low key, and the records were, too, major fun

Such occasions occur back in the day
It begins, you're a raw kid all the way
Son of a gun, but there you drifted
All are endowed but few are gifted

At the break of dawn behaving like a spy
Lampin' in the light the cold world awakens
Deeper is the light to open up the sky
Look into my eyes and see them dilatin'

Omaha Stylee is the s*** we come with, man
Embedded in our souls, it breathes out from this band
We always knew that we could
Thank you if you, too, felt we would 

We will arise, explore these worlds and find the gra**roots
How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew
My dude, on the one, come off like Teflon
Rock your s*** and you will rise on  If you're a farmer out standing in your field say (uhh)

Do as you will do as you wish follow your bliss say (uhh)
We travel 'round the country, giving it our best 
We like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest
The hammer and the chisel and the rule and conquest

We forged the sword, the chariots of war, our battle axe 
There's much power in anger, but love's a bigger banger 
Complete props to my crew
'Cause this is how we do

A shortcut's a self defeating means, if you cannot do it clean
You'll never reach your reward
And when the day is done, what you receive is the sum
Of what you took out, from what you put in
Times deep in a dream seem a veiled realm
Shadows what I think and feel is real
Times in our tribe feel the tribe when we thrive

You’ve got so much to discover
Can’t you conceptualize
What you’re doing to our mother

Those drugs that you choose
Leave you left with the blues
Trust me I've been there
To me it's old news

Pending disaster
You’re heading there faster
It's tearing me up
To know you get so plastered

Because you’re caught up in the scene
At the age of nineteen
Maybe so was I at the age
But I had a dream

And those goddamn powdered drugs
They’ll fill you with doubt
You’re just getting sucked on up in it
And you have to break out

You blacked out on the floor
You told me, the next day they found you that way
Those damn medications had your back baby
It hurt when they took them all away

You’re feeling so bad
You’re looking for a place to land
Help me understand
How in hell it got so out of hand

I know that it's hard
But you’re risking being permanently scared
You’re hurting inside
So you’re flirting with tragedy on the dark side

Those drugs that you choose
Leave you left with the blues
Trust me I’ve been there
To me it's old news

Hey little brother
You messed up another chance
Sooner or later you must take a stand

At the edge of it
All where you begin
To consume that product to its very end

How much time is left
Will you collapse
Will you confess you're in a spiritless void
Spinning into excess

You blacked out on the floor
You told me, the next day they found you that way
Those damn medications had your back baby
It hurt when they took them all away

You’re feeling so bad
You’re looking for a place to land
Help me understand
How in hell it got so out of hand, go",Little Brother [*],2005

The flow won’t stop
Pressure still won’t drop

Backwards we fall

All stressed out, working until your eyes bleed
Overtime to buy things we don’t need

Always on the go and you’re thirty thirty
Gotta make the ends and get dirty dirty
Will it ever stop will it ever end, is it worthy?

Reality of this is you go loco loco
And too much of this way and you’ll go postal postal
Happens all the time just get in line and go comatose

The moms and pops have all closed up shop
And who can blame them? I don’t know anyone
The kids just hide scared to go outside
And just who can blame them?

And at times it seems unreal
We can see but we can’t feel
And no one’s at the wheel
Born here all alone
Growing old with hearts of stone

I jump into the valley of the far from mundane
My knees buckle a chuckle chuckle
Muthafucka I get back up like there never was a scuffle

Strange like a tale from Brothers Grimm

One or the other sink or swim

There’s no where else I’d rather be, for me

Get ahead, leave behind lose your mind
Find in time a nowhere rhyme

Chemicals up in the atmosphere
Another meteor is falling near
Buried in the headlines disappear
I’m not the type to live in fear
You dream but I know you’re awake
Explaining a nightmare you couldn’t shake
Maybe the Kool-aid that you drank today

We’re breaking away from the past
Reaching a new plane at last
Regardless of what cards get played
No one can keep you afraid

Unless you wanna be
You make that choice indubitably
They wanna play my emotions
But I’m like the ocean
Too calm to get upset by somebody’s notion

Future makers, organ takers
A non-human intelligence is guiding
Worlds colliding, far away star system
I string DNA where I need ‘em

What we gonna get with a zero field
Gotta have the one to make it real
I tell ya that more will be revealed
The mystery don’t bother me
Everyday masquerade
There’s always too many plans we laid
Keep going faster down the grade we made

We’re breaking away from the past
Reaching a new plane at last
Regardless of what cards get played
No one can keep you afraid

As sure as we’re spinning
For it’s never ending from here

I am sorry I’m not sorry
Hate me later
There's something greater
From the petty here and now

Years later on a Monday thinking something
Would come from doing the same thing

Bout time to give up on the same old stuff I’m stuck on
Just say that it went wrong and move it along

It’s just how it goes sometimes.

You gotta keep on climbing the hill
'Cause if you think you’ll make it you will
Go swimming quick like a fish and every wish will be fulfilled
Strike up and start the parade
Cutting down the weeds keep slinging the blade
And when they fire that warning shot
You’ll have a spot made in the shade

Standing at a side street station
Feeling like a one way on the down low
Flying solo till further delay
Easy blame it on procrastination
Always hoping somehow that the nonsense
This time will make sense, stuck in circles
Faces in the sunshine they never look at mine
People just walk by and keep their eyes low

That’s how it goes sometimes

You gotta keep on climbing the hill
'Cause if you think you’ll make it you will
Go swimming quick like a fish and every wish will be fulfilled
Strike up and start the parade
Cutting down the weeds keep slinging the blade
And when they fire that warning shot
You’ll have a spot made in the shade",Made in the Shade,2014
311,"Never thought it would come easy
Slow as turning soil
That’s the only way to reach me that much I am sure of
Bring it to a boil

Just take your time, thoroughly
Let the seasons be the air you
Breathe in and out
Patiently
Wait for spring’s returning

Try not to think too far ahead
The pendulum swings soon enough
We could stay on this side instead
But we wanna make it rough

(Ahead)
(Instead)

There were times I thought I’d get there
I know you thought so too
The days have bled together now, anyway will do
If you’re looking I might have it but
you have to look to see
The image you have of me is
What I’d like to be

I was so good at pretending
And denying when things bothered me
So shut the front door I’ll
Kick in the back
Metaphorically, I’m hoping

Try not to think too far ahead
The pendulum swings soon enough
We could stay on this side instead
But we wanna make it rough

Make it rough ’til they put you in the handcuff
Seeking out minds that are not yet corrupt
Woi-oh woi-oh and away you go
I’m a go on til the god damn juice gone
Far enough into the journey to feel the satisfaction yes
Action speaking louder than bombs and we just go
on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on and on

Try not to think too far ahead
The pendulum swings soon enough
We could stay on this side instead
But we wanna make it rough",Make It Rough,2014
311,"We are not so different, you and I
No matter what we think
We’re kicking against the traces, bludgeoning
Trying to make it sink

We’re stepping into the unknown
Peeling layers of the onion right down
'Cause that is part of my style to
Risk to be left with nothing
In pursuit of chasing something out of hand
I know, I know don’t tell me

I’ve been on this earth, I know the moon like a friend
I hear a tune or someone sing, feel the beauty in them
These words, woman we have some children
I got memories with you, I wonder, how it ends
It’s beautiful yes, what we have chosen
With love in our hands we have made this garden
And I think I can ride although I’m not a horseman
But I have a patient mind and it’s open

We don’t want to walk into the gray
Solo rolling with no map in hand
So we reach out for someone to grasp
Keep from sinking into the sand

Pick it up now brother help another pick it up
Don’t get stuck in the destruction looming near
Pick it up now brother help another pick it up
This is the revelation of the year

Picking up all the pieces here and there
To see if one might fit
Spinning them around and sideways and up and down
It kinda stings a bit

Digging through all the ditches
Just unwinding all the stitches, into thread
Then hang it out to dry so
What was I expecting 'cause collecting balls of lint up in my hand?
I know I know don’t yell at me

I know you’re tired of the same routine
You have a look on your face
I think I know what it means
Out of sorts in a vast machine
A worker bee up in the scene never will be the queen
And yes sometimes you have to sting
Expose the schemes to unlock the dreams
Ignite quicker than the gasoline
To mask everything again in a smokescreen

We don’t want to walk into the gray
Solo rolling with no map in hand
So we reach out for someone to grasp
Keep from sinking into the sand

Pick it up now brother help another pick it up
Don’t get stuck in the destruction looming near
Pick it up now brother help another pick it up
This is the revelation of the year",Revelation of the Year,2014

Maybe something that I wrote
Out sailing in my boat
I’m not really sure

I’m still singing the same tune
I’ve been kicking around since June
All morning and afternoon
Now it’s all a blur

I’ve been listening to sea shells
To hear the stories that they tell
Of high times and tide swells
That have yet to occur

Backsliding down the drain
Partially taking all the blame

Chasing coins to fill the purse
Is it really better or for worse
Is it a blessing or a curse
To pass the buck

Is it a bounty or a bust
Is it precious metal or just rust
Well it seems it’s up to us
So wish us luck

I kept making a U-turn
Ended up with a sunburn
But the lesson that I learned
Was worth the skin that peeled

I climbed so many mountains
It’s not even worth counting
All the drinks in the fountain
Before it was revealed

Backsliding down the drain
Partially taking all the blame

From the copper to the kettle
The stamen to the petal
We watch the value of sand dollars crumble

Chasing coins to fill the purse
Is it really better or for worse
Is it a blessing or a curse
To pass the buck

Is it a bounty or a bust
Is it precious metal or just rust
Well it seems it’s up to us

I mean what the hell was I thinking

I could feel the blood racing through my body, and know that I'm growing distant from the world

Where there's nothing to find and there's nothing to hide

Your breath fills my skin, all the way in
In the event of an emergency, I'll ask for your saving again

Return to now, as we are opened wide
Underneath the haze of lights and scents of cigarettes and lies
So say your goodbyes and let it all die tonight
'Cause you have every chance to close this, and let it all in and out of sight, where there's nothing to hide, where faith buries strike

Your breath fills my skin, all the way in

His mum and dad both left this earth, why
It was the drinking that killed his mother
He's watching the same thing kill his brother
And he doesn't say it much but he really loves us
And he doesn't want the same thing to kill his sons

And I'm hoping there's a heaven
I want to meet again

He's ready and he doesn't need a map to find it
It's the muscle in his chest that is pumping all the blood until he's dead,
Knowing nothing will be left
And he can't let it go, it's hard to let it be
And you can call it pride, but he can't accept defeat

It ain't whether he can do it yo, he's got no choice
Now he's got his armour on, and they cannot stop him
Shoot what they want to, watch the bullets bounce of him

She wants a boyfriend now, go and have a closer look.
Talk about a bad choice, yo she wrote the book.
She's been talking to this guy for a while and he wants in,

You turn a small thing into a massive deal.

Most the time you just fight with the weak

Living in the sex and the drugs and the rock and roll.
I'll admit it though I lost control.
I met a girl with a positive soul,
She regretted that she ever went and got involved.
Couldn't handle all the people talking,
I let them keep going and I keep ignoring.
I'm past those days always keeping score,
And I said it and I meant it, that ain't me no more.

I used to play basketball, that was me every night
I wanted to play college too, yo I'd reach for the sky

I had to stop playing, what should I do?
When ball was the only thing I wanted to do
Listen, that forced me to focus on music
Pez sat me down like ""bro we can do this""

I wanted everyone to see me as the hard guy
Walking around with my mates trying to start fights
Hoping they wouldn't want to 'cause I can't fight
Thinking back now that shit could have ended crazy
I'm just glad that situation never faced me
Back then I was thinking you could never change me
What a dickhead, that's not how my parents raised me
See I wasn't facing the facts
Acting crazy, wishing I could take it all back but
It took one of my mates to get stabbed just to realize
This shit wasn't a game, it was wack
That's how I wrote so fake so easily

Probably was the best thing for me

But thanks to the crash yo I made this song
So now I ain't afraid to see the day that I die

Have a look and you'll see me up there flying in it
It's a nice view, sometimes you might lose
But understand when you fall you can fly too
Don't let anybody tell you what you can't do
Don't let them enter in your head because there aren't you
And understand you could have anything you want

I just wear earplugs and sit there and watch

Moving bumper-to-bumper until your arse hurts, all to get your car searched
And if your alcohol you're stressing 'cause you need it bad
Stashing bottles of vodka up in your sleeping bags
Maybe get a spare tyre with a heap of cans

And you gotta time it so you peak it while the acts play
Try and jump the fence and start sneaking into back stage
If you get caught by police then try to act straight
Nah, they're not those pills, I need them for my back pain
And dudes are flying, saying to their mates ""I love you man!""
Or on a walk so they can go and call their Mum and Dad (it's Pez)
And then there's people who so desperately just need a friend

'Cause all that time out in the sun left you covered in burns
And smothered in dirt, the sight of all the dunnies is worse
And all the food shops are gone when you're so hungry it hurts
All you wanna do is sleep but you got packing to do
Then squash up in that car and jump back in a queue

But now days everybody's got it twisted

38th Parallel,"You broke the bread, You poured the wine,
You spoke your mysteries to stretch my mind
See I didn't quite follow,
How was your flesh in the bread that I swallowed?
Dipping bread in a dish, calling out a traitor
I'm hoping you'll explain this sooner or later
I'm living with confusion, It's like a bad dream,
Tell me, what's the conclusion?

[Chorus]
Three times denied
Thought I was strong but it seems I was wrong
Now I see, since now I've three times denied
Your name, I'm stained with shame
This wretchedness becomes my fame

Your accusation, it plagues my mind
Your prophecy leaves me horrified
Denied you ain't never gonna be,
Of all your crew, how could you think it was me?

That would break your heart and make you moan
Forsake your name, leave you alone
With the sting of a coward's lie
The signed decree that declares you die

[Chorus]

Nightmares run through my brain
Cold sweat covers me like a sickening stain
In this place between asleep and awake
I shake from the cold and the fear of heartbreak

And in the glow of the fire I turn into a liar
To scared to say 'I know'
And like a sheperdless sheep I run and I weep
As I hear the cock crow

[Chorus]

You said three times
My son do you love me?
And I said 'My Lord God, you know that I do'

I'd give my life to touch your flame

Though the road is hard

It seems to me there is no way around this
From all you've done for me
I know you'll never break your promise

So here at the end of this day
Where the world is shaded in gray
I will look to the blue horizons and watch for you to come
When my hope is tattered and torn

When my faith is weathered and worn

I am still running that narrow line

I'm not enough Chorus So here I am Broken on my knees stretching out my weary hands Grasp them and lift me Help me to find a rest in your arms that can change my state of mind I stagger the earth with one defeated sigh I once was longing to live now I'm longing to die Having attained everything that I desired was not enough Not enough to quench the thirst for life, for hope for peace Captive to my pride now I beg for sweet release And then a voice breathes in whispers to my soul ""I am enough, I am enough"" Chorus Set my awkward steps straight in line Move me to walk this life with your hand in mine",State of Mind,2002

On the brink of eternity cold and alone I shrink 
At the festering obscene corruption 
And my silence in the face of this mass destruction

All rise, abandon your shadows and cut ties to your selfish pride 
Fix your eyes on the sun 
Get burned on the in side and turn these tides

Hearts far to hard to challenge a sadness that's draining 
The soul of a generation 
Blanketed with tears are faces of nations

And truth is a homeless traveler hoping in the night to be found

Dans ce décor, je compte sur mon binôme pour m’épauler
Si on est pistés, c’est que nos rimes en gênent plus d’un
S’ils nous veulent morts, c’est que ça en arrangerait plus de deux
Pas le temps de pleurer sur mon sort, à quoi ça servirait ?
Juste prier qu’on s’en sorte et amasser comme au quinté
Voir ces gens s’ruer en masse à notre sortie
Les voir kifer en concert dans la troize partie
Leur dire qu’ici ou ailleurs, c’est le même quotidien
Si c’est la merde dans ton coin, c’est que c’est pareil dans le mien
Que ces salles deviennent trop des saloons

3ème Oeil,"Couplet Jo Popo
C'est pour tous ceux qui tiennent le Troize depuis qu'il est ce qu'il est
Ceux qui nous ont soutenu dans les patelins les coins les plus laids.
Ceux qui pendant les moments les plus durs ont su nous rassurer
Epaulés comme on l'a été on s'devait d'assurer
Pas le droit de vous décevoir les gars j'ai pas failli à mon devoir
J'ai pas l'intention de m'égarer, j'compte bien ravitailler tous ceux qui sont ivres de ce son
Qui te marque comme un suçon
Marseille et sa production on donne le ton, un degré au-dessus.
Que tu le veuilles ou pas, la rébellion partira d'ici
On n'attendra pas la 3ème guerre mondiale pour faire parler de nous
On n'a pas l'intention non plus de poser un genou à terre sauf pour un jour faire nos prières
Quand je pense à tous ces mômes qui miment nos mots ça me fout de la fierté
Et me pousse à aller de l'avant et plus haut
Loin d'être une idole en poster dans la chambre de ses dames
Jo Pops écrit ses textes aux côtés de Marie-Jane
A qui j'raconte mes histoires mon bonheur et mes drames
Ce qui nous entoure mon quotidien, la rue, le béton, ses tours.
Big up à tous ceux qui jumpent du début à la fin non-stop
Ceux et Celles qui ont fait avancer ce putain de Hip-Hop

Refrain
C'est pour ceux et celles
Qui n'ont pas peur de mouiller les aisselles
Ceux et Celles qui mouillent le maillot sans chercher querelles
Ceux et Celles qui portent le Troize dans le coeur
Ceux et Celles qui bougent jusqu'à pas d'heures

Couplet Boss One
Que ça plaise ou non comme dit Bob on fait quand même
Pour l'amour de cette musique qui sort de tes enceintes il faut qu't'aimes
Des années de lutte qui à mes yeux ne resteront pas vaines.
Au bon vouloir de Dieu c'est chacun sa veine, ses joies, ses peines.
Tout risque a son prix et toute médaille son revers
A force de se prendre pour Dieu le père
On finit seul psycho suicidaire.
Si le paysage s'assombrit,
C'est que bon nombre n'ont rien compris
Epris de succès, à tout prix de la jet Set faire partie
Grâce au Tout-Puissant on a fait des fidèles
Sans être des idoles
La tête sur les épaules, en rendre plus d'une folle.
Plus d'un fan, plus de deux fous
S'perdre en si bon chemin t'es pas fou non
Le but atteindre le sommet d'une échelle graduée,
Qu'aux yeux de tous on passe pour des mecs gras doués
Le Troize motivé comme mes frères c'est don't sleep
La hargne aux yeux on sort le son
L'essence des bons comme des mauvais types

Que les excités oublient d’être fâchés, cloués comme des piquets

Epaulé d’Pops et Sat, alcoolique acolyte
Pour servir cette masse en quête de sensations fortes
Son de contrebande ou légalisé comme le hah
Au fait, si tu te demandes d’où ça sort, du 3ème arrondissement
De sortie pour donner c’qu’il faut et comment
C’est sur nos sons, nos rimes, nos tripes qu’on s’ra jugés
Dès qu’on s’échappe de scène les sceptiques doivent adjuger
Dans ce cercle vicieux on s’veut peu prétentieux
Messieurs, le 143 régale les envieux

Quelle joie, quel bonheur de retrouver tous nos excités rien qu'à l'idée de vous retrouver j'en suis tout excité 
Trois ans d'absence on en ressent une grosse nécessité
Merci pour l'accueil du 1er au 100000 qui ont participé
Grâce à vous cette aventure est devenue formidable, 
Le Troize compte parmi les groupes incontournables, vu qu’il y a demande
Faut qu'on offre Sat, Jo Pops, Boss One c'est la race qu'on te décoffre, 
Et si tu es d'accord avec c'qu'on dit : ya foye ! 
De quoi tous vous remettre d'accord, le Troize est de retour,

Couplet Don Choa
Des vapeurs toxiques, pas de tox sick, que des affamés,
Gonflés à bloc, chiche, enfoiré, do you smoke shit ?
Prêt au choc, seen ? Pour tout cramer, ça finit jamais
Pille le stock, chie sur les porcs qui dorment et rmmmh, pshiiiiiit
Mon armée, kamikaze, marche sur le fil
Opération, ouvre le gaz, crame sur le grill
Explosion dans la chaleur de la nuit, peur sur la ville
Plus de héros, si, Don Cho ! Mais appelle-moi Kahil
Séronégatif à mon dernier test

Couplet Boss One 
Douze mesures pour dire à ceux que j'aime l'amour que je leur porte 
Dire à ceux qui me détestent, qu'ils courent tous à leur perte 
Qu'on joue tous la même partie avec des dés différents 
Clame ton innocence si entre nous y'a différent 
FF et le troize sur un son de Luch’ c'est ""op"" 
Autant que Saïdou en mission en Bosnie 
Es-tu pret ? 
II faut si peu pour égayer une vie valahé 
Chez nous soit contient que l’honnêteté prime Walahé 
Si les crimes d'amoncelles c'est que plus rien ne se négocie 
Si les bled paumés deviennent dangereux ? C'est qu'ils existent eux aussi 
L'attitude des hommes bougent peu 
Seules les conditions progressent 
La fin on l'a grosse c'est dû à ça que nos rimes agressent 

Couplet Le Rat Luciano
Croire à la beauté du monde ou à la vie en rose
A la longue ça gonfle et à force on est toujours en rogne
C’est rare d’avoir le moral en hausse, même avec des ronds
On en devient morose, cherche les solutions mais tourne en rond
La vie c’est pas que drogue, sexe et pèze
La vie c’est dur mais faut être là sinon c’est toi qu’elle baise
Faut lutter sans trêve, jouer là où d’autres stressent, 
Causer là où d’autres s’taisent, jusqu’à c’qu’on en crève
Les tracas rongent mais pour isoler y’a pas qu’les bringues
Au bout d’ses rêves, pour y aller, y’a pas qu’les blindes
Pour être classe dans cette vie, faut pas qu’les fringues
C’est comme les braquages, pour les faire, faut pas qu’les flingues

Refrain

Couplet Sat
Comment oublier qu’on doit tous mourir, hein ?
Que si tu baisses ta garde, on t’blesse, on t’baise avec le sourire

A condition d’avoir une vie intense et de riches souvenirs
J’ai pas trop l’temps d’m’étaler ni de détailler
J’ai douze mesures avant de m’tailler, détaler,
Retrouver ses rues et caler, ses SDF étalés,
Ses histoires propres à nos coins, y’a ses foutues cages d’escalier
Si ces murs parlaient, ils te diraient à quel point l’cadre est sordide, 
Morbide, le Troize et FF c’est du solide

Unis à la vie par l’même péril, à la mort dans l’même périple

Couplet Menzo
C’est pas des paroles qui vont nous faire du mal
Enfoiré tu t’fais du mal, remballe
Tes putains d’critiques à dix balles, j’déballe
Parle de rue, mec, et je me régale
Les moments qu’j’ai vécu, d’ac’, n’ont pas d’égal
Parle pour les Khal’, du Comore jusqu’au Sénégal
Pour nos parents qui s’sont battus pour qu’on ait pas la dalle
J’me dois de pas râler, c’qu’on a fait, il le fallait
C’qu’on raconte c’est c’qui paraît
Qu’on s’le dise, on n’en a rien à carrer
C’est l’Troize, FF, Section Nique Tout, dites-leur :

Que chaque jour qui s'lève soit béni, 
Chaque parole broie des coeurs, laisse des âmes en furie, 
J'veux sauver ma gueule tant que j'vis, m'en sortir seul.

Qu'on fasse tant de bruit, entendent tant de cris, apporter tant de joie, 
Comme ce fameux soir où tu nous as vus pour la première fois. 
Que c'morceau soit en repeat dans ta sono 
Jusqu'à ce qu'elle serre dans le juke box du bar du coin, 
Autant de fois que nécessaire, que ton voisin s'arrache les cheveux

Ou on prend des coups
Qu'il n'y a rien de glorieux d'être aller à Luynes
Juste donner du soucis à cette mère
Que le chagrin assassine
Hier encore j'en parlais avec mon pote Azzedine

Tu sais on ne respecte pas ceux qui sortent de cet enfer on les jalouse.

Ne pas dire non plus que tous sont dangereux

Cette musique on y a consacré notre jeunesse sans regret
Et si c'était à refaire j'suis sûr qu'on le ferait sans hésiter.
tous ces moments de joie, de plaisir passés à ses cotés
Sont marqués dans nos cerveaux et nos coeurs jamais
Hip-Hop ça m'met bien dès le réveil, un rêve de gosse qui se concrétise
Rapporte de l'oseille une raison de plus pour lui rendre hommage,
J'l'aurais pas connue, je serais peut-être qu'un naufragé
Ou un jeune de plus qui pointe au chômage.
Oxygène pure pour un mec qui sort d'ces blocs durs.
Un besoin vital qu'on ressent en nous.
Et ça c'est sûr j'compte sur elle pour nous
en donner des meilleurs dans l'futur.
Envie de faire connaitre à la jeunesse cette culture,
C'est du JO Pop's girls and guys sur ce son jump jump ?
DJ fais tourner ta sélection, pour la section,
Mets-toi en condition, good vibration

Une bombe qui explose de Marseille à Bombay
Pas un coin du globe qui sous son charme ne soit tombé
Pas un ghetto qui manque de MC gradé
De Dakar à Conakry
D'Abidjan à Yaoundé
Tant de groupes qui cherchent percer, être fiables
Goûter un jour au succès et trouver les autres minables
Le son sur lequel la bourgeoisie s'extasie
Qui s'exporte de Dichili à Radjini
Ils ont la rage de Casa à Tunis, d'Alger à Paris
Parlent de monnaie, de faim, de police,
De gens qui s'unissent,
vibrent de Francfort à Montréal, Milan et Bruxelles
Ivres de cette musique qui de ces enceintes t'ensorcelle
Ca toast rap dur aux Antilles Timal,
Dans ces townships en Afrique ça reste illégal
Hip-Hop en Suisse à ce jour excelle
Pour tous devenu langage universel

Rapport de force pour décoincer des situations corsées
Sans ça, ce serait se laisser manipuler
Rapport de force avec ce patron qui voudrait te maquer
Qu'est-ce qu'il croit s't'enculé
Que tous les jours tu dois en chier
C'est prise de tête d'avoir l'impression de causer à un mur
Ou de se dire que de leur côté ils étaient trop obscur
Si lourd pour un gosse d'affronter un prof facho
Obliger d'avoir l'air fâcheux, sinon il te fait chier
Comme un contentieux qui te mène à l'évêché
Où ta figure fichée dans un fichier ça fait chier

Couplet Jo Popo
Rapport de force avec ces on n'sait pas à quoi s'en tenir
Selon leurs humeurs des fois on peut s'attendre au pire
Mais le pire c'est qu'ça retombe toujours sur nous dans c'pays
Arabes et noirs étiquetés comme des voyous trop d'inégalités
Qui poussent les jeunes à être irrités
Contrôles fréquents et musclés les cops abusent et se prennent pour Cassius Clay
On nous demande un peu de compassion envers ces gens-là
Si vous saviez ce qu'il s'passe derrière les murs des commissariats
Rapport de force dès qu'il y a arrestation
A chaque fois où ils croient tomber sur un gros poisson
Pendant qu'ils passent leur temps à nous faire chier
Les psychos, violeurs d'enfants ne font que s'éparpiller
A croire qu'ils voudraient tous nous voir crever
Comme si les bavures commises on les avaient oubliées
Inutile de vous prendre pour des super-héros
Alors que c'est les balances qui vous filent tous les tuyaux
Qui taxe les putes, qui met le shit au rabais.
Qui nettoie les rues quand il a des kilos à écouler
Certainement pas un enfoiré comme lui ou moi
Mais ceux censés défendre nos lois

Révolution, mot qui fait trembler l'Etat,
On y fait appel quand plus rien ne va,
Vu l'ampleur qu'ont pris les choses on y avance à grands pas.
Vu les conditions de vie on peut pas aller plus bas.
Allez leur dire, aux politiciens et ceux autour d'eux, qu'ils s'mettent bien en tête :
""c'est nous contre eux"". Y a trop de haine dans nos yeux
Quand j'vois les fausses factures, transferts de compte et dessous de table.
Que d'autres font la manche et n'ont rien à bouffer à table
Et ce bon père de famille qui trime pour un salaire minable,
Une mère seule qui élève ses gosses, vie de ces ménagères

J'suis si triste dès qu'j'entends parler de sévices ou de viol
Du qu'une petite est rouée de coups parce qu'elle portait le voile
Si triste quand je repense à mon bled
Quand j'pense qu'à cause de I'Apartheid
Aujourd'hui encore on décède
Quand j'repense à Kassim et Nasser
Ceux et celles laissés un jour sombre
Par leurs proches au cimetière
A ces mères qui n'ont guère eu l'temps
De dire au revoir à leur chair
Et ça m'fait mal au coeur de voir des soeurs qui s'déchirent
Ces situations me font comprendre
Que je suis moins à plaindre envier
Sinon que penseraient de moi ces orphelins de ces foyers
Ou ces gosses nés sous X qui n'ont rien demandé à personne
Et qui ont le coeur rempli d'amour et de tant de haine
En gardent un goût amer, ne peuvent se confier à personne

Je suis si triste quand j'croise des gens marqués
Par la dureté de la vie.
Ces p'tits vieux qui m'parlent de leur temps avec tant de mélancolie.
Si triste quand je remplis mon bloc-notes d'histoires dingues.
J'veux parler de ce qui t'touche
Que de m'inventer vies ou parler de flingues
J'ai mal au coeur quand je croise un sans-abri
Couvert d'hématomes
Qui attend le SAMU qui se plaint qu'on soit
Tous des enculés les hommes
Si triste quand je repense à ce môme qui me disait
En avoir marre de la vie .
Qu'il voulait rêver, que s'il aimait autant le troize,
C'est qu'on le faisait tripper,
Ca me fait flipper de lire toutes ces horreurs
Dans les faits divers.
Ce con qui bute sa femme , sa môme sur un excès de colère.
Si triste à chaque fois qu'il arrive malheur à ceux que j'aime
Ou que se déchirent les gens censés s'aimer,
Je suis si triste quand j'entends qu'un jeune vient d'y passer
A cause d'une bavure ou embrouille de quartier.
Son corps sur le trottoir, y est resté.
Ca rend triste, ça craint.
J'suis si triste, putain.

Je suis si triste dès que j'pense à Mumia Abou Djamal
Ces gens enfermés pour rien, ça m'fait trop mal
Si triste devant ces situations de barge en Algérie
Savoir que le monde part en couille.. trop de tueries.
Trop de folies
J'lis trop de détresse du côté du peuple afghan
Trop de main-mise de l'Occident sur l'Orient
Dégoûté de voir comme toi qu'aujourd'hui
Le respect fout le camp

Je suis aussi triste qu'une chanson d'Oum Keltum
Ou ce gus qui approche de la trentaine et qui chôme
sous ecstas, insulte sa mère frappe, sa soeur h'cheme

[Verse 1: Kiely]
Yo, if you don't like expensive things
Then you can bounce if you don't want to get it together
You could be out, 'cause I'm all about gettin' them things
From the truck to the house, to the gear and them rings
No doubt, coulda done it but ain't no hoe for you
Now I try to tell you but all you do is sit around
It takes more than hope and a dream
I got a mean team puttin' in work to get the cream, what

[Chorus: Lil' Kim (3LW)]
Money and hot rides (I need that)
The platinum and shine (I need that)
The house and the gear (I need that)
I'm sayin' baby (I... want... that...)

[Verse 2: Adrienne (Kiely)]
Life can turn you in so many different directions
Then I got a mind to win

I want everything, but I need to stay realistic
I'm gonna live this dream
(From hear on out, that's what I'm about)

[Chorus 2x]
[Verse 3: Adrienne (Kiely)]
Boy I feel for you, you think you have it real easy
You don't even have a clue

I'm gonna do my thang, sorry if you feel rejected
You need to do the same
(From here on out, that's what I'm about)

[Bridge: 3LW (Lil' Kim)]
I need these things, you can't supply me
It's too easy, for you to stop tryin' (Uh-huh)

I can't stick around with shady feelings

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
Jackpot, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at, where the stash at
Nigga pass that, up the bonds and stocks
And the canary yellow D flawless rocks
Introducing the Lil' Kim Shepard Watch
I'm on fire, 'bout to turn it up a notch
Keep ya yacht, I want ships inside my estate
With FullForce written on the license plate
Heliports and helicopters with gold propellers
Tryna have more cheese then mozzarella
I need stables, there's only one way to live (What's that?)
Horseback ridin' in the back of the crib
Two Indian braids like the Navaho
Yippi iy ya, yippi iy yo
Make this money, take this money
Ain't no way you gonna take this from me, ow
