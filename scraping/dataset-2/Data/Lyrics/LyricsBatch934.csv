Rita Wilson,"I've had bad dreams too many times,
To think that they don't mean much any more.
Fine times have gone and left my sad home,
Friends who once cared just walk out my door.

[Chorus]
Love has no pride when I call out your name.
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame.
I'd give anything to see you again.

I've been alone too many nights
To think that you could come back again.
But I've heard you talk: ""She's crazy to stay.""
But this love hurts me so, I don't care what you say.

[Chorus]

If I could buy your love, I'd truly try my friend.
And if I could pray, my prayer would never end.
But if you want me to beg, I'll fall down on my knees;
Asking for you to come back
I'd be pleading for you to come back
Beggin for you to come back to me.

[Chorus]

Yes, I'd give anything to see you again.",Love Has No Pride,2012
Rita Wilson,"You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love, never my love
You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love, never my love

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you

Never my love, never my love

You say you fear I'll change my mind
I won't require you
Never my love, never my love

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life
With me

Never my love, never my love

Never my love, never my love",Never My Love,2012
Rita Wilson,"Please come to Boston for the springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends and they've got lotsa room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe here I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston
She said ""No. Would you come home to me?""

And she said, ""Hey ramblin' boy now won't cha settle down?
Boston ain't your kinda town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""

Please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains so far that we can't be found
And throw ""I love you"" echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night till they come back around
Please come to Denver
She said ""No. Boy, would you come home to me?""

And she said, ""Hey ramblin' boy why don't cha settle down?
Denver ain't your kinda town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
'Cause I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""

Now this drifter's world goes 'round and 'round
And I doubt that it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I still need to lean to
Somebody I can sing to

Please come to LA to live forever
California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill
Please come to LA
She just said ""No. Boy, won't you come home to me?"" 
And she said, ""Hey ramblin' boy why don't cha settle down?
LA can't be your kinda town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
No, no, I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""

""I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""",Please Come to Boston,2012
Rita Wilson,"It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on",River,2012
Rita Wilson,"I want him, I need him
And someday, some way, whoa-oh-oh-oh, I'll meet him
He'll be kinda shy
And real good lookin' too
And I'll be certain he's my guyl
By the things he'll like to do

Like walkin' in the rain
And wishin' on the stars up above
And bein' so in love

When he's near me, I'll kiss him
And when he leaves me, whoa-oh-oh-oh, I'll miss him
Though sometimes we'll fight
I won't really care
I know he's gonna be all right
'Cause we got so much to share

Like walkin' in the rain
And wishin' on the stars up above
And bein' so in love

No, no he'll never do
No it isn't him too
They would never, no they'd never
Never, ever love

And wishin' on the stars
Or bein' so in love

Rita Wilson,"I am a lineman for the county 
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wires 
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation 
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that that stretch down south 
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you 
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you 
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line",Wichita Lineman,2012
Rita Wilson,"Tonight you're mine completely
You give you love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?

So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?,2012

You were on my mind

I got wounds to bind

So I went to the corner
Just to ease my pain

Ritchie,"Meia noite no meu quarto, ela vai subir
Eu ouço passos na escada, vejo a porta abrir
O abajur cor de carne, o lençol azul
Cortinas de seda, o seu corpo nu

Menina veneno o mundo é pequeno demais pra nós dois
Em toda cama que eu durmo só dá você
Só da você, só dá você iê iê iê iê

Seus olhos verdes no espelho brilham para mim
Seu corpo inteiro é um prazer do princípio ao sim
Sozinho no meu quarto eu acordo sem você
Fico falando pras paredes até anoitecer

Menina veneno você tem um jeito sereno de ser
E toda noite no meu quarto vem me entorpecer
Me entorpecer, me entorpecer iê iê iê iê

Menina veneno o mundo é pequeno demais pra nós dois

Você vem não sei de onde, eu sei, vem me amar
Eu não sei qual o seu nome, mas nem preciso chamar

E toda noite no meu quarto vem me entorpecer
Me entorpecer, me entorpecer iê iê iê iê

Ritchie,"Perdi a hora 
Mas encontrei você aqui
Desde aquela noite
Eu nunca mais me entendi
Você levou meu coração
E levou o meu olhar
Eu sigo cego, infeliz 
Querendo te encontrar
Pra conversar e te convencer
Te confessar quero só você

Não esqueci seu nome
Seu rosto, sua voz
Outro dia eu te vi numa tarde
Tão veloz
Você passou no circular
Pela Praia do Leblon
Corri atrás, tarde demais
Perdi a condição
De conversar e te convencer
Te confessar quero só você

Sei que isso não tem importância
Pra você não faz sentido
Mas a noite aumenta a distância
Me perdi no teu caminho
Me encontrei falando sozinho
Sigo sempre sem destino
Pra te encontrar
Pra conversar e te convencer
Te confessar quero só você

A vida tem dessas coisas
Olhe só nos dois aqui
Presos num elevador
Uma noite sem dormir
Zero hora no relógio
Legal você está aqui
E amanhã pela manhã
A gente pode sair
E conversar e te convencer
Se confessar quero só você
Pra conversar e te convencer
Te confessar quero só você
(Eu quero só você)",A Vida Tem Dessas Coisas,1983
Ritchie,"Diz prá eu ficar muda
Faz cara de mistério
Tira essa bermuda
Que eu quero você sério

Tramas do sucesso
Mundo particular
Solos de guitarra
Não vão me conquistar

Uh! eu quero você
Como eu quero!
Uh! eu quero você
Como eu quero!

O que você precisa
É de um retoque total
Vou transformar o seu rascunho
Em arte final

Você por mim e mais nada

From what we've seen
What can I do still loving you

Help a poor man fill his pretty dream
Give me pennies, I'll take anything
Now listen while I play

Watch the jingle jangle start to chime
Reflections of the music that is mine
When you toss a coin you'll hear it sing

Ritchie Blackmore,"You came along for a weekend
But you only stayed for one night
You pulled off your hair
You took out your teeth

Ah you know you're a living wreck

You said you were a virgin
Full of promise and mystery

Ritchie Blackmore,"Really hate running really hate the game
Looking at them all I want to be unborn again
Their suit is getting tighter although they're getting thin

Have we got our freedom no no no
Is it getting better no no no
Do we love each other no no no
Must we wait forever no no no

Ritchie Blackmore,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Ritchie Blackmore,"I stood out here once before
With my head held in my hands
For all that I had known of this place
I could never understand...

On the hills the fires burned at midnight
Superstition plagued the air
Sparks fly as the fires burn at midnight
The stars are out and magic is here...

I wished on the seven sisters
Bring to me wisdom of age
All that's locked within the book of secrets
I longed for the knowledge of the sage...

On the hills the fires burned at midnigth
Superstition plagued the air
Sparks fly as the fires burn at midnight
Stars are out and magic is here
The stars are out and magic is here...

So, the sisters smiled to themselves
And they whispered as they shone
And it was from that very instant
I knew I would never be alone...

While on the hills
The fires burned at midnight
Superstition plagued the air
Sparks fly as the fires burn at midnight
Stars are out and magic is here
The stars are out and magic is here...

Many stars were long forgotten
Many faded and became ghosts
Still my sisters glittered down from heaven
Always there when I neede them most...

And on the hills the fires burned at nidnight
Superstition plagued the air
Sparks fly as the fires burn at midnight
Stars are out and magic is here
The stars are out magic is here...

Ritchie Blackmore,"There have been many tales
Tainted by truth twisted by time...
Some choose to forget
Yet it still
Weaves webs in their minds...

And it seems like she's been here forever
Her branches as black as the seas
She's been through it all
By the luck of the draw
She became the old hanging tree...

She asked for nothing
Except maybe
A little rain...
They used her strength
To help them steal lives away...

And she witnessed the sadness and sorrow
To this day she still doesn't know why
But her heart broke
When they came with the rope
To declare her the old hanging tree...

Life stranger than fiction
Can make you want to cry
Roots could never stop her
From reaching for the sky...

Life stranger than fiction
Can make you want to cry
Roots could never stop her
From reaching for the sky...

Those years have all past
Lucky for us lucky for her...
Now, children play at her feet
And in her arms she cradles birds...

And it seems she's been here forever
These days are the best that she's seen
Still somewhere in the back
Of her mind is the time
She was known as the old hanging tree...

Yes somewhere in the back
Of her mind is the time

The bells are a ringing
On Mid Winter's Night
The moon sets all alone
And once again I try to sleep before the morning light

Too soon the sun will come a-calling over the hills in our little town
Too soon the snow will start falling over the worls without a sound
While in my room dreams are a-fleeting
I close my eyes one more time
All too quickly the dawn is breaking and I must leave the night behind.

Ritchie Blackmore,"A timeless and forgotten place,
The moon and sun in endless chase
Each in quiet surrender
while the other reigns the sky
The midnight hour begins to laugh
A summer evening's epitaph
The winds are getting crazy
As the storm begins to rise
As the storm begins to rise

Wild were the winds that came
In the thunder and the rain
Nothing ever could contain
The rising of the storm

In the wings of ebony
Darkened waves fill the trees
Wild winds of warning
Echo through the air

Follow the storm now, I've got to get out of here

In between dark and light in the underworld
Wrapped around your finger like a string of pearls
Smiling face, empty hand, 7 golden rings
Dancing through the starlight we began to sing

Diving right into the ground 'round the winding stair

Don't stay away too long this time
We'll raise a glass, maybe two
And we'll be thinking of you
Until our paths cross again, maybe next time

Let's remember the moments that leave us all too soon
We'll smile at the pictures still lingering in our minds

Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual

And here I sit
My hand on the telephone
Hearing a voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
Where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest

Ten years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
Oh and you brought me something
We both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms

And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing
With leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You are always so good with words
And at keeping things vague

Because I need some of that vagueness now
It's all coming back too clearly

And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

I love you so, never let go

As far as I could see
The winds that grew from out of the trees were calling out to me
Curtains blew in the Ivory Tower
Willows start to bend
The ravens flew to escape the fury as the storm descends

I followed fortune 'round the tower
Searching in vain
For through the mist 'round the old stone tower I only found rain
And though the cold, cold Ivory Tower was stony through and through
I laid and dreamed on a feather bed, my dream was of you
My dream was of you.

All time waiting
As the sun doth set in the haze
All time waiting

Though the waves were plenty strong
Down the twisting river Rhine
Following a song
Legend's faded storyline
Tried to warn us all
Oh, they called her ""Loreley""
Careful or you'll fall.

Oh, the stories we were told
Quite a vision to behold
Mysteries of the seas in her eyes of gold
Laying on the silver stone, such a lonely sight
Barnacles become a throne, my poor Loreley

And the winds would cry, and many men would die
And all the waves would bow down to the Loreley

You would not believe your eyes, how a voice could hypnotize
Promises are only lies from Loreley
In a shade of mossy green, seashell in her hand
She was born the river queen, ne'er to grace the land

Oh, the song of Loreley
Charms the moon right from the sky

You know you will ever be with your Loreley",Loreley,2003

I told the coachman, ""Just drive me on, 
It's the same old destination

I jumped out about five to nine. 
And I waved at the stage door-keeper 
Said, ""Mister, get me to the stage on time."" 
Oh, but the rain wasn't made of water 
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun 
So I slipped behind a rainbow 
And waited till the show had done. 

I packed my ammunition. 
Inside the crowd was shouting, ""Encore"", 
But I had a most funny feeling 
It wasn't me they were shouting for. 
So when the tall dark lady smiled at me 
I said, ""Oh, baby let us go for a ride."" 
And we came upon two drinks or four 
And popped them oh so neatly inside.

Like I knew he did a thousand times before
Voices seem to echo ""come talk with me a while
Just around the corner, just another mile""

A mystic's myth or fable, truth or fairytale

Said ""sit with me my darling, let's talk a little while""

And the road goes on, forever will I wander on the way to

Some things don't go as they're planned
Where are we going from here

Spinning in circles with riddles in rhyme
We lose our way, trying to find
Searching to find our way home
Trying to find our way home

As the day dies, with tears in our eyes
There's too few hellos and too many goodbyes
Silence answers our cries where are we going from here

I've traveled round the world
Always on the search for something new

When all the roads I've crossed
Always seem to lead back to you…

Old familiar faces
Everyone you meet
Following the ways of the land
Cobblestones and lanterns
Lining every street
Calling me to come home again

Dancing in the moonlight
Singing in the rain
Oh it's good to be back home again
Laughing in the sunlight
Running down the lane
Oh it's good to be back home again

When you play with fire
Sometimes you get burned
It happens when you take a chance or two
But time is never wasted
When you've lived and learned
And in time it all comes back to you…

And when I got weary
I'd sit a while and rest
Memories invading my mind
All those things I'd treasured
The ones I'd loved the best
Were the things that I'd left behind…

And I think my spaceship knows which way to go

I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day

Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me love me
And I would surely stay

And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old

When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thougt my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

And I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer
Just tryin' to earn a dollar

Well, I went to my boss
Who governs me
He said, ""No, dice, bud
You gotta work late""

Sometime I wonder
What I'm gonna do
There ain't no cure
For the summertime blues

Well, my mom and papa told me
Now you better earn some money
If one of you is gonna go
Ridin' next Sunday

Well, I didn't go to work
I told my boss I was sick
He said, ""You can't use the car
'Cause you didn't work a lick""

Sometime I wonder
What I'm gonna do
There ain't no cure
For the summertime blues

Gonna save two weeks
Gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problem
To the United Nations

Well, I went to my congressman
He sent me back a note
It said, ""I''d like to help you, hon
But you're too young to vote""

Sometime I wonder
What I'm gonna do

From New York to St. Louis and old Chicago by the way
To the hills of Minnesota where them rippling waters fall

In the hills of Tennessee many places throughout the land
When his earthly race are over and them curtains 'round him fall
[Incomprehensible] him back to Dixie on that Wabash Cannonball

We came down to Nashville on a warm November day
As we rolled into that station I heard somebody say
There's a boy from Carolina, they're wide and fat and tall
They came down to pick us a few, they rode the Wabash Cannonball

I woke up one day and planned to get reckless
Felt myself and put on my best necklace
Posted in the group chat, who wants to faaji?
They were only down for the after party
Hmmn, my body is ready
And it's sweeting me like I have jedi jedi
Who else would be hype? Who has the ginger?
Only this guy that I know through my sister
So I hit him up and told him let's roll
And he told me he'll pioneer the parole
Now it's a movement
The night can't waste
So I got some Henny out the stash for a taste
Went out for pre-drinks, squad was chill
But as the time passed, shit got real
I mentioned the movement they said they'll come through
Now them too were ready to do the do

The whole squad turnt and the music is flames
And we don't even know anybody here's names
Can't even front, I have no ragrets
Low key one of my best nights yet
Ooh I'm on a big wave
Everyone around me probably feels same
Nothing can phase me now

What am I gonna do?
I only have a three man crew plus two
A crew regardless, oh ya let's move
We can find a spot in the city for the groove
Get to the zone and bredda it's lit
Never seen a crowd get wild like this

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love is,2010
Rittz,"Once upon a time in an apartment home
Lived a little girl with a heart of stone
Cause part of her heart was partly gone
Rarely seen and hardly known
Treated like a mat on a boxing ring
Blood drop stains on the twin box springs
Daddy came to visit it's not a dream
She thought to herself what is happening?
Above her head is a crucifix
But Lucifer loosens up his wrist
Lays her down with an open fist
And all that was left was hopelessness
Little girl, where's your loving mother?
Under the covers,under the covers
Little girl what have you discovered
She stuttered 

[Chorus]
Growin' up in the gutter
No more, fairy tales, and so
No place like hell, no place like home
Growin' up in the gutter
Black and white, in a frame
There we are, safe and sound
Stray guns, no aim, yea!
Growin' up in the gutter!

(And you ain't gotta be from the projects, to deal with this nonsense)
'Cause even in suburbia somebody will murder ya
Over nothin' leave your body slumpin'
In the parking lot of your complex
Violence is a hard pill to swallow and digest
My town is full of drug dealers
Most of them get shot in the process
Hustlin' and stackin' up profits
They robbin' motherfuckas like they havin' a contest
Shit, he took a bitch to his apartment to brag
A week later he tied up on the carpet and gagged
Cause he showed her all the pills he had for sale for the low
She told her cousin then her cousin grabbed a Glock and a mask
Kicked in his door laid him down
Then he shot him and dashed
Ran off with all that he had
He used to be ballin' now he got a colostomy bag
What you know about that
Middle class white bitch slangin' her body for crack
Mexican drug cartels, you hear the buck shot shells and then the blood clot fails
There ain't no healin' the wounds
Biggest meth bust on the east coast right here in Duluth
My lyrics are proof
Of growin' up in the gutta

You think you can define how hard you got it?!
By what neighborhood you live in muthafucker
Wake up in the gutter!

[Chorus]

Slumerican indeed, I am
Drug through the mud like a weed, what I am
Was child who was beat, I am
Leather belts that made me, I am
Home alone again at eight, I am
Somebody's life to rate, I am
Given to the beast by fate, I am
The one who did escape, I am
A voice for the cold in the dark, I am
The one who sold his heart, I am
From a family torn apart, I am
A target for your dart, I am
Sick again from the whips, I am
Head to the gun and click, I am
A soul that don't run from shit, I am
Exposed to the goats of sin, I am
Met a ghost and he said, I am
In the basement in red, I am
Dead 'cause the Ouija board said, I-A-M

[Chorus]",Growin' Up in the Gutter,2011
Rittz,"See now my cup is full, my vibe is boosted
My fate is undecided, but it's going down the way that I choose it
Living life up on the stage and it's like I'm on display
And the fans coming through when they know every word to the songs that I fucking play
Bang the speakers out plus tears are leaking out
Girls in the crowd are freaking out, labels reaching out
Buzz is peaking out, when I'm doing everything I dreamed about
Man, I think I'm on one, saw the easy route, took the long one
And now they ain't ready for this crazy white boy
Running through the rap game like Donkey Kong
'Cause I be super smashing them I'm back with a rap attack
I'm homegrown and I grew the roots and it's about damn time that I flew the coop
So mother fucker let me show you what this dude could do
Going through the roof and I'm gonna hold my own
CT down to the bones, so anywhere I'm going you know I'm coming back
Because as they say, ain't no place like home so then I'm gone

We be riding, yeah we be riding on

I'm here to do my thang, so what you really know about that shit
Good kid in a fucked up game, suitcase still packed from the last trip
Like this and I feel alright, turned around my life
Started from the bottom, now I'm in the middle
Sitting first class on a flight and I still got fight
As long as I got a mic I'll recite the type of hype shit that'll spark ignite
And set the world on fire when I give it a light
You never heard of one like this in your life because I go so hard
Got these bars on me, baby, I'm a super star and the bass go roar
Like I got Simba trapped in the trunk of my car
R-R-Roger that the rhyme is [?], stepping on the gas pedal when I ride[write?] a track
Real shit, anybody that deny the facts, fuck you, ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody got time for that shit, the same kid crashing Datpiff
Is back to the smack the world off it's axis
I'm in the game now, you better go home and practice
Firework in the sky bitch, get so high, fuck around and hit a pilot
I'm just feeling like it really is my time, this rhyme shit ain't for the weak
Don't try this, at home if you ain't ready for the life, this game [?] whether or not you like it
So I'm telling you all the ups and downs so you can see the world I'm in, 
Looking through my eyelids

Ride on...yeah
Baby, where you wanna go
We be riding, we be riding
We be riding, yeah we be riding on

Came close to being [?][I could of made it?]
Frustrated with the industry, how can I motivate it
Feeling like the only loser that my parents pro-created
Watching homies that associated with me [?][Know I waited for my turn?]
[?] It was so belated, I was jaded, when I made it, it was hard to believe
Even harder for me not to wear my heart on my sleeve
But, people judging me in the public
And I started to read, the comments underneath my video, my skin is thick enough
It's hard to describe the feeling when somebody telling me that my music got them through when they were feeling like giving up
He standing right in front of me and [?]
Cause he enough with his girlfriend and they breaking up
He breaking up, playing my music it helps to lighten the blow
Player wishing to sleeping like 20 times in a row
Mouthing the lyrics when they hear it getting hype at the show, I love it
Ain't got no money, but I'm getting through
Gotta remind my self, time to time when I get in a depressing mood
I'm getting paid first[?]
[?]
Look at my dressing room
1,000 miles away they want an autograph
He said he like my deep records and my party tracks
I scribble things across the bottom half
It's Rittz and Chris Webby, you ready, let's hit the launching pad, let's fly

Got my foot up on the pedal till the sun goes down

You light the over cash you really hope with that
Could you light the darkness that comforts you
Like a compass do
Buzzer 'em like you just flew up the zoo
Higher than a middle school kid up on glue
Sucking really on mouth from dark alone
Fix faith the rub sticks we start the fight
Knowing that the real shit is coming soon
You could wind a song or two I heard it backwards
Wishing close my eyes and saw the blackbirds
Eating on a dead raccoon
Starting to think I'm bad when I was scared to say bad words
And for the internet making up Facebook passwords
I see Casper slow in my room 
When I pray I guess she come down and bring f words
People kill deal for the ant lords

I didn't really wanna let one live

Please let my girl know how much I love her
Sorry that we're both so unhealthy

I signed a record deal all these years
I wish I was more optimistic ,
I'm really just scared
What if they don't like what they hear
What if I don't make a career out of music
What am I supposed to do then
I'm always getting jobs
I hate to see my face in the mirror
And I wrote about everything so many times 
I don't have inspiration to spare
I barely even hear
I've been down on the road 
And I feel like I've been gone all year
Even when I'm home there's so much pressure to be here
It's hard to feel like I'm all there

So complain about us it's unfair
Some days I feel like I've been living in a dream
Other times feeling like a nightmare
And I need some of my peers

And I feel like my future depends on this

Gotta get some confidence up in my paymentship

Only to condensate something that you didn't attend my music

And fuck a maid keeping knocking reorienting
She give me oral then I told her you're a 10

It's a damn shame that I'm singing the last

And both out to shine like a barn bill

And the sound of shy day fills the room with jamma bitch which fills my pocket
I like to wiggle wiggle it more I'm a hussler
Walk around pimpin' I don't touch 'em
I thought you knew that pimps don't go to jail

In my old school bumpin' that ""Kiss of Life"" beneath the city lights
Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed
'Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight
This dream difficult for me to visualize
And that was real when they said the limit is the sky
But my feets on solid ground, no more stalling now
On the road to get it 'cause, when it rain, it pour
But now the storm finally calming down
Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining
My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds
I ain't got a bunch of money 'cause it cost to grind
Silly beats being burnt up with my stomach growlin'
In the darkest island, got the heart to fight
I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant
Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling
I'll be up in Neiman Marcus smiling
Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe
You could say that you played in the major league
Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave
I feel wet from the sweat on my famous tee
I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf

Right up 85 North, I never was
Working, breaking down doors and barriers
Still representing Georgia, I'm feeling the support
Spread the word 'cause the more, the merrier
Nobody blowing off the torch I carry
Got annoyed from every time they point and stare and judge
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde
And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts
Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down
In case you wanna come and duke it out
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce
And we just blew an ounce
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist
I got the backseat bass and the lobster bisk
And took a shot of whiskey to the dome
Made a toast to the homies that are gone
Two for the fans and the love they shown

Knocking on the door empty-handed uninvited
So I'm geeked up letting all the people know it
Better wake up, we ain't going to sleep home boy
After party checking out six in the morn'
You ain't really about this life, said we done too much

I guess you could say I'm blessed
Party favors stay on deck
Fans give me free weed as a gift but I'd rather have some yay instead
I live life on the edge
Don't step I try my best
Patent leather four on my feet looking like the wind dance every time I step
Follow me, don't be misled
This bitch just got undressed
Tryna act cool, have sex with the crew thinking that they might get her a picture with Tech
Lemme text, now it was cool to see you twerk now I wanna see you spread
Do a trick with it, make it smoke a cigarette
I ain't even fucking with these hoes
I be cutting out the blow, oh shit, now there isn't any left
I get drunk and I be cooking shit like I'm a chef
You don't wanna sit down there's a wet -
Spot from a thot that somebody must've brought on the bus

Rittz,"One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time
Back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday

Remember Valentine's Day twenty-ten
She was so upset 'cause I had to go to work
We ain't got to spend much time together lately 
'Cause the rap was finally taking off, I had to put it first
My boss said one of us can take off early
I was like ""me please"" 'cause I wanted to surprise her
So I drove to her job, turned my lights off in the parking lot 'cause she was getting off at five
My stomach giddied out when she came outside
She was walking with a guy, laughing and something didn't seem right
And when she noticed me she looked like she was busted doing something
Tryna kiss me, I said ""who the fuck is he, mucka?
Feeling was killing me, I couldn't even knee
I felt like she was hiding shit, I couldn't let it go
I asked her one more time is there something going on between you and him?
She looked at me and told me ""I don't know!""
You don't know
What the fuck you mean
You've been cheating on me, shit
Bet that her and him would kiss, crying
Telling me that all I do is spend my time writing, working nights, neglecting her
She don't love me like she did
Well the last 5 years were for nothing
Yeah we struggled but we loved each other now it's coming to a sudden end
Fighting, tryna move my furniture up out of momma's crib
Pack my shit, kiss our dog on the head then I left and I felt like
Death

One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time
Back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday

Stayin' the the basement of my mum and dads
Staring at her facebook every pictures that she posts every comment
Tryna' see if she gone' call me back on an over lonely heart
My mama said it's gonna' pass playing 80's music back to back, Johnny Hates Jazz Shattered Dreams
How am I supposed to live without you when I've been loving you so long, she already sending kisses
I wonder if she's started fucking him or not I bet you
I sent her texts saying I miss you she don't write back 
I know I shouldn't but at night I like to ride past
The house I used to call ours yeah my name's
Still on the bills scared to switch 'em thinking there's a slight chance
She's just going through a faze we'll get back together soon but it's two a.m.
I wonder where her car is and how the dog is I wish I could go inside and pet him
I never thought you would do me wrong bitch
I need to calm down, sadness turn to anger Xanax putting me into a deep depression
All I can do is wait now, shit I almost had a break down
Up at Tree Sound, we was mixing Wishin'
White Jesus just dropped everything I dreamed about when
I was younger is coming true while I'm in this position
It's like my life is finally supposed to be the shit but isn't chewing on the barrel of my pistol
Never visioned that this bitch would do me like this

One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time
Back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday

True Love
True Love is counted by the health, well-being
And happiness to another person to a greater degree than your own health and well-being and happiness
When you care for your saying of words, thoughts and actions
that’s specifically how you figure out a person, your love

A soulmate
A soulmate is a person who’s perfectly suited to another person’s temperament
A person who strongly resembles another person in their attitude and belief
A close friend who completely understands them
A person who has the same beliefs and opinions as another person

A douchebag
A douchebag is someone where you [?] at the end of a song
Just rinse the douchebag nozzle in warm water after using it
Let the douchebag dry completely, use twice a day
One day

One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away

Rittz,"This rap shit ain't a movie
Online gettin' turned on by a bunch of male groupies
That said they gonna shoot me or do something to me
When they see me them imaginary bullets go through me
Ask anyone who know me in the rap game say that I'm cool but you should watch how you pursue me
I find it confusing these dudes click on my dick so hard
Its like they grew a coochie homie you canoeing
Up shit creek, a thick beef stew was brewing
You talk about it so much I wish that you would use your toolie
On yourself blow your brains out, plus you suck at rappin'
If I was you I would do tattooing you stupid
Thinkin' I'ma argue with you online
So you could try to get views boo-hooing
Talking shit about me and all I do is keep it cool with motherfuckers
(Now I'm starting to feel the) hugest mood swing
[?] Why would you include me
Cause it takes a while to text you back
So many rappers sittin' there trashing
They expect I'm gonna let them have
A feature for free and get so mad because I'm busy and can't do it
Really that's what all this 'bout?
I feel like I got so many enemies I cannot keep count
Even homies I grew up with are mad I blew up and wanna knock me down
But I'm like Rocky Balboa can't count me out
And I ain't dumb I've been around tommy guns before
But I'm not the one to be gunnin' for
And this is karma you started it shut the fuck up country boy
You disrespected me
I ain't tryna' say I've been a G
I'm just me I hate their negative energy
Somebody should of told 'em let me be
This shit is stress relief, the haters rest in peace, cause

It's the day of the dead
Better watch where you're making your bed
Watch where you're layin' your head
Why the fuck would you say what you said about me
Don't try to come around me, nah
It's the day of the dead
Better watch where you're making your bed
Watch where you're layin' your head
Why the fuck would you say what you said about me
Don't bring them dudes around me, nah
Cause I ain't with that bullshit

I cannot relate or understand
A man that goes online to hate another man
Pussy boy they just type away
I'm tryin' hard not to write them a reply, but can't
And all the lames that all rhyme the same
On every record I'm guessing that they ain't musically inclined
They made the kind of statements
Oh, you saying Switch Lanes sound the same
As Heaven and Living the Dream and I could name
A bunch more Crown Royal, call 911
You can tell the difference between the flow on blow and wishin'
My Interview didn't you listen? I always switch it up
I'm thinking that these drones are slow
And they can't break down rhyme schemes
Heated cause they can't out rhyme me
And I ain't ever changing to try to get signed
And I ain't animating like say I'm Tech N9ne
But If you get me on a feature it's a straight up crime scene
It seems like every year that pass I gotta' remind you
I came through on my debut like make room
Its still the total opposite of shit from my sophomore
And still ain't got a sponsor from Monster
Jumping off the stage to hit a guy that flipped me off at my concert
They call me every name in the book
From white Tech to fat Yelawolf, see a friend jealous look
When they shaking my hand like I can't tell what's good
Cause I can't go and put people on just because
Man I wish that I was rich as you was thinking I was
Homies catching feelings acting like a bitch with a grudge
They liked it better when I was broke and depressed with a job
I tour three times a year if you mean what you said
And when you see me in your city tell me face to face
Cause you ain't real just another screen naming lame
Get out your black face paint and pray cause

It's the day of the dead
Better watch where you're making your bed
Watch where you're layin' your head
Why the fuck would you say what you said about me

I guess your eyes see us on that map and make you think we ain't a trap
But I'm from that North, N-A-W-F
North Atlanta, we for real

Eighty five north of Atlanta, home of the Gwinnett County Braves
Out-of-towners looking out of place 'round here
Think it's sweet and disappear without a trace
Cops on the dash see the plates out of state
Apartment complex got a gate but it ain't 
Safe tryna hustle 'round here think there's money to be made
You'll get robbed by somebody underage
We don't rock brands like Vans, only J's
We don't use words like hella or the bomb
So many celebs that live in Gwinnett
Tryna say Downtown when they tell you where they from
Me, I'm from the 'burbs, never had much, I'm 
White boy in black Hollywood representing Slum
Yeah, I got long hair, I ain't ZZ Top
I got diamonds on my pinky ring and diamonds on my charm
I'm incredible like Burt Wonderstone
Hurts when its done
Wanna battle me and you'll get murked one-on-one
We ain't on no battle rap
We used to rap about our habitat and all the work that we done
Camaro convertible, turbo, we're there with the purple
We stand in a circle and puff
Got these bitches they go twerking and sucking
If you ain't got 'em fucking then you probably ain't assertive enough
Make your girl have a crush and I'm far from a heartthrob
Middle finger up saying fuck Paul Blart
Cops got the K9 in the car lot
Someone just got shot up at the Marriott courtyard
Sitting in the car shot
People scheming to get Lamborghini money
They ain't tryna drive a Dodge Dart
Drug deal gone bad up at Wal-Mart
Better pay attention when you're pitching in the ballpark
'Cause

These streets can be misleading, and this one thing I know
Don't come around here flexin', I suggest you slow your roll
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold
They gon' get you for your diamonds and gold
Everybody want some diamonds and gold
And I'm dying for your diamonds and gold

I know in Georgia, shit ain't peachy, so fuck what you've been told
'Cause when this shit get greezy, we've been known to go for broke
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold

From a middle class neighborhood
From ninety-four to two thousand and five, I was up in Eagle Point then
A lot of people wasn't born here
Moving in and out, never know who the neighbor next door is
Drug dealers tryna build clientele
So they telling everybody they got it, that shit was short-lived
Jack boys get work, kick your door in
Talk to you on the phone, pistol-whip your girlfriend
Hit a lick for four grand, now they got some cash to fly
In high school, used lame kids to practice on
I made 'em empty out their pockets
Other kids dreaming of being astronauts
We were scheming to make a profit
The gun that's underneath the mattress drawn
Make it a chance of living half as long
A lot of homies from the past is gone
You wanna play games? Better train for the triathlon
'Cause ain't no games round here, ho
We ain't in no dorm room playing beer pong
Homies never made it into the millennium
Never forget 'em should've tattooed tears for 'em
Adam got a life sentence, he in Dooly State Prison
Send him money, if he need me then I'm here for him
We done smoked so much weed, smoking weed ain't shit
Doing any hard drugs we could get our hands on
Man Darren, he was clean, started fucking with that meth again
It wouldn't be GC without Mexicans
Claiming turf, gang signs spray painted on the picket fence
They gotta represent what set they in
Back in the day it was Breckinridge, Crescent Lake
Sweetwater, Saratoga, and The Falls just to name a few
So watch the lane you choose, and who you bragging to

I'm in the kitchen on that Adderall, focusing
I'm on the road, doing shows, with some hoes again
I hit the gas a couple times, then I hold it in
I'm in the street with the heat on the seat
In case I bump into police or I run into my foes again
'Cause I hear them niggas tripping 'bout the flavor that I'm kicking
And I'm down to start messing with the gold, you see
I been breaking down pounds on them Lortab 10's
On a bar and a half, and I'm going back in
If you ever see a foreign car sliding on rims
Up 85 North [?] that's him
Just drive, I see him, I see him, I see him
All black tint, nigga riding Nigerian
All white paint, we gon' call it Siberian
Loud pack on him, he ain't no librarian
Up from Mexico City, that's that Norcross area
Whole lot of killers gon' need a pole bearer
Drinking on brown, got you feeling barbaric
Still got a trap spot right on Harrington
Still got a trap spot, trappin' on Jimmy
I'ma dump the whole clip til it run empty
And my license expired, tell Rittz to come get me
We the only ones got a key to this city
My lawyer's suppressing the evidence
I had some dope in my residence
I had some guns in my residence
I would not tell on no Mexican, I would not tell on no Mexican!
They can indict it, I'll fight it, I swear to that
Shorty don't like me, I'm piping, I'm arrogant

You a cartoon drawer, motherfucker I'm Picasso

Rittz,"Welcome to the Jonny Valiant show
I'm about to blow
Independent with a hundred thousand albums sold
Rappers used to crowd around me funny now they don't
No one's in my lane, my competition going adios
No magician but I dissipate 'em in a cloud of smoke
Revvin' they engine up and I'm a thousand miles down the road
You ain't ever heard of me, fuck it now you know
It's hard to take you serious, and I ain't out of jokes
Most of the shit you rap about is unaccountable
Saying nothing, making noise with your mouth like you're out of road
Never seen an ounce of blow, flexin' like you Al Capone
So we can seek to sneak the brownie a la mode
Pocket full of bread, I ain't counting sour dough
Cheating on her from above, funny how the roles
Got reversed, when it was him, they never said, Look out below
Never tried to lend a hand, I was down and out and broke
With no balance in my bank account, and just a couple 'O's
Now we feast, I'll beat my [?] while we toastin' Crown and Coke
Weird where the talent go, now it's like there's no one left
Someone said you blowing up, they trolling on the social network
I murk my flows, I choke 'em out and never broke a sweat
You knock one out the box, now watch it 'cause a domino effect
You're not a monster so these ghosts or goblins don't oppose a threat
I ain't scared of no one, seen a hater and I told him that

If you don't start shit, there won't be none
'Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
'Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story

Go ahead and sound the horn, like every boring rapper does
I wish the dude behind the booth would pull the power cord
Just quit and do some shit you're good at
Your stage show is hard for me to look at
Like the unibrow on Al B. sure
The difference between our music's night and day
I'm getting busy but you shitty like a giant pile of cow manure
So watch that mouth of yours
I never thought I'd see the day it'd be okay to let these rappers dress like Shalamar
They wanna dance, suck a dick, fuck these kids, knock 'em off they balance boards
Beat 'em down and settle out at court
Ugly as fuck but these sluts pulling down they drawers
White bitches love me like an Abercrombie outfit stores
Sick and never found the cure, sipping on the Crown I poured
Wild and rowdy bumping Scotty ATL and (?) boy
Some dummy said I wasn't hungry since I made it and I'm famous
Bitch, I'm starving like the Army was in Valley Forge
Was dope enough to get a deal back in two thousand and four
I was born a killer, tried to warn 'em, better tell them boys

If you don't start shit, there won't be none
'Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction

Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story

I'm just really being honest y'all
I'm just sick of being modest all the time
When all these artists talk like they the hottest and y'all
They don't get away with murder
They just rhyming words together, ain't no substance to their monologue
They go on stage and spray the crowd with water
Rapping over top they vocals to this track
In fact, they sounding awful dog
We ain't playing volleyball, I ain't going back and forth
If you diss me and then piss me off, then I might smack you for it
Run up in the studio while you were on like everything
It's coolio, I jack you for your laps up in your mackie board
You think I'm playing, you mistaken
Shit, you faker than the movie Taken
You ain't got no skills you only act the part
Come and get a battle scar, thicker shit that's caviar
You fictional like Battlestar Galactica and Avatar
I'm on another planet and these rappers I'm on Saturn, Mars
Venus, Jesus, we the C-N-T and we just laugh at y'all
An open casket, I just killed a Kato track
If you feel it, play it back
Really, I'm just stating facts that

If you don't start shit, there won't be none
'Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
'Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none

Rittz,"Yeah
Sometimes I just get fucking pissed off
I just get sick of all this bullshit

Shit's sad growing up in the gutter
But I met a lot of kids, want to be like I am
It's weird, people see you on the come up
Then you happy with some money but I'm mean and I'm pissed
My girlfriend knows that I love her
But I mentally abuse her and I treat her like shit
We both suicidal, she a cutter
All I do is self-loath, what's the reason I live?
Bunch of empty liquor bottles in the cupboard
Lying to each other like next week we'll quit
Get drunk, make a straw outta dollar
But it's okay, it's only cocaine, not meth
My family looking at me like a fuck up
And they're right, and I don't want to disappoint my twin
I pray one day I'll recover
But it's like I'm tryin' to schedule an appointment with the devil
Lord knows I don't wanna die
So I'm begging, praying help me please
I lie like [?] in the summer
With anxiety and I ain't got no self-esteem
Lot of people are going wanna tell me shut up
Cause they got it way worse, I'm a selfish piece of shit
Make a motherfucker wonder, what it's gonna take for me to change mentally
Bags underneath my eyes cause I live too fast
Grey hairs on my beard
Feelin' like I can't breathe if I don't take a pill so I'm always on a Xan
Drink a bottle every night, I feel them doing damage to my liver
I ain't ever been this fat and disgusting
I don't wanna rap, I wanna nap on my love-seat
I ain't sayin' this to get no pity, I'm just feelin' shitty
Lookin' like a piece of metal rusting, and trust me

And I don't really like
The person I've become
This isn't who I thought I would turn into when I was young
But now I'm grown and they say I'm

I don't know, maybe I'm a hater
I'm supposed to write a rap, but I hate rap now
Stop breathin' when I'm sleeping then I wake up
Still in my clothes, can't remember how I passed out
Lately I'm an angry drunk am I'm afraid I
Might have been a dick, best friend's gettin' cussed out
But, fucker then I guess I found a liter
What I done, 'nother hungover day bummed out
Ooh shit I ain't no exaggerator
Nose bleedin', trying to act like I ain't sniff shit
People think they're motivating me to take up a different lifestyle
Fuck them and their Fitbit
They just wanna help but don't appreciate uh
Cause they love me, and they don't wanna see me die young
Every day I'm dissapointin' my creator
I've been strugglin' to get up out the hole I dug
Lately I've been switchin' over to the vapor
Chain smokin' newports [?] my lungs
I can see my future and it's [?]
Girl cryin' to the operator, calling 9-1-1
I tour, blessed to be an entertainer
Been spendin' months away from home, there's nothing I find fun
Signed a record deal, I love the record label
Three albums later, underrated when it's my time come
Couldn't afford the tour bus, so I went and bought a van
There's some money selling records, so I got to tour again
I don't wanna bore the fans, so I bought a couple lights
Plus some background singers, but I can't afford a band
Jealous of these rich rappers and the money that they make
I was up outside of Chili's having lunch and a lame
Started rooting for his team on the screen
When I see happy people wanna punch them in the face
I'm ashamed cause

I don't really like

I know that you like the way I move
When the clock strikes two
I'm gon' have you inside of the groove
Inside of the groove

Tatted up with my jewelry on, my shoes looking so brand new
Stunting like mom and pop, matching all my clothes
Being broke 'cause I know can't do
And I so can't lose
My team stay winnin' we can have any girl we can choose
We in the ATL but
We be partying like we in Cancun
Double shots of the Avion with no lime to chase
'Bout to bite the slate clean and ride the wave
I gotta diamond bracelet, designer shades
Suede retro nines, look behind the drapes
When neighbors sleep we was geeked up wide awake
We making money when the clock strikes two
And the kids say Rittz I wish I was like you, ooh

Me and good dudes cool
Me and fake dudes ain't
I play by the rules
A fuck boy I ain't
I ain't with that old sucker shit
Gettin' money is all that I'm familiar with
Diamond clusters all on my fist
Rolex watch cost 46, thousand
Used to be broke, now I'm a cash cow
I'm the plug, got the juug and my pack loud
Hella love in my hood smokin' Black n' Mild
Bitch motherfucker I'm smooth

I know that you like the way I move

I made a bunch of mil, I'm about to celebrate
I prolly should be rockin' somethin' tailor made
They wishin' I would stop but I accelerate
I got a bottle with some molly in the cellophane
Some purple liquid in my cup, no Welch's grape
I got a couple more notches in my belt to make
I gave that bitch my number
I ain't sittin' around waitin' for my cell to ring
And that's a lost cause
Our squad
Messin' up the room leavin' drawers, bras
Layin' on the floor, leaving' bars, straws
Layin' on the table by the vase, y'all

Rittz,"Dear Lord
Please forgive me
I'm so ashamed of everything that I've done
I'm trying to be a better person, God
I need your help

Who the fuck gon' pick me up when I fall?
Waiting on my Xanax to dissolve
Eat a bar just to go on stage
Just a bottle was a problem that I just can’t solve
On the slumerican made tour last fall
Everything snowballed, lookin' back and I’m appalled
Hit an all time low, had a two month binge
On that Blow, and I know you heard that song
But this real life
Ever wake up from a drunk night like you pissed people off?
That was me the whole tour
When I got home, I was so embarrassed
Had me feelin' like I need to call - Wolf
And say sorry for bein' so obnoxious
And constantly actin' like a junky, a Jay
On his bus doin' bumps, in my bunk
In the dark, from my heart, and the A

God bless my soul
Demons following me everywhere I go
That temptation in my face I can't control
Trying to chase them down this straight and narrow road
Here I go
Just say no

But I can’t, goin' up to fans
About to damn near beg for drugs
Tellin' them I can get 'em into backstage
If they get me some, my self-respect was gone
I stayed up all night with Ounce and Big Henry
Then go and get a room about two P.M
Eating Xanax in the afternoon
Cause I’m panicking from the Coke
My heart, don’t know what mood it’s in
I Face Time with my girl in my room
And when I finally fall asleep I make her watch
It’s a daily routine, I tell her I can’t breathe
And to keep an eye on me, just in case I stop
Look at my face in shock
My nose was so inflamed and swollen
So much abuse to it that it got infected
It’s five times it’s normal size
Plus, I blew my knee out
Drunk, tryin' to slap box a wrestler
Up at Whistler center, about to hit the E.R
It’s hard to explain yourself
Why your nose is the size of Gonzo's
The doc knows you’re a cocaine addict
You can only blame yourself
Here I am in the hospital bed
But instead of regret, I’m thinking about the cocaine I left
On the bus, I officially flushed
I told my girl I'm okay, I’ll be home in two days to rest
I got home, but really all the damage was done
Couldn’t go out into public without being nervous
And my dick didn’t work for like a month
Couldn’t bend my knee up in physical therapy
But as far as Coke and the urge, I was done
Didn’t learn shit, cause I did the same thing on the next tour run

God bless my soul
Demons following me everywhere I go
That temptation in my face I can't control

Rittz,"Mom and dad split up when she was just a kid
She lost all her trust, her trust in relationships, the unfaithfulness
It was a shame
Both of them cheated, leaving her a non-believer in falling in love
She was jaded since day one, looking for someone to blame
She never really had shit, she don't give a fuck about how much you got
She don't care if it's a little or a lot, no matter what she bought
She was lied to so many times by guys in disguise, trying to be something they not
I kept it real so I'm hoping that she'll let me get a shot
I told her I ain't gon' try to fill her head up with fairytales
And I know that she was scared as hell
You let your guard down so you gotta wear a shell
'Cause every male that ever said it was gonna be forever bailed
Her pops left out the door so fast like a jetpack was on his back
Got abused by her step-dad, the only way to get attention was a sex act
Momma never taught her to respect herself
She had to learn on her own, had a lot of obstacles, and barriers that herd her along
Beneath the surface was a girl in search of true love, she's a queen that deserves to be crowned
And I can recall the first time I seen her, I was in awe
It was like I had a crystal ball, it was her and I
And I ain't tryna say you about to have the perfect life because I heard goodbye girl

'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate

We both used to be heavy into drugs, until we finally got each other clean
Used to fuck on a hand-me down twin bed, now we make love on a California King
Had to share a car, working double shifts, Christmas came around, couldn't buy each other gifts
Summertime couldn't turn on the A/C, fan's blowin in our face while we eating frozen fish
Had to go and pretend like we had our own place
Saving up to stay up in a cheap motel
Now we got a two car garage, three cars, a big house, paying bills we don't need no help
65 inch T.V., she don't care about no money, she just love me, and I feel the same for her
Told her she don't gotta work, kick your feet up
She's just about to get the life she deserve

'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate

'Cause even when the times got hard we were always laughing
Even if we were single, nobody else is gonna have us
We're both so crazy, ten years in never lost attraction
And there's gotta be a god 'cause he crossed our paths
When we were lost and had it with the dating game
I pulled a David Blaine inside the bed, never lost the magic
Got her dripping like I took her white water rafting
And I know there's gonna be some people that'll hear the song and trash it
I don't really give a fuck what they say
As a rapper you really ain't supposed to act like you in love
Fuck 'em they don't even gotta hit play
Fuck touring, fuck music, fuck money, fuck the internet, and anything that gets in the way
Even her friends and family members' opinions don't matter
'Cause it's only me and you at the end of the day, and just know that

I'll run through flames to rescue you
There's nothing I would rather do
Than be next to you

'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away

Still cruising on Crews road, gold flexin' my candy paint drip

People walk up on me in the liquor store they wanna take a pic
I can hear their argument up in the aisle right beside me
Saying, is it really him and I promise you it is

Uh I got bars like I was brought up with slaughterhouse
But say my name and you'll get sawed up and shot up, BLAOW

And a bitch to wanna' party, grab my card and I'll chop it out

And told the operator sorry I pocket dialed
I told her to walk it out but now she's calming down enjoying it
Annoying bitch keep trying to blow me with cotton mouth

That turned me on that's why I came before her make up could dry
I want the bitch to leave can't find a way to say it polite
I told her there's an Uber waiting started waving goodbye
That never happened what happened why rappers say this a lot

Last tour, she done slit her wrists and this time she done OD'd, blacked out, and broke her arm
Feel bad, lyin' to her bout the coke I done

Is my girl and she been fucking with another dude
And I was hoping maybe you would tell me what to do
I'm tryna make it with the scraps that I have
Working fast for the stack of some cash
But its like I'm losing the enthusiasm I have
Trying to master the craft as a rapper
All I hear is laughter just got in a scrap with my dad
He hit me in the eye and he blackened it bad
All I ever wanted from him was a pat on the back
And I bet if I was dead he'd be glad
Hit him back so relax, this is how life works
When you feel like you sitting at the bottom; You not
To get better, shit gets worse first
Gotta reverse the negative eye
Keep praying to God and don't believe in a made up curse

Or wanna burn us in a furnace till we boil up
Beggin' The Lord above
To show remorse for us

Formed in something far less unfortunate
We absorbed enough pain to push the rush
Through our veins like a sting from a scorpion
We ashamed 'cause we can’t afford the stuff
We wanna buy had to find some form of love
Or find a formula, of course sure enough

Rittz,"First time I ever set eyes on you it was love at first sight
You was so young, your mom told me that she got a son, and you were the love of her life
As time went on, me and you bonded
I fathered you, I was so proud to be a dad
We were so broke, I promised you that one day I would get rid of the problems we had
I hope you accept my apology
All the fights and the drunk nights that you saw in the past
You never chose sides, we were so sad
But when it came to happiness you're all we really had, you're an angel
So happy-go-lucky, such a good soul, words can't express
You had a gift of making people fall in love with you
You affected every single person you met
And we ain't have much, we spoiled you to death
Anything you wanted you can have, I still laugh
Think about the holiday when you snuck 
And ate a whole cheesecake we ain't even get mad that's your favorite
We was so stressed out, we were about to lose the house that we stayed in
I was trying to be a rapper, we could've moved in my parents basement but couldn't bring you
Really you're the one that made me quit trying to rap
So I went and got a job so that we could get a house, I'd do anything for you
You, me, and your mom moved with your grandma
It was us three stuck in a little room
Finally had a place to play outside, I would love to see you run, like a dream coming true
I was riding in my car to some tracks one day, played this beat, started thinking of you and now I'm

Looking in my rear view
Wishing I was near you
It's quiet here without ya
And I've been thinking about ya
Feeling of nostalgia

I hated my job, I loved coming home
I would lay in bed with you for hours on end
Me and your mom were obsessed with you
Cause you were momma's baby boy, and daddy's best friend
But daddy ain't been, home a lot lately
To play with, I tried to set you down and explain
That I got a new job, that I wanted all my life, and that everything might possibly change
That I'ma have to go out of town for some months but when I'm home, I'ma be around every day
And when I'm gone I'ma need you to look out for your mom, keep her company while daddy's away
Your momma sends pics of you and her in bed
I would feel bad thinking that you thought I left
But I was saving bread so we could finally have our own place
Live a life that we should've always had
And I did that
Now you're spoiled even more cause instead of being cramped now you got your own room
Your mom quit her job, and you and her could chill every day
For the most part, I'd be home too
And life is looking bright, used to see it so blue
We finally were content, had a daily routine
I made a bunch of songs with your name in them
I would come into your room, hugging you and I would sing
You were always treated like a king
Cause you were everything that mattered to us and I would hate to see your cute face crying
Cause you knew that I was leaving for a tour
Always hated when I go and grab that red suitcase out the closet
You'd look at me and say you promise, you stayed by your mom when I'm gone
I'll be back in a couple of months, give me kisses I'll be missing you a ton
Homesick every time I'm

You grew up so fast, but you always had a baby face so it's hard for me to tell
You were sick on and off
We were just rough-housing on the bed, good to see you getting well
I had to go to Omaha for a show, but your mom called me up and told me that you slipped and fell
But you were limping, we figured that you twisted something and had to give it time to tell
I got home and you were breathing funny and your hip was big as hell
Your momma said that she began to see it swell
This morning, this isn't normal, we took him to the doctor
We thought he might of broke his hip bone and it would heal
It's crazy how life change in an instant
The doctor walked in with his x-rays
Said he thought he broke his hip, but he didn't
He got bad news and there ain't no way to fix it, what is it?
He said the x-rays showed bone cancer was spreading through his legs in a crazy position
The amputation, the chemo, wasn't a option
He probably ain't gon make it to Christmas, I blacked out
Cause Christmas is like three weeks away
When I left he was okay, now your telling me he's gonna die?
He said he's strong so he's gonna fight
Eventually you're gonna have to put him down whenever y'all decide
Please God, not a dog, we're in shock, not our son, he's the only thing we got, we was done
It'd be different if we knew that he was suffering for months, but he's limping
How the fuck is it that nothing can be done?
Tried to comfort him as much as we could
Drug his mattress - down the stairs to the center of the living room
Me and his mom laid with him every night
Petting him while he was crying, you could tell the pain was getting to him
And me and her in disbelief, all we did was cry, all we did was scream
Struggling to try, we'd take him outside, but he could barely walk
And every day it seems, it's spreading even more
The medicine we fed him isn't doing anything and we just can't accept it that our boy
The most important thing is dying right in front of us
Like how much do we let him suffer til we go and make the choice
We were laying on the floor almost twenty days
He ain't eating anymore, he can't move his legs
It's December 21st, I think it's time for us to let him go so we can send him to a better place
It's been several weeks, me and your mom still grieving feeling like we in denial
I go in your bedroom every day, smell the air
Start to cry for a while, then I smile thinking bout ya

Looking in my rear view
Wishing I was near you
We're crying here without ya
We're dying here without ya

That south side, and that motherfuckin' north side

You might see me cruising with my crew inside my Buick Regal hard top
Might see your reflection 'cause I'm fresh up out the car wash
Crankin the music up we flexin while the neighborhood watch
Trunk boomin speakers beatin like the school of hard knocks
Clintel the movement stupid got a large knot
In my pocket they be hatin' on us 'cause they squad's squat
Local legend I don't got no beef I call shots
North Side representer I've been given carte blanche
Riding Beaver Ruin I just rode this shit from twenty-nine on Buford highway
Smokin out from Berkmar High to Norcross
Its ghetto up in Meadowcreek I bet if these police they see me riding
They gonna pull me over just be'cause, watch
There ain't shit to do but catch a buzz and bar hop
Chillin' in my car parked, smokin' hit the unlock button
Got my door propped open and a couple hoes inside of a Corolla pull up on me and they jaws drop
Pleasant Hill to Pleasantdale smoked so much we left a trail
Bumping jezzebel and extra terrestrial
Snortin lines SNL
Tryin to bite my fresher feel
Life is like a movie this the director's reel
Blowin kisses to these bitches got 'em catchin' chills
Catchin' feelings bet you if I met you you gon' let me drill
Like a Craftsman or Black and Decker back and better than before
I got em screaming ye-uh yeah

Tell that mother fucker watch his mouth 'cause I'll pull up on you
I'll pull up on you
All the bitches they be wishin' they was riding when they see me drive away

I'm a pull up, reclining on em I ain't tryna scoot up
I'm shinin' on em now they look at me like I done blew up
Next time you say Atlanta then you better not have screwed us
The Clintel the crew and our respect is overdue but
They hate I'm getting paid and I don't have to push a broom a
Cross the kitchen pockets sticking like I'm made of rua
Plus up in a shooters alley where my homie blew a few bucks
We left to get some food, he said he knew a ho at Hooter's
That had the superfriends that were fans and if they had a chance
To come and party with us they would let do what
Ever so I hit up my connect and and got some mollys
Try to start up a menage pourin' vodka and Kahlua
It's just another day in her life like I just drew a
Picture for you like I'm sitting for the interview with Don Shula
I can coach you how to move like a maneuver
Said I do the kool and fuck if you a goon or you a shooter
You're assuming I'ma sweat on you like Harry Connick Jr
Slide up to you missy have you screaming ooh aah
I might be in Tucson, Arizona maybe in Missoula
Might be with a country bitch I pull up in a Kula?
I might cuss her out drop her off and throw the deuce up
Crazy like I lost a couple screws inside my tool box
Strangers try to lay me like they met me at a luau
Police say my music too loud they be yelling when I pull up

They be yellin' when I pull up, pull up
They be trippin' when I pull up, pull up

I suppose that your eyes were closed the whole time
I've been on the rise for almost five years
But most of my peers they hope I nose dived
Like an aircraft that crashed
They congrats you, dap you
When your back is turned they throw knives
I ain't handicapped or slow or no average Joe
I see past the smokin' strobe light
Put me up against your favorite rapper
You sayin' snap and harder than me, close but no dice
The difference be in my consistency and I don't need MC's to ghost write
Who you know that pitch that always throws strikes
Every time I get the ball across the goal line
I done made it out the bottom on the slow climb
If you talking to my dogs they all gon' cosign
And I'm sitting on a gold mine (gold mine)
Songs I write are from the heart it ain't meant for the closed mind (closed mind)
This more than bars they're metaphors, it's a cure for the soul, I, (soul, I)
Seal with the end of your rope and now I'm right here, closing by
Third time's a charm, I already let them know, twice

Let me set the record straight I'm the best, there ain't no one better, fuckin' let the rest debate
I accept the hate that'll desecrate I just set the pace
Set to detonate, some that disagree

Ain't nobody gonna come and take my crown
They be takin' me for granted I be killin' everything you hearin'
Gonna lyrically blaze eyebrows
We ain't got to double time I do it eighth mile style
Born in P.A. and was raised down South
Wanna make a city hit the stage
I bounce, from the north side up, A-Town down
Some of these MC's need CPR
Listen to the wack MP3's I'm bored
Your video is hard for me to sit through
Like Kanye's speech at the MTV Awards
(You on point Rittz) sí señor
I got a pair of new shoes you probably never seen before
I used to be dead broke with some cheap Louis V decor, inside a Regal that was leakin' oil
But now I cost five G's for a feature the middle finger up begging for a confrontation
And #FuckAnyoneWhoSaysHashtagInAConversation
Man I throw the peace sign Assalamualaikum
Cli-N-Tel was the crew and the congregation
People thinkin' I've become complacent
I'm just lookin' at the game feelin' nauseated

You wanna be Eazy
You gotta be Ruthless
You wanna be me
Then you gotta me the smoothest
Gonna seem breezy watchin' me do this
Got a deep teacher and follow me students
Hit 'em with the woah (woah)
That work everytime
Then we down start singing for the hoes (ho)
Trippin off that line and some punk
Might overdose, off this dope I write
A lotta rappers wanna act like rock stars
When they square as fuck but that's me for real
I got the pills and I'm fucking with a soft heart
Fist fight with my girl in the hotel punching the mirror
Breaking the door and the armoire
Shit I can't recall the last fifteen years wishing I could do an interview with Nardwuar
I got an early morning flight to Hartsfield
Taking airplane shots witha chilli chese hotdog
Never gonna fall off, man I know I'm on now
Got a bunch of unknown numbers in my call log
People got me all wrong
See my hair and the beanie and they get the wrong idea
Say I look homeless shit my shoes two-hundred my shades two-fifty a pair
Watch out you'll go blind
By the diamonds the side of my pinky that sparkle and shine
They call me Rittz, bitch

Rittz,"Another school shooting just occurred today
Thinking what on earth
Could make somebody run up in a school or a church
And take innocent lives away based on a person's race
Little school kids stripped of their vertebrae's
Fake rumors start to circulate
They beat his ass on camera, cause they heard he's gay
The YouTube views almost over 30k
The internet got us so shallow that we impersonate
Celebs' thinking that we all should be one
And not that we failed
The world, they need male role models
Wish you knew your pops but he's gone
And mom don't keep up, she got two jobs
Don't like stress, working for her children
She's at work while her teenage daughter
In the room with a dude and she twerking while he filming
Hurt somebody's feelings
Shit all we do online is diss and talk bad, and we bash
Total strangers
Hope's endangered
Glad to see my homie's made it back from Iraq
But his limbs are torn up, his friends got blown up
Enlisted as a kid, ever since, they grown up
They been through so much, disposed to death in combat
How the fuck you come back and adapt?
My homie just got Hodgkin's Lymphoma
I'm praying every day hoping he gonna beat it
Strong motherfucker on the phone with me
Telling me jokes while he's going through his chemo treatment
And he didn't put one sob story on his timeline
Instagram or Facebook ain't always real life
People staring at their phones so much that they forget to look up and see the skyline
Thinking that they Einstein cause they wrote a clever post
It's Just a flash in a tiny attention span
Music is chewed up like fast food and spewed out
Like I'm new with a menu plan
I can't hear shit
Sincerety clearly has died
My lyrics are merely mirrors to the tears in my eyes

I’ve done my best to share my life
My privacy's been sacrificed
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
I've put my soul in every word
I've shared my pain until it hurts
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
Ah yeah

Woke up and I checked Worldstar this morning
A cop just shot and killed a black kid
It was all recorded
Just like the incident they put up two days before it
It's become so normal that it sickens me
I know that I'm probably going to piss some people off listening
Because I'm white and I'm talking about some shit we generally don't go through
But still I can't ignore it
There's so many people with power that won't go forward
The problem ain't gonna solve itself
Half of the cases are unreported until it's caught on someone's cell
And this is not a diss to all law enforcement
We call on them to help out when there is a threat
But I guess it's because I'm white, if I was black I'd be scared to death
When David Banner asked us
""Where were all the white rappers at when Mike Brown got gunned down?""
I couldn't think of any answers
I felt ashamed and afraid of the future
With no contribution or any helping hand to lend
I went to Kansas City
Shooting videos for my last album
And I could feel the tension
Another time of my life that I felt I was guilty for the color of my skin tone
Three months later, I was back in Missouri
On tour the same night that the verdict was read
I was in shock, on Twitter venting
Then one of my fans tweeted that Mike Brown deserved it
I said, man, you dumb as fuck
Imagine you went to the store for blunts
And tried to run out the door with a pack
And the cops didn't bother arresting you
Or give you a lecture
But instead they just murdered you dead, man this shit ain't right

I’ve done my best to share my life
My privacy's been sacrificed
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
I've put my soul in every word
I've shared my pain until it hurts
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
Ah yeah

Rittz,"Yeah
When the rest of the world go to sleep, I
I be getting drunk, probably on some kind of drug
Tripping looking at the street light
Tryna write a rap, wanna lay that beat
But its hard, I'm on a speed high
C-N-T my crew, we cool
But we grew up in the street life
In other words, we gon' sting 'em when they swinging at the bee hive
Rewind, ain't nobody reach out
Back when I was coming up, now they hit me and get mad if I don't reply
Where were you when I was cleaning out the deep fry?
Didn't wanna swing by
Hoes saying he's fine, yeah right
Saying that I wanna fuck, she lying, she trying
I can tell by her face that her pussy smell like a sea lion
Only thing she gonna get is denied
Couple grand inside my Levi's
T9 put me on, and he always wear red
But I swear if somebody disrespect him, I'ma check him
He don't gotta give a green light
Listening to Big Mike, rap music used to be tight
Some of it still is, but a lot of it is street hype
Back when I was praying I would make it
This ain't what I thought it'd be like, despite -
All the fake shit, I'm really happy to achieve my -
Childhood dreams and a ton of shit's sweet
Every now and then its sour like a key lime
And when it is I gotta remind me
That I made it to the big time
And I know I might not be as big as T.I
But guaranteed, if you see me getting behind
A microphone, I'ma bring the heat each time

'Cause I was born for this
I'm so lucky to be this fortunate
My life, my heart, my soul got poured in this
And I'ma keep going until my story ends
Until the Lord above me decides to turn my lights out
But for right now
I ain't trying to put this mic down
Stage is mine now

Told my parents I was gonna make it one day
They ain't never look convinced
I was just a little kid at a young age
They probably thought it was a dumb phase
And I quit school, said I'm stupid, told me just wait
I regret it and I do, I was thinking I was cool
Started fucking with the drug trade
Just knowing I might end up blowing up big
I was finally of age, hitting up Atlanta at the club late
Doing every open mic, looking like a straight target
I was unsafe, in the middle of the hood
Only white boy on stage, had to let my nuts hang
Fifteen years later, all the work paid off
Kids coming tryna run game
Only difference is, I was a lyricist
Before the internet opened up the floodgates
When white boys had to have skills
If you didn't, then you getting booed, getting jumped
What you just say?
Had to live what you rapped back then
Nowadays you can say you 'bout gunplay
When you shot a target at a gun range
You can say you got a plug, I ain't following for the pump fake
Saying Usher's your cousin, your uncle is Just Blaze
As far as bullshit go, nothing much's changed
I'm getting better every year
All I see is competition to me that I wanna try to upstage
And there's still a lot of people that ain't never listened to me in their life
I think it's time to get an update
Rappers that I gave my demo tape to in the past
Tryna come and get my number, we should touch base
They could be me one day, but I'm hotter than a sun ray
I'm blazed

'Cause I was born for this
I'm so lucky to be this fortunate

I done met all types of people
Good and evil
Been amongst all walks of life
Some that you be perceive to be decent
Will soon deceive you
'Cause who they really are inside
Ain’t who you thought they were
At the bar we worked at was full of skeletons in the closet door
I knew a couple named Steve and Rose who’ve been known to slow base
Let me start the story off with her
She was an alcoholic, but so was he
Socially they were both popular
So in love, it was rare to see him and her not there
Words can’t explain how shocked I was
And then when Steve walked in with his blood shot eyes
Cryin' I could tell that he’d been up all night
Told us that Rose had overdosed committed suicide
And the woman that he loved just died, not Rose
People sittin' at the bar froze
Made a toast to him, may she rest in peace
With his head in his chest, Steve wept with grief
He got drunk, went to get some sleep
It’s sick 'cause after he left rumors started to fly
Someone said Lady he’s sketchy Steve, been seen numerous times
With another girl he screwed on the side
Now all of sudden she was dead it seemed little odd (odd)
Was it crocodile tears he was cryin' was it all a façade?
She could drink, was it really a bottle of pills and some vodka that caused her demise?
A lot of the guys started callin' him a murderer
And I ain’t really tryin' to accuse him but
He was kissin' on his new girlfriend at the bar same night of my funeral
'Cause she’s so cold blooded

I knew a couple named Ike and Linda
Same bar, different story
Let me think where should I begin'?
I wish this was a fiction piece
But I witnessed this shit time and time again
Ya see, Ike was the quiet type who shot darts with his best friend Mark
But he liked a pinch
Of cocaine and raw but none of us woulda thought his life would come
To a violent end
Until one day the bar got silent then
You could hear pin drop the minute that Lyn walked in
Cryin, 'causeshe said Ike died someone tied him up and then they set him on fire, damn
They found his body right inside of the complex
Whoever did it must've had an accomplice
But the cops just said it was drug deal gone bad
Tried to blame it on the drug problems
What I found bizarre was
They found an empty gas can in the storage compartment
That had Lyn’s palm prints
But it was her and Ike’s place so
It wasn’t enough to implicate her involvement
Case unsolved and two weeks later it would raise an eyebrow
But they burying him
Everybody at the bar found out that Ike’s friend Mark got married to Lyn

Irritated sayin, how much for a feature Rittz?
You said it was a G on basket case
It was a Grand back in 2011 and went for three-five now, I'm sorry you might have to save

You should do a song with him, put him on the end""

Like what's the problem dam?
What you tryna go mainstream on us Rittz?
You supposed to keep it strange
My opinion is if you support a label that was underground
Then you should wanna seem em be the biggest name

You can go and tell 'em what you didn't like or did
And you can get it off your mind, and vent
And feel like you lookin' someone eye to eye and spit

I took 'em so low on the OD tour, lost like fifty-five grand
Lesson learned, I can't afford to bust shit
I told my girl we gotta cancel our plans
And I went off on a tangent
A wreck, cause I'm panicking
Life as a rambling man disappearing
And I'm damned and I can see they can't get a handle of saying it
But do it for my handful of fans
And I still ain't changed

Never
It's Rittz, bitch

People change and I don't know why
Cause I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah
Money come and go, but so what?
I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah, aw yeah

Look, might've seen me on a poster or the grocery store
People that are scared to approach me are
No different than me
I write raps for a living and I'm overjoyed
And even if I get no awards for my music
Fans say it helped them cope before
Made 'em hope for more
Sometimes the sky can seem so out of reach
When you're sitting on the ocean floor
I did Breakfast with Sway
On shade forty-five with Heather B
You can see the YouTube video
Where the mic fell, shit was embarrassing
Did a song with Trae the Truth
I met Devin the Dude
And man, I just did a video with Twista
Shit I think somebody needa pinch my arm
Here, lets take a picture for the Instagram
This is famous fam with no Travis Barker
Tagging Rittz bitch with a magic marker
The Agora Theater in Cleveland to Phoenix
It's like I'm on a magic carpet
Shit I'm dreaming a bit
Sold out shows, I was up in the arena with Tech
Then I flew back home to Atlanta, did a show for my homie
Only twenty-five people was there, but I rocked that bitch

Cause I still ain't changed
It's Rittz, bitch

People change and I don't know why
Cause I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah

Aw yeah, aw yeah

One time for the dreamers
I pray your day will soon come
It's hard to know what you here for
It'll reveal itself in due time
I rap with friends who ain't made it
Let your lyrics channel through mine
Two times for the fans that motivated me the minute I started to lose sight
They be showing up in each, state
Fans overseas saying peace, mate
They loving the lyrics because they re-late
They give me the motivation to cre-ate
When I'm fettered it gets hard for me to see, straight
To my family I used to be a di-sgrace
The time I'm spending rapping was a big, waste
But I finally got a record deal a big, break
Time to be, great
Homie we, chase
The paper 'til the muscles in our feet, ache
And finally I got to have a sweet, taste
Of victory, picture me rolling with the homies C-N-T, mane
Everybody in the world wanna de-bate
Who's better Meek, Drake?
I'm just hoping that I reach, they
Level, went back-to-back-to-back
Haters saying he, changed

Like really?
Ain't shit changed
I still live in Gwinnett
Still got the same homies

Got a lot of dollars off my occupation
Jealous, poppin off, it's obvious they pocket change shrunk
Now they wanna come apologize and make up
Got ho inside em', they should go apply at Avon
And those the type of guys I try to stay away from, they be too lame, but they say they keep it A1
I bet I lay one
Out across the pave-ment
If they say somethin', I don't play no types of games son

Look, I heard your entire tape and wasn't inspired
It was hard for me to make it through but since I'm a rapper
I feel like I should listen, now I'm wishin' that I didn't
I would rather watch an episode of Empire ten times
And I don't even like the show, chopping rocks of white
Just know I tried to crush it up but then my license broke
Your style's old like yellow stripes on [?] and wire spokes
It's time to go, I know your goal ain't to retire broke
But on a brighter note, they might be hiring at Kohl's
Try Verizon Wireless, there's always people buying phones
Drunk or flying drones, crowds at shows are multiplying
Fire marshal tryna say we violating codes
Spraying my cologne, smelling like a millionaire
Silver pair of Jeremy Scott's I hardly ever wear
Black hoodie but the fabric's made of leather
Looking fresh like I was Fred Astaire, with a better head of hair
With no fedora on, fuck is going on?
Rappers dressed like Def Leppard, so, Pour Some Sugar On Me in the name of love
I ain't never changing up
I be backstage with the - bitches in there taking bumps
Love to blow a dick so much she just might suck the pigment off the skin
And when you nut she rubs it in like it was facial scrub
Too busy getting money, I can't conversate with ya
And I don't rap for free, I want some compensation, bruh
Mike was cooking up the beat, he hung his apron up
And when he did I picked my pen and paper up

Listen, I'm not your homie bro, we barely know each other
You think we close because we did a couple shows together
Some folks I met on the road, I'll probably know forever
You just kissing ass, always asking, can I open for you?
I got a talent for spotting hidden agendas (like what?)
You tryna copy me, watching like an apprentice (hell nah)
I'm not Italian but I got some homies down to do a hit for me
They caught him and shot him in his appendix
It's funny all these dudes, they shoes and scarves
And thinking they look original but they copying Jimi Hendrix
But everybody's looking for something like Annie Lennox
I'm looking for someone to bring the Xanax
Higher than Bob Ross, watch me while I paint the canvas
And you just a ho, I figured you oughta know, shout out Alanis
Morrissette, portraits I painted, ain't it gorgeous?
Still I made a fortune, Porsches and Corvettes
Run up with the torch lit
Run off at the mouth and we gon' show up at your doorstep
Fuckboy, probably think he fly inside his Ford Flex, pocket full of Boar's Head
Cheddar but never seen competition, doomed to corpses
You must've been born deaf, really you can't be serious
You making Silkk the Shocker sound like he's the greatest lyricist
That ever lived, that's not a diss, I'm just comparing them
I might not be the biggest fish in this aquarium
But everybody in the water scared to fuck with me
So fuck I'm chalking up the piece, slumping in my bucket seats

Times done changed for the emcee
And if he rap, I know he gotta be buzzed
If you don't know somebody who rap
You know somebody who does
It's prob'ly one of your cousins or dude up the block
Dropped a couple of albums or moved up a notch
Swallow it up or I don't slack on writing commence
To eating motherfuckers like Attack on Titan it's real
I see you headed for your doom, interscope and
These lesser niggas searching for the moon in the ocean
My third eye's open, inner vision in 3D
It's killer city, Missouri murdering 'em on GP
So fuck 'em all with a condom and I'm a nympho
This ain't no conversation, no common knowledge no info
I'm going in and it don't
Matter who get offended, this shit is premeditated
So if I said it, I meant it

I dropped in just to say what up
Hip hop chuckled to itself and it created us
Laugh now but y'all dogs better rabie up
Cause on a real, ball hogs never made us much
My group precipitates skill, shade by the deal
Fools forget to play still chasing dollar bills
I'm feeling great fail if you cruising it's a race
You hit the brakes bail if you knew what it would take
To make sales, no run up on the state sales
My face pale, made a come up on some hate mail
It's all subtle boy, I hope you enjoy the rebuttal
Where with the trouble I just shrug when I point to the rubble
My coin stack, prepare the appointed task
They avoided the facts, I'm disappointed but back buoyant
I let him know that that soiling is rap poison
Comma for selling Belladonna I'll tell him Ill be out

Bring it right back
There's more and I'm a need a night cap
Emcees be bugging me I need a fly trap
I'm fly as fuck, I look at you and see a piece of white trash
That got you heated, my bad
If I can beat him scrapping, I'm a stab him, leave a white gash
They leak and he gon need a dry rag
An ice pack, an eye patch, a life raft
I drown him in a pool of blood
I'm truly underground, I write my rhymes inside of my shaft
Frame by frame I stutter the game, it's like I seen a time lapse
And every lake is just as bad, I can't look past the traffic jam
Test the rappers they won't ever pass the class exam
Blazing like I lit a match and had a can of gas in hand
You make me mad on stage, I'll backhand a bitch like afro man
Snap a wrench in half and discipline you like a kid again
We stomping basic bitches need some titties and an ass implant
Cold blooded like I'm trapped beneath an avalanche

Caminito que el tiempo ha borrado 
que juntos un día nos viste pasar, 
he venido por última vez, 
he venido a contarte mi mal. 
Caminito que entonces estabas 
bordeado de trébol why juncos en flor, 
una sombra ya pronto serás, 
una sombra lo mismo que yo.
 
Desde que se fue, 
triste vivo yo; 
caminito amigo, 
yo también me voy. 
Desde que se fue 
nunca más volvió. 
Seguiré sus pasos, 
caminito, adiós.
 
Caminito que todas las tardes 
feliz recorría cantando mi amor, 
no le digas si vuelve a pasar 
que mi llanto tu suelo regó. 
Caminito cubierto de cardos, 
la mano del tiempo tu huella borró; 
yo a tu lado quisiera caer
why que el tiempo nos mate a los dos.

Now I want you to prove it right here on the couch, yeah
All I wanna do is get you to myself, get, get you to myself
Can't have nobody else, else

Life is good but it's taxing
Discourse distractions

Discotec mathematics
Gave her my number after dancing

We got pop eyes
Hop the red eye, we got sunrise out in jest

I meet my fate, that's bad for me

It's a deep feel like the dogs set my alarm for 5 AM

Than to never have loved anything at all

You know, who's gonna say that the borders are secure? 
We've got the House and the Senate debating this issue
And it's, it's really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants
""Immigrant"" has somehow become a bad word 
So the debate rages on and we continue

And just like that it's over, we tend to our wounded, we count our dead
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

I got five roommates in this one studio, but I never really see them

But now Lady Liberty is acting like Hilary Banks with a pre-nup
Man, I was brave, sailing on graves
Don't think I didn't notice those tombstones disguised as waves
I'm no dummy, here is something funny, you can be an immigrant without risking your lives
Or crossing these borders with thrifty supplies

Na they don't play British empire strikes back
They beating us like 808's and high hats
At our own game of invasion, but this ain't Iraq
Who these fugees what did they do for me
But contribute new dreams
Taxes and tools, swagger and food to eat
Cool, they flee war zones, but the problem ain't ours
Even if our bombs landed on them like the Mayflower
Buckingham Palace or Capitol Hill
Blood of my ancestors had that all built
It's the ink you print on your dollar bill, oil you spill
Thin red lines on the flag you hoist when you kill
But still we just say ""look how far I come""

To a galaxy far from their ignorance

Identidad falsa
Brincamos muros o flotamos en balsas

Somos como las plantas que crecen sin agua
Sin pasaporte americano
Porque la mitad de gringolandia es terreno mexicano
Hay que ser bien hijo de puta
Nosotros les sembramos el árbol y ellos se comen la frutas
Somos los que cruzaron
Aquí vinimos a buscar el oro que nos robaron
Tenemos mas trucos que la policía secreta
Metimos la casa completa en una maleta

This how we gon' put it down
Dem gangsta niggaz from J.C. center court 12th, 3rd Avenue, my block
Nigga, murder, murder mayne

I come nake faceded, ain't no need for a ski-mask
From neck down, I'm black down, eye to eye when I blast
No question, I got the code
Now how many bodies out there, take out before I reload, hit 'em below

His fuckin' knees, before we leave, we gon' locate them ki's
A nigga gotta eat, ya heard me?
You know the player when we get there, kill everything in there
Leavin' no clues, like we never even been there

Life ain't fair but fuck it, it's a new year
I'm grabbin' my strap, cockin' it back and boo-yaa
We almost thay, lock down the spot
Put your vest on punk, we in the parking lot
One of them, all day killers, who's hard to spot
Jackin' all y'all whether it's dark or not

It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, I'm clearin' the block

It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, we clearin' the block

We did our job, now we on the next mission
The next victim, go on, see if the tec spittin'
No bullshittin', see they don't know just how we livin'
I'm goin' all out, I ain't scared to go to prison

Make your own decision, it's gon' be a long ride
I need the money, I can't wait a long time
Keep a strong mind 'cause we done waited in a long line
Just to get our shine on, now it's our time

Believe that, it's our turn
Pull out your weapon to burn, get what you earned
We all must learn, that money is the key to life
And niggaz gon' die if we ain't eatin' right

It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, I'm clearin' the block

It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, we clearin' the block

Who you know livin' right, ain't nobody spreadin' love
Niggaz snow off that white, goin' out and sheddin' blood
Life lookin' like my momma said it would
Whether or not, I still ride for the hood, I'm on my block

My niggaz they slang rocks, shoot it out with cops
From J.C., the center court life's hard knocks
Hold on, grab your glock, did you see the car stop?
Which one? The black Benz with the top dropped

Fuck 'em, the mac-10 with the infrared dot
Represent how I'm livin', keep on drivin' down the block
Oh, it's on now, let's take the back route
Get your mac out, it's blood in blood out

It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, I'm clearin' the block

Rizin' Sun,"Ay they can't handle this one
This for the block nigga, what?

[D-Tay]
I make one move, hit your block, and your whole spot hot
Uh-huh, if you're lucky have your whole block cocked
Now I ain't sayin that's gon' stop all my niggaz that chop
Cause in they mind, ain't no dyin, niggaz flip to get flopped
Shootin more than 50 shots and my heart catch not
When the gunfire a-start it ain't no callin the cops
Besides, you started beef, I'm just bringin it back
All my niggaz you hunt around so what you packin a gat?
Just leave that where it's at, or leave here on your back
Make one move like you're reachin and I'm leavin you flat
Warnings I'm givin you, but you never did listen
So I'm spittin Smith & Wessons 'til they out of ammunition
I'm clip totin, holdin rollin with my cousin Priest
I'm back, and ridin in the candy painted 'llac
We max, and gettin all these hoes for they cheese
We jack, and gettin all these ballers for they ki's

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Didn't think that I would make it this far, throwin rocks at the pen
Left niggaz layin dead and I did it in sin
And I'd do it again, thugged out 'til the end
Still we gon' keep ridin 'til we caught in the wind

[Rizin Sun]
Nigga I'm gon' make it if I gotta rob and steal
Cock back my grill, let 'em know this burner's for real
When the coast is cleared that's when I plan my escape
Wanted in 50 states, my first shot is debate
Don't be late, Buck we got hits to make
50 is you with me, if they really want me they'd come and get me
Now I'm a fugitive on the run, killers don't leave home
Without the gun, blaze one
They got me nationwide all over the world they tryin to turn me in
But the pearls, I think ahead on that
Fuck the pen, I'm tryin to see my money stacks
If you lookin for me I'm where the ballers at
Drinkin Cristal gettin smoked out
Try not to take the bar out, but they done, tapped my house
I'm goin all out, got me on some major shit
Dressed in black, when I attack, please believe that

[Chorus]

[Young Buck]
I need to get my hands on somethin, I suggest you play it low
Get your last words in when the soldier's rag over my nose
Look the anger done build up, I'm damn near about to blow
Tryin to unhook a time bomb when I'm right at zero
Fuck a stolen vehicle, we gon' pull up in luxury
Bubbilize somethin, survive nigga you're lucky
When shit get ugly, bustin e'rythang that rush me
Swingin this fuckin chopper 'til my arms get musty
This occasion calls for military issue buddy
My fetti took a slight fall now y'all gon' be bloody
Young Buck, a.k.a. Frank Nitti of the city
Ain't fakin none to DT's, you got it then come and get me
But the form I come in, I swear it's hard to hit me
Not a face bein shown, just a chrome tucked in my dickies

",Caught in the Wind,2005
Rizin' Sun,"[Verse One]
You niggaz got me fucked up, it's time to go to war
Nigga so what's up, I bust up, any muh'fucker feelin he rougher
I can't get enough of, showin niggaz what time it is
Go inside his crib, find his kids 'til we find the shit
Go ahead and keep buyin shit, act like you run the town
On the worst day, your birthday, that's when I cut you down
Let me show you how, to make this money by the pound
Get a black dickie fit, can't forget the hundred rounds
Still a murder man, told myself I'd never hurt again
Niggaz out here hoes, so I'm kickin in they do's
And nobody knows when a nigga like me be comin
Nigga stop drop and roll when a nigga like me be gunnin
Wanna live to see tomorrow? Better calm down your woman
And that shit in that plastic bag better be all hundreds
When my mask down, that mean I'm ready to blast now
Taught your ass a lesson, bet you'll learn how to act now

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Get your murder on - cock it back and let it go
Bitch I represent them killers who be kickin in them do's
Get your murder on - black down from head to toe
See I tried to tell you once niggaz don't want war

[Verse Two]
Just look at life from my point of view, run where I call home
Feel what a gun do and I'll bet you {?}
Wonder why my mind strong livin the life
When niggaz really don't live long playin me sheist
See I'm goin all out, like straight hoes to dykes
Switchin the game around like Reeboks from Nikes
Stayin in my black dickies, t-shirts all white
Thugged out, what it's all about, all right
Let's just shoot it out now, we can do it all night
It don't matter, the 50 caliber gon' bite
Watch 'em scatter, the loud sound got 'em all fright
Get the cheddar, then let them cowards hear the dual pipes
When we bite, we fight like pits on red meat
Is this life the shit nigga? Yes it fuckin be
Freaks take a glimpse, they scream Buck's the shit
Now fiend for the dick, as I lean in the 6

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Back in my 'llac the auto fo'-fo's and Optimos
Kickin in do's on the one stressin {?}
Let me get that out you hoes, me and my snub nose
Bonnie and Clyde, when we ride, both of us have open eyes
Realized I'm a young nigga, puttin it fuckin down
Never goin to sleep without a hundred fuckin miles
Layin it down, my name is known throughout town
Blaka blaka, blaka blaka

Rizzle Kicks,"Diiiiieeeeee Miss Illusion,
Mmm yeah I love it when my lips are on her,
There’s a spark in our relationship I plant a kiss upon her,
I **** around too much and there’s a risk that I'm a goner,
So I've got her on hand like a badge of honor,
The downside is she’s never there when I'm lacking dollar,
So I've got to try and go through a day without acting bothered,
In the hope she’d leave me alone because I'm better off her,
But I see that spark and I just accept the offer,

So many people say why are you with her,
And I'm like; she’s a damn good kisser,
She feeds my addiction,
She leaks something different,
The smoke from our last meeting has risen,
Keep her away from all of the other boys,
'Cause you know she’s every single cutters choice,
Always there when the cold nights are lurking,
Gotta keep hold of my Golden virgin,

I think she’s good for me,
That's why I don’t want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when I shouldn’t be,
She’s there when I'm in need,
But she isn’t cheap,
The last time I saw her,
Mostly I couldn’t breathe,
And they say she’s bad for me,
But they say she’s bad for me,
But I don’t think she’s bad for me,
But it’s a bit of a miss illusion,

She’s got a mate called Benson,
But he’s a bitter of a waster,
Always chats about silver and gold,
But I don’t think that he’s safe (right?)
Plus his mate like’s to come out at break time,
Try’s to act bad but I've smoked him like 8 times!,
And if I take it the wrong places then I face a fine,
And if I don’t take it much she say’s its a waste of time,
In fact she doesn’t lie,
She tells me that she’s bad for me,
Even when I patch things up I don’t feel like I have to leave,

I said I had to leave; I had to get away,
It’s funny when I'm not around I've seen better days,
Sometimes I demonstrate how to set it straight,
I filter out the bullshit and keep her locked in case,
But when I'm chilling she’s always in my mind,
I do her out but the doubts are just glassed in side,
I should respond in time but then I found out,
The last boy she kissed coughed and died,

I think she’s good for me,
That's why I don’t want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when I shouldn’t be,
She’s there when I'm in need,
But she isn’t cheap,
The last time I saw her,
Mostly I couldn’t breathe,
And they say she’s bad for me,
But they say she’s bad for me,
But I don’t think she’s bad for me,
But it’s a bit of a miss illusion,

M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be,
M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be,
Can you please leave my vicinity,
Can you please leave my vicinity,
Actually wait nah I'll have another kiss,
Oh **** I'm in love with this chick what this its,
Straight robbery,
She’s always there when I'm by myself and I can’t remain solitary,
Babe honestly,
It appears that your bad for my health and a quick way to poverty,
You went from my pal to my lover,
Now I see you outside with thousands of other,
But you’re on my mind right now,
So I guess I'm coming down from another little fling,
Gotta confess this,

I think she’s good for me,
That's why I don’t want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when I shouldn’t be,
She’s there when I'm in need,
But she isn’t cheap,

So far nothing’s happened but we’re far from calm.
And I got a mouthy friend breathing fire
Claiming what he really desires
Is to go outside and pick a fight
But the Lion tamer will not leave his side

I think it’s funny how the clowns intervene
But they keep (fights going)
Bound to take risks on a night (knife throwing)
Seen that clown before yes (I know him)
Don’t like him let me get a pie thrown in
And I know on a night like this
When the hype grows
It might go like treading a tight rope
With your eyes closed
Might notice five blokes when the light glows
Five- O hope you enjoy tonight’s show

And she says ""wait, you didn't ask me... (How I felt)""
I said I love that your a (nice girl), and I'm sorry
But this really wasn't time well,
And it kinda feels like it may be a blur,
Maybe coffee and telly is what I mainly prefer,

Yes, yeah the other day I was sitting on the train but in another place,
I was on my way home, or maybe some would say,
I was thinking bout the days I wanna run away,
I've only really gotta couple mates, me, myself and I, how cliche,
Looking out the window, feels like I'm in a film,
Director, producer and as it happens I'm the main (character),
Yeah my own little feature, length sound track being
Whatever's in my speakers (then),
I'd rather not be held accountable I bank on peoples feelings
It's no wonder why I'm feeling spent, yeah and in a deeper sense,

Helped me reconnect my feelings then!

To settle for a desk job bring in those pounds,
I wanted to live in those clouds,

See how they twist & shout

Like what's going on

Teachers thought my potential was wasted
Hey kids it's all about faith in what you're making
I need more than these pre written pages
And hormones make me want girls to get naked
I don't want a bad bitch
I want a chick that will slap ud a auv if he calls her a bad bi v jfv
That's it

I don't wanna glamourize this
If you do it well I think that your standards might slip
Up for a challenge
Head fully balanced
You and who's army I reckon
I'll manage
Let em all have it
Homegrown talent
Yeah

So let the games begin
I won't fall
I'm no fool

This means war

This means war

Oi listen though
Yeah I don't even carry a weapon I got bars
Ain't rocking any tatoos but I got scars
Whole game's going berserk like it's not ours
Motherfuckers overlooking the work
I'm like Cha
Seriously can't fuck with the style or you'll get burnt

Go on drag me back in the battle and get learnt
I know a stack of rappers who act like a wet perm
But when the time comes for getting it live (they just weren't)
A younger generation look at the game and it's all thugged out

Their bugged out, their running their dumb mouth like
Oiii
Feel free to hate on the way that this shits turned out
They're burned out shame that you weren't down but BOYYY

Against all odds I blaze you bods
While you sit and reminisce about the days you was
It made you what
See the way you played yourself it's odd

So let the games begin
I won't fall
I'm no fool
I won't fall
I'm no fool
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means yeah

Rizzo The Rat,"Performed by Jimmy Buffett, The Great Gonzo, and Rizzo The Rat
From Kermit UnPigged - Jim Henson Records BMG Kidz.
(Talking)

Rizzo: Hey Look Gonzo, Jimmy's Buffet!

Gonzo: Oh, No No No No/ That's Jimmy Buffett. He's Recording in there.
Come on let's go say hello.

Rizzo: No thanks, I saw a sign down the hall that said meatloaf.

Gonzo: Well I'm going to see Jimmy...

Gonzo: Hello Jimmy

Jimmy: Gonzo

Gonzo: Hey, you don't look so good

Jimmy: I had the most amazing night last night
(Singing)

Jimmy: Woke up this morning, with light in my eye,
And then realized it was still dark outside.
It was a light coming down from the sky.
I don't know who or why

Gonzo: Must be those strangers that come every night,
Whose saucer shaped light, put people uptight.
Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark.
I hope they get home alright.
(Chorus)
Both: Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along.
I won't do anything wrong.
Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along for the ride.

Jimmy: Woke up this morning,
I was feeling quite weird.
Had flies in my ear and my toothpaste was smeared.
Opened my window,
They had written my name.
Both: Said so long, we'll see you again.

(Chorus)
Both: Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along.
I won't do anything wrong.
Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along for the ride.

(Talking)

Rizzo: Hey you two.

Gonzo: What do you want Rizzo?

Rizzo: You won't believe this, but there's a space ship outside.

Jimmy: Oh yeah, I knew they'd come back for me.

Rizzo: What!

Jimmy: Come on boys, let's go

Gonzo: Yeah, let's go

Rizzo: No way, I'm not goin up in that thing.

Gonzo: Oh Rizzo

(Singing)

(Chorus)

Both: Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along.
I won't do anything wrong.
Hey Mr. Spaceman,
Won't you please take me along for the ride.
Won't you please take me along for the ride.

(Talking)

Jimmy: Alright Gonzo, you ready to go?

Gonzo: Sure

Rizzo: Gonzo, you can't leave. You have to be here for the end of the album

Gonzo: Ah, yeah

Jimmy: Hey, see you later guys. I'm space bound.

Rizzo: Have a nice flight

Gonzo: Yeah, see you in the tabloids

Gonzo: Say Rizzo, is there any of that meatloaf left?

Rizzo: Nah, the was some big guy in there. I guess he ate it all.

RJ,"All my life, wanted to love you, wanna make you proud
To never leave you or how they fly
Gave up my loyalty and paid the price
Got me asking why these people wrong you, but you done them right
They giving up and all you do is fight
You sacrificing, you would even die
And I thank God for never leaving me alone even when I'm on my own
Won't break up, stand up strong
And I thank God for showing the road to go
When I'm weak and feeling low, built up, but never show

Sorry, Ms.Jackson, I hate to call in this fashion
I understand it's late and you work harder than average
Plus I'm knowing that you and your son have been clashing
But Kenny called and told me to tell you what happened
He hit a lick with his homies, his homies switched it on him
They spent the money, he got greedy and put the pistol on him
Shots fired from both sides, but nobody died
I thank God he survived and got out alive
But this gon' hurt you to hear
Kenny went to jail, might be facing some years
Police say it's evidence he broke into someone's residence
The neighbors say they witnessed it and plus they found fingerprints
They say the bail like 50 thou
But it's gon' be like 5 thousand to get him out
Man, I told him not to fuck with them niggas
I'm sorry, I don't mean to curse, but I just never trust 'em at all
And he up in the pound, my dawg
And his girl ain't accepting his call
Can't let him fight the charge in his cell, he didn't bail on me
I got 2, we just need the other 3, fight the case on his feet",Thank God (Interlude),2014
RJ,"When I was gone
I heard you was fuckin' on whoever
Love you again? I can never
When I was gone
You tried to take a advantage of a nigga
Had me pull a hammer on a nigga (On a nigga)
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes

I was, in jail wit' all niggas
You was waiting to exhale fucking wit all niggas
My momma said I should accept yo apology
But fuck that, that's just reverse psychology
I dont love you no more, and I think you a ho
You let a nigga go too long, without no sto
For all my niggas doing time, I know how it get
Yo homies disappear, and yo bitch turn into a flip

Once upon a time, I thought I found love but then she played me
I was gone, came back now my baby, having a baby
I know you was cheatin', I was outta town eatin'
But real players we don't get mad, we get even
But this is why I lost feelings, cause if these hoes ain't fully flippin',
Then they cartwheeling

When I was gone
I heard you was fuckin' on whoever
Love you again? I can never
When I was gone
You tried to take a advantage of a nigga
Had me pull a hammer on a nigga. (On a nigga)
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes

She got a nigga in here, dumb hot (dumb hot)
Tell a bitch, hurry up its in that green dot
Left a nigga in the dirt, now she like 7-Eleven giving free slurps
I bought a celly from my cellmate, she dont even text a nigga no kind of sex-play
Fuck that bitch, I'mma have the lil home girls rush that bitch

I say my bail too high, my hopes too low
My case too slow, violation from my P.O
I just got out I shoulda just stayed on the couch, 3-way now my ho tryna cuss me out
And my lawyer say the witness coming to trial,
On top of that I heard my main bitch fuckin' around
Im bangin' and shit, my lady prolly sellin' her clit, no money on my books
A nigga taking L'S wit this bitch!

When I was gone
I heard you was fuckin' on whoever
Love you again? I can never
When I was gone
You tried to take a advantage of a nigga
Had me pull a hammer on a nigga. (On a nigga)
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes

If I put my trust in a bitch, I'll always be hurt
Shoulda known you wasn't shit from that fake louie purse
You broke, dumb and goofy
Really tried to boof me, you gone end up like ya mama a old ratchet hoochie
You couldn't stay down if you was nailed to the floor,
Three baby daddy's I ain't tryna be fo' (uh-uh)
Thass why I got no love these hoes, sucka duckin', you be suckin all the bros

When I was gone, I heard you was fuckin on budda, hoein in the hood gettin gudda
When I was gone, heard you was hangin on the block, bitch I dont like you on da block
When I ain't home, you be doing hella ho shit
Thinkin I ain't heard up in this bitch?
Run my door, or I'mma pull a blade on you bitch
Pen it til she blast on you bitch
And I ain't wrong
My telly went big on the sto and you ain't even yo phone
And now a nigga on, lost all respect for you bitch
You can burn, I ain't gonna spit on you bitch

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Hey RJ, you ready?
Ohh

Only when I stop to take a breath
Only every time I take a step
That's the only time I grow to love you even more
Everytime I think I'm sure I know
Our love has gone as deep as it can go
Suddenly the feeling gets much stronger than before
 
You're my reason why
You're my living stream in a desert dry
And you can believe me

There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

See there's so many times
That I've taken your love for granted
It's hard work for us to grow the seed that we planted
I pick up the pieces
Of the past and present problems
You have perfectly placed in my path
To help me solve them
I can't even try to lie
Like I ain't blown away
I guess it's just a simple fact
And now I know today I'm tired of playing games with my devotion
I just want to press rewind and play it back in slow emotion

I'm never gonna turn

It led me to the truth

It's from the heart right here (yeah)
Everybody has a story to tell
Check this out though

I knew this chinese dude in Junior High
Part of my crew, everybody knew the kid
He was the talk of the school, intelligent
And well spoken, respected by teachers
All the other students kept their eyes on his sneakers
What can I say? You can tell he's cool if you talk with him
During fire drills girls would want to walk with him
He could have any chick up in his view
But there was only one girl he wanted to call boo
See its all true, found himself stressed in a dead end
The girl he was feelin was obsessed with his bestfriend
His bestfriends a playa, that's the reason he's pissed
Plus he treat her like she don't even exist
He ain't tryna hate on his man, but there was no help in it
Wrote the girl a letter told her how he felt in it
She was shocked at first of him revealing the truth
Till she realized that she was feelin him too

[Chorus]
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you

And you've been thinkin of me

Oh

Uh
So you know as time goes by
Things get a little bit serious
Just listen

It was strictly hip hop, now they bumpin slow jams all day
Went from holding hands, to makin out in the hallway
Their relationship, seemed like a dream come true
As time went by their friendship grew
Staring at the stars, trading secrets on the phone
When her parents were at work, she would sneak him in her room
He told her he was a virgin the day that they met

So on his birthday he got a gift he'll never forget
Females were jealous, but they still calling him cute
First day of summer school, they rocked the matching nautica suits
Happy in each others arms, can it be
They found true love, living in a fantasy
Then reality attacks, his pops couldn't see past the fact
His son was asian, but his girlfriend was black
Imagine having to choose between the one that you love or your fam
That's like cutting off your right or left hand, damn

[Chorus]

Uh huh, yeah

I know this sounds like a true story
Coulda happened to any one of us
It's crazy though right?

Now if this sounds like a true story
That's probably cause it is
And I know for a fact cause I'm that chinese kid
Mm, lookin back now, I know its more than just a crush
I'm sayin the whole expierience taught me so much
Love can overcome anything that gets in its way
That's reason I still think of shorty 'til this day
We talk now and then, she's doin her thing
We both full grown up, I think she rockin a ring
I know she's proud of me and all the things I've accomplished
She was there when I was nobody, that's being honest
Ain't no shame, I'll admit it she was there when I cried
So in return I wipe the tears from her eyes
As far as my pops, he's a little more open minded
If his son is happy, he's 100% behind it
Now this is a song I know I had to do
Cause all the stuff I went through might have happened to you

I do it all for you, I do it all for you

They put me on the wrong world, yes they did
Star on my forehead bless this kid
They threw me in headfirst, blind in the dark
In the alligator pit with the rest of the sharks
All I could think about was how they set me apart
I never knew a killer whale who had so much bark
The heart of a lion, I'm sharp as a dart
And it took me a long while to master the art
You know why?

What else do you need besides superb wordage?
Man I stay heated like a burner from the furnace

Outside the law, raw, never fall timid
Always ahead of myself, pushin past the limit
We taught the world to freestyle now it's a epidemic
Yeahhhh! Woo!

I walked the long mile just because I had to
I'll be glad to add to the pile if I have to
Ain't a situation on earth that I can't adapt to
I do what I got to, {?} to
I am what I am but that ain't all I can be

I leave 'em with they eyes open wider than Bambi
They don't understand me, that's why they abandon me

Skills stay hardy at the party for sustenance

I'm out with my nightstick, cruisin' the corridor

Cause anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you

Rjd2,"Yeah.
Yo, what up?
This is Aceyalone.
What's happening?
Yo. 
Let me tell you a story real quick about one of my partners,
About this cat I know. 
One of my homeboys, and we just gonna call him Junior.
Yeah, Junior got some money just for being a good kid.
He sealed it up and never even opened up the lid.
Girls gave him candy cause he treated him nice.
He took it home and chopped it up, and doubled up the price.
Miss Thomas at the parent's conference said we honest.
She was astonished at his confidence and what he accomplished.
He respected his elders, but he knew who he liked.
He listened before he talked, and he never would fight.
It's like, everybody knew him or they wanted to know him,
And anytime they did something for him, they felt that they owed him.
He was learning a life game that no one would show him.
He had more than an idea of where he was going.
He grew into a young man and gained some trust,
And he had a knack for pleasing people, and that was a plus.
Any situation he was in, he would adjust.
He never cussed, and he never fussed what he discussed.

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
We was the same age, but I still looked up to him because we had this thing together.
Some people just got that knack, and you can't do nothing about it.
But they end up being a victim of circumstance because he's on the rise and, you know, he's gotta battle against the odds,
And my man had such a good demeanor. 
He was smart, man. 
And he was a hustler.
And he had his ? up. 
And he had a natural ability to bring people together,
And which people he brought together.

By the time he turned 26, he was a...
He was becoming a young prince with a whole lot of sense.
Not only could he make money hustling white,
He had a little bit of everything to get you some height.
They made cash with him so nobody wanted to hit him,
But they'd get him if they had to get him, get rid of him quick.
But why kill off the goose if you're making grip,
And why kill off the captain if you run a good ship?
Some people are strong,
Some people are weak.
Other are smart, but still don't got a stomach for the streets.
But Junior had a different angle, he was an angel. 
The Calypso changed, though ?
The game could tango.
'Cause he can't tango.
A dance with wolves or waltz with a rattlesnake,
What would it prove?
They started salting ? up his program, hoping he'd lose.
But he stayed cool, and he stayed steady, making moves.

Yeah, okay. 
Meanwhile, Junior's off doing his thing, and living up to his full potential,
But the haters, and I don't even want to call them that cause they're worse than that,
But he's become a victim of the monster. 
You know, the machine, the revolving door.
It's them that got versus them that can't get, and ain't gonna never get.

Junior had it good.

Man, four years later, Junior got him a nice stack.
Compared to what he used to have, now he's got twice that.
When beef is at his door, he decided to ice that.
Now knowing more and more, he was caught in a mice trap.
He wanted to fight back.
But who could he tell?
The lesser of the two evils would just put him in a cell.
Everybody around knew that Junior was frail,
But he didn't need muscles to make it, all he needed was a scale.
A hundred and twenty-thousand in cold hard cash,
A stash at gun blast that don't even ask.
You get beat by the only one thing that can beat you,
Defeat you, cheat you, the streets will eat you.
Jealousy and envy make a person deceitful,
Then you add greed to it,
Combonation is lethal.

Well it's a short life knowing that it won't be a sequel.
Sometimes bad things just happen to good people.

Yeah. So they killed him. 
They murdered him in cold blood.
He died face-down in front of an empty safe.
And for the fools that did this, I hope you rot in hell.
I hope you live in hell.
For my nigga, Junior.
Rest in peace.

Junior had it good.",Junior,2006
Rjd2,"A bunch of wild boys was hanging around
At the local neighborhood saloon
And some cat kept dropping quarters down in the jukebox
Playing all the favorite tunes

And back by the bar playing cards looking hard
Was big bad Solomon Jones
And watching over his luck
Was the love of his life
Is the lady that was known as Simone

When out of the night which was dark and cold
Into the smoke-filled dimly-lit room
Stumbled in a thug
Who was smelling like bud
And his eyes looked high as the moon

He looked like a man with his foot in the grave
And his lifetime about to be out
Yet he slapped down some hundred-dollar bills on the bar
And he yelled out ""drinks on the house""

Now nobody could place where this dude was from
But we knew that he was far from home
But we drank to his health
And the last to drink was big bad Solomon Jones

Now there are some G's
Who just run the streets
And they live life in and out of jail
And such was he, that kind of OG
That looked like he'd been through hell

With his hair in cornrows
A mean mug grill
Like a dog who's day is done
He lit up the green stuff in his cigar
And took hits one by one

Now I got to thinking who this cat could be
And what the hell is- going on
Well I turned around and who was staring at him
The lady that was known as Simone

And the white t-shirt all stained with dirt
He was trying not to be rude
But he was trying to find another
Good song on the jukebox
So he could just set the mood

Have you ever been out in the city streets
With the gang-made players so clear
Where the police and gangsters control the block
And gunshots is all that you hear

When the only sounds are the drums of war
And you left out in the cold
A half-dead man in a half-dead world
And a yellow-brick road to go

Then all of a sudden the music changed
And everyone just held their post â?¨But it felt like a life had been robbed from you
And everything that you held close
Â?¨That someone has stolen the women you love
And that her love was a devil's lie â?¨That your heart was gone and the best thing that you could do is crawl away and die â?¨It's the painful cry of a man's despair deep down in his bones â?¨I guess misery enjoys company, said big bad Solomon Jones

And the stranger turned
And his eyes had burned
In a most peculiar way
And the white t-shirt that was stained in dirt
He sat in to watch me sway

Then his mouth had frowned up in this kind of grin
And he spoke in a voice so clear
""Boys you don't know who I am
And I know that you just don't care""

""Now I'ma say these words
'cause these words are true
And when I'm done here I'll be gone
But one of you boys is a shiesty dog
And his name is Solomon Jones""

Then I ducked my head
And the lights went out
And two guns blazed in the dark
Then I women swooned
And the lights came on
And the two men laced with the starch.

With a bullet in his head
And pumped full of lead
Was big bad Solomon Jones

What a thug from the street
Who was hoeing his heat
And who knows to that lady named Simone

Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero
And Superman don't fly no more cause he ain't one with the people
He ain't nowhere to be found, when he should be fighting evil

You make me whole It's not the movies, but it fake the role
I try to take control for the sake of soul
But the only thing I get to do is scrape the bowl
When God made me, said â??break the moldâ??
I put foot to the concrete and shake the road
I don't have powers like a caped crusader
But I do have powers like an Ace invader
Back in the days he had so much flavor
He was so major to get you out of danger
Now you can't find him, and he's just a stranger
And if you did he'd probably give you the finger
Your hit channel's evil on your channel changer
And your hero with a lifesaver threw you an anchor

I really don't know what you thinking of
I can't make it wet from underneath my glove
I can't see through walls but I can see through you
You dress up the ball but that's all you do
You fell for him, he didn't fall for you
And just me is what I got to offer you
I don't save the day, I just pave the way
In the city of Gotham where every day's a day
I know it pays to play, but I ain't playing
I ain't laying my coat down; know what I'm saying?
You want lots of muscles and lots of green
But my hustle and bustle is my only thing
It ended all bad as my last song seems
You need a star in your life and not in your dreams

But blow up in skrilla Cali, a must to maintain my composer
Bit the bombest spot for the doja

A 9-4-3-3 soldier, a bitch will most to the square
But I ain't got no choice but to be a player
'Cause I ain't even trying to go there
I'm gonna lay back in the cut breakin' bread with the crew

So all you niggas riding for me I'm riding for you
I thought you knew

[Mac]
Come around my way so we so we can sip E&J 
Hennessy and Coke niggas gettin' smoked in the alleyway
Them Cali days nothing but sunshine running from the one time
Still hittiin' fences, lifestyle is stupendous

Spittin' true game since wayback 
Nigga don't hate me because I'm way phat
Can't put too much on it
I'm saucy floss like Prego, from Diego to the Bay
I'm clockin' grip like Canseco

[Mac Mall]
Now must I
Tear a page of the game for them suckas
Mac & A.K. is the name a straight hustla
Got two hoes eatin' out eachother

Pimp shit and you don't ever have to wonder
At the Ramada I done stayed smokin' ganja
Yo baby mama with Double M up on her
And why'all know what Mall do work pussy like no other
When I'm threw, get blew

RKCB,"There's something I can take from your fingertips
But it's hard to only be the one you're playing with
Do I fake the fight to prove I'm right?

I'm twisting that kind of heart of mine
Am I colorblind, don't turn my lights off
I'll catch the sun tonight

Maybe I should go
Listen to the voices that are telling me
I shouldn't be here
Better take it slow
Under pressure, I'm not perfect, no
Could the pressure turn into a tired episode (under pressure, babe)
Under pressure, makin' our walls come down
Under the pressure pushing my heart right now

Haven't seen the deep end anyways
Contemplate the feeling, looking for a reason to stay
Can you leave behind the times I tried to get you out my life?
But I need to feel ??? laying here, oh who's on your mind?

Maybe I should go
Listen to the voices that are telling me
I shouldn't be here
But I need to know
Under pressure, I'm not perfect, no
Could the pressure turn into a tired episode?
Under pressure, makin' our walls come down
Under the pressure pushing my heart right now

Are you looking for my attention?
Have you ever been under pressure?
You know that I love the tension
Well if that's what it is

Maybe I should go
Listen to the voices that are telling me
I shouldn't be here
Better take it slow
Under pressure, I'm not perfect, no
Could the pressure turn into a tired episode?
Under pressure, makin' our walls come down
Under the pressure pushing my heart right now",Pressure,2016

The colors on your wall,
Reality's much different now,
The answers at your call.

Don't stop this trip,
'Cause I don't wanna grip.

Hallucinations wild.
Curiosity's growing,

You can say I'm just like them

Smoke a doob to my forehead.
It's in my mouth before I leave my bed.
Can't you see?
I gotta get stoned.
'Cause I'm just another Pothead.
Without a doob I'm totally lost.
Gotta score some bud,
Whatever the cost.
Sell me a bowl, or maybe a jib,
Or I can't even live.
It just gets worse day by day.
Have to smoke more to get the same way.

RKL,"Betrayed
Feelings of rejection, no false hopes or misconception
Just a burning in my head and in my heart
Promises were made, friendship lost along the way

A twisted path of lies, deception from the start
The future lay in your hands with talk of stardom, all your plans 
We had our dreams, high hopes, we trusted you
But the decisions that you made

And the staring role you played
Quickly made us realize what we must do
And I gave my trust to you
Got stabbed in the back and left for dead

Why'd you do the things you do?
With all the lies, deceit, wrong things got said
Never expected this of you
I should've known better than to do what I did

I was blind and you were shrewd
Had me eating from your hand like a naive little kid
Laid down my guard, wound up screwed

Betrayed

There comes a time in every life 
When quickly we must learn from our mistakes 
Now trusting no one, guard held high
Second guessing all the chances that he takes

We all must learn to use the term ""my friend""
To those deserving of the phrase
Avoiding the pain and all the rage from knowing 
That you've been betrayed

Never again will I trust you
Left for dead, knife buried in my back 
I wish I would have knew
Your sneakiness, plan of attack

This is what you do
Lying, cheating, and all that crap
No chance for number two
With my guard held high and my wall built strong
Next time around I'll screw you

There comes the time in all of our lives 
When quickly we must learn from our mistakes
Not knowing why we made them, just the outcome
And the feelings they create 

Whether it's sadness, loss of trust, death, pain, forgiveness,
Love, joy, sex, happiness, or fate,
It's one of these, the biggest one, that I really hate
It's a feeling you get when a trust so deep 

A trust between friends has been broken
And you know you got played, it's that feeling
You straight up been betrayed

Fallado te pido perdón, solo te pido que
Te pongas en mi posición y que escuches

Hola Soy Yo
De verdad estoy llamando para decirte que
Lo nuestro no puede continuar, espero que puedas entenderlo
Y que algun dia me puedas perdonar

Hoy a terminado el amor de los dos
Quisas amarte tanto , ese fue mi error
Hoy no sentiras nada , pero pronto veras
Que el amor que te di nadie lo igualara
Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas , mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola , con ganas de amar
Lloraras

Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas, mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas solas, con ganas de amar
Llorarasss

Cuando beses otros labios y, no
Sientas en calor que sentias conmigo
Cuando veas que ya no hay marcha atras
Vas a querer regresar, y muy tarde sera

A veces no sirve el amor sin ser conrespondido
Te llevas mi corazon en pedazos partido
No me diga que el tiempo que pasamos se a perdido
Solo recuerda los momentos bellos que hemos vividos
Vas a llorar, cuando quieran besarte recordaras los momentos que tu Solias amarme
Vas a sentir lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Este dolor tan grande que me esta matando aqui adentro.

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola, con ganas de amar

Saber mas de los hombres 
Y que no existe nadie ya 
Que te asombre 
Yo te dare el amor 
Que te corresponde 
Te llevare adonde.. 

Te regalo amores 
Dentro de tu vientre 
Pinta'o de colores 
Dame lo que sientes 
Pa' que no llores 
Tengo amor sincero 
Amor del bueno 
Para llevarte lejos de los dolores

Quiero darle colores 
A tu día gris 
Robar tu corazón y sanar tu cicatriz 
El llevarte de cruzero 
Y en el medio del mar 
Poderte acariciar y poderte besar 
Decirte al oido que mi amor es sincero 
Y que por ti daria todo lo que tengo 
Y mi dinero 
A veces no te encuentro y me desespero 
Por que siento que si no estas a mi 
Lado me muero 

Ya no llores mas 
Por un amor que mal 
Te dejo llorando y sufriendo 
El amor se va otro llegara 
Gota que baja va subiendo 
Y no pasaras mas la vida 
Solita sola llorando 
Yo te hare feliz 
Quedate a mi lado 

Te regalo amores 
Dentro de tu vientre 
Pinta'o de colores 
Dame lo que sientes 
Pa' que no llores 
Tengo amor sincero 
Amor del bueno 
Para llevarte lejos de los dolores 
Pintar en tu vientre 
Un rio de amores 
Dame lo que sientes 
Pa' que no llores 
Tengo amor sincero 
Amor del bueno
Solo para ti

¡para todas las damas del mundo
¡bienvenidas al castillo

Hola Soy Yo
De verdad estoy llamando para decirte que
Lo nuestro no puede continuar, espero que puedas entenderlo
Y que algun dia me puedas perdonar

Hoy a terminado el amor de los dos
Quisas amarte tanto , ese fue mi error
Hoy no sentiras nada , pero pronto veras
Que el amor que te di nadie lo igualara
Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas , mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola , con ganas de amar
Lloraras

Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas, mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas solas, con ganas de amar
Llorarasss

Cuando beses otros labios y, no
Sientas en calor que sentias conmigo
Cuando veas que ya no hay marcha atras
Vas a querer regresar, y muy tarde sera

A veces no sirve el amor sin ser conrespondido
Te llevas mi corazon en pedazos partido
No me diga que el tiempo que pasamos se a perdido
Solo recuerda los momentos bellos que hemos vividos
Vas a llorar, cuando quieran besarte recordaras los momentos que tu Solias amarme
Vas a sentir lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Este dolor tan grande que me esta matando aqui adentro.

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola, con ganas de amar
Lloraras",Llorarás,2008

Se que estas nerviosa es tu primera vez 
Te tiembla todo el cuerpo 
Estas llena de ansiedad 
Fue mucho el esperar y hoy por amor 
Tu cuerpo esta sobre el mio

RKM & Ken-Y,"Amigo, ya que al cielo tu haz partido
Solo una cosa a mi Dios yo le pido
Que entre sus brazos te encuentres dormido

Amigo, para nosotros siempre serás amigo
Te haz marchado pues lo quizo el destino
En nuestra mente siempre estarás vivo
Amigo, amigo

Entre llantos y tristezas hoy amigo te despido
Piediéndole al Señor que en sus brazos tu estas dormido
Con mis lágrimas voy recordando todo lo que hicimos
La ocurrencias que hicimos, en el barrio cuando crecimos

Mirando al cielo pido a Dios que te perdone
Siempre te recordaremos en nuestros corazones
Fuistes un amigo en las buenas y en las malas
Siento un dolor tan grande ahora por que te marchas

Amigo,ya que al cielo tu haz partido
Solo una cosa a mi Dios yo le pido
Que entre sus brazos te encuentres dormido

Amigo, para nosotros siempre serás amigo
Te haz marchado pues lo quizo el destino
En nuestra mente siempre estarás vivo
Amigo, amigo

Que es lo que debo hacer para yo conformarme
Si dia a dia lo que hago es recordarte
Quisiera tenerte frente a frente y explicarte
Para que veas cuanta falta tu me haces

Que es lo que debo hacer para yo conformarme
Si dia a dia lo que hago es recordarte
Quisiera tenerte frente a frente y explicarte
Que aunque te hayas ido, tu siempre serás

Amigo, ya que al cielo tu haz partido
Solo una cosa a mi Dios yo le pido
Que entre sus brazos te encuentres dormido

En nuestra mente siempre estaras vivo

RKM & Ken-Y,"Huh
Las mujeres no son las unicas que tienen sentimientos
Mamita te voy a hablar claro
Yo me siento mal, muy mal
Ken-why, explicales

Ayer me dijistes que me amabas
Que no habria quien nos separara
Que yo era tuyo why tu eras mia
Para nuestro amor no habian medidas
Pero de repente todo cambio
Ya no eras la misma cuando haciamos el amor
Hoy me pides que me vaya sin ninguna razon
Tu no sabes cuanto daño la hare a mi corazón, perderte

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)
(Que no me vaya no) (no)
Que no ves que ya no puedo
Que sin ti me desespero
[Muñecatu eres la razon que yo hago]
[Todo esto es la razon qYo trabajo tan duro]
No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Yo te quiero dar una vida, diferente]

Yo te quiero con todo mi corazon
Pero no entiendo la razon
Porque siento como tu why yo no somos lo mismo, a lo mejor
Estamos acostumbrao'
Why no estamos enamorao'
O maybe es algo que da duro
Why viene why se va como un morao
Pero mami let's work it out
Es un daño profundo
Pensar en los años
Que tu why yo viviamos juntos
Why que, todos esos años se fueron por gusto? (No, no..)
No me digas eso mami
Eso yo no lo puedo aceptar
Un amor como el nuestro es real
Un amor tan profundo
Yo te apuesto el mundo
Que tu te sientes igual
Un amor que no se puede olvidar
Un amor que no se puede ocultar
Un amor tan rico why tan fuerte
Que no se puede dudar

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)
(Que no me vaya no) (no)
Que no ves que ya no puedo
Que sin ti me desespero
[Muñecatu eres la razon que yo hago]
[Todo esto es la razon qYo trabajo tan duro]
No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Yo te quiero dar una vida, diferente]

Como pudiste lastimarme
Si lo unico que hice fue amarte
Creo que merezco una, explicacion
Creeme, he tratado de olvidarte
Why lo unico que he logrado es recordarte
Dime, como aguantar tanto dolor
(No, no, no)

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)
(Que no me vaya no) (no)
Que no ves que ya no puedo
Que sin ti me desespero
[Pero, pero mamita tu no entiendes?]
No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Tu eres la mujer que yo quiero,
Yo te kiero dar el mundo, yo te adoro
Hazme el favor why escuchame mamita]

Dime mami que es lo que tu sientes
Dime mami que es lo que tu quieres
Mira mi hija, tu sabes que la vida mia
Esta en la boca de toda la gente
Chisme por aqui, chisme por alla
Yo lo vi por aqui, yo lo vi por alla
Yo lo vi con esta, yo lo vi con esa
Entonces yo te llamo why tu no contestas
Yo te amo, yo te quiero
Yo te adoro, mi cielo
Yo quiero, vivir, mi vida, contigo
Yo te quiero complacer
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime
Yo te quiero complacer
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime!

Dime que debo hacer si la verdad es que no puedo
Alejarme de ti, olvidarme de ti, mamita yo no quiero
No me pidas más que no, no te voy a complacer
Si todo estaba muy bien
Dime amor, en que falle!!?
En que falle?
En que falle?
En que falle?

(No, no, no)

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme

Duermo solea'o, rocha'o porque te has marcha'o

Acariciando la noticia de no tenerla a usted
Entiéndanme, los hombres también lloran
Y más cuando se va la persona que mas adoran
Estoy en baja, down, ya no tengo ni palabras
Pensando en ti, dando vueltas en la cama
No es fácil vivir la agonía
De pensar en ti noche, mañana, y día
Estoy muriendo, sufriendo, yo te hago entender
Este amor yo te lo juro quise defender
Pero todo fallo en todos los intentos
No aguanto la agonía y este sufrimiento

No es facil vivir en esta guerra
Del corazon ma' y de la conciencia
En la que ni se olvida y el otro pide pasiencia
No aguanto las ganas de amarte porfavor regresa

Por ahi comentan que ella raya la locura
Es que eres tu causante de mi amargura
Que ando loco sin grupirme la tadura
He pedido los sentidos, he perdido coldura

Dimelo tu como hacer
Como borrar de mi el ayer
Dimelo tu como olvidar
Que fuiste mia y ya no lo seras
(No lo seras)
(Dice)

Como olvidar esa forma de besar
Ma tu te fuiste y yo no puedo pensar
Voy pa la calle y no me siento normal
Porque te fuiste con aquel animal?

No se cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar
Pa estar contigo y ocupar el lugar
Que aquel no pudo yo no vengo ha jugar
Yo si te quiero el te va maltratar

Siempre que te veo yo enloquesco
Trato de no pensar en ti y no puedo

RKM & Ken-Y,"I know that things are far from perfect
Please don't walk away
Give me a minute
Listen to what I have to say
I always put you number one in my life
Never thought we'd say goodbye

Mi amor te extraño
Cuando te siento lejos de mi
Vivir sin ti, me mata el dolor
Es que yo no soy nada sin ti
(No)

Siento en mi piel tus manos acariciándome
Te busco y no te encuentro amor
Es que yo vivo extrañándote

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Tengo un amor que vive en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ahahah de mi pasión
y me lleva volando hasta ti

Eres mi cielo, eres mi luz eres mi despertar
A ti te entrego todo sin mirar atrás
'Cause it's all about you and your future with me
Girl, it's so simple to see that this was destined to be

Abrázame, sentir que el tiempo es corto y se va
No existe la distancia en mi amor
Sera tuyo por la eternidad

Amándote, besándote y tu besándome
Descubro que estoy sintiendo que quiero morir
y amarte otra vez; sabes que

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Ouu tengo un amor que habita en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ah ah ah de mi pasión
y me lleva Volando hasta ti

Como le digo al corazon
Que ya no esta mas contigo
Sintiendo caricias tuyas si en verdad
No estas conmigo Cierro los ojos y te veo

Me refugio en tu recuerdo
y a la vez que pasa el tiempo
Me da miedo perderlo

Mi corazon se lamenta desde el día que tu te fuiste
Disimula estar sano cuando en verdad esta muy triste
Quiero saber si de verdad yo volverá a amarte
Quiero saber si siempre vivirá pa' recordarte

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Tengo un amor que vive en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ahahah de mi pasión
y me lleva volando hasta ti

Hola Soy Yo
De verdad estoy llamando para decirte que
Lo nuestro no puede continuar, espero que puedas entenderlo
Y que algun dia me puedas perdonar

Hoy a terminado el amor de los dos
Quisas amarte tanto , ese fue mi error
Hoy no sentiras nada , pero pronto veras
Que el amor que te di nadie lo igualara
Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas , mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola , con ganas de amar
Lloraras

Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas, mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas solas, con ganas de amar
Llorarasss

Cuando beses otros labios y, no
Sientas en calor que sentias conmigo
Cuando veas que ya no hay marcha atras
Vas a querer regresar, y muy tarde sera

A veces no sirve el amor sin ser conrespondido
Te llevas mi corazon en pedazos partido
No me diga que el tiempo que pasamos se a perdido
Solo recuerda los momentos bellos que hemos vividos
Vas a llorar, cuando quieran besarte recordaras los momentos que tu Solias amarme
Vas a sentir lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Este dolor tan grande que me esta matando aqui adentro.

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola, con ganas de amar

de emociones que llevo por dentro
Es tan sencillo amarte a ti
Es que estas hecha para mi

A tu lado ya no siento miedo
no me falta calor y tus besos
Siempre están listos para mí
Es que también yo descubrí

Un paraíso de ternura, de pasión
De mil locuras

Sin temores, sin censura, estamos los dos aquí
Con los ojos cerrados, amándonos, volando en un beso
Viviendo este amor que es tan puro y real
Este amor que se puede tocar

Con los ojos cerrados, enamorados
Soñando despiertos sin miedo
A que nadie nos pueda separar
A jurar que lo nuestro es eterno amor

Solo tu me iluminas el cielo
Con el fuego de tus ojos negros
No había sentido nada así
Me has dado ganas de vivir
Me has concebido la fortuna
De llegar hasta la luna

Sin temores, sin censura, estamos los dos aquí
Con los ojos cerrados, amándonos, volando en un beso
Viviendo este amor que es tan puro y real

Que te hayas ido, que regreses
Que el amor que no tenemos
Con el tiempo crece y crece
Pero es dañino
Afecta mas, nos duele tanto
Cuando vienes solo sufro
Cuando no reventa en llanto
Es difícil pero es mejor no volverte a ver
Porque desde tu recuerdo que me hacen comprender
Que lo nuestro es imposible
Nos hace daño
Que este amor nunca jamas podrá ser

Saque la puntuación mas alta en el amor
Sin ti de nada vale

Tengo un gran conocimiento

Tengo el corazón graduado en sentimiento
Con la nota que jamas nadie a alcanzado

Tengo mis sueños contigo
Todo lo que se tu me lo has enseñado
Nada de lo que yo conozco es fingido

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada
Me queda sin ti

Si tu no estas aquí a mi lado de nada me vale

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale
Los mil diplomas mil honores
De nada me vale

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Para que quiero un castillo
Si esta sólito ya no tiene reina
Para que vivir hacia sufrido
Si tengo tantas ganas de vivir
Y muero de amor

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale

Si tu no estas aquí a mi lado
De nada me vale

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale

Los mil diplomas mil honores
De nada me valen

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco

Wild Bandana, sto 

Sto crescendo male oppure forse no
Io capisco male oppure siete voi
Mi stupisco sempre per tutto quanto
Mi incupisco sempre perchè già lo so
Se mi metto a scrivere son già le sei
Spengo la candela, spengo quell’incenso
Spengo la mia testa e tutto ciò che ha dentro
Svengo nel letto e compenso
Svengo nel letto e contemplo
Sì, come se fosse un decesso
Siamo delle pile, delle pile vuote
Venti pile vuote le riverso sopra il blocco note
Fiume in piena, catene di edera sopra la schiena
Sì le mie radici me le tengo appresso
Sono morto così tante volte
Tanto da scordarmi di chi fossi
Devo ritrovar me stesso
Tu c’hai le botte sul telefono
No, mica come me che c’ho le bozze sul telefono (seh)
Tu c’hai le cozze, ma in testa
Ho preso mille strade sì, sì ognuna è diversa
Ora fumo fumo perché Charlie è Brown
Profondo Nettuno, fidi, flusso, Don
Sto connesso, tu stai con l’escort
Dimmi un po’ chi sta sbagliando
Fra’ come stai messo?!

Non sai cosa cerchino da te ma
Non ti importa più di tanto in fondo
Pare il tempo passi e tu ne hai perso troppo forse (ne hai perso troppo forse)
Faccio ‘sti soldi e vado via per un po’
Che Milano cuoce come carta da forno
Tu avevi un cazzo di sogno
Ma per riuscirci hai preso un cazzo di troppo
Ciò che ho visto resta qui con i miei
Tu fai il pitbull su Facebook, qua sul tempo fai schifo
Non mi conosci sono peggio dal vivo
Stai confondendomi per questo sto qui poi
Ciò che ho in tasca me lo spendo e spesso male
È impressionante fuori 
Non c’è un cane però resto uguale con i cazzi miei
Che provo a farci pace

Mandarci te resta una passeggiata sai

Rime fra chiavi mi aprono porte
Tipe tranquille diventano porche

È riempire di soldi ste borse
Ho anelli e collane
Pago l’affitto per me e per mia madre
Non li sento i commenti di questi, li lascio parlare
Li lascio affogare mentre prendo il volo
E divento un puntino lontano nel cielo che stanno a guardare
Nei messaggi privati lei mi chiama “Papi”
Mentre il mondo odia qua fanno la ola per questi scappati

I compiti a casa non li portavo mai
Mi fiondo al posto con chi da prassi
Mi accompagnò ai tempi, temi possa riperdermi
E mi ami più di quanto mi aspettassi
Nel letto aspetto l'attimo giusto
Le chiavi con cui ti apro
Ti hanno tarpato le ali, rose nere nel bouquet
Intorno solo teste chinate, siamo io te e le altre
In fondo siamo pezzi di un puzzle
E passo io per lo stronzo

And I'm feeling so ashamed
And I don't want to lose
My friendship over it

I got some issues with my own confidence
Lord help me to forgive and forget
Can you please help me to be a better man?

For the rest of the darkest nights
Shines the brightest sun
I hate the man I used to be
I'm better than before

What can a brother do for me?

What can a brother do for me?

Yeah, Next, uh Lil' Zane

Come on drop the top, let cha' hair fly

It's a clear sky tonight baby

Uh, let me know what's on ya mind

[Tweety]

It's Saturday, get the car shined up

Hair cut lined up, Heaven made my mind up

Professed one side of it tied up, won't see me there

I wonder how she wears her hair

If I see her I swear

I'm gonna put the game down like you

[Chorus: Next]

I'm just looking for love

I've been looking all over the club

Fresh Nikes, jeans cuffed, pressed in Sean John

Trying to find someone, someone for me

[R.L.]

I just tipped valet

Got in line through the metal detectors, stormin' days

Movin' to the sound of the DJ hoping she'll come my way

Is it the girl with the bomb weave, standin' next to me

Or is it the one with the short waves

A few are stepping but I ain't checking cause

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]

I switch lanes when I hoop game

Bet I score the same when I shoot game

I promise baby that I change whe the loop came

I'm off to bigger, better things with my new thang

No strings attached I'm on my two-way

Hopin' that our beams'll match

Gotta see you later baby, I'm a fiend for that

Wide body Navigator but my screens are flat

Now we watchin' motion pictures sittin' right in the track

Wanna honey dip, not interested in spendin' money

But how the money flip

She ain't concerned when I earn, she make money chips

I lit the fire place, baby gave me fine face

Tell me what cha' want but shorty I'm not Mase

I'm known for drillin' in a hole like I'm I-A

Fast as a speedin' bullet on the highway

Hopin' that I'm not late

And I ain't worried bout a ticket cause I got cake

Baby I'm lookin' for love

Autumn leaves just pass me by

That's the thing about true love
That is the way I want to be happy with you

RL,"Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for currency
But you could run to me when you need and I'll never leave
Honestly, someone to believe in, as you can see

It's a small thang to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to know he'd do the same thang if he could
'cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

Take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, till the end of time
Take these broken wings

Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all night, money making got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo

For quiet times disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homey had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sex his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' the only thing I did good was scrappin'

So I can fly away, till the end of time
Take these broken wings

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life as an outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate but death row full of demonstrators
And in the end drinkin' Hennessey made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath
While beggin' me to keep the peace

What I can see closer to achieve
In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G
Remember me, as an outcast outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about more
Gettin' raw till the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me

The only thing I ever had was you it's true
And even when the times got hard you were there to let
Us know that we'd get through

You showed me how to be a man
You taught me how to understand the things people do
You showed me how to love my god
You taught me that not everyone knows the truth

Ro,"She tries for the honesty but the truth just gets in the way
'Cause I know inside what she can't bring herself to say
There's something dying deep in her heart
I feel it when I touch her hand
So I tell her a lie when I tell her I understand.

[Chorus]
But inside I die a little each day
Inside I feel her slipping away
Inside if she knew that I hurt this way
Inside she'd find a reason to stay
And so I must keep this broken heart down deep inside.

She turns to look at me trying to speak her mind
A thousand reasons in search of a single rhyme
And suddenly it occurs to me she's trying to say goodbye
So I give her a smile and tell her that I'll be alright.
Oh

[Chorus]

Sometimes love will slip away it's hard to say just why
Is it something that's said or is it in-stead
Something that just simply died key change.

Inside she'd find a reason to stay
And so I must keep this broken heart down deep inside.

Ro Dolla,"It's eight o'clock here in kingston, jamaica
The kingston police have issued an apb
Out for wanted criminal rostacious johnson
He has last been seen headed towards
The united states of america or canada
If you have any info please call us right away

[Chorus]
I was a gangsta,
Livin' my life hustlin' on the block, with no food to eat
Rollin' with them prankstas
Settin' the streets on fire with the heat
I had no choice as a gangsta,
Livin' my life hustlin' on the block, with no food to eat
Rollin' with them prankstas
Settin' the streets on fire with the heat

Aiyyo, stepped off the edge of 'maica at the age of ten
Landed at the dot airport, comin' out of may pen
Raised by his grandmama, until his real mama
Could send for the youth, and reunite, aiight
So now he's growin' up exposed to the ghetto limelight
No pops (nope) plus his moms got to work nights
Moonlightin' as a janitor, to make bread for the two
All the while he's growin' up, runnin' with a crew
It started off tryin' to make a little extra creamer
But then it turned to pushin' rocks, savin' for the beamer
Told his moms he got a job workin' in the trade
At a local grease monkey, that's how he's gettin' paid
And that's how he got the deal on the black man wagon
Moms thought it was suspect, but she's still braggin'
To her kin about ""how he come home and grow right""
All the while he's wildin' out, money starts pilin' now
The next crew saw the flex and start red eye
Jealous of the way them niggas hustle,
Til he get a little muscle, uh huh, bust a bunch of shots
There my nigga laid, really holdin' down the block
That nigga gangsta

[Chorus]

Hey yo, six weeks in intensive, holdin' on to prayers
On the seventh, he was back on his back in the west wing
His man done came visiting, in his ear whispering
How the block was hot, and there was 'nuff shots whistling
Another week and he was back on his feet
Discharged, ready to get back and hit the street
Moms was still working overtime, clueless to the real
About how his son was livin' in the hood packin' steel
Pushin' coke no joke them cats wanted retaliation
Word got back, about who led the slaughter
One nigga named blaka, real name elroy
Next day (boom) what happened to that boy
For the next three months my man stayed on the low
Told his moms he wasn't workin' cause the garage was slow
But just as he tried to resurface on the strip
Someone on the turf called 222-tips

[Chorus]

Now my man locked up, and had to sweat inside a jail
Cause his man done fled the scene, and moms couldn't afford bail
The trial came and went, his mother cried ""discrimination!""
Said the judge didn't know her son
He said he knew him too well, he'd seen him there before
Turned the cheek cryin', now he feels he's on fire
Got burned by the same liquor, quit talkin' fresh
He doesn't know how to act, so now he got to go back
My man got dipped, sent right back to may pen
Grandma didn't want him, now family wouldn't take him
He thought about work, but he said ""f that!""
He got a fake passport and just came right back

[Chorus: x2]

Mama know the drug dealers straight quit her job
He took his life and along with him I died
And she died
We died...

Told me, ""daddy, don't cry, I'm alive""
I look her in the eyes and see me with no sins

I been going half crazy, running circles heart is dizzy
I'm hot-blooded, girl I wanted you, got so close but-could'nt touch you
How come we ain't-getting busy, thought that we'd be-making babies
Read the signs-can you see, I've been patient-until now

CHORUS;
It's to late baby-too late baby, the sex has gone
It's to late baby-too late baby, the sex has gone

Now you're saying, no more playing,
Wanna give your-self to me
Must have thought I-had forever
But your thinking-was way off key
Girl I still feel, something for you
It not the same-as it was before
Someone else has-got me confused
'cause she's giving-so much more

Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin raw
Skully tilted, pants saggin, damn near touchin the floor
And I come with do-rags to your so-called awards
T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all
Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path
A&R's had me feelin like moss in the drab
So I turned the league out with ""Reasonable Doubt""

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an 'Airmail Special' too

The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights

The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismatching, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch-drunk

Off comes the clown's disguise
The curtain's fallin'
The music softly dies

But I hope your smilin'
As you're filin' out the door
As they say in this business
That's all there is, there isn't anymore

We've shared a moment
And as the moment ends
I’ve got a funny feelin'
We're parting now as friends

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
If I had this to do again and the evening were new again
I would spend it with you again, but now the curtain falls

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
People say I was made for this
Nothin' else would I trade for this and to think I get paid for this

Thank you, goodnight
But now the curtain falls

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2008

Don't give that money to put enough in your gut
I gotta be the killer because I'ma stunt [?] leave us in the dust

And I'm beginning to treat my ill like others

I came to ice ya, a ring to nice ya

For the winning I'm gonna increase

I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems with me)

I don't know how I'm still hungry
But they don't know how the IRS hung me
What do you do when they take all of your money
Get gram like gumby come back like a bungee
All of my grief it is making me unleash
On a bum all my opponents will cease
So I'm yelling to the north, and the south, and the west and the east
I'm motherfukin' beast
When you don't have nothing
Only have the way that you go its still mad tough
And the crowd stuff, the lab book, and notes with the bad luck
And the flash up with the cash stuffed up in the bag
And you gotta get it no matter what
Don't give that money to put enough in your gut
I gotta be the killer because I'ma stunt [?] leave us in the dust
The ruthless, killed my mother
Something really stupid, feel my brothers
And I'm beginning to treat my ill like others
With real life smothers, I feel like thuggers
So bang, try to my way up in the gang, with the pain I write this
I came to ice ya, a ring to nice ya
She hanging knifeless, I'm stranger, hey bitch I aim when I spit
For the winning I'm gonna increase
The pressure when I'm having no peace, feel me
Because I gotta eat, I won't let the demons release, kill me
Son of a feast your gonna need a bishop of the priest
I am that monster coming to get you to say the least

I'ma motherfucking beast
I'ma, I'ma fuckin' beast
I'ma mothafuckin' beast
Fuckin mothafuckin beast
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems with me)
I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems)

Ok! So you've never heard of me, I am the reason that you've ever done anything creatively.
You sound ridicules! It's Rob fucking Bailey in this, bitch!
Stop crying about your blood and your sweat! Quit talking about things you haven't done yet!
Are you done yet? Do you need a second? Catch your breath I haven't even started yet!
I just want you to know that I am aware and I think everybody else is too!
Its been a few years, but I am well fed! Check my pedigree, I am well bred!
Ship captain, mine shaft, foreman till your hands black, like J. Henry, 
Hit spikes till I'm dead!
Lets take a break before the chorus and let that sink in.

I work harder than anybody knows and I've lost touch with everybody close to me,
But I won't stop, no, I won't stop, no, I won't stop, no, I can't stop!

Ywah, yeah And you should be a little jealous, 
At least that's all that instant messages tell us!
Well, I guess its on to the next one, mama said be the best so I am the best one!
We've invented this shit, with my whole life I've been in some shit.
Never got a handout, blue colors in me, blue on the outside,
Cut me open, blue blood comes out and I doubt I will bleed red.
Zombie mentality, work past death
And I'm hard in the head, brick walls couldn't stop a motherfucka, I am going all out!

No seeds, no water, no dirt, from concrete, I made it work.
Foundation, build over an empire, I am the bridge-stone, I am the fire,
I am the raw, I am the blueprint, I am the master you are the student.
So here is your first lesson, quit trying to be me!

I won't stop, I won't stop, I won't stop, I can't stop,
I won't stop, I won't stop, I won't stop, I can't stop!

Your four wings touch the sky
Fly too high the wax will melt
And you'll fall down to your knees

You go Downtown
Where your life's a joke
You go Downtown

You go

Where the hop-heads flop
In the snow
Down on Skid Row

Uptown you cater to a million jerks
Uptown you're messengers and
Mail room clerks
Eating all your lunches at the
Hot dog carts
The bosses take your money
And they break your hearts
Uptown you cater to a million whores
You disinfect terrazzo on their
Bathroom floors

Afternoon's a curse

And five o'clock is even worse

Crust of bread and a job
Treats me like dirt, calls me a slob

Show me how and I will, I'll get outta here

Downtown, 'cause it's dangerous

I'll start climbing up hill and get outta here

Downtown, where the rainbow's just a no-show!

Someone tell me I still could get outta here
Someone tell lady luck that I'm stuck here

When you live
Downtown, where the sun don't shine

Gee it sure would be swell to get outta here

Rob Base,"""War 
War!""
""War 
War!""

This is a beginning, message I'm sending, out
To all the rappers who think they got clout
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
want to start a battle with me, but I won't
Cause it don't make sense to me, just to see
Who's the best you see
We got a lot of negativity, in the rap industry
Battling for superiority
Who's the best? Who's the worst?
Who's the good, who's the bad? I'm mad, listen up now!

[Chorus]
""War, war! Huh, good God y'all"" (C'mon now!)
""What is it good for?"" (What?)
""Absolutely nothing!""
Say it again now (pump it up, pump it up, see'mon)
""War! You M-C's listen"" (uh)
""What is it good for? Absolutely nothing!"" yeah yeah

This is secondary, tell me is it necessary
To battle another brother, hurry
Tell me the answer, I want to know this
This ain't war, this is show business
Unless, I guess
You think, you're the best, I won't 'fess
I'll make peace, even though I'm strong
Another flow right along in a battle

[Chorus] 

L-l-l-l-l-l-l-let's talk about Hitler, a man with a sick mind
One of the threats of all mankind
He thought he was the best, the baddest
He's dead, and I'm the gladdest
A lot of rappers, they get ego's
Like kings and queens, and all my heroes
But no, I'm not claimin' no titles
Young kids, rappers they idols
I'm not a gangster, I don't diss
A lot of rappers do and I'm pissed
Like Hitler, they want to rule
But God's the ruler you fool!

[Chorus: x2]

Now you're the best, the baddest, the roughest, the toughest
Man, you ain't sayin' nothin'
to me, cause I'm another MC
(Doin' what?) Battlin' for superiority
No! That ain't true, I ain't you
And I ain't tryin to just knock you
I want to get some peace and love and happiness
And things like those you can't miss
Stand your ground, I ain't saying be a punk
(Why not?) Cause if you do, your ship'll get sunk
Cause this is war, no, this is show business
So let's get down to the bottom of this

[Chorus] 

It's funny, I don't see Patti and Luther battlin'
(Why?) It's doesn't matter and
All I want to do, is make music
Throw it on so the people can use it
Rap is strong, word is bond, let's go on
Let the dream live on, we're movin'
Like a jet, fast
Remember they said it wouldn't last

So, here we go, to claim a new throne
Step on stage and then you're in a twilight zone
Where no man has gone before
I like to kick the funky, funky, funky new style
So gimme space, clear the place so I can buck wild

Suckers try to beat me but they can't
Cause of my reputation, to rock this demonstration
The smoothest illustration, deep concentration
I think and sink into with the wits of a Ginsu knife
Do what you like to keep it real hype
Come and get the riff from the gift MC
Smokin' like a muthafuckin' spliff
When I rhyme I start to smoke, make you choke
Unlike a man that's broke
My rhyme is like thunder, make you wonder
You can't get over, go under
When I rhyme my rhyme bursts into flames
And they're tough like the drawers called Haynes

(I want to rock right now)
(Got to be funky)

Here's the conclusion of the dope rap rage
Use caution when you step on my stage
Cause I'ma rip MC's to shreds
Step to me, lights out, you're dead
I'll knock you out like in a Tyson fight
I roll you up like a blunt, real tight
Then smoke you, or just choke you
You shoulda chilled, cause now I broke you
Be cool when you see me flex
Left, right, left right, who's next?
Is it you, you, you, or your whole crew
Messin' with me you're through
I don't sleep and I don't relax
I kick funky lyrics to the max
I know you like the rhymes I'm swingin'
But there'll be more that I'm bringin'

Hit it!

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

I wanna rock right now
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to rock the microphone
Because I get stupid, I mean outrageous
Stay away from me if you're contagious
'Cause I'm the winner, no, I'm not a loser
To be an MC is what I choose-a
Ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me
Like the way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why, man, I don't know
So let's go, 'cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

My name is Rob, I gotta real funky concept
Listen up, 'cause I'm gonna keep you in step
I got an idea
That I wanna share
You don't like it, so what, I don't care
I'm number-one, the uno, I like comp
Bring all the suckers 'cause all them I'll stomp
Bold and black but I won't protect
All of my followers 'cause all I want is respect
I'm not a doctor, put them in rapture
A slick brother that can easy outfox ya
'Cause I'm Rob, the last name Base, yeah
And on the mike, I'm known to be the freshest
So let's start, it shouldn't be too hard
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a bodyguard
I won't fess, wear a bulletproof vest
Don't smoke buddha, can't stand sess, yes

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

The situation that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna lend
A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
But listen up 'cause I want you to comprehend
'Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes are not counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert
Take off your shirt, make sure it don't hit the dirt
I like the kids, the guys, the girls
I want the ducats 'cause this is Rob Base's world
I'm on a mission, ya better just listen
To my rhymes 'cause I'm all about dissin' 'cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

I stand alone, don't need anyone
'Cause I'm Rob, just came to have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
'Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows
About things that make ya get weary
Don't cheer me, just hear me
Out 'cause I got the clout, shout (ho!)
Before I turn the party out
I won't stutter, project my voice, speak clearly
So you can be my choice on stage
Or on record, go to the Wiz and select it
Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back
I like the Whopper, fuck the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So, throw up your hands, go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me, no, oh?
'Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the backup
We're not soft, so you better just slack up
'Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mike with the help of E-Z Rock
On the set, the music plays
Only cuts the records that I say

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

All right now
E-Z Rock now, when I count to three, I want you to get busy, you ready now?
One, two, three, get loose now!

It takes two to make
It takes two to make
It takes two to make, it takes two to make
It takes two to make
It takes two to make
It takes two to make
It takes two to make
It takes, it takes two to make
It takes two to make
It takes two to make
It takes two to make

Rob Beckley,"Slipping away
Are we sleeping at the wheel and unaware now
Has the population put us in a trance now
Overtaken by the tide and washed away now
What do you say now

In a daze
Are we moving in the motion of the crowd now
Slowly losing everything we were about now
Is it time to draw a line in the sand now
And take a stand now

Somebody talk to me, am I all alone?
When are we gonna wake up?
Are we numb, is the feeling gone?
Tell me what went wrong are we numb?
Close your eyes let the world pass by
Now you're hypnotized are we numb?

Moving away
From the heart of everything we tried to be now
Just stop look and tell me what you see now
We've been taken like the winds across the sea now
We've gotta break free now

Mesmerized
Desensitized
Before my eyes
I'm paralyzed

Somebody talk to me, am I all alone?
When are we gonna wake up?
Are we numb is the feeling gone?
Tell me what went wrong are we numb?
Close your eyes let the world pass by
Now you're hypnotized are we numb?

We're drifting
We're dreaming
We're floating away

So many times we just watch pass by
The tick tock of life leaving us hypnotized
Mesmerized a stun gun leaving you in a daze
Better wake up now before you find yourself slipping away

Are we numb, is the feeling gone?
Tell me what went wrong are we numb?
Close your eyes let the world pass by
Now you're hypnotized are we numb?
",Numb,2003
Rob Beckley,"Chorus:
Rise up lift ya eyes up 
get up stand up throw ya hands up and.. 

Verse 1:
sick of all the lies sick of the compromise 
sick of the way we live our lives and run and hide 
sick of the times we turn our head close our eyes 
can you hear the cries when you gonna rise? 
stand up! my people in the place where you at? 
stand up! God's people who ain't ashamed where you at? 
stand up! if you say you know his name where you at? 
stand up! cause you gotta proclaim what you have 
rise up! no more hiding no time for crying 
you can't be the light of the world when you ain't shining 
I'm straight rhyming so you'll be straight recognizing 
you ain't trying you just sitting there straight whining 
while the whole world around you just straight dying 
so keep in mind Jesus Lion of Zion 
gave his life so you and I wouldn't be frying 
so quit hiding it's time for you to start rising 

Chorus:
Rise up lift your eyes up 
get up stand up throw your hands up and 

Verse 3:
To all my real live people in the spot now 
rise up let me see what you got now 
we blowing holes in ya speakers when we rock now 
we keep it hot now every time we rock towns 
that's how we got down every time we drop sounds 
so you know you better listen when I talk now 
cause we never stop now or let ya guard down 
cause if you got the answer why keep it locked down? 
(Trevor) 
How many people want to see this rock now 
go bump it in your trunk rolling with the top down 
hold on cause I'm letting the missile drop now 
no hostages cause we're taking your whole block down 
yo we hot but not tropic 
in the mall might catch me in a Hot Topic 
we can talk if somebody want to knock it 
cause we coming at dangerous speeds ya can't stop it",Rise Up,2011

Rob Black,"[P. Diddy]
Yeah can you hear me? Yeah
There's certain things in life that you can stop
and there's certain things in life that can't be stopped
Let's go

""And now, for your, bad bad boys, starting at guard""

[P. Diddy]
why y'all niggas still talking?
Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?
What you have is a portion
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and
So you better use caution, knowing I'm the boss and
I'm sitting on pyramids, flossing
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you acting like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, making my mark on Harlem like Poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV
or pick up your CD, P.D.

[G. Dep]
This is gruesome
Niggas always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'
What's wrong with you son?
Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?
Then you living an illusion, living in a used one
while I'm in the Limited, cruising
You ain't really got a crew son
You giving them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant
You's a smoke head
I've been doing this since this Pro-Ked
Broke breads with the cokeheads
Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped
I said, I'm a ""Top Gun"" like Gossett
Run and get your CD and cass-ette
Gossip, lotta niggas got lip
But they ain't got hot yet 'til they got Dep

[Loon]
Why niggaz lie like that? Know they ain't fly like that
Niggaz get fried like that
And you don't want to die like that
Have your momma crying like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it frying like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, why y'all niggas better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggas is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is cock back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang

[Black Rob]
Keep fronting, I'ma put a crease in your jaw
Might catch me squeezing the four
My nigga I go to war
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store
why'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw
Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six
Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit
Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists
Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off
Fix your face, we back on the paper chase
Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place
Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice
the breadwinner, three-six-five I stay focused nigga

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Beneath the pressure of all time
They grow in hope and expectation
Waiting for your hands to find
Cause only you could reach inside me
And figure out the worth,
Of a life I lived providing
What it was you needed most

And if everything is measured by the hole it leaves behind
Then this mountain has been leveled
And there's no more diamonds in the mine

Was too strong for us to fight

The story of two lovers
Who danced both edges of the knife

In the station you're standing
Not knowing what you want
And the secrets we're defending
Have become our only bond

Just be patient while I wait here
Our journey is out of sync
While you're out there running in the chaos
I need some time to think

Fantasy man you are always one step ahead of me
Well I never heard the warnings
I haven't got things right
