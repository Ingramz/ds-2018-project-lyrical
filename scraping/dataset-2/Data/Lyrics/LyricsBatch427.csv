Would you take the nails from his hands
Would you take the place of this man

The depth of his grace
Flowed with every sin erased
He knew that this was why he came

That we will enter in this rest with wonders anew

But I hold on to this hope and the promise that He brings
That there will be a place with no more suffering

There will be a day with no more tears, no more pain, and no more fears
There will be a day when the burdens of this place,
Will be no more, we'll see Jesus face to face
But until that day, we'll hold on to you always

I know the journey seems so long
You feel you're walking on your own
But there has never been a step
Where you've walked out all alone

Troubled soul don't lose your heart
'Cause joy and peace he brings
And the beauty that's in store
Outweighs the hurt of life's sting

There will be a place with no more suffering

There will be a day with no more tears, no more pain, and no more fears
There will be a day when the burdens of this place,
Will be no more, we'll see Jesus face to face
But until that day, we'll hold on to you always

I can't wait until that day where the very one
I've lived for always will wipe away the sorrow that I've faced
To touch the scars that rescued me from a life of shame
And misery, this is why, this is why I sing

There will be a day with no more tears, no more pain, and no more fears
There will be a day when the burdens of this place,
Will be no more, we'll see Jesus face to face

Of Him to be my Savior

That He would leave His place on high
And for sinful man to die

Before I knew my Savior

Jeremy Carr,"I was six years old
Riding shotgun in a old school with my dad
Memories that I hold on to
'Cause really those the only ones that I had
They used to call me Lil' Rock
Skinny big head nigga with a rock
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hard
Even though my fam used to keep the grams in the socks, damn
It was me, lil Brandon and Nene
Outside running wild, fuck TV
On 13th all the way the 49th and Chambers
Shout out to my lil cuz Veve
And my uncle Jerome
One time for my uncle Jerome
In the basement smoking cigarettes with Tyrique
I think we did that when unc wasn't home
47th and Lloyd, first time I got jumped on the porch
Hit the oldest one with the one two, bink bink
Other one ran up, left his ass right there on the porch
Hell is you saying? Lil Jeff turned me into a man
That was big bro, that was big cuz
Everything to a nigga now he gone
Guess God had a plan, I don't understand
Lord why you do me this way? You live and you learn
Them tables will turn, them bridges will burn
But through it all, just make a way
I'm here to stay and I'ma do it for my city like the mayor
Real north-side nigga living life like my grandaddy Charles
He the reason why a nigga a player

Let me talk to 'em
Plenty nights when I felt all alone, nobody to lean on
Listen up, let me tell you how it feel
Look, I just tell it how it is, everybody claim they real
On the real these niggas ain't ever been real
I'm just living my life, I'm just doing my thang
Same nigga from the jump
Baby I ain't gon' change
Baby I ain't gon' change
Baby I ain't gon' change

Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be shit, is the shit,
Who knew?
Still ridin' 'round with my day one niggas
We don't need new niggas in the crew
One time for my nigga Dan
That was my first friend second grade, Mrs. Blue
I don't do too much, nigga just say what's up, man salute when you see me
These niggas upset 'cause they heard I got next
I keep cheese like Fellini's
Back in the day I used to be a hot head
Like I'm walkin' 'round with a beanie
In the middle of the summer
I'm just tryna score, nigga, no time to fumble
It's game time, everybody on ten
We just tryna get this money at the same time
I ain't claimin' what ain't mine
Got your girl on the edge like the state line
Ain't no mo play time
We just tryna get it off the muscle
Fighting for the money, how much hustle
I'ma get my bitch to respect my hustle forreal
Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit
Is the shit, who knew
Look, I'm just livin' my life, I'm just doin' my thang
Same nigga from the jump

What's the point of getting that money?
Money ain't money, if your life don't change
What's the point of pushing that whip
If you ain't changing lanes?
What's the point of having any girl
If your bitch don't change?
What's the point of staying the same
If everything around you change?
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed

All I need is change

Il a perdu au tout départ, Georgy
Il a pris sur lui et a appris sur lui
Il était seul, il aidait seulement les autres à s'en sortir

Qu'une croix s'est faite et Dieu merci

Et à comprendre un monde illusoire

Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me.

I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything

Is time worth saving in paper dollar bills
'Cause we always just done it don't mean we always will
Is it worth singing along if you have a song to sing
If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything

Can one single person make a change if they try
It's true all the martyrs that ever lived already died
Is the road so long we're gonna have to drive
If you don't stand for something, you will fall too far behind

Is there meaning in all these words that we say
Is there reason for living life anyway
Is confusion a state like Iowa or Maine
If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything

Are the waters so rough 'cause we tried to scrub them clean
Do we mean the things we do, do we do the things we mean
When a child is born, is it because she has sinned
If she tries to stand for something, will she take the fall for everything

When the day has come your shadow lost it's light
Will you see in the darkness who was wrong and who was right
Will the devil pay your tab and take you home with him

But what's the difference, it's a wonderful delusion and 
Most times you won't make it past second base

In the corner store back in my hometown, this stranger smiles at me

Jeremy Heiden,"Ask the girl of the hour by the water tower's watch
If your friends took a fall, are you obligated to follow

Time after time after time
when the bull's on his hooves, when you gather friends by the tower
If you try to refuse, will they judge your worth by the hour?

If your tired and you're tried you can find me in my room
You can stay if you want and the third time you can't lose

Ask the girl of the hour, by the water tower's watch
We can fight if you want but who will turn out the light",Time After Time,2000
Jeremy Irons,"I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride
It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares
So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer
And where do we feature?
Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!
So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!",Be Prepared [From The Lion King],1996
Jeremy Irons,"Breathe deep the gathering gloom
Watch lights fade from every room
Bedsitter people look back and lament
Another day's useless energy is spent
Impassioned lovers wrestle as one;
Lonely man cries for love and has none
New mother picks up and suckles her son
Senior citizens wish they were young

Cold-hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colours from our sight
Red is grey is yellow white
But we decide which is right
And which is an illusion",Late Lament,2018

Jeremy Lynn Woodall,"Way down in Virginia
Amongst the tall grown sugar canes
Lived a simple man and a dominiker hen
And a rose of a different name.

Well, the first time I felt lightning
I was standing in the drizzling rain
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
And a rose of a different name.

Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone.

When the devil made that woman
Lord, she threw the pattern away

She was built for speed with the tools you need
To make a new fool every day.

Way down deep and dirty
On the darker side of shame
I caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin
With a rose of a different name.

The devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
Help me leave that black rose alone.

They say my mammy left me, same day that she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back

And I just thought I'd mention, my Grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today

Pickin' cotton, rasin' hell, and bailin' hay

Another woman put together like you all
With your wiggle and your walkin', and your big city talkin'
Your brand new shiny Plymouth rag-top car

Yeah it's hurry up and wait, in this world of give and take
Seems like haste makes for waste every time
And I pray to my soul, when you hear those ages roll
You better know I'm gonna get my share of mine

There should be a place where the lonely go at night
For people just like me who just want to disappear
In the smoke and the darkness maybe drop a couple tears

This town needs a bar 'cause I need a drink
A little place not too far where I don't have to think
Or wonder who you're with, don't wanna wonder where you are
That might do the trick, this town needs a bar

Theres a bank down this street that helped us buy this house
That I no longer want because you're not in it now
And that church on the corner, I can go and pray
And the doors are always open but I don't wanna go today

This town needs a bar 'cause I need a drink
A little place not too far where I don't have to think
Or wonder who you're with, don't wanna wonder where you are
That might do the trick, this town needs a bar

We had everything we needed to build a life, a settle down
Everything was right there 'til you weren't around

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Jeremy Toback,"The weight falls upon my back
Dig deep to balance attack
Anger appear
Bury big fear
Soon old fire consumes
Battle with will
But something will spill
So I take the time slowly
Learn to loose my mind
Finding another unreason
And I leave the goal lightly
Learn to valentine
Kissing another true fiction
Kissing another true fiction
We say
Welcome home
The weight waits to call my bluff
Dares me to shed this tough
Shell of resolve
And self-absolve
With plenty to go around
Why me martyr, with sound
Watch it unfold
Grow young and old

Learn to lose my mind
Finding another unreason
And I leave the goal lightly
Learn to valentine

I'll come around
I'll come around
When you least expect me to
I'll come around
I'll come around
I'll come around
When your mind is wound around the problem
And the words won't ease pain
They just redirect the flow
Take your shut heart to the shore of your river
Lay down armor
Let loss go

Jeri Brown,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Jeri Brown,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

A house with installments due,
A letter with lots of X-S

a kiss without a future in it.

A knife and fork to spoon with,

Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares

And disinclined to play

To go your own sweet way

Nobody's heart belongs to me today

And I want you more than a new pair of shoes

How many rappers I killed, counted at least 40
Nah I ain't God, but shawty down on her knees for me

A Love Supreme, that's cold fame album
Lately I've been dancing like a Soul train album
Lately silly making songs bout how they hate me

Don't be talking too much, these niggas copy too much
These niggas cardio crazy, chasing clout must be tough
Fuck it, I wrote me, a dozen niggas got me fucked up
I raise my hands and raise your family's casualties up
I'm faded, I'm playing
These niggas don't be no gangster, they be paying it, yeah
Extortion ain't dead, it just moved to the county
Shoot them out the S-class, I guess you won’t see the problem
I know every who and who and every who that I’m around
And what you call a piece of mind, I call a picture for a bounty
Hold up, yeah, I'm in my luggage, in my luggage, hold up, boy
I’m on the runway like I'm Jackie, hold up

Yeah, stepped in the building with my vibe on a million
Slide on the beat like, ""My God, I'm so brilliant""
All other rappers, put your pride to the side
Try collide with the squad, turn your mob into corn on the cob
You's a fraud, you's a thorn in my side
I'm a knife in your back, I'm that turn of the knob on the door
When the boy from the corner come rob you
And tie you up to something, now, stop with all that frontin'
That big money talk should be reserved for those that got it
But when you really got it, you ain't pressed to talk about it
That's why I hear that capping on your raps and highly doubt it
The game too crowded
I'm 'bout to get all the way the fuck up out it
No if's, and's or but's about it
Thirty mil' on a deal depending on how the tour was routed
I seen your watch when you first dropped, that shit was clouded
Which means, you used to fugazi shit
Fake it 'til you make it-type, I shoot through you crazy with
Hollow tips, no holler backs, just hotter raps
I gotta black to make sure every dirty dollar stacked
Y'all aiming for the stars, bitch, I'm aiming at your starter cap
Run, nigga, run like a fucking black quarterback (uh)
Stereotypical, but to hear me is pivotal
I will bury you niggas and come and air out your funeral
Have your homies on stretchers right next to Roman numerals
IV's, IV's
It's the reason why nobody try me, try me
Have a nigga screaming, ""Lord, why me? Why me? Cole did me grimy
He took it too far, he treat them bullets like they Siamese""
Back to back, I clap like that's a wrap, but
No video shoots, just hoodies and boots
Putting your troops in pine boxes
I blew a million on white tees and Calvin Klein boxers
This nigga silly

Girls acting friendly now 
(Killa c'mon feel me, ow 
I leave'm past sleeping 
Last weekend 
I took Cardin to get his ass eatin'
He said you pass freepin' 
But I'ma ace so throw your cards up 
But if you stink baby, I ain't hard up 
Parl' up 
To wash up 
But that's insulting 
Revolting 
But if you clean we ballin' 
Eat you 'til you catch convulsions
And girls all feign, for the bod 
On my team and my mob 
Think we scheme and we rob the way they screamin' for God 
And all sluts, with he V's 
Let'em see how it be 
They be like ""No, you ain't puttin' all that meat up in me"" 
You wil'in out 
For the styin'out 
Girls say I'm foul and doubt 
But baby got to understand 
That's what my style's 'bout

Jermaine Dupri,"Everything you like is with me
So if you know, like I know
This is where you need to be

Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Leaves you alone, he's with me

Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
And everything he likes is with me

If I was in your shoes I would've had to let him know
From the first sign of him tryin to play
If you want me to stay you gotta let all that go
Oh, but no, you wanna stick around
And not believe in what you see
And while your waiting, thinkin everything is gonna be OK
I gotta him, I got him right here with me, oh ho

Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Leaves you alone, he's with me

Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
And everything he likes is with me

I wanna call you so bad and tell you
When it started and what we do
How long it's been going
Why he ain't gon' never come home
'Cause I know what
You didn't do to make him stay
See a bad performing, unfulfilling woman, drives a man away

Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Leaves you alone, he's with me

Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
And everything he likes is with me

And now as far as I know
He's in good hands
So you can stop calling all around
Saying have you seen my man
Ain't no need to fuss 'n fight
Trynna to make it right (no ho)
Certain things ain't meant to be
And that's why, that's why he's right with me

Everything you like is with me
So if you know, like I know
This is where you need to be

Everything you like is with me
So if you know, like I know
This is where you need to be

Everything you like is with me
So if you know, like I know
This is where you need to be

Everything you like is with me
So if you know, like I know
This is where you need to be (Do you wonder?)

Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Leaves you alone, leaves you alone (don't you know he's with me)

Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
And everything he likes is with me (everything he likes is with me)

Do you ever wonder when he
And everything he likes is with me
And everything he likes, everything he likes
(In the middle of the night he leaves you alone, leaves you alone)
Everything, everything he likes is with me

And everything he likes is with me (do you ever wonder when he )
Everything he likes is with me
Everything, everything
In the middle of the night he leaves you alone
And everything he likes is with me","With Me, Pt. 1",1998

Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some? 

Motherfucker, go get you some
Get off my dick, bitch, get out my mix and tell me where the real niggas at
Put your blunts in the air, y'all nigga get fried to this
To the ??? to mother, tell me who the thuggest in this motherfucker
What you niggas really wanna do? Big ballers flossin'
Niggas wanna beat so they got to be talkin'
Oh let me give them what they say and run 'em in they face
What they say? ""Oh nothin'""
Buster, hit'em in they shit anyway (hey)
That's how we play, stil thuggin' ain't a thing change
Still the same name, love the face
Real, real niggas, that's all I gotta say
You fuckin' with the real, you ball to get gusted
Really, the real ain't shit to be fucked wit'
Protected by the niner, when you careful
The nigga the trigger finger itchy fixin' to make you duck the whloe flock
Make a nigga close shop, sho nuff
Showstopper, fuckin' 'em up with diesel
What's pumpin' the shotgun?
Real neccesary cause all we want is a little respect
That's all we want but nigga, you don't feel me
Krazyie crazy, maybe insane hangin' with JD
Little rip done slip the clip into the gat, rat-tat-tat
Just like that

I ain't fixin' to be the bitch to procastinatin'
Niggas wanna be shippin' me half a cake
Go through whatever drastic measures I hafta take
Make a motherfucker masterbate, the hotter I get the more hate
Some of you hoes is overrated with flows
The salvate'll take'em to the rehab and get'em re-instated
My lyrical content send other bitches to convents
Pray for me to be deleted but that's nonsense
Been the bomb since '74 Aries
I can see how ya nigga be lookin' at me
He want to get in between the sheets
Leave the wallet and the keys for me
I ain't persuaded easily but if he spend the cheese for me
Nigga, we can fuck free frequently
You study me, but another me could never be sold
Broke the most 6-0-6-4-4
When niggas'll haul off and hit ya with the sawed off
Seen plenty motherfuckers fall off with they jaws off
When I'm finished droppin' 'em al off on the west side of Chi, I'm ridin' high
Thinkin' of way to make it through the major of the paper chase
Slidin' by, keep a luger in the chamber ready for danger when it's time to die

Nigga, don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some?
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some?

Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some? 

Nigga, don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some?
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some? 

See everywhere I go, I feel like niggas be tryin' to get me stuffed
I'm flyin' on out of what? Iced up and all the hoes wanna fuck
Knockin' bitches and that nigga got cake stacked up, packed up
Everything I touch, gold and platinum, what?
Niggas can't fuck with us
Like Busta Bust, we dangerous
And you know that if I peel I got mo'
Y'all peel, it's gone, that's why the ice grill on
When the wheel on by y'all niggas in the corner
Back and forth, like ""fuck that little guy""
Don't worry bout me, you need to worry bout yo' goddamn self
How you shit on shelf and how you sit around
Wishin' that a nigga would sign to So So Def
I'm a A-T-L-A-N-T-Alien
Never been known to play with
Can't none of y'all see me, so y'all niggas don't really need to say shit
With all your paper-hatin', paper-hatin' and your bad looks
What y'all need to do is shut up
And take heed to what my nigga sayin' in the hook

Nigga, don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some?
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some?

Goin once, goin twice, everyday, livin nice
In the grey wit the ice, makin money rollin dice
Livin the life, that y'all dream of
Puttin niggaz outta business like Sony did to Sega
You seen us, the green stuff
An nuttin' else that's all I collect
I got the hots like the Lox - Money, Power and Respect
An' I can damn the check that any of y'all niggaz spit

Not even close to nines
Sorta like fives and sixes

Type of bitches that spit in yo' face like Alomar
Broke hoes without a car 
snatchin' fruit from salad bars
Which one of ya'll come on, test me now
Me not goin' nowhere, you don't impress me now
So next time you see me up in them clubs
I'm probably scemin'

I'm feelin' that 2x  is you wit' me? 
I'm the type you see at the bar  fresh  buyin' it up 
And every girl I talk to  yeah I'm tryin' to cut 
I tell'em all I'm Chi Chi and it's nice to meet ya 
Real quick  I tell how she got all the right features 
The jams come on and the glasses get refilled 
We dance and watch the relations build 
Now I'm all up in her ear and she listenin' 
At the same time, watchin' how a nigga glistenin' 
BLING! BLING! I'm thinkin' it's bout time to go 
Get the be	 out of valet and start the late night show 
Niggas hate, I know but I don't stop I shine 
I'm in the club every week, same place, same time 
Same thing on the mind, PARTY! PARTY! 
So the hell with all that, we tryin' to find somebody 
The right kind 'fore the lights come off 
Shit, I'm tryin' to take sumpin' home 

[Chorus] 
Now if I buy you a drink and you drink it up 
Then, uh, you goin' home with me (and all my niggas say) 
And if you talkin' at a party and we talk too much 
Then, uh, we goin' home with me 
Now if you came with a friend that don't want to do my man 
Then you need to give her your keys 
Tell her to call you tomorrow or give you a beep 
Cause tonight, you going home with me, ya heard? 

[JD] 
Now, is it because my name's Jermaine? no 
It's all about how I kick my game, you know? 
I just flow with it, spend a little dough with it 
Entertain, before you know, I'm in your brain doing my thang 
Tellin' you how good you smell 
Send you up for a drop top cruise through the A-T-L 
Now when they tipsy, it's risky, you don't know what you facin' 
Fuck around and end up like Anthony Mason 
So I let'em know a few things before we leave 
Like, ""it's true, I tapes damn near everything"" 
So don't even think about lyin', baby 
Or try baby, to set me up for rape cause it's all on tape 
Where you said put the cake 
How you fed me the grapes 
What I did with the ice that made you shake, shake 
Now when the night's over and the girl is gone 
I'm back up in the club singin' the same damn song 

[Chorus] 

Now, walk in, I'm the grown man that you figure to trick 
But I'm feelin' your dress, girl and lovin' your hips 
But I'm buggin' off this, ""Why you stuck on the wrist?"" 
Golddigger, huh, mommy? Oh, you ain't that bitch? 
Ain't that some shit? Suddenly, you hugs and kisses 
Gotta be the dough you holdin' so obvious wit' it 
I get G's to flash, T.V.'s in the dash 
See Sinbad, watchin' Vibe, ladies clockin' to ride 
Luxury flows, lengerie hoes, R.O.C. hit'em mo' than Jose Conseco 
Uh, RBI's, orange top fly, the brown skin, slim 
The nice braids, brown eyes 
R.O.C.'s stay pimpin' from Jersey to Richmond 
y'all playas waitin' to ball like 6th men 
I'm done with the game, point spread by a hundred 
Speakin' of hundreds, five's is a nice way to slide it, let's ride

Sho nuff a sight, anything ya like
You know the ones you wanna make your wife, ya heard me?

Little fast bitch, actin' sarcastic
Need to get her ass kicked, tryin' to get the cash quick
She be my last pick, I got a real hoe
Take yo' ass back to class and buy a dildo
Don't let the freak in you  keep you up all night
Gettin' fucked and sucked, you wastin' your life
Before a real nigga ever kick a hoe down
She gotta understand what I know now
Ain't no broke down, lazy, gold digging, cute bitch
Come around me gettin' credit cards and don't do shit, bitch
I travel throughout the year
I keep a woman with a house and her own career
So when I buy her a diamond ring, it's just a gift (what's your name?)
Too Short baby, don't need to trick
I give her what she want cause I'm a real player
Platinum after platinum, ask me how I feel later

See I ilke them crazy hoe
Them straight, get down and pay me hoe
I wouldn't mind no jazzy hoe
Make my creep fall right out my clothes
On the blow, can't let no hoe see my flow
Tight jean and bra strap, girl that got to go (gotta go)
Strip you on down like a shake-a-booty hoe (uh huh)
Put you in the street, make me mo' money mo'

Now see, just the other night, I met me a ol' jazzy hoe
Straight boozyabitch, ol' sassy hoe
Who think she fly to death, so I ain't gon' hold my breath
To let you skeezers know, just let you ask yo'self
For as I cut one but two down the line
But could it be yo' hoe that I'm cuttin' everytime?
And I come to find she servin' every nigga in yo' clique
To get in where she fit in, now she known to be a trick

Quote for quote, who tote like this
Hit the Club Jig, on some Wes Snipe shit
Snatchin' all the hoes in your harem, indeed
I mock turtlenecks while I'm bees and tweed
Til I proceed, damn right, the spot's tight
Nothing but dimes in sight, so just might
Bag these bitches like groceries
Player to player, you can't get close to me
Now who you 'posed to be?
Pullin' toast on the  S-O double N-Y, girlfriend lookin' fly
And I can tell she schemin' (why's that?)
Cause she like the ice is gleamin' (okay)
But that's cool though, cause I know how to stain golds
I pimp tight without the kangol, niggas know
I slang flow, east to west
Available at anytime to put the pussy to the test

Shy, not I, some times I choose not to speak
Surrounded by my real niggas drinkin' Hennessee
Or Remy or Red Passion with champagne
Chiefin' up some hay, gettin' at them hoes, man
Trick, not I, trick be you, can you dig that?
I got star hoes pickin' me up in Tahoes
Fuck them at-the-bar hoes, tryin'-to-score hoes
Mickey dropin' hoes, quick to drop they clothes
I give those only funky weave wearin' bitches
All made up, gettin' at a  niggas riches
I like women with they head on straight
Pull your own weight and you can fuck wit' Eight

So So Def
Yeah, yeah

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why?  Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam

What cha want to do?
What cha want to do?
We're the Legion of Doom.
We're the Legion of Doom.
We're the Legion of Doom.

Fourteen seventy-two is the same cut throat and locks,
And plenty dopes can you cope.
You can call me Count Chocula.
I control all the bitches, Chi-Chi control the riches,
And fly surf the snitches.

Look up in the sky as the fly,
My herion wip, clip on hip, now trip on this.
A bunch of outlaws try to take my town,
Set up shop, run me out, and cut me down.
And how that safe, when I'm the illa-superhero,
Born and raised on that muthafucking underground.
Brrrrbrrrrbrrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em.
Try to catch me, slip 'em, but now you about to be my victim.
I'm not Aquaman, but a aqua-boogie.
I'm sorta like a monster, chasin' cookies,
And I spin a web any size, you can call me to fly.
I walk walls and this is for all my dogs.
(Woof!)
I'm like the wonder twins, my style activates.
The many niggas get in it, and try to playa hate.
It's fly, the rider Maine and Ri, (man, man.)
I do it like a muthafucking rider,
And I represent all the time and
I represent the mad ass fuckin' eastside.
(Eastside,) look out, look out, come out,
'Cause here comes the rider man,
(Rider man,) nigga.

I rock the blue cake on 'em, drop the weight on 'em.
The more they hate, the more I elevate on 'em.
I swerve and collect, serve and protect,
Never hit the streets without the ice on my neck.
I'm all about partying, hos, and getting paper.
They call me Chi-Chi and do it up, caped crusader.
Contact through the frame, no mistakes.
To bank rules, back in town and it's on us to shut 'em down.
Now fly what cha want to do, (nigga what.)

Let's put this shit down my lil' homey, Mr. Turner, with the murder.
He got my back, you know he put me up on game.
When they get up, they getting lit up, heat that shit up.
Enough said, don't tell it, jus' sell it.
We blowin' in the wind and we gonna ride till we win.
Young soldier, stickin' to it, we put the Folgers. 
It's your turn gone get on up and get the light,
And don't forget to grab your strap.

[Chorus x 2]
Look up in the sky.  It's a bird; no it ain't.
It's the Legion of Doom, ain't a damn thing changed.
Keep it safe and sound, get it locked down,
And you don't have to worry when we in your town.

Just a young muthafucker from the street,
Forced to be a G-angsta, knock-knock with a glock, pump-pump answer.
Throw your hands up, nigga, yeah, death's a callin'.
Went from petty deaf bank robber, straight to ballin'.
Stop with us, walk with us, as we bust through,
The doors, forties fallin', like parts in us off in dust.
Stereos got many holes in, plenty dope, plus we fly as fuck.
Duct tape while room up, toe tag 'em.
Have him feel the strength of a black magnum,
Body bag him, nobody is as bad as them.
As shown as them, set kissed like FM.
Life in 1-4-7 to the deuce, right then.
I slipped in the bullet-proof suit,
And swoop down on the bank ruler with the gats.
Waiting for the permission to cancel his ass,
Handle his ass.
I love to see his guts and his blood spill,
And cracked up as I drugged, as I rise flying up high with a forty-five.
If a red demon in it from the sky,
Drop and I put the barrel right between his eyes,
And said you fuck with the Legion and now you must die.
We serve and protect all the hustlers,
And G's from the west to the north, south and back to the east.

[Chorus x 2]

Look up in the sky, (in the sky.)
No it ain't, (no it ain't, no it ain't,)
Mean a damn thing changed, (changed, changed, changed.)
Got it locked down, (locked down, locked down,)
When we in your town, (in your town.)

Look up in the sky, (in the sky.)
No it ain't, (no it ain't, no it ain't,)
Mean a damn thing changed, (changed, changed, changed.)

Shit like this right here
I got my nigga Black for me, uh
I got my nigga R.O.C. for me, uh
And y'all know who the fuck I be
And for a long time I think niggaz been taking So So Def for a joke
But I guess that's why we rich and y'all niggaz is broke

Y'all got one chance to flow I let y'all know
While y'all stretch your mouth I stretch my dough
Also stretch the doors on my Navigators
Long as the Olajuwon
Rock mine a Phenomenon Mr. Smith style
You want to get uh, oh here he is now
Dot to the O caughted blow your shit down
Dot to the see you're feelin' me now?
Anyhow y'all niggaz can't measure up
I'm here to get my cheddar and who ever mess it up?
Then I'mma blow these rounds out, wet â??em up
For my dawgs like DMX who pound like Kurupt
And Snoopy in the club getting at the groupies
Stash the uzi tonight flash the jewelry
And just post up we can't be touched
All my niggaz say, ""WHAT WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK""! (UH)
Be-boy style hot like tical
Four, five cal, check into the profile of a killa
Sonny Black my mellow, my ace playa get on the
Microphone and rock it please

I'm make y'all niggaz feel the hit homie
None of y'all motherfuckers know me
Three times a niggaz like T.O.N.Y.
All up in your spot like Navy Seals, wave your steel
Lay your shit down, clown I'm for real
Spittin' Crips for chips, plant bombs in your whip
I bring the pain to the game on the real tip what?
Hittin' niggaz like JFK
For the pounds and the bricks and yay, hear what I say?
Squeezing off, just to mash and releasing off
Y'all motherfuckers shouldn't be so soft
Oh you type thug niggaz
Frump niggaz, yo I got no love niggaz
Expect the worse yo check it can make you see the hearse
Tell mama I'm about to break the button for the nurse
Niggaz don't want it but they think they do
And soldiers should never fuck with me and my crew, who?

You know I'm gonna make them dance when I step in the club

Well I know another way to make â??em put their hands up

I drop the beat on
I cock the heat on
I got this party niggaz
We lock the street corners

Well it's him again, the Timbaland lacer
You trembling in the faces, Detroit hates us
Take us, come smooth the hard shit, rock jewelry
Like Mr. Antarctic
Watch our hands move regardless of the chartless
Cock your automatic
So the safest thing for you to do is shut the fuck up
Let my crew do this (UH) like this niggaz from the bricks and (UH)
You don't want NWK to get to ya
So you heard we make believers out of dreamers
Now we make murder cases out of sleepers
S to the motherfuckers O to the S to the y'all damned
O to the D to the E F-uck you 'cause we buck you,
Y'all niggaz can't touch us

Assume my position 'cause papermaking's a must
Straight mangle motherfuckers when it's time to bust
Lace flows with angel dust all up in your spot
We got no things with us, kind of dangerous
Don't fuck around and get caught in a verbal onslaught
'Cause I'm label your bills and my man Too $hort , ooh Lord
Getting down one more time
For making motherfuckers who be out on the run
I gotta get mine daily can't let these motherfuckers fade me
That's just the way my mama made me
Top size rider from the get go, known to spit flows
And keep them niggaz on their tiptoes
I goes to the extremity blind with weed and hennesy
I know you niggaz don't remember me
Got the flow poetic, and I stay diamond setted
Running over tracks like I'm Libyan, here's the past
Labeled a pussy, cash see her bounce
Shaking, moving, waiting, sipping the ounce
What's up with that? None of y'all niggaz can fuck with Black
Motherfucker where's your focus at?
JD my mellow my ace get on the mic and come rock please

Nigga I feel like why you gon come if ain't on time
And ain't no need in coming out if you ain't gonna shine
That's why I am why I am with mine and y'all sick
While y'all keep it real we keep it rich
Just clowning, pounding, riding around in
Some of the most elite shit to ever hit the town
Screaming out how you like me now and I'm gettin busier
I stay platinum while y'all get dizzier
The difference between y'all is I get 'em out of their seats
And my balling techniques is out of your reach
Live and direct from the Peach State
Where we make hits, deep grits and steak, homes laced
We never hit the breaks just continue to speed

Better come through with a little more win

Ain't no tellin' in this life of sin
How much dough you got to spend
Take so long you got to bend
Grab yo' man snatch yo' bitch

Because of you

Something's got to give

Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Just you and I

You are no Casanova
I know that you'll be true
And that's why
I'm so in love with you
But each romantic ending
You leave me at my door
But tonight
I'd like us to explore

A full moon
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are

We don't give a fuck(uh-huh), gotta let a bitch be a ho(hoooo)
Now all my niggas say what
We don't give a fuck
Gotta let a nigga stack dough(money, money)

All the niggas fuckin in between, be the the main man
Never get stuck on the scene without a game plan, understand
I went from pop lock into tops droppin
To one of the reasons why the day parties keep rockin
No stoppin niggas is like (wa-what?)
And shorty from the south keep fuckin it up
I'm the glitter and the gliss of this industry
Makin hits, is how ya'll remember me
Niggas dream to be like this one here
JD type cat don't disappear
I'm the J to the E, are to the M

Bitches I should set up shop
Bettin against me,
Please! my bank don't stop

Nobody want to fuck with the R.O.C.
Young G from the streets
And he's banned from t.v.
Nobody said life was easy
Out on the block
I got shot
And nobody came to see me
Back on my feet
Packed my heat
Got back in the beef
Blazed it up
Are ya muthafuckas lookin for me
Raized it up
And now they see I'm makin rap songs
All I ask is my real doggs smash on...
I said yea and ya don't stop
'cause its a 1-8-7 when ya fuck wit R.O.C.!!
I said yea and ya don't quit
I'm comin live from the Bricks wit the gangsta shit
All my niggas on the corner at the end of the block
Infront of the stores, shakin my dick at the lady cop
Shakin my clip
Til the hatas drop
And I'm in a drop-top, bumpin down ya block
And I'm dumpin

[Chorus 2X]

I seen a lot of niggas go down the wrong path
And I learned from they mistakes, how to keep cash
In this world it's snakes,
I don't care,
I don't break,
Pushin Benz, 'cause a nigga know how to create
On and on like a jeep go
Any nigga standin in my way of my papers, automatically fonito
Suckin on the end of Rosco pico's

Deleted from the muthafuckin game

I keep it all the scriffin' y'all
But real street for y'all
Cause you never know
When you're gonna go, no

You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you 
Just Hold on
You never know

From the killing 
The robbing
The squabbing
And jacking
Car jacks to kidnaps
What? Niggas be acting a fool
Trying to set me up at the park
But I'm cool
Act a fool
My daddy said throw them thangs
And stay strong
My momma got sick
So I'ma keep it strong
As long as I got my feet in the game
And make this beats
And bring heat to the game
Fuck the fame
I got a little boy to see through
And him without me 
Is like me without you
Keep it true
And stay down for your grips
Homies and licks staying tight
Like this 
You never know

You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you 
Just Hold on
You never know

You niggas never know
Which man are blasted for
Never know which man to kill
Just to settle the score
It wasn't long ago
I had this partner of mine
Knew him just a short time
But he's stuck in my mind
My nigga lived perfect
Said the streets wasn't worth it
If you don't die rich in the game
Then what's the purpose for this struggle?
We stay piece to puzzle 
Invest half the wealth
And pray to god it double
We just in this
Trying to get rich at the interest
Keep it pimping
Stay with niggas that's relentless
Smoke dough
Just because I say so
Money pronto
And niggas never would know 
They never know nigga

You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you 
Just Hold on
You never know

You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you 
Just Hold on

So many reasons why
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

In the butter soft seat that keep a street thug scheming'

How I rep the A town it makes ya
(Rock with me all night long)

(Verse 1)
Well it started off on the avenue
When I came up with the name called the So Def crew
It was me, my big homie Eddie
Up late making tapes, putting them out on the streets
I used to rap scratch even try to sing
Now I'm the little cat pumping out the steam
I used to play with it, now I stay with it, Lay with it
And huh keep pumping out hits
Cause can't nobody do it like we does
This side, that side I gets nothing but love
And I keep it pumping up in the club
Big with all the pimps, the hustlas, ladies and thugs
That respect that knock, when they hear that knock
Y'all niggas think I'm gon stop (Please!)
Y'all won't see me on behind the scenes
But you can catch me at a money machine, Ching Ching

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Kris Kross was the begining of the linen and cars
Houses, hidden clubs, shutting down the bars
I was only 19 doing big big things
In the CP living the American dream
Then I signed Xscape, first album 1.8 (million)
New company, my shit looked great
But uh, me being the player that I am I couldn't stop
I just had to find me something else to take to the top
Something fly that'll catch your eye
Thats when I bumped into my little sister from the West side of Chi
Demo after demo we made
Got so funkdafied now we paid
Rap or R&B we ain't playing
We demand y'all respect this afroman
As the game gets bigger, and my dough gets longer
And me and my crew get stronger
The more you wanna

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
In every flight there's turbulance and I had some
But I remained focused and kept dropping the bomb
'What should I do next?' that was going through my head
Then Candy introduced me to a Jagged Edge
Three homies from the Dec, one from right around the corner
We went in, came out, now everybody on 'em
Three albums later, everyboby on 'em
Ain't a city you can go where the girls don't want 'em
Once again I was thinking 'whats next for me?'
Then I got a big call from my homie Steve
He said Hey, let throw something your way
It was none other than my brother they comparing to MJ
Girls can't stop screaming, three mill now
Everybody love him and his name is Bow Wow
As the game gets bigger, and my dough gets longer
And me and my crew get stronger
The more you wanna

(Chorus)

See I've been doing what I'm doing for like 10 years man
Putting out fire man
You might remember Sometimes Leather, Monica,(aha ha)
Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, TLC, Usher, MC Lyte
Man you name it man, I got the hits playboy
Dru Hill, Da Brat, Xscape, Jagged Edge, (ha ha)
Kris Kross, Destiny's Child, and my little homeboy Bow Wow
Listen man I never gonna stop

Niggas love to hate, hoes jock cause I'm getting rich
Keep my mind on my fetti just to let you know
Strapped with rocks, reds, and camera's in my black fo'fo
On the east-side nigga trying to get me some paper
Lying throwing stone out all over the cater
These hoes be lovin the player, Jason calling me baby
But fuck that, I rather trot these hoes are too damn shady
Look I don't need a bitch, I'm riding down for me
And fuck a gang of niggas, see I'm a soldier G
And ain't another nigga, who got more got game than me
You need to check yo shit, because its lame to me
Since 91 been paying the cost, to be the boss
Got no time to floss, because the game's throwed off

Steady riding shit that ain't even came out
In the club, VIP is where you find me at
Private planes, ice chains, I don't know how to act
Every city, got me something pretty keep em on they back
""If I ain't a hot boy then what do you call that""
If its my shit, off the top you can tell
Cranberry, pineapple, four bottles of bale
Cats that play sports, rap fresh from jail
Hoes in packs, screaming out ATL
See I'm the type of nigga that was built for cash
Drive me and dropping putting down a smash
Knowing nothing in life, but how to make these hits
Get paper, spit game in, pull me a bitch

Hardcore niggas getting dead presidents
Where the real niggas went, I'ma let you know
Lay back with the strap, and they ain't found no mo'
These lil niggas tripping, all that hollering-screaming
I know yo momma saw dick, she should've swallowed that semen
Now I'm driving through your block, red hot like a demon
Cock it back, all you see is the beam from my demon
And it ain't no ping ping nigga, black-eye black-eye
No respect for the game, you better watch-out watch-out
Got this shit on lock, and now you locked-out locked-out
All that hate on a player, gone get you knocked-out knocked-out

Whatever I'm bout, she bout that, whatever I'm on, she on that

Whatever you bout, I'm bout that
Whatever you on, I'm on that

Out here hittin' hoes like Cham-ber-lin

Even bring my crew, then I'm in the wind, no stress
No, where you going, no, where you been
No where you at, no, who you wit (Uh)

Care free very freaky hoe, that's what I prefer (Say what)
That let me come through anytime, and do what I want to do to her

And come on and work it on me, like it's all about you
Play at your own risk, girl hugs and kiss (Kissing sound)
Baby shake it up like dice
Nasty and naughty, exotic and nice
Home alone, girl hit me on that Nextel
J. on the other end, she waiting to exhale
Cop a baby L blat, do as, I'm bangin' in that back
She got pictures of me, bangin' in that back
So we gon', laze up, in my tunes
And lock up for days in a hotel room
Pull the pink thong to the West (West)
Prepare to insert billy bong in ya chest
And get full of smoke just like Chris-tian

Ain't no shit bumpin' like this one

I remember when we first hooked up we were only 17, 
cut-off shirts and jeans was your only way seen. 
What I had didn't matter, it was all about us, 
all day on the phone and the stuff we discussed. 
I used to come over when your mom was gone. 
We didn't know what we were doing but we got our freak on. 
One thing led to another, I introduced you 
to my mother like ""ma, this my girl."" 
That was when it started getting real, 
feeling kept getting caught, gifts 
started being bought and everybody knew the deal. 
We used to hang out, kiss, argue and all that. 
Hang up the phone and call right back. 
I got to know you like the back of my hand. 
And, you got to show me how a girl can love a man, 
and we took a small thing to a new land. 
And when I said I loved you I wanted you to understand, 
its real.

Everyone said that you were goin to change, 
but when 2-1 came, you were still in the game. 
'92s new version of Bonny and Clyde, 
no matter what it was we were side-by-side.
You know the type you see getting it in a 
photo booth, matching shirts, flea market, photo shoots. 
Everything I saw cute, shit, you had to have it. 
What's the fly life if a nigga can't share it? 
Every new dollar made I put it on you. 
Everything around your collar, braid, put it on you. 
At car dealership, shit, nigga bought two. 
And when I went away I got yo name tatoo. 
Hey yo, I'm trying to put the Bling Bling on yo hand, 
cause ah, you showed me how a girl can love a man. 
And, ah, we took a small thing to a new land and 
when I said I loved you I wanted you to understand, 
its real.

Yo, all of my nigga's that know what I'm saying, 
look yo girl and in the eyes 
and say...

[Jermaine Dupri and Jagged Edge]
Girl your so off the chain. You took the 
freighter straight out the game. Now I 
know what a good thing feels like, I know, 
I gotta have you in my life. 
Got me feeling messed up inside, 
you make a nigga just wanna do right. 
Me and you is like Dre and Snoop Dogg, 
as long as we together, we can have it all.

Who's the biggest baller of all
I got a 700, a Bentley and a Magine
The girls just die when I'm ridin' past

Live life like I'm sellin' pies
Arabian with two or three wives
Two or three houses to hide
Ten cars parked outside
And they all got bodies that's wide

Follow me as the Leer jet flies over Crimson Tides
Four bedroom duplex in the sky
Nicknamed Lottery 'cause I don't stop spendin'
When the wheels stop, the chrome keep spinnin'

It's gotta be somebody greater, maybe it's not

Hits for every chick with a size see tits
See it's like this, I don't mind wavin' at you kids
But I can't manage to raise my wrist

Jewels so heavy, y'all fools ain't ready
My twenty two shot the streets into confetti
Move like Andretti, red linin'
Whatever city I'm in, I'm headlinin'

At five a.m., I'm still lookin for Mo'
Still gettin' crunk, still lettin' it flow
Bar outta Cris', now I'm drinkin' Mo'
Stomach upset, I feel like I'm about to let it go

It's five o'clock in the mornin'
Got my pedal to the flow, got my pedal to the flow
It's time I test my 600
Wonder how fast this bitch go, wonder how fast this bitch go

Three girls and two of 'em sleepin'
One got her hands on my bow, one got her hands on my bow
Sun's comin up, we still drinkin'
We ballin' outta control, really ballin' outta control

Man I was dancing, prancing, laughing, bouncing, swinging
Moving, grooving, cause the music's booming
Macking, trying to get some action, packing, acting
Manish, drinking, tweaking, winking, peeping
Seeking a freak for the evening, really feeling way too horny
Reaking from the weed I'm token, choking, smoking, real doping, hoping
My nights wide open, knowing that my girls at home
Snoring, boring, ignoring, warning that my girl was coming
Sudden mood interruption, busted my girls in the club

[Chorus]
Ring the alarm (oh oh)
Your woman has just been sighted (uh)
Ring the alarm
How'd she get in if she wasn't invited? (I dunno)
Ring the alarm
She's headed this way like lighting (yeah)
Ring the alarm
I'm not trying to be ducking and dodging (c'mon)
Ring the alarm

[Nate Dogg]
Headed, top speed for the exit
Dammit don piece can't grab it
Habit like chasing my cabbage
Magic, time to disappear fast with
This chick, who I slept last week with
Real trick, I like her cause she real slick
Let's dip, I don't care who you came with
No lip, got no time for some bullshit
She went, that she all in the backpen
Time spent, now it's time to hit the pavement
Two sense, got no time for your comments
Don't trip, do you know where my girl went?

[Chorus]

[Jermaine Dupri]
Listen, I'm in the club, no where I ain't even suppose to be
Drinking with a girl all close to me
I'm all up in the air, telling her some super fly shit she need to hear
Thinking can't nobody see us cause we in the rear
All I'm trying to do is get a number then I'm up out of here
Cause my girl ain't home, she out with a friend
It a be just my luck this the spot they in
Not the place for her to spot me in
You know specially when I'm suppose to be at the studio
I take one step, what do I see my girl coming threw the door but she don't see me
Now I'm ducking, now I'm dodging, hiding, praying to god that she don't come find me
What was I thinking of, I should of never parked my car in front of the club damn!

We love that basketball

Yeah, now basketball is my favorite sport
I love the way they dribble up and down the court
I keep it so fresh on the microphone
I like no interruption when the game is on
I like slam dunk, to take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll
I like the give-and-go
In this basketball, Bow Wow, let's go

[Chorus]

I got the rock in my hands
ain't no telling what I'm gonna do with it
When I come position I'ma act a fool with it
I might cross you up fake one way
Turn around and hit you with you with the MJ fadeaway
I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd
Taking cats to the rack
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

Don't too many players get offers like me
Back and forth, I'll likely
Shake the checks off your Nikes
They almost had me in a suit at the draft
And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go blast too
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook
They don't know if I'ma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look
See my game consist of a whole lotta
Moves you would think I learned from the Harlem Globetrotters
J.D. gon lead us to a ring
Fab and Bow Wow the only players that make cheerleaders want to sing

[Chorus]

Now tell me were you in the joint
The night MJ scored 63 points
When the Lakers won titles back to back
didn't give nobody, no kind of slack
When Vince Carter gave and stuck his arm in the rim
Everybody went crazy in the whole damn gym
Dikembe Mutombo standing tall
Playing D with desire, it's basketball

I don't think why'all can handle this
I don't really really think why'all can handle this
Mo, I don't know if they can handle this
I don't really really think they can handle this

[Chorus]
I'm too hood for you
I ain't trying to act too good for you
I'm just trying to tell you what's really true
Baby I don't think you can handle this
I'm too hood for you
Tell me what you know about
Riding all chromed out
Hair braided up
With the gold in ya mouth
Nothing, nothing

I don't want to pull your heart
Play you out, call you a s.o.b.
But the line you just kicked to me
It won't get you nowhere with me
I can see that you are not the kind of guy that I like
Me and you could never be
You're too nice and just too pretty and

[Chorus]

It's not your fault I'm from the hood
I love them bad and hate them good
To keep it real with you, honestly
That's the only type of fella that can handle me
I'm tired out, faded out
A playa that don't give a watch
I'm the only one he lets inside
And when he does it's ride or die

[Chorus]

I try not to let it show
Something says don't let it go,
Well let yourself be free
'Cause I can take myself out the hood but
I can't take the hood out of me
I'm gangsta, got diamonds and my peeps are so ghetto
why'all just want to please
I gotta have the heart to play the part and talk the talk to walk these streets,
I'm too hood

[Rap: Jermaine Dupri]
Call it what you like
Sometimes I like to fight
Get fly, get high
Party all night
Keep at least 5 grand in my pocket in a rubber band,
Only rock it if it's name brand you know
Prada, Gucci, Polo, whatever
The car? Gotta have that woodgrain and leather
The shoes? Gotta be 20's or better
I don't care if you're in a Benz or a Jetta
Ladies, with tattoos, about three or four
Of somebody's name you don't even see no more
You gotta have the blings, some rings on your neck
Peace bracelet, studs in your ears
Fellas with more than two BMs, that's too hood
Girls that dress like Lil' I'm, that's too hood
Can't talk without cursin' and gold teeth
MLK, ma that's me

[Monica]
Now you see
Just what I mean
I'm too hood

Never let a punk ass nigga slide, dawg
You get beat dead, that means you dead meat
I been on Wall Street, Beach Street, Gregg Street
That's Dallas, Atlanta, I style with them hammers
I wild witcho nanna, doggystyle on a hamper
You'll get ripped apart, that's it with darts, you kids ain't smart
Pop, pop, pop, I lit the dark, from the wizard door, come get some heart

That's courage and brain, 'caine on several strips
Not from Houston, but shit, call me 'Little Flip'
'cause I flip a little, fa shizzle, you flippin' nickels
When I flip coke and flip boats, come live a little
And you best be knowin', pussy still is the best thang goin'
Any extra dough, come invest in hoe'in

But I clap that boy, kidnap and wrap that boy
Clap, we ready, I'ma mastered boy like Pastor Troy
But I'm stoned sucka, with my nigga Bone Crusher
Baby, we like to bone, all our chicks are bone crushers
We got guns in coupes, in case our sun'll roof
No basketball, when we talkin', run and shoot

I ain't neva scared, I got big hammers everywhere
In places where you need yo passport at, I'm heavy there
It's time we get even here, when I put the game back
In it's proper perspective, this time leave it there

You can think whachu want, 'til I blow the back of yo' brains out
And see if you could think with yo' front
Like a new single, make sure you leak for a month
Treat yo' face like a buffet, and tell my niggaz, eat whachu want
You'ono nuthin' about puttin' a couple hundred thousand on the table
And tell yo niggaz, keep whachu want
It's usually hate or somethin' stupid that a nigga die for
So whachu think we outside for?

Some fine ass girl walked by
And she was lookin, I'm lookin back
She said uh ""JD I love those 20's on your car""
I said I beg your motherfuckin pardon
Them is Michael Jordan's baby
She gotta understand the type of nigga you dealin with
A young, fly, flashy So So Def representer
The biggest thing in the city since Martin Luther the King

Uh, holla at 'em
Brooklyn is what I'm reppin
Disrespect and bullets fly in your direction
Ridin shotgun with JD I got so so connections
Locos and the chrome blows, homie not to mention
I got four homes that I own, I'm certified pimpin
Cross my path, shots blast instant
Extort your ass the kid got henchmens
The whole Brooklyn for instance
Red dot, ruthless, head shots stop you from thinkin
A best seller's what I'm inkin
Another Brooklyn classic, straight acid, keep listenin
Twin Desert Eagles, duck when I'm twistin 'em
Rims spin on sick vehicles, look we killin 'em
Manson and gas my adrenaline, racin fast
Switchin four lanes with weight up in the stash
I'm livin so so better now, the so so dash
is what I'm sittin on, blowin up so so fast

Yeah, uh huh
Yo, You really don't want to get hit
Hot lid when I empty the clip
Drop kid if you droppin your lip
Never know enough about but I talk shit
You must want to eat up my clit
Everything we ever did on is sick
We don't have a party, we rich
We cut it up with anybody we with
And I'm the main one, havin to fit
Can't nobody do it like this
I got a gat by the side like my man Big
Stand out on that song he did with me
You feelin the presence of So So Def
Rest assure we gettin the money
crush your label there's no more left
Just fables fictional characters I
Stay away from those who 
embellish the truth and LIE
I'm kickin the same shit you been 
used to since ""Funkdafied""
Let your mind escape, you laid 
away back and enjoy the RIDE
Yeah, I'm rollin on deuce trays
Shoot all my Tequila straight
Catch me at the bar of the bay
I might even buy you a little drank
We been choppin paper for years
Ain't scared of you niggaz out here
Some of ya'll might think we disappear
But everytime the resurgence is clear

Yo, yo
Brooklyn has to be two of the illest
Felons to be diluted I do whatever, to foot it
Like I want to do it, like I do it
When I done it
PUSSY (PUSSY), roll like caine
Just rhymin with Benz or
 present with the Coupe-a
Drive my lifestyle down
I'm between lines and my new slip
2003, M.O.P. nigga you see

Who be doing what I do?
Uh huh yeah, yo whoo!
Let's get at it dog, come on, whoo!

Now what goes up, must come down (shit)
But we ain't coming down, it be them same ole' clowns
Aiming your pound pretending they proud
But when you leave town they go around they running they mouth (man)
They something like a hater man
Talking bad about a playa as if I'm not gon see ya later man
You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like whats going on goin' to another song
'Cause I keep a hater guilty
My cars and my money all alike man, both them filthy (get it?)
From skimpy and empty to fuel on full
See I be high when my 'Ca-go Bulls
Obey no rules to school you fools
Schoolboy's err'y where, we're Young Dude news (man)
St. Louis like Blues, D. Miles and Larry Hughes
And the Young Dude done paid young dudes' dues dude

But yo, what da hook gon' be (Uh oh!)

The sun'll come out, tomorrow
And I will never have to borrow
Got my first car when I turned sixteen
Only drove it home outta town limousines
Plus we was broke wit a deal but nobody could tell
So we did what we had to do for ""Country Grammar"" to sell
Haha, I stay on my own melodies
Plus I like my Booties and my Boobs like a capital letter 'B'
That's how it is, how it better be
I preferably rather have two or three girls in the bed wit me
Close your ears ma you ain't heard nothin' (whaa?)
I always pay ma let a brother hold somethin'
I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons

No hi, no nothing not a simple house life
Understand the money's good but I'm still from the hood
So don't be asking for no ""inch"" and be expecting the ""foot""
Unless you want a foot (whoo!)
I know a few crooks that can place you where you need to be put
And it might not cost me playa
Got a Benz pepper interior, paint salty playa
And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood
Catch me on your local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty
I'm the same dude that came through wit my crew

Everyday I age, I just want my life to change
I done been around, put away my childish things
Like my attitude, it ain't good to be so rude
I wanna be in love, it's my right to
And every year I seem to make some really bad mistakes
And I'm ready now, I don't wanna be this way
I'm finding out, what it's all about. Yeah
I want to be in love
What's it like to be in love? That's all I been thinking of
And I was just wondering, wil love ever know me?
And my heart is open, and I've been hoping
To find what it is everybody keep on talking 'bout
What's it like to be in love? That's all a nigga thinking of
And I was just wondering, will love ever know me?
And my heart is open, and I've been hoping
Somebody show me, what's it like to be in love?
My life has changed somehow, but still so much the same
Got a bank account, I'm still broken down
I need to know, where does this road go(hopefully someone for me)
Family, is that so much to ask Thee?
Begging please
Feel like I'm going mad
I'd trade all I have
Just to know...
I know love is something that you can't go out and buy
When you looking, always seems like it's the wrong time
But I hope one day I'll give away this heart of mine

 Need to come to the back where we got it locked down
 In your white t-shirt or a three-piece suit
 Don't matter what you wear all that matters is who you with
 Some jiggy and some are straight grindin
 All up in the club just to have a good time and
 [Hook]

 Just show me where that party at dirty
 Somewhere where it's crackin right around one-thirty
 Never get done too early
 Come in as is, doo-rags and Tims
 I'm rollin past his, his little Jag and Benz
 With the Rolls, not the one with the stem (the one with the rims)
 The one that seem to make more enemies than friends
 I'm slidin in past doors, both eyes closed
 Both arms rose, both charms froze
 With the S-O-S-O, D-E dot F
 I'm buyin bottles, bottles, until it ain't none left
 I'm quick to go left, I blaze with no rep
 I jams more than def, baby show me the club
 I'm like ""hey, where that Bacardi at?""
 Come and mix it with the Cris', baby, what's wrong with that?
 We in the V.I.P. twisted, down right spliffed it
 Two way and shit, ooh they makin like they missed it
 [Hook]

 Left side, just put your hands up, throw 'em up
 Right side, just put your hands up, throw 'em up
 Everybody, put your hands up, throw 'em up
 When the beat come back around e'rybody do it again
 Do the eastside run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah)
 Do my southside run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah)

I'm so sincere with it I just want you to know
If you can feel it rock back and forth
We so sincere with it we just want you to know
If you can't feel it rock back and forth
Lets go

Settle down thinking that I can let ya talk to me that way
Making that move, the one that could be creeping and taking your place
You don't even know
Where I be, when we argue now
You goin' be here lonely yeah
'cause she knows what I need at night

[Chorus]
Can't you, see she wants to (take your place)
She wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in
Don't make a (big mistake)
Thinking I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start (talking)

Tell me why should I
Be here tonight
See you don't wanna
Hurt me but we both know this thing just ain't right
When I go (and I go)
It's gonna be a little too late
To try get back again
When I don't have this feeling no more

Now we're ain't gonna be talking no more (no more)
She's gonna be the reason I leave you alone
And I feel (some day you'll see when I'm gone)

So right now
You better speak
And give me a reason

Girl can't you see
She wants to (take your place)
She wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in
Don't make a (big mistake)
Thinking I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start (talking)

This shit is over (you betta' start talking)
Shoulda ended long ago (you better start talking)
But I stayed around thinking that something in your head 'd start clicking
But I can see that I was all wrong (you betta' start talking)
I can't be a fool no more (you betta' start talking)
She wants to be that one to give me that love you ain't ready for
You better start talking, girl

I go to the club strictly to party and find something to twork with
I'm the dude that all the girls wanna flirt with
Jump up in the booth show me just how they work it
So shortly your window is small to work with
I see it in your eyes but you ain't saying nothing
Your girl doing everything trying to push my buttons
Symbolizing us leaving and me cutting
Easy like Tiga' on the green when he puttin'
You betta' start talking
Shorty wanna do something
Do something too live crew man man
Shorty wanna move something
And you front like it ain't what it is
Bout to lose all this 'cause you ain't handle yo bizz
After two shots of the three
She was all on me
And you seen it but try to play it like a PIMP
Now I respect that
But sometimes that's a set back
And I really can't see you setting back lettin' that
Be the reason we ain't breezin' through the city
Girl you better start talking

Can't you see she wants to (take your place)
She wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in
Don't make a (big mistake)
Thinking I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start (talking)
She wants to (take your place)
She's wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in
Don't make a (big mistake)
Thinking I'm so caught up I can't let go
You better start (talking)

I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep comin wit dough man
You steady watchin stealin but there ain't no hope man
You dealin wit somethin bigger than the US OPEN
And ain't no jokin
Fresh like fatlaces and dukey ropes and I keep on smokin
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm strokin
Look at me now days girl a dawg is pokin'

From records to movies now a tv show man
Anything given to me I'm gon rep man
Big house, big cars what you expect man
Just to get a glimpse girls breakin they neck man
Blinded by the light glistenin in off the Breitling
Bow hot as ever I ain't lost no step
Straight t-shirt, sneakers I ain't tryin to go prep
Like these lil r 'n' b groups that need my help

I been watchin you so damn long
But I don't know what to say or do
I be sittin around fantasizin?
Bout what I want to do to you
Its something about the way you move
Your body I can't take
Specially when you turn around
And you make yo ass shake
You the number one most requested
In the club like one of my jams
But no matter what, when I come in
You're right here where I am
Breakin it down like me in bed
Got a nigga spittin up all his bread
Bendin over to the front
Lookin back at me like what you want

And it don't matter if that's ya bitch wit ya

And we be lookin at each other, get the picture
And my body not Beyonce, but big girls we rollin it down
Light skinned, used to be way in,
But brown skin is the hot shit now
don't tell me you's a one hit wonder
Keep me hanging out on the shelf
You better act like I'm the real deal
And real bitches I'm the last one left
Might never see me up in a thong
But I be rockin my Adidas suit
Yo chick can put a tight dress on
But she still won't look this cute

[Chorus]
[Jermaine Dupri]
Shit if that's the case baby, what's it gon take
For us to get it jumped off right now
I got checkbooks, credit cards, all that shit
Just tell me how its gotta go down
Now usually I ain't gotta trick but I will though
Cus you, super bad and for real though
Ooh can't wait for my lips to kiss your lips- both sets
But you don't hear me though

[Missy Elliot]
Ooooh yes I want to splurge with ya credit cards
Let me drive your cars all up and down the boulevard

Yea I like ya Southern draw, might let you hit it raw

I don't why but I keep going back (back)
Knowing damn well that I shouldn't be doing that
'Cause I ain't doing nothing but making it worse for me
And I ain't doing nothing but making her thirst for me

Hard motherfucking habit to break man

I know it ain't right.. that's what it is!

See I'll be damned
If I let my son call another man daddy
And if you feel like I feel that's
Baby mama love!!
I don't want to be with her
But I just can't stand to see her with nobody else
I know it's bad, but I can't help myself

Went to the crib, did what we did till about six in the morning
Wasn't thinking bout having no kids
Just thinking bout getting it on and
On and on, and on and on and onnnn
That's how I got where I'm at right now
Let me take it back right now
She was there for me, everytime I needed
Even when I got a little lonely
Wasn't even like she was my girl
She was more like my little homie
It's deeper deeper than you'll ever know!
Sometimes you lose control
The hardest thing to get up out ya system is that

[Chorus:]

Oh Lord it's getting crucial!
And being truthful I don't understand it
I just won't have it!
Her out wit another nigga in the bar
My son wit another nigga in the car
Girl you ain't gon play me
Like I'm just gon be tolerating this man
Playing dad, see I pay the bills
I'll tap the phone, I catch ya here again
Homie we gon have a problem
Let it be known, I might not stay here
But this is my home, leave it alone!
'Cause this child is my baby
No if, and, but's or maybe's
Girl you gon drive me crazy!
With this..

Hot and cocky wit it cause I know that I am man 
I'm going down in history like American Band stand
I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep coming wit dough man
You steady watching stealing but there ain't no hope man
You dealing with something bigger than the US oh man
And ain't no joking
Fresh like fat-laces and dukey ropes and I keep on smoking
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm stroking
Look at me now days girl a dog is poking

Just to get a glimpse girls breaking they neck man 
Blinded by the light glistening off the brake lane

And I don' stop, I got rocks in rings
You know, the same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the the backyard

And you make you? ass shake

You the number one most requested
In the club like one of my jams
But no matter what, when I come in
You're right here where I am

Breakin? it down like me in bed
Got a nigga spittin' up all his bread
Bendin? over to the front
Lookin' back at me like what you want

He's my man in 2 so let's switch up
And we be lookin' at each other, get the picture

And my body not Beyonce
But big girls we rollin' it down
Light skinned, used to be way in
But brown skin is the hot shit now

Don't tell me, you?s a one hit wonder
Keep me hanging out on the shelf
You better act like I'm the real deal
And real bitches, I'm the last one left

Might never see me up in a thong
But I be rockin' my Adidas suit

But she still won't look this cute

For us to get it jumped off right now

Just tell me how it's gotta go down

Now usually I ain't gotta trick but I will though
'Cause you, super bad and for real though
Ooh can't wait for my lips to kiss your lips, both sets
But you don't hear me though

Jermaine Dupri,"I know some people might not understand me
And might not go number 1 or wit a Grammy but uh
I done done the lovin', I done done the touchin'
All the kissin' and huggin' baby you know it's nothin'
Everybody know that I can oh ho
Ladies love it when I go oh ho

You tryna stop all that, no
Well brother please, can you make me understand what chu sayin'

Listen man
Troubles of the world today, it's got me heated
Every word I'm about to say, I feel it's needed
So let me talk about the things that's goin' on
The war is over but the troops ain't home
I see the bullets flyin', I see the people dyin'
See the babies cryin' what's the reason

So who you posed to be, public enemy number one now
Next thing I know you gon' be tryna tell me to put my guns down

I'm tryna have a conversation wit-cha fo' you let these streets get-cha
Show you a bigger picture then standin' on this block

You wanna talk well where the weed at, cause homie I don't need that
Stuff you talkin' what I'm doin' ain't never gon' stop
You must been watchin' too much C-N-N, it's about them dividends
The hood ain't changed, I don't know where you been
Everybody sufferin' and it's way mo' tougher than it was
And we don't never see nobody helpin' us

OK that's so true, I can feel ya pain
I'm not here to argue, just put you up on game
But I guess you the type I can't tell a damn thing
Couple of dollars in yo pocket, and you start losin' ya brain
It's a trap got you hustlin' all through the night
It's a trap takin' pictures in broad daylight
Don't let the system trick you into nothin' else, please
Be a man and stand for yourself
If you're not rich by now, you'll probably never get it (uh uh)
How can I get this nigga to listen to what I'm sayin' to him
Don't be a fool, with that I don't give a damn attitude
Cause I know you got someone at home who truly loves you

I'm tryna have a conversation witcha fo' you let these streets getcha
Show you a bigger picture then standin' on this block

You wanna talk well where the weed at, cause homie I don't need that
Stuff you talkin' what I'm doin' ain't never gon' stop

Please listen, hear me when I say don't let the system knock you
Lock yo ass away, cause you got things to live for
Your family and your children

Don't wanna lose, the life that you've been given",Gpsa (Ghetto Public Service Announcement),2006
Jermaine Dupri,"[Chorus] 
Every time I try to leave 
Somethin' keeps pullin' me back, me back 
Telling me I need you in my life 
Every time I try to go 
Somethin' keeps tellin' me that, me that 
Everything gon be alright 
Every time I try to leave 
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back 
Telling me I need you in my life 
It was meant to be 
You were meant for me 
So that means we gotta make it work 

It was all good at first, 
Spendin' money, goin' shoppin' 
Eatin' at the finest restaurants 
And then from club hoppin' 
She was right thurr with me bottle poppin' livin' that life 
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I don't like 
We didn't have a worry in the world, got you diamonds got you pearls 
Cut can't help it if Ching-A-Ling been attracting all the girls 
Baby I'm a superstar and that come wit it 
You got a good nigga on the side, you betta run wit it
Even though I'm on tha road doin' shows
I make time for me n her, relationship to grow 
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry 
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me 
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her 
May conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her
(Uh) I thought I was your man 
Guess you ain't understand 
N now I'm sittin' here, lookin' crazy like 
Damn! 

[Chorus] 

Walkin' to house from hard work, my head hurts
Instead of arguin', can I have dinner with some dessert (uh uh) 
She talkin' 'bout this phone number she found
Hey, give me time to put my bags down
She's straight up, clowned 
Before we end up fightin', let me leave 
I'm exhausted and dis hurr, I don't need 
Now I'm wit the fellas ridin' n drinkin' 
She's blowin' my two way up but I need some time for thinkin' 
(Yeah) I wanna go back, but something sayin' naaaw 
Give her some space and the next day I might call 
What should I do 
Look, let me ask ya'll 
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall 
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed 
But it happens some time 
It's either love it or give it up 
I thought I was your man 
Guess you ain't understand 
Now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like 
Damn! 

[Chorus] 

[JD:] Chingy holla at dem again !! 

Ta all the fellas know you feel me, if you eva had a woman
Good times led to bad times n you ain't see it coming
Try the best to make her happy
But it wasn't enough
'Cause mamma told me in relationship to roll ya bluff 
I don't wanna have my head down 
Weak n stressed out 
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next round 
(Uh) I thought I was her man 
Guess she ain't understand

Show Cali why I'm bangin' this crew
Ice Ice Man, baby, and you know what it do
I'm throwed

Now, to broads I'm a sharp-shooter like Steve Kerr
Flash the wrists, 'cause a blur
Fox fur and flyin' spur
Undisputed for sure
So I'm collectin' these dimes
Name and number lil' momma 'cause it's checkout time
I'm slidin' on glass threes, inhalin' the chronic trees
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's
I'm cool as a ocean breeze; like Chester, I'm chasin' cheese
I'm stingin' like buzzin' bees, on softly with cheese
Screens fall like all them leaves, makes the TV's rain
Take a picture if you please; yeah, my wrist is insane
Dirty can, diamond chain, so fallin' is off the chain
Mind frame, I'm stackin' change
I'm so throwed in the game

When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast
I ain't never came through
Got a mouth full of diamonds
You can hardly hear me speak
Especially when it shine like dis (dis)
It's that H-Town, baby, and you know what is
I'm throwed
Got Styrofoam cup full of bar
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Show Cali why I'm bangin' this crew
Ice Ice Man, baby, and you know what it do
I'm throwed

I'm pourin' that purple sprite, and I'm searchin' for broads
Paper stackin' so my money stretch like extension chords
I'm a wide bod rocker in a four on them choppers
I'm on the grind stackin' up my mail like the post office
Movin' at slow pace with T Fair as my ace
Cup full of expensive taste, open mouth and showcase
I'm throwed up with screens hangin', swangin', breakin' his trust
We pourin' up in them cups; that stuff got me leanin' tough
Hold up
I'm caked up so all the boppers attract
I got 'em like a softer pal out there runnin' the track
Pullin' capers, makin' paper stacks fly as a dove
A bread breaker, taste maker, baby
Holla at ya love, I'm throwed

When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast
I ain't never came through
Got a mouth full of diamonds
You can hardly hear me speak
Especially when it shine like dis (dis)
It's that H-Town, baby, and you know what is
I'm throwed
Got Styrofoam cup full of bar
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car

Self made self paid we latch around in our white tee

And if he make one (hell naw dat don't sight me!)

You heard pimpin' playa (they shine so brightly)
Don't stand so close vision burners with ice blingers
Respect my whole squad no you can't even touch us 'cause
Role out the red carpet high five to show us love

But when shit get thick I grab the k he grab the pipe
So when my muthafuckin' partnas

Strap up in all black, so make dem suckas see da light
Some people say I'm crazy, my eye stay lazy
The neck so sweet, ten bricks for the eighty
Killin fuck niggas when they don't wanna pay me

We back on the block, servin glass to the jay
Nigga gotta glass jar, swappin' shit, breakin' face
Gotta yays and a bar, clean ones, stay laced
Gotta king fitch tell her get the fuck out tha way

When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!

Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin' to scream about just back your Beemer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to Kima house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me

The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup)

Know you ain't lettin' them climb up in my throne

Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin' crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above

It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick with 'cha entree and get over your side

We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love 'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man


Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin' the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin', it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us

Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Now ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes",Ain't That Peculiar,1972
