Candlebox,"Well I woke up one morning 
Seen my baby fly away 
Sugar don't go 
She said I don't be treatin' her 
Right by the things I say 
Sugar don't go 
Don't go  I feel I'll be left alone 
And I'll cry 
Oh in the rain 
Early one morning I packed her bags 
She said she gotta leave me now 
I've done her wrong 
I said baby I'm gonna change 
Gonna change for the better 
Sugar don't go 
You can't be leaving me so alone 
And I'll cry in the rain 
In the rain 
Oh in the rain 
In the rain 
Sugar go 
Now sugar go you leave me alone 
As you packed your bags 
You've got your plane on the road 
I said oh why'd you leave 
Oh why'd you leave 
You gotta leave me alone 
I'm feeling sad 
I'm feeling sad 
You gotta back off 
Baby you treat me 
Baby you treat me 
My life and I could take my time 
I lose it 
What I have 
Is what I have 
Is what I give to you 
And I feel I'm gone 
I've been crying 
What you gonna do 
Who you gonna see 
Where you gonna pack your bags 
And where you gonna stay 
Say where you gonna go 
Who you gonna ho' 
Where you gonna lay your hat today 
I said what you gotta change what you gonna do 
Where you gonna lay your mines down 
What you gonna do 
What you gonna take 
Where you gonna go baby 
Who you gonna 
Stay with me again 
I said move it on 
Oh I said move it on 
I said move it on 
Oh won't you move it on down the line 
Well on down the line 
I said pack your bags now baby 
You gotta move it on down the line 
I said I want to tell you 
Say, what you gonna do 
Who you gonna stay 
Where you gonna ho' your ass out all over town 
Baby, where you gonna go 
Who you gonna see 
What you gonna do with your time 
I said what you gonna do 
Who you gonna take 
Where you gonna lay your hat down 
Where you gonna call your home 
Where you gonna go 
Who you gonna see 
What you gonna do with your time 
I said move it on 
Oh won't you move it on 
I said move it on 
Hey you gotta move it on down the line 
Well on down the line

Said what you gonna do 
Where you gonna stay 
Who you gonna ho' your ass out 
Baby where you lay your hat today 
I said what you gonna do 
Who you gonna see 
Where you gonna go and spend your time to be 
Baby, 
What you gonna do 
Who you gonna see 
Where you gonna go 
When I set you free 
I said move it on 
Oh won't you move it on 
Hey move it on 
Oh won't you move it on down 
On down the line 
Oh baby, I said baby

You got asked to leave now 
Pack your bags you gotta go 
Where you gonna go

You should live the life I give to you
We can learn to fight, I can't believe it
Pour your heart inside, you won't believe in
What you like tonight, I'm gonna be with you
So pleased to show you'll find but can't perceive it
At least you shouldn't mind and can't believe it

Breakdowns, pull her out and knock us down everytime.
Another time for her to find out,
She'll let it go blue,
And then she'll fall down. Gently,
Until she's broken hearted...
I know, she's seen it all along,
She's better off lately.
They said it's all she's after,
Everytime, Everytime, yeah.
Can she free it,
Has it all been wasted.
Can she free it one last time?
Can she free it?
(see her one last time...)
So when she lays her head down,
Do you read all the thought that she feeds aloud
She can, she can see through
And when she says she found out,
All the things that she thought we could read about,
She can, she can see through.
When she said she played out,
All the dreams that she thought she could dream about,
Do you feel, do you feel, do you feel,
Do you feel the need to break free?
You don't need to take me...
Lay her down, lay it.

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

And darkened the sky

Revealing the shadows
That passed through the mist

Was chasing them on

A procession of dark coats
Followed the star
Foretold to come since ages
In silence they walked on
Crossing the lands
On their way to Bethlehem, to break the
Chains of the spell
Stone, they worshiped the stone
In generation from father to son
A star, a star is to come
To light them way to the one who is born
The leader he knelt there
To greet the newborn
Holding his pendant before him
Teardrops were falling from his eyes as he said

(Don't do as I did long ago)

Into the sundown he returned
The moon was rising and heaven burned
Like shadows disappeared the men
And the black stone wielders were never seen again
Stone, they wielded the stone
In generation from father to son
A star, a star is to come
And light them the way to the one who is born

They came across the western sea
With powers greater than needed
The wizards commanded the lightning
Every creature knelt in for their will
But they wielded the black stone with evil
And their evil was cast back on them
Condemned to praise god forever

Born into glory, then back to ashes once again
High flies the dragon, the ruler of the seven skies
Riding the winds, not knowing that he just can't die

Chase the horizons, catch the illusion
Remember the child within
There's no tomorrow just sadness and sorrow
Hold on to the ancient dreams

See how the wizard cast his spell with maddened eyes
Using his magic to reach the heavenly skies
Witness the alchemist turning all his lead to gold
Try after try, begging that his fantasy will hold

The pain is lightened by sweet, sweet dreams
The cries of despair are silenced with a lullaby
Sleep my child, I'm with you, we are one

Led by servants, the old one is barely sane
Marked by her burdens, the guardian can finally rest

A faint echo form the past
The bells are still tolling,

Worshiped false Gods
Scoffed at the good
Desecrated the altar
Spat on the cross
Teared down the temples
And laughed at their loss
Oh faith oh faith

Stone on stone,
The ringing goes on and on
Attracting a memory,
Forgotten and nowhere to be found

Forged by the mighty
Admired by the great
Once blessed by the holy
Protected by fate
Announcing the twilight
The wrath of the Gods

Was drowned by the flood

Lurking in the shadows
Twisted shape of creeping terra
Guarding something special

Robed in the door the precentor
Noisome with quiristers prayerful moan

Candlemass,"Deep was my anguish in for these words
They froze my blood and changed my soul
The master has spoken, the truth, not any lies
The Devil gives and evil takes
The thing in life that man forsakes
A throne in hell, a price or a sacrifice?
Still the wind was blowing soft
And gentle here under the oak
Which gave me shelter and rest in for my trial
I'm not strong, weak is my mind
A new beginning, where to find?
I'm the last one on earth, please forgive us our crime
It was a time, when love was mine
Now it's time to sacrifice

My heart, bleeding for my race
The traces of mankind swept out
By the hand of our Lord
I cried for the ones I lost
Midnight in paradise, grief
Away goes my hope
I cried for the ones I lost

Climbing on the clouds above
Silent cry
Reach the inner halls of truth
Give me a sign!

Candlemass,"I bind unto myself
Today the strong name of the trinity

Crypt of despair

The black hole to hell
Its evil must never arise I can tell
Holy mission
Forever he's sworn
To protect our world from hatred and scorn
He will not fear
Though the Sabbath is near
Twelve strokes for Candlemass darkness descends

""Break the circle and all hell comes loose
The well of souls must stay sealed
Ancient force of light against the dark
The well of souls must stay sealed""

The air grows cold and threatening
Dark shadows wicked laughter
Brings darkness to your heart
Behold the goat of Mendes
Red burning evil eyes
Lord's prayer holy water
Only faith can save you now

Disharmony, satanic serenade
Black symphony, a tribute to the plague
The twisted souls awakened by the chanting
Unchained at last, rise, they will now rise

A new day's dawn, holy light
Sunlight redeems
Slays the dark, warms and heals, makes you
See nightmares' terror is back in your dreams
Sleep well my friend 'cause
This tale's now to end, don't
Believe our world is as safe's we pretend

Candlemass,"Beyond all nightmares I met my fate
An ancient passage surrounded by hate
Scared I was with my hand on my cross
I went into the demons gate
Across the Styx among the mists of Hades
A gate of stones marks the path
To soul's damnation and hell's wrath
Ancient evil is awaiting there
At the doorstep to hell
Within it's darkness the demons dwell
From the dark age the passage hail
Created by witchcraft and hate
Where every sinner will meet his fate
The place is cursed by the hands of doom
Unholy powers in reign
The devil's paradise of pain

The choirs of damnation, call you on through
The twilight possesses, the heart of your soul
The starlight is fading to black, into the

She has got me engulfed by her nature
A slave under her will
In her grasp she is boiling my blood

Oh, the moon is so cold
See the grace of her presence

Giving you the poisoned apple,
beauty or beast
Dancing naked in the rain
with eyes that cannot see
Calling demons that have not spoken

When the air breathes of evil

Afraid to go, afraid to live
Into the emptiness what there's to believe

Winds of spring whisper through the trees

No preacher can tell me who I am
My blood is calling me from Asaland

Walk the soil of this earth
The pen will be his mighty sword

They sink it in a pond

I close the gap that bears my name
My hart and my soul

Leading to an empty house

Spewing out its collapse
Did you care as heaven slowly fried
Missing out on the Swansong

It's a cold December
I count my wounds as ever
And that day was the seventh
When blood fell from the sky
You turned your back as the nightfall
Closed my eyes
New or old millennium

Candlemass,"Walking 'round and 'round in circles
Locked inside himself
The funny farm where he can't hurt us
Or what we all believe
Mute and deaf with no obsessions
A broken watch he got
He's the one that got no questions
Not a word to breathe

And there you see that he flies
Across the room like a swan
The colours sparkle and change
Stars are born 'round a flashing sun

Then it all just stopped, the temperature it dropped
It was so quiet I couldn't hear the sound of grief no more
We walked into the room, the small and padded room
I looked down on/at the man that lay/laid crying on the floor

The mother of life is a whore

Always drooling walking backwards
Never dries his tears
Come and see the man of miracles
But please don't come so near
Writing weird stuf slow and patient
I think it's something deep
Then he tries some levitation
Before he disappears

A rainy day you too might meet him
Give him mercy please
It won't be long until we'll need him
And all that's beautiful
If he speaks the world will tremble
A dream of love we'll see
He's our all the cosmic centre
We are spinning 'round",Spellbreaker,2006

Too late for understanding
Too late for your tears

Candlemass,"Can you see her, slender and pale?
But so graceful she walks down the stairs
A perception of musk fills the air
The kiss of darkness, the baron's own heir

In the tower shadows lurk
Full moon power the baroness's noble sleep
The daily escape nature's mistake
Soon awake ready for her nightly slay

She's so ruthless evil, grotesque
In her glory the baroness godless
Blood is precious, so delicious
Vampire white ferociously vicious breed

Her heart is bleeding, time is fleeing
She's barely breathing
Baroness you're an ancient rest
Now in shock, surprise in stock
You can't stop the clock
Soon extinct like the pest

The bleeding baroness, hours of slumber
Just before she will take you
And make you wish
That you've never been born

The bleeding baroness, crimes of passion
She needs you and feeds you
And bleeds you with the rise of the moon

The bleeding baroness
Hours of slumber
The spell I'm under

Can you see her, slender and pale?
But so graceful she walks down the stairs
A perception of musk fills the air
The kiss of darkness, the baron's own heir

The white queen smiles, the creature's alive
Thirsty forever, thirsty and proud
Her teeth drip of red, slowly down her chest
Blood is life, blood is death

What is the price for your beauty?
Who dies when you shoe all the jewels?
The morning comes like the tide
You wish you could turn back the time
There is no love in the chamber of blood

",The Bleeding Baroness,2009
Candlemass,"Jaded and demented
In the attic the bone men soared
I slammed the door behind me
Reality was no more

The screams of the demented
Follows me where I go
A secret door I entered
Leads to the ever-flow, oh no

And the days before sunrise are the worst
When my mind goes from friend to foe
So I stare into the wall of gloom
Where the troops of deceit and sickness loom

Confused and delusive
I stand where I stand
In the dungeons, in the chaos
Thought the truth would set me free

The cries of the demented
I tried to shut them out
So I did what they wanted
But failed with poison glass and rope

And the days before sunrise are the worst
When my mind gets challenged by my foes
So I stare into the wall of gloom
Where the troops of darkness loom

The clouds in my veins
The clouds in my gaze
The sum of my pain
The same every day

",Clouds of Dementia,2009
Candlemass,"You are the gospel that is spread
A mighty voice, the rhymes of the dead
The bible of the holy rage
A broken angel of this age

The fire in the flesh
God knows I'm still possessed

You are the thunder, earth and sea
A born devil, a saint that deceives
The silent footprints of the wolf
The morning, sun, the savior that engulfs

I'm an image of perfection
I'm the sunrise, resurrection

You are the sense in all our fears
The very reason of our tears
A ticking warning in my soul
The demon son of my own mold

The fire in the flesh
God knows I'm still possessed

In the eyes of the world
For the roots to the soul
In the songs of the child
The dead angel's alive

Candlemass,"There is a light, a flickering light
The eye in the sky is now approaching
I fall into, the well of taboo

In the maelstrom of mote I am floating
I'm going down, deeper and down
The door to the other world is open

High court of the witch lord
I got the invitation
Curved blade of the doom sword
No room for hesitation

Like a lamb to the slaughter
I died in the Douaumant trenches
Did the devils daughter
In the realm of superstition

Do I have to go, where all the sinners burn?
It isn't real, am I able to return?

My funeral dreams

I'm one out of thirteen
Got hit by an poisoned arrow
Three rusty daggers
The voice of the scarecrow

I'm trapped here by treason
And strangled in the blue light
Was shot for no reason
In the minefield of midnight

Do I have to go, where all the sinners burn?
It is not real but am I able to return?

My funeral dreams

It's dark, I'm blind, I'm trying to climb
Up from the holes into my head
In my dream I stab and I scream
I'm dead without leaving my own bed

What I've been doing there at all
I don't know what I've become
My mind is gone when I'm alone

Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes

Candy Ledbetter,"What a friend we have in time
Gives us children, makes us wine
Tells us what to take or leave behind

And the gifts of growing old
Are the stories to be told
Of the feelings more precious than gold

Friends I will remember you, think of you
Pray for you
And when another day is through
I'll still be friends with you

Babies days are never long
Mother's laugh is baby's song
Gives us all the hope to carry on

Candy Man,"(Tone Loc)
Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that wanna get busy
You gots to speak up now

(Candyman)
This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
(Candyman telling'em the truth)
Will still end up knockin the boots

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you

(Candyman)
At each and every show, thers's this groupie
Artis knows what she wants to do to me
She knows my name, knows every rap routine
But how she get in my limousine
Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
(Girl I do)

(Candyman)
Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
When I mention it, you're surrending
Giving it up like a good girl has to
Living it up
Eventually you ask to stay
You're gonna pay for this
Just rest your breast on my chest, yes I'm impressed
With the way you cold love me down
I don't wanna sit down, I just wanna get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to
Do, what it takes to make you
Understand I'm the Candyman
And I melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Hard as rock, yes I'm no sucka
The boots I knock make me one bad mutha
(Unh Unh...giggling) *2

Knockin, while I'm a hip-hoppin
Many people say my lyrics are shocking
Just because of the simple subject
Everyone should love this
Cause everybody does it
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
You betta keep quiet
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
But girl thats irrevelent
Break out the bottle of Asti Spumante
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
We ask the questions, you give the reply
MC Chip, Big Rob and Bud
Rockin on the waterbed, knockin on the rugs
I'm just playing, what I'm saying ain't ill
Girl you should know I'm real

Candy O'Terry,"Winter snow is falling down
Children laughing all around
Lights are turning on like a fairy tale come true
Sittin' by the fire we made
You're the answer when I prayed 
I would find someone and baby I found you

[Chorus:]
And all I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away
And I'm thankful everyday
For the gift

Watching as you softly sleep
What I'd give if I could keep
Just this moment if all of time stood still
But the colors fade away
And the years will make us gray
But baby in my eyes you'll still be beautiful

Can't find the words to say 
Thank you for the gift",The Gift,2008

Let me tell you now
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I never thought it could happen to me
My heart was heavy when in misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me

Night wolves moan 
The winter hills are black 
I'm all alone 
Sitting in the back 
Of a long white Cadillac 

Headlights shine 
Highway fades to black 
I'll take my time 
In a long white Cadillac 
In a long white Cadillac 

Sometime I blame it on a woman 
Why my achin' heart bleeds 
Sometimes I blame it on the money 
Sometimes I blame it on me 

Train whistle cries 
Lost on its own track 
I'll close my eyes 
I'm never coming back 
In a long white Cadillac 

Night wolves moan 
The winter hills are black 
I'm all alone 
Sitting in the back 
Of a long white Cadillac 

One time I had all that I wanted 
But it just skipped through my hands 
One time I sang away the sorrow 
One time I took it like a man 

Headlights shine 
Highway fades to black 
It's my last ride 
I'm never coming back 
In a long white Cadillac

Wrap it is a sigh
Soak it in the sun
And make a strawberry lemon pie?

This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill

Will still end up knockin the boots

Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go

Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it

I don't wanna sit down, I just wanna get down

Cane,"Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
Just to show that I inherited your gambling ways
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
Please, buy me a lucky 7 so we both can get paid
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
When I put in all your numbers at the store for the day
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
Grandma can I get a scratch off?

It's all or nothing, quit with all the bluffing
Soon as one of my cards decline, I'm in my wallet shuffling
Not so lucky, I guess that's how it's looking
I'm a pro and not a rookie, I school you all and I play hookie
These were my times with Sookie
Tea kettle whistling if she ever left the stove on
Old age had kicked in and she sent me for a store run
Gambling is in your blood, ain't superstitious but you're definitely knocking on one
If I win we all won
Behaving, imagine the good grandson that I've been
Grandma give me the missing numbers, the cash that I need
Used to love the bodegas, now they ask for I.D
Had my own two dollars just to get some scratchers for me
Around that time things were drastic, worrying 'bout our finances
Didn't no one give them to me, I was the one who finance us
Said fuck whoever doubted, that's when I took my chances
Feel strongly about whatever I believe in cause I'm a Cancer
Ain't an auction but they gave my mans a bid
Damn the CC8 just filled another bed
I guess we got some time to kill
And you gotta play the hands you're dealt

Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
When I put in all your numbers at the store for the day
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
Grandma can I get a scratch off?

Voice of the unheard, louder than the bomb
Grandma's boy couldn't be prouder of my mom
For this historical perspective, a political education
I hardly ever gamble, my risk was too calculated
Caught up in the traps, to be highly and discrete
Red dollar and rented dream and get you followed by the feds
Cause this life is like a lottery, a loser then you'll probably be
Living with the ghost, like Debbie Moore with the pottery
Testing our morality when facing our mortality
Betting on a fallacy, handing over our salaries
Natural born killer, they call us Mickey and Mallory
'Til our men become warriors and our women become Valkyries
Cussing like some sailors in the open seas
Mama got the silk for the apartment smelling like potpourri
Shopping for the groceries
Got her a pepsi cola and some coke for me
Making a quick stop out the OTB

Scratch off?
Just to show that I inherited your gambling ways
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
Please, buy me a lucky 7 so we both can get paid
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
When I put in all your numbers at the store for the day
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
Grandma can I get a scratch off?

Grandma, uh, and you knew that's all we needed, that's why you plant a seed and feed it
Repeat it and treat it and we playing against the odds
If we can only defeat it
We'd see it, but we standing weeping whenever we read it
And then we feeling cheated, we deserve better
Cause she done earned cheddar and I know she took her turn
Being Tina Turner, let her be returned from her ghetto
You'd know all she want is world peace if you let her
And one day we may travel, if you bought that scratch off
Like Payola at a DJ battle
And it paid off, then we made off like Madoff
And ate off that plate, constantly concentrated like Adolf
Came all the way, four hours in your heart though
Showing up in my school, saying we hit the lotto
Popped a bottle then saw that we misread it at second glance
That's when I learned life isn't up to chance

Scratch off?
Just to show that I inherited your gambling ways
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
Please, buy me a lucky 7 so we both can get paid
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?
When I put in all your numbers at the store for the day
Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?

Natural born killers
We sold crack to his mother, he turn his back on his brothers
Killed his partner for the plug
He think everything a hustle
Cold motherfucker
Oh no, I’m black hearted
No feelings, just a gun
We was raised in the trenches
Not to mention all the hoes had dissed him
So homes think the whole world against him
Played ball, coach benched him,
Grandpa Klan lynched him,
He raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis
Kind of hard to adapt
So homes turned to the strap
To succeed tried rap, couldn’t fight got slapped
Shot dice threw craps, did time back out, damn

I buckle up to kick rap like a crash dummy 
For the fast money, I get up in that ass money 
The fact you tryin' to test me kinda bugs me 
I leave crews fed up, like handicap niggas tryin' to get up 
Emcees get wet up with lyrical gun pillars, 
I blow up the spot when it's time to rock 
I speak through a mic my voice peak out at a hundred watts 
Who want to fight son, I get dumb 
Word to my mother the father the holy ghost and Rev Run,

I smoke you and whoever you standing close to 
And make every man in your crew deny that he knows you

I'll make you question any and everything you've ever believed in

Fuck y'all you don't impress me and no one can test me 
An Emcee so ill, I got AIDS scared to catch me 
All that shit you poppin will stop, when I put you in a headlock, 
And apply pressure until I crush your mutha fuckin noggin 
I grab mics and push niggas to the left 
So fast their hearts end up on the right side of their chests 
My hypothesis, is that nobody can see this 
Lyrical genius, I got it sown like a seamstress 
But if you want to battle, I'm down, 
If you got nine lives, I'll take eight of them off your hands right now 
Step up and get your neck cut from ear to ear

Anyone who ain't feeling my shidick can suck my didick 
You need to quit it, if you ain't spitten 
More than 50 bars per minute cause you ain't in lyrical fitness 
Kickin' boring raps with metaphors that's wack 
All of ya'll mutha fuckas need NordicTrack 
To get ya weight up, fuckin with Canibus you get ate up 
Get beat down and sprayed up, just for bringing my name up 
Been rockin longer than niggas twice my age 
Back in the days before Bob Marley was rockin a fade 
Before Honest Abe signed the paper that freed slaves 
Before Neanderthals was drawing on walls in caves 
I existed, in the garden of Eden gettin lifted 
Stickin dick to Eve before she was Adams mistress 
Before Christ created Christmas, I been in lyrical fitness

I smoke my weed and clean my kitchen dishes
Tec to the sky see how mom's is always bitchin'
I'm done buffin' got my cheese my pen & paper
it's time for me here to prepare my caper
I written it down the line & now a ring is on my phone
it's my nigga Spigg Nice he tellin' me he in the zone
Yo I got the liquor the grain fool let's make a tape
I'm caught up in my own zone can't really escape
I ran it down the line as Easy Mo played the song
He checked my five he said to me yo later on
about an hour passes
about my loosey deuce deuce & my tinted glasses
I got the bike that I copped from my younger cousin
cause that cat is up in class like a nickel & he wasn't
I'm concentratin' on these moves that I'ma soon be makin'
and once I break then I'ma show my peeps that I'm not fakin'
See my man Pop or Die from the block
niggas wearin' reverse as we handle barred it to the block
See certain situations happen
when you caught up in the 'hood in the game of rappin'
You see scrappin' now leads to cappin'
we used to have each other's back
what the fuck happened? Stupid
Yo fuck it
Anyway Mary Easter record store
walked to the back now let me get a four
Exit from the spot everybody know what's hot
you get yours on & soon as you see 'em
the thieves turn the block
Jump on them right now when niggas chillin'
if you ever sported it you know how I'm feelin'
Cracked open my St. Ides took a squig
as Mama Blackwell whispered

You got it this time
He represents my Crew
You represent my Crew
We represent my Crew
Represent your Crew
He represents my Crew

We LB families niggas don't understand us
lyrical scanner diagnosin' niggas with cancer
you got a problem I got the answer
Twin Glocks goin' bananas
buckin' innocent bystanders son
the total sum is a mathmatical function
I used to get suspended for keepin' the class jumpin'
Had the blackboard with the chalk in my hand
Mr. Cheeks snatched the thieves off the Canibus plan
watched the crowd get amped
while they scream & chant
it's ill hot they can't keep still like a fire drill
We desire mils from 97 until
firin' high caliber steel on this battlefield

Lost Boyz is my Crew
Group Home is my Crew
Everyone is my Crew

Strictly out for the fortune & fame
I entertain for my personal gain
rock the gold chains
big enough to cause neck pains
Canibus is my name
I be the last one to set it
You could find my name
in the Lost Boyz album credits
if you open up & look at the cover
you'll see Cop killin' Queens in this mothafucker
and we all represent the Group Home click
L-O-S-T   B-O-Y-Z for the 96
and as the clock ticks record sales climb
I remember when them niggas first got signed
fuckin' with Uptown bustin' they ass e'ryday
from ""Lifestyles"" to ""Jeeps"" to ""Renee""
Now they gettin' mad airplay all over New York
top ten on ya Soundscan report

",My Crew,1997
Canibus,"Yeah, yeah
Me and my man Com Sense
Rallying troops like Joseph Stalin
Where you at, yo?

I'm about to make the name Com Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And I'm a make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware

I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him

I'm creating the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testing me
Because you know you can't ""F"" with me
Stepping to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations
Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be digging my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who want to battle?
I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MCs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
What

""Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron""
""I ain't scared of no nigga""

I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit
The clique that you came in with accent your flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper whose career
You could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble it's
Mistaken as a weakness, when poetry's in motion
Like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions

""Fucking with Canibus""

Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred sixty degree visual
When the signal was given, MCs get bitten with venom
From a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the Shroud of Turin
For certain, I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this
The lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as
You gay ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source chilling on page 40
Put this in your CD-ROM
WWW dot Canibus dot com
You can find me on the internet talking to chicks
That was sweating me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talking mad trash, trying to get them to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beast from the East part 2, coming to see you

It's time I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware

Since I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You stay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared

Hey yo, I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin' Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin' your ex hoe
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chicken-heads gobblin'
Shit I'm drivin' in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin, see
When I approach rappers be takin' notes
I drop like I should of invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin 'til you pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you, my attitude is anemic

I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take 'em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, 'cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
Yous'a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin' on detention
Watch your mouth, better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (LL Cool J is hard)
Every little boy want to pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin' a tiger cub to his knees 
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga, you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line

Canibus,"You ever dance with the Devil under the pale moonlight?
Desperados travelling
What the fuck's up son?
We could do this word up, we could do this

Spend too many nights on the Henny getting right
Breaking big face Bennies, betting against the friendly dice
I can't call it, it's going too good to spoil it
Tell it like it is, the raw shit never recorded

At a thousand degree Celsius I make MCs melt
Fuck my record label I appear courtesy of myself
Let me explain how I maintain thresholds to pain
I walk across the Sun barefoot looking for shade
I rearrange your ribcage like a twelve gauge at close range
And change the position of your brain
My hard raps penetrate through your hardhats and all that
Nigga, get ya wig peeled back
I scalp you like the Indians on horseback
Running Bull will hit you harder than running back
Stunning man with brave and cunning raps
Swiftly running laps around 48 tracks
Like uncut crack you fiends keep coming back
Heads is flipping like acrobats on gym mats
From wax to analogue tapes to digital DATs
It's critical black, that Canibus is ill like that
In fact perhaps you should quit rap, instead of always tryna diss back
If niggas keep telling you that your shit's wack
I rip raps, hardcore raps wrestle you to the floor mat
Put you in the figure four, break your thorax
Jump off the top turnbuckle and land on your back
Till I hear it snap or crackle, the ref says chill black
You get clapped bringing the wrong raps to combat
Like bringing a paint gun to a shoot out with real gats
Y'all niggas is wack, rapping over microphone feedback
My intelligence begins where yours peaks at
From Fox Boogie in the see-through brassiere to Nasty Nas here
My nigga Nature'll explain it further if it's not clear

Millionaire look at the sky make sure it's still there
Ice grill stares and my jewellery is in every year
Pierre Cardan back in a Dapper Dan time
Now flex, angle wrecks, Foxy rock Anne Klein

Initiated to the Firm shit, real thugs learn quick
Sit back and feel the ultimate hit

We clocking, on your airwaves, keeping it rocking
Blaze up, make fire, light your Purple Haze up
Betcha tired, bitch ass niggas need to be caged up
So raise up fuck the playing, I'm sick of laying
I can picture spraying off an SK, shells ricocheting
Snatched up, in Supreme Court, eyes half shut
Co-defendant caught a life sentence, seem him crack up
React what, who will, bail two mill'
Nigga cool still bet I'll be home before the news will
Blast fuse and leave purple Frank Matthews
Perhaps you confuse the concept black, cash rules
Incog another HAMO- D’s involved involved
Known freeze condo seize seven keys dissolved
Daily routine, speaking up for niggas who sling
Hand to hand on them street corners claiming you king
It's time to lock this, join with us, let your Glock spit
Guzzle the toxic, only fake niggas dry snitch
Get your guns out, it don't take much for me to dumb out
Play one route, lay ya shit down and run South

Here's the cause of this shit, more statistics
Deeper than the laws of physics, Malibu sand, the gorgeous bitches
Weed from 1-2-5, my whole crew live
A true Desperado, one that never choose sides
And show sympathy, just QB, an entity
Stock exchange, top of the game, watch you mention me
Image is nothing just obey your thirst
I blaze the Purple Haze, sit in a daze then display a verse
For those concerned or just eager to learn
I speak for The Firm, when zonin' keep the cheeba to burn
Stashing my riches, pass traditions like Olympics pass the torch flip shit so y'all could picture my thoughts
I'm drifting, it's type ill waking up looking like Phil
Twenty years younger same hunger same ice grill
Genetically form grade A pedigree
Born to carve rhymes, a swift tongue helped to set it free
Theoretically peep how we bless this, young and restless
Guns and westerns, learning to connect through lessons
From cool feats to camps, niggas shoot back
It's a proven fact, '97's mine, y'all niggas move back

As the universe expands 
I contemplate whether it was God or the Big Bang that made man 
Sometimes I wonder how come 
We can't live without guns 
What would of been the outcome if the South won 
Think about that son 
What in the hell caused the assassination of Malcolm 
The federal communications commission listens to politicians in the position 
To Make certain decisions like puttin minorities in prison 
To decimating the population of women 
It's called socialism 
From the United States to the United Kingdom 
Aahhkk, spit into the sky and extinguish the sun, but how come 
 
In the future 
The location is planet Earth 
The time and date is 1999, December 31st 
11:59 p.m., the anticipation of what I think's 
About to happen got my heartbeatin 
We got less than a minute left before the planet Jupiter 
Is united into a star 
I know it sounds bizarre but it's mathematics 
A specific sign for some of the planet's inhabitants 
Those who understand know what I'm sayin is accurate 
Our country is corrupt from the president to the cabinet 
In the year 2, followed by three 0's 
The space probe Galileo, will welcome us all to channel zero 
But how come",How Come,1998

Yo  Yo  Aye Yo! 

I stand outside the gates of Buckingham Palace  selling reefer 

Puffing a challis with the beef eaters. 

Gettin' so high that whenever I drop shit 

It'll land on the window of your airplane cockpit. 

Canibus with the hot shit  ""Crazy I. Click"" 

Niggas is bloody idiots thinkin' that they can stop this. 

I'll increase my strength  to a super human extent 

Nigga your rhyme ain't worth six pence. 

And if you can hear, smell, see, touch, and taste.... 

Then you don't need six senses to feel me punch you in the face. 

>From Princeton, to ????? my lyrics invade Europe like Joseph Stalin, 

And murder niggas for rhymin'. Spittin fire.... 

With gasoline filled saliva, drunk as Lady Diana's driver with

Behind her. Alcohol in the hands of 

A minor. I got you panicking like bombs, with 30 second timers. 

Clear the building, evacuate women and children....

Yo, Yo 

Prepare for the worst. This next verse is the face of death 

Me without lyrics is like a porn flick without sex, 

Illmatic, my lyrical skills are Jurassic 

With more flavor then skittles when not digitally mastered. 

I go off like a cannon, and blow up the planet with ""No Fear"" 

Like them clothes white boys be wearing. 

I'm tougher than denim, lethal like venomous snake bites 

The marijuana makes my eyes bright red like brake lights. 

There ain't a party I couldn't rock, believe that. 

There ain't a microphone brave enough to give me feedback. 

I'm strong my word is ""Bond"" like James, 

Niggas be tryin' to test but they ""week"" like 7 days. 

MC's run away when I kick it, they act so chicken 

They should come with a large drink and a biscuit. 

My styles radioactive, massive atomic, I plan to push the Earth 

In Front of Haley's comet. Breaking the ""Facts Of Life"" down 

Like Tudy, I'm raw like sushi, with more vocab, then 

Three fucking Fugees. So recognize or be hospitalized

See I need much more energy then my enemies 

If I want to make more Bill's then Bellamy. 

So I could be on MTV, with women constantly telling me, 

I resemble Billy D. I make fly rhymes to get my name on the scene. 

And when I'm on the scene I do shows to get the green. 

Then I take the green by a automobile machine, for

With a sharp enough weapon, the brain remains conscious for 10

Long enough for me to give you one last message, 

And when you get to hell you can tell Lucifer I said it. 

Don't ever get it confused. Fuckin' with Canibus the human ""rubics

So wicked, I Satan ejaculating on his fingers

Everybody wanna live the ill life, know i'm sayin
But yo we tryin ta live it like love, peace and nappiness
You know I'm sayin, word up

I'm growing up in the ghetto
And there was nobody happy 
And my head is mad nappy and
I'm thinkin up a way that I can get some dough
Man I'm tryin ta blow
But yet this record shit is so slow
I got the whole family on my back
All I do is eat and sleep
Run the street with that steel pack
You know the lost boyz got
With timbs and jeans
Field jackets, and hats coverin the eyes
But listen, that's how it is
If you don't dig how I live
Motherfucka 
Cuz everyday on the street 
The black man is gettin beat 
Police line us up on the concrete
Now people look at me 
And always see wrong
A new problem everyday
I'm tryin ta be strong
Now how strong can a nigga be
When the blacks is locked down
And the white man's got the key
It's gettin harder day after day 
Somebody got ta pay 
And in my closet lays an AK
The new cat is found dead
Plus when he killed the girl 
He put the gun to his own head
Ya never hear it on the 6:00 news
When my niggas get killed in the street over tennis shoes
It's hard enough for us blacks to earn cash man
The homeless keep warm by settin fire to a trash can
Now everyday I need ends
New shit my nigga weed
St. Ides is my best friend
Pa's is broke
No calls comin in on my phone
And money I'm down to my last stone
My mom dukes is always bangin on my door
My music's too loud
I got clothes on the floor (pick em up)
She doesn't understand
I'm cruisin in the fast lane
I'm fresh outta nerves
Ma, you're workin on my last vein
Now how can I explain
That I don't wanna take her out 
But that's stuck in my brain
We're havin fight after fight
Because I leave when it's bright
And comes home the next night
But that's the life that I live understands me
It's bad enough that Po-Nine tried ta can me
Ayo my lifestyle is rough
I got three sisters, four brothers
Man, ain't this enough?
But yet I gots no hero
But I got the 411 on the ghetto

Smoke a blunt let's start to talk
About this ill situation
That us blacks is in
It's time we build a better nation
Motherfuck them police
Some whites talk about peace
But they ain't ready for the planet

But he don't even understand it

You give it all to your bullshit skills G
A white boy actin black, that shit kills me
Pants hangin, talkin slang kid and all that

None of you suckers are even remotely close to me
To be nice I sacrifice things like no sleep
I keep a library of lyrics on microfiche
Creating concepts so deep, niggas quote me
They rewind and interpret my rhymes to they homies
I did things beyond your flows, eons ago
It's inevitable in ninety-eight I'ma blow
Ever since eighty-four, I've been in it to win it
But see back then we used to battle by spinnin' on the ce-ment
You can't even absorb the rhymes I record
Or resolve the deep laws of the physics involved
I travel to the end of the universe and beyond
Parsecs, out of range from a cellular StarTec
From the galaxy of Andromeda, I puzzle niggas

Hypnytis is in your eyes, that look, that smile in disguise.

[Canibus]
Ayo, can you feel it?
I know that everybody's heard of that (Vapors)
But this is the 98 version of that
Biz Mark, one of the founders of this art
Discovered evidence of this disease and documented it
Now the name of the virus is called ""hypnytis""
A terminal condition that effects all biters and liars
Hypnoholics can't require my respect
Cause they snakes and I can smell the venom on their breath
Hypnytis

[Chorus]

Alright now, I'm about to break the hypnytis down
It's characterized by a certain type of lifestyle
People that treated you foul just want to be nice now
Smile and raise their eyebrows when you come around
I remember when I first started to work
And tried to get this job as a label intern
Them niggas was killing me, cause wasn't nobody feeling me
A&Rs wouldn't even risk demo-dealing me
Can you believe that shit?
That's how it was back then

[Chorus]

Ayo, I know most the niggas I exchange pounds with or lounge with
Wouldn't be around if my career was spiraling downward
They'd crowd around me till I'm surrounded
Ask me who I'm down with
Till I replied, ""the Navy Seals outfit""
They told me my album was coconuts so they rewound it
I knew they was hypnoholics by how their voices sounded
I pull a silver can out of my trousers
Paid a public announcement about the Hype juice and then I bounced kid

[Chorus]

To me hypnytis is like the measles
Cause it's a disease too
Studies show it affects 1 in every 5 people
It's so lethal the cure can't be achieved through
Hypodermic needles or the ingestion of medicine in teaspoons
If you feel the need to
Here's a toll-free number, they'll send you an 8-page pamphlet for you to read
Through

We'll never part (through) sickness and health 

You are my heart 

I love you more than I love myself 

But in the middle of the night

It'll be all right  I'll be there for you

Verse 1: Canibus 

Aye Yo! 

Boy meets girl, boy really likes her 

Boy loses contact with girl but he finds her 

Girl has no clue that boy is a liar, and he has no honor. 

So she dates him regardless, 'cause she thought he was harmless 

And he had her believing' he was the man she wanted. 

To spend the rest of her life with. The words ""I love you"" are 

Priceless, unpredictable like rollin' dices. 

Nonetheless in spite of the fright 

And repercussions you might get people still risk they necks. 

Of course it's nice the feelin' of courtship 

Roses and stuff, women never get it often enough. 

And the reason people love they mother so much 

Besides the fact she carried you for nine months, is trust. 

It's a five letter word, that should only occur between him and her 

Before the bees and the birds...word!

Verse 2: Canibus 

Aye Yo! 

I heard a soft moan in the middle of March, 

Then I felt a powerful force push me forward like a dart. 

On your mark, get set, GO! 

I was off, flagella was my propellor wiggling back and forth. 

Then I set across for the border, Mother Nature's ?comma? 

Calling me to the rock of Gibraltar. 

The compitition tried to be smart but I was smarter. 

My competitors was swimmin' fast so I swam harder. 

Submerged in water, prayin' to my heavenly father 

If I don't make it through I'm a ""goner."" 

Screaming out death before this honor, because I'm awesomely 

Stronger, my stamina last longer. I was destined to be a son 

Instead of a daughter, XY is the male chromosomal order. 

One'll stay alive, and survive, the rest'll be dead 

'cause I'm a be the one to fertilize that egg (echoes out) 

Chorus: (Sung by a woman) 

In the middle of the night 

I heard you cryin' in your sleep I held you tight 

I'll be there for you.... 

If you tell me all your secrets. 

Verse 3: Canibus 

Aye Yo! 

Mommy I'm up in your stomach, buggin'. Whenever you 

Rub it, I love it like a comforters covers you warm as a oven. 

Your husband...stubborn, how can you love him. 

Smokin' cigarettes by the dozen when he knows that I'm comin'. 

Bad move, you hopin' that daddy improves. 

Knowin' in your heart that's bull, because he's too cruel. 

You've been abused, used, you got wounds and scars. 

Stick with your mind not with your heart, let's go to grandma's. 

Terminate the lease call the landlord. Give your job two weeks notice 

Pack up the car, and go to New York. What part. 

They got a little borough called The Bronx, Mom.. 

And I heard that's where hip-hop is gonna start. 

Yeah, I think we need to be right there. Four months 

In your stomach and I already chose a career. When you cry 

I hear, and I wish I could dry your tears, but I can't 'cause I'm stuck 

in here. 

Five months from being able to lay against your chest 

I can't even hold you in my arms, 'cause they ain't developed yet. 

But I swear to you, as the God Almighty Truth 

I'm a be there for you 

I'm a be there for you.

I'm like Charlie Chaplin pantamimin 
If you John Blaze or you James Flames 
Or you Jack Cremation  I'm Jermaine Propaine 
No pain, no gain in this rap game 
For the fortune and fame in order to remain 
Most real MC's learn to adapt to the change 
Or get washed away like tears in the rain 
Just ride, just ride, just ride e'rybody just ride 
Just ride, just ride, just ride e'rybody just ride

If you can see what I see, you're prepared for the jackers

If you want to know how I kick a flow 
When I rip a show with my lyrical I'm a let you know 
It's difficult cause I'm a part spiritual part para-physical miracle 
And I'ma blackout in a minute two 
Spittin like Bone thugs like nigga what 
I'm finna to get a gun and stick em up 
Then crush a thugs bone with a chrome slug 
The black cyrano, the birch of rack to rack 
With the ghetto anglo-sax poetic syntax 
In fact nigga don't even give me dap when I see you 
Just don't give me no ice grill eye contact either 
When you see me wylin like Beanie on the speakers 
""Sim simma"" who got the fire for my reefer? 
You came home from a bid a nigga was in your crib 
And the whole time you thought your girl was celebate 
Old school old school 
You locked up and she need some dick 
Just ride, just ride, just ride e'rybody just ride 
Just ride in the hood, just ride, all my just ride 
Verse 3: Canibus 
Yo physically I move at a velocity 
That'll break your stopwatch if you clockin me 
My concrete jungle is like Jumaji 
Illa than what you seen in the cinema 
A 5'8"" nigga with more horsepower than eight cylinders 
My brain consists of twin pentium chips 
Double the clock speeds of a 586 
And nothin about my physical matrix is basic 
I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tastin 
You be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes 
It's like a jamaican seein the snow for the first time 
Rhymes of a sort it distort space and time 
It's like explainin color to a man that was born blind 
?Fog on the street corn frontin like I'm heated? 
?From my cup of tea but don't give them the rest?

Verse 2 

Yo, I want you to sucker-punch 

Whoever you standin' next to 

If you ready to rock with a Refugee rebel 

A Navy Seal underwater in a submarine vessel 

Shittin' on niggas above sea-level 

I'm tired of you emcees talking 'bout loot 

I'm tired of you corny drug-induced rap groups 

I'm tired of the lies, the cries, the screams 

Tired of gettin' my name misspelled in magazines 

I'm tired of you two-faced disc jockeys 

Non-believers, suckin' on my arch enemy's penis 

You know who you are, I'm talkin' to you 

You need to recognize 

I'm tryin' to introduce somethin' new 

Somethin' I would sacrifice my life or die for 

Somethin' if I was already dead I would rise for 

Somethin' that would make a fool 

A hundred times wiser 

Somethin' that would help all mankind to prosper 

I'd die with laughter 

Lookin' at you wack emcees 

With your craft unmastered, bastards 

Hip-hop in it's rarest form 

Crossbreeded with rock and roll 

Now rip-rock is born, mother fuckers 

Rip-rock (7x) 

You want rock and roll? We got it 

You want hip hop? We got it 

You want to wreck shop? We got it

The club scene is a regular hangout spot for unclean 

women in tight jeans frontin like queens 

Chickenheads who should be home takin care of their eggs 

Instead  they always in the club flirtin with men 

No I don't care about no hype no holic bitches; all I'm concerned with 

is who's bringin they burners in to burn niggaz 

While security practice is mediocre proportions 

Niggaz is still stealthily sneakin they firearms in 

Often, niggaz be acting like they're marksmen 

but couldn't hit a stationary object 

So how you gonna hit a movin target? Especially if you alcoholic 

The party was coconuts until you spoiled it 

Nigga what's goin on?

Aiyyo 

The other night I seen some kid gettin loud, runnin his mouth 

Til somebody pulled the thang-thang out, then shots rang out 

This nigga in front of me got his back blown out 

On the floor with a piece of his small intestines hangin out 

I had to scream on the bouncers to carry him out 

They said, ""Nah, them niggaz is still bustin in the crowd"" 

Then they ducked down close to the ground as the bullets whizzed by 

Prayin to Allah cause they don't want to die 

But neither do I, fuck it, I gotta be here 

As a rap artist, it's a vital part of my career 

I swear, y'all niggaz need to chill with that 

Bringing your handguns to every God damn club I perform at 

Everything from semi-autos to macs 

Chrome or black, plastic gats and all that 

Believe it or not - the government wants that 

So they can use that as an excuse to shut down rap 

What's goin on? 



Chorus 



[Canibus] 

Yo 

All of my hip-hop niggaz should feel what I'm speakin upon 

A subject that was touched by Nas and Pharoahe Monch 

Bullets - bein shot from guns, guns bein carried by thugs 

who come to the clubs to shed blood 

Bear in mind, that everytime a nigga reaches for chrome 

he jeopardizes more lives than his own 

To some this record ain't even relevant until you experience 

how a bullet can shatter your dreams in a millisec' 

By some thug cats who didn't take that 

by bustin a gat, they could render somebody handicapped 

and trapped, in a wheelchair over nothin 

With the gift of walkin and runnin snatched from them 

What the fuck is goin on?

It'll cost a brain cell just to cypher with me

I don't give a fuck if you ignore me or camcord me 
Freestyle or written, spittin' with infinite ammunition 
For anybody tryin' to go the distance 
I promise ya no less than a hundred-thousand kilometres 
My bomb threats'll have you evacuatin' your continent 
I'm barbaric with the alphanumeric 
Hittin' you with lyrics that separates your body from your spirit 
This is for wack niggaz doin' shows and shit 
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controllin' it 

I roll with the wildest niggaz 
West Indian Island niggaz, unemployed jobless niggaz 
The foulest niggaz, who never smile at niggaz 
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggaz 
 
We savages, snatchin' microphones from amateurs 
Cause like women who get abortions, I ain't havin' it 
I rip you, my metaphor content, will split you 
Into little, powderlike crystals, so I can sniff you 
What I say should be displayed at the Smithsonian 
Your rhymes are phonier than cubic zirconias 
Have you any idea what I do to crews like you 
How many niggaz in my career, I ran through? 
Comin' afta ya, blastin' ya, with the shotgun 
Like a front seat passenger 
You must be askin' fa', some sort of a massacre 
I'll attack ya cardiovascular 
Shatter you like glass in automobile crashes 
When I smash that ass into blackberry molasses 
Rip your speaker to ashes, and kick a hole in it

More lines than the bible quoted from Jesus

Canibus,"You never hear that we buckle
Beef? we chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit

Now it's a symphony
Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??
Motherfucker clueminati 98'

Basically, LB Fam to the motherfuckin' death
Park side, Queen's niggaz represent
Long Isle, how we do? They knew our style
Represent niggaz in and out the P now
Yo, I could do this mother shit for a while
I don't give a fuck, my rap style be true, yo
Yo, eh yo, yo, yo, how we do this

Hey, yo, well back on my South Side Jamaica part of town
Where us real niggas love to get down
Where you only hear G and P finessin' tracks up on the tape
We stuck in Queens, and I'm not tryin to escape
Yo, I'm havin cess', drinkin; I'm kickin raps and Emceein'
LB for life, kid, my way of bein'
Its time to set up shops; wild in this game and got props
And fuck cops; we puffin' lah wit' windows up in drop tops
Nothin' stops my crew from gettin' it; we learn from the past
Puffin' on this ounce of weed, I got this drink in my glass
Conversatin' with myself; what does my future hold?
Niggaz is dyin', will I make it past thirty years old?
I can't run; I guess I gots to hold it down till I'm done
What the fuck's the deal? I been doin' this here from day one
Official Queen's nigga; be a Lost Boy till my death
Until I breathe my mothafuckin' last breath

[Chorus x 2]
Eh, yo, from boyz to men
We're strictly Fam, no longer friends
Let's keep it thorough; I hold it down till it's on again
Until we meet again, yo, I'm back up on the street again
I'm tryin' to make it; throw out my nine, but pack the heat again

[A+]
Check this out
Yo, yo
My mind is reachin' twice that size than it only did last year
Three times it's likely to feel clear
A+, I transform into a super emcee
With super vocals, quicker than Superman can find a phone booth
The whole truth, nothin' but the whole truth, I roast you
Thermonuclear vocals get hotter than in Shanobal
The double O, just abide nuclear explosions
Exposin' radiation like a vulcan
I'm the only guy that knows why the golden eye
Was stolen by five Soviet spies
They told me to lie; they don't want to hear the god spit
Chop my hands off at the armpits, but I regenerate limbs
Like star fish, comin' at you with the hard shit
Swallow my beeper and page myself so I can communicate with a dolphin
Lyrical arson rush the planet like a million martians committin' arson
Walkin' the tarpits in India with snake charmers that place all the weight
Down...

[Canibus]
Yo, A+, fuck the nonsense
I got the reinforcements
To crush any enemies offense with a hundred thousand horsemen
And the hardest muthafucka on the market right here
I'll complete in a minute what would take you a light year
Extra-terrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
Battling for world supremecy
Who want to get touched?
The Can-i-bus will crush you
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Ambushin' emcees, jumpin' out the trees
Like Vietnamese in fatigues, covered with leaves
Interrogatin' you whack emcees like MIB's with dark glasses
Askin' you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed
By flashing bright light in your eyes with those silver gamas
So when you revive, you can't recall or understand it
That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
And take advantage of opportunites to do damage
I pierce your heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster then tha speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark, I rip you apart
My state-of-the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of his cranial cavity, which is actually
What happens to any motherfucker for tryin' to battle me

You know I won a title a couple a times, did right
No, but they can't hurt us, man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring, man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle this lil' nigga

[Canibus]
So I'm a let the world know the truth; you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you lays your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin' that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only droppin' clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched the footnotes 'bout how you used to sniff coke
Frontin' like a drug free role model; you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin' off your body 'cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me 'cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While ninety-nine percent of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to jay-z
Now you wanna fuck with me? You must be crazy
You drippin' with whack juice, and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga

You don't want no bitch ass niggas hangin' out wit' me, man
We're warriors, man, when we go into battle
We come out, or don't come out at all

[Canibus]
Yo, you better give me the respect that I deserve or I'm a take it by force
Blast you with a 45 colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk?
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that whack-ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
'Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March ninth
God bless his soul; rest in peace, kid
It's because of him, now, at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this; see, this is somethin' different
A faggot nigga tryin' to make a livin' off a dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feelin' himself 'cause he got more cheddar than him
Well, lemme tell you somethin: you might got mo cash than me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a niggas ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse; fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your first, second, and third born
Make your wife get on the horn, call minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it; I say, naw, he started it
He forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself
Trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars off hand
From a lost and forgotten land; you done did it, man
You done spitted some whack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it
Fuck that, 'cause like Common and Cube, I see the bitch in you
And I'm a make the world see it too, motherfucker

My metaphors sting like after haircuts when 
The alcohol is applied to the raw skin 
So whoever want to battle get blasted 
Get your teeth enamel shattered, shitted on like Pampers 
You had a bad bitch, I left the back twist 
I stuck my dick in everything from asshole to the nasal passage 
Dug her out all day, then changed my sperm DNA 
Now she got nobody to blame 
I been spittin raw, what the fuck you think I'm livin for 
Throw me in jail, I'll do a prison tour 
For wannabe hard niggaz, insecure niggaz 
Wit they heads to big for they neck to support niggaz 
Three in the Squad plus me equal four members 
An extra addition for any special force mission 
Man listen 

Ain't these niggaz on some shit 
Keith Murray, Canibus ain't no stoppin it uhh 

Let me draw a brief description of what happened 
I was rappin, niggaz got the scrappin, guns got the clappin 
Three-fifty-seven degrees I was separated 
Have bullets deflected metal, bodies decapitated 
GUSH!! a nigga got struck as I look 
I caught the next guy runnin by wit the metal hook (BOO-AHH!!) 
Blew his back open, blood gushed on my face 
A bitch fainted 'cause she seen I enjoyed the taste 
The case is that I split your melon 
And feed it to the jigga-boos wit fried chicken wings 
I'm wildin for Long Island, I turned and took Charles Ferguson 
And open fire on any trains now 
You may never know who's in your shadow 
You punk ass niggaz just best stay shallow 
And hollow, if you want to live to see tomorrow 
'cause ain't no sun comin out tomorrow 
Yo, I might do something y'all niggaz might regret like 
Blast you in your face and disregard your vest 
I'm pissin and dissin off of recognition and niggaz to listen 
Just to let you pussies know how I'm livin 
'cause I Return like the Jedi, wit my dead eye 
Leave niggaz to die, peace to niggaz up in Bed-Stuy 
Oh-ah, this that type of shit that make them niggaz want to wet it 
Word up, got me ready to set it 
 
Seems I steps wit aggression 
To any bitch who think they nice in this profession 
What? what you think your wrecking? 
I break your stlye down to little fragments 
The pain is permanent, so spare yourself the embarrassment 
Buck-fifty 'cross the face 
Followed by knife wounds to the chest for you attempt to retaliate 
I noticed all you bitches flows is based around clothes 
But Deja Vu got something for you stankin hoes 
Studio gangsta bitches I diminish ideas of bringin beef 
Before the thought even finishes 
I want to see red, blood from a chicken head 
'For I wild the FUCK OUT like the Grateful Dead HA 
This wild style must run in my genes 
Because my sister's in the county 
And my brother just came home from Green 
I strike like the black widow, through the underground radio 
Kitto and still stack dirty ditto",Some Shit,1999
Canibus,"Yo six o'clock every morning you waking up yawning 
To the sound of your alarm clock alarm 
About an hour from now 
You should be at the place of employment 
Which is annoying cause it's so boring 
Your co-workers are talking too loud for you to ignore them 
It affects your occupational performance 
You wonder why your work load is so enormous 
Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office 
People get depressed, they get ulcers 
From the stress that the corporate environment causes 
Regardless of how you ultimately want to solve this 
Seems to me like you've got one of four choices: 
You could take a new job offer for more chips 
Stick it out a little longer or forfeit 
But my advice to anybody that wants to quit 
It'll feel much better if you say it like this: 
 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it 
 
Yo, if your boss is a S-O-be	 
Tell him to S-H-O-V-E the J-O-be	 
Put your middle finger up slowly 
Put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely 
Say I ain't workin' here no more 
Who do you think you are? 
Rip your apron off, throw it on the floor 
Run to the door, to the payphone 
Make a toll-free call 
Tell your spouse what happened and where you are 
So they can come and get you in the car later on 
And help you search for a new nine to five job 
If the unemployment line ain't that long 
You can take your time printin' out W-9 forms 
Eventually, you'll get on if you try hard enough 
And you'll get money if you keep punchin' your time card enough 
Maybe you hate it, maybe you love it 
But if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to 
 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it 
  
Yo, some occupations are like slave gigs 
The boss is favored and get placed in something spacious 
While the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces 
Or get thrown down in the basement, get your stapler confiscated 
You constantly waitin' for a paycheck 
Twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet 
Here's a optimistic motto 
If you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow 
Most nine to five's are hard 
'Cause the description in the job ain't no picnic in the park 
People get hired 
Drink coffee to stay wired 
So they don't get tired, sleep late, and get fired 
 
You came in late, you already ate, 
Nowww, you want to take a lunch break!??! 
 
Ay, yo bust it, ain't no need to discuss it 
Just take this job and shove it, right between your buttocks 
  
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it 
 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Ah Ah ah ah ahahah ah 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Ay Ay Ay ayee ay 
I ain't workin' here no more

Yo, I'm a nuclear warhead
Right now you're provokin my detonation
Never test me without proper authorization
My lack of patience has cause me to get mad
And explode right in front of your face like a airbag
Your rhyme is fake, your brain is child's play to manipulate
I create lyrics too intricate to imitate
Movin at a velocity
That'll break your stop-watch if you're clockin me
My concrete jungle is like Jumanji
But iller than what you seen in the cinema
A five foot eight nigga wit more horsepower than twelve cylinders
My brain consists of twin pentium chips
That's double the clock speeds of a 5-86
And nuttin about my physical matrix is basic
I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tastin
You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes
It's like explainin color to a man that was born blind
One of a kind, I got divine chromosomes in me
My sperm'll scramble the eggs in a women's ovaries
'cause I'm as original as it gets
And I can't respect, niggas that copy like double-decks
I get vexed, when crab punks bite my style
'cause I'm sellin a thousand records per day, per square mile
Breakin the laws of phsyics, wit metaphors and lyrics
Speakin to dead poets by conjuring up they spirits
From Shakespeare to Edgar Allen
Yo, the whole Dead Poets Society couldn't mess around wit the talent
Much less understand it

lose they balance when I kick the planet

Crucial black - two chicks to screw you at
Then they shove a poolstick where you doodoo at

Hoppin out with gauges, prepare for the occasion
We throw about eight in, the house that you was raised in

Pull a voodoo verse on a nigga, Kennedy curse a nigga

Y'all niggaz can't be serious, I was nice before ice
Before Christ, before the words let there be light
And a light took over the night, I was born with a mic

Lord of the mic before all plant and animal life
Took this rap shit to new heights
Before the Wright brothers took flight
Before dog fightin' and aerial strikes
Before MC's picked up pens and started to write
Before promotional marketin' and posterlights?
The Canibus'll bust up mics, punch out lights
Punch out your motherfuckin' eyesight for the title bought fight

And from my balls in my draws to the floor

So I can start World War 4 and murder us all

Like frozen meat tryin' to thaw then bury you under the morge
Gettin' in my way is like jumpin' in front of a car
Breakin' the sound barrier, that means the car is in front of the horn
By the time you hear it blowin', it's too late to respond
By the time you feel it hit chu, I'm gone
I'll send ya' to hell where you belong
So by the time ya' body hits the floor
Ya' spirit won't be in it no more
Who could flow for 4 minutes or more
Without breaks, without mistakes, without flaws
I got millions of styles and I mastered 'em all

Well I'm here now, verbal ass whippins bout to get shared out

Then bust a shot in the motherfuckin' courtroom and watch it clear out

Smacked him in the head for trynna' roar at me

And there ain't nothin' on this God damn planet that's worth more to me
In the name of Hip-Hop niggas could corner me
Torture me, slice me then stitch me up like embroidery
Way back before gold-plated male and female
RCA jacks was used for crystal clear playback
I was tryin' to blaze ADATS, and if a nigga said my demo was wack?
I'd beat his ass and took my tape back
""Yea nigga""  ""What? Yeah nigga take that""
Anybody get outta' line, get they face slapped
Quick fast, the Can-I-Bus'll buss yo' ass
Then I'll bust you wit' a shotgun blast

If you the first nigga that laugh
I'll blow you in half 
The first nigga to talk trash
I'ma blow you in half
The first nigga to show your ass
I'll blow you in half
The first time'll be your last
'cause I'ma blow you in half

[Verse 2]
Yo check it *beat comes in*
I destroy your whole city block when I'm ready to rock
Blow the speaker box, magnetically shielded or not
Magnetically energy poppin gates of radio waves

Oscilate lyrics and beats copulate to pop your tape
Manipulatin space in large proportions
Millions of brain organs get lost when I start talkin
About shit like supernatural forces

Gnomes and theories and superstring theories
Most of you mothafuckers barely 
Even understand the English language, much less think clearly
When I die, will I go to Heaven or Hell

Or will I end up in a place called the Van Allen Belt
I researched my roots, lookin for proof
The best place to hide a lie is between two truths
The aftermath of a nuclear blast 

When the average death sentence becomes a dead paragraph
I dig a 5 by 9 rectangle in the grass
Reach your epitab and bury your ass
As the coffin gets lowered into the ground slowly
I'll sing all of your greatest hits, oldies on karaoke

I'm headless nigga, but I packs a big piece
Blastin, they let assassins loose on the street
Murderous notes I wrote, I lacerate throats
I toss fire at niggaz; motherfuck the six

The condos is supposed to be flip bricks
All thirty-nine of your bitches, pretty-ass bitch nigga 
I'll throw some fucked up kicks on
Next is a small tank top, the spot, shot it up

Beat you in your face wit a rope knotted up
'Cause we don't give a fuck, the Headless Horseman Kurupt
See I'm off the wall nigga, Horsementality
I'm a Horseman nigga and that's all I'll be

See I'm tired of the sparkly shit, niggaz talkin shit
I want to see the streets dark again
Let the heaters spark again, police callin all cars often
Powerful as a motherfuckin Vulcan

My specialty is - poetically lyrically energetically 
Ultra magnetically Dogg Pound pedigree
Fuck the shiny shit, fuck a bitch, only grimy shit
Dirty shit, holocaust in thirty-thirty shit

Missile flick assassin Sicilian
Kill women and kill men, and kidnap children
For vengeance in the name of the Horsemen
Slice your Achilles tendon, the Headless Horseman

And we abide by, the code of the streets
The makings of a real MC (C...C...C...C) yeah bitch!

So just abide by what you ride by
Cause we abide, by what we ride by
Just abide by what you ride by
Cause we abide, by what we ride by

[Killah Priest]
What the fuck y'all done started; four apocalyptic prophets
Appearin out of floatin' objects, wearin' Middle Eastern garments
Long trench coats with our hands in our pockets
Slappin' all you scary-ass rap artists, half-retarded

Swear by our forefathers
Anything you speak, think, or show will be disregarded
Then I drag your frightened ass through the darkness
Bring you out the other side, as a carcas

I'm heartless, regardless if y'all claim to be Gods or Goddess
To me, y'all all garbage; I see all of y'all as movin targets
And my lyrics be the atomic rockets, cosmic vomic - spittin'
Hittin' at y'all Vietnam vets

Wit military arms and bombs strapped to our chest
Castin' meteor storms and comets
Now who want to make the next ras comment
And be the first one left unconscious?

After I squeeze your head like the Charmin
Fuck around and see a lightning bolt around your throat
And squeeze till your head smoke from all the electric volts
Satanically sacrifice your ass like an occult

Have your seance inside of a dark synagogue
We was lyrically sent to y'all
Like the Men of God to put a end to y'all
I sniff bites like dogs to get the scent of y'all

Horsemen, we be scorchin when we be walkin'
With the power to put a graveyard inside a coffin

[Ras Kass]
Let's air it out like the breeze
Now watch me do one-armed handstands 
And hang these N-you-T's over seven continents and seven seas
Streets is Lebanese

Be rockin Bulgari wrist watches and sniper marines
Most of these MC's can't even rap, just model and go gold
And get big-headed like they swallowin colleges
I spit empty gravesites, rap stars fill 'em up

You what? Thirty, forty years old and still wack as fuck
Me? I ain't even in my prime
When I write my dopest rhyme, Western civilization declines
Catch me hoppin off the A train in a New York state of mind

But I rep Westside, so I keep L.A. time
That's a three-hour difference;
So when my bitch is a six, she's really a nine
In seven days, she'd still be a dime

Call me Blaze Skywalker hittin jugular veins
Crack open your skull wit a paper weight and suck out your brains
Kiddo, I be doin my thug-thizzo for shizzo
And the wife of a careless man is almost a widow

So what's happening, from P.I. to '99 Madden
Since police be jackin blacks, I talk to pigs in Pig Latin:
Uck-fay ou-yay itch-bay at-lay a-igga-nay-play, 
And free Keith Mur-ray (Horsemen)

[Canibus]
Yo, yo, yo
I kick a verse at six-hundred and sixty-six meghertz
Make lightnin flash across the sky everytime I curse
Six-hundred and sixty-six flashes

Give out six-hundred and sixty-six lashes
To the backs of six-hundred and sixty-six Master of Ceremony has-beens
Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is
If he's a *Catholic* I nail him to a crucifix

Then I beat him till he's blackish-blueish
Then perform acupuncture wit six-hundred and sixty-six toothpicks
Beat em with two whips; with pieces of broken glass glued to it
Your whole crew get spayed and neutered

As soon as I aim and shoot it, you get sprayed with bullets
Your armored cars and your kevlar vest, is useless
I'm a fuck all of you pussies like group sex
You get six-hundred and sixty-six years imprisonment

For biting off another nigga's shit, you bitch
You got caught, now you on the other side of the law
Snitchin on mad niggaz in a soundproof court
To get some of your sentence knocked off (nah nigga) you wildin

But you still be in Riker's Island gettin forced to toss salads
You scared of that, wit a phobia fear of that
I'm a tape it on the digital video DAT
And send a copy to Miramax - leave you exposed

Turn all the fiction to fact, so everybody will know
You a sucker-ass nigga, father-fuckin ass nigga
That got fucked in the ass by your father figure
(No matter who?) I'll bruise and bash you, blast you

Autograph you wit a bullet wound for a tattoo
Deliverin mind blowin rhymes and poems 
Controllin my tongue when I'm flowin like pilot controlled Boeings
When I get bitten, I bite back, Quicker than Tyson attacks

I don't give a FUCK if I don't get my license back
So, take caution
The Four Horsemen'll chop your head off wit a sword then
Gallop Northward

MC's take caution
The Four Horsemen'll chop your head off wit a sword then
Gallop Northward motherfuckers; yeah

With my motherfuckin arms crossed

Grippin the road with the wickedest flow, 'Bis is a pro

Accelerate and decelerate in and out the cones 
Poisonous poems travel through walkman headphones
Into your dome Osteoperosis your bones,
Who's the nicest nigga you know in the year two triple-oh 
Spit turn to icicles in the mid air and slit your throat
Drain your carcass dry rip out your heart bitch
I write rhymes using your blood for my ink cartridges
Paleoanthropologists, polish the bones

Yo, Yo, I'm faster than leopards running across the vast desert 
In twenty-two yards per second to catch me to daily delicatessen 
With thirty minutes to eat'em, forty minutes to digest 'em 
And fifty minutes for it to pass through my intestines 
So ask yourself a question - can the Canibus rhyme? 
Is a fuckin porcupine half swine? 
No time to make up your mind, you wanna run or die?
Clip you while you're running by, trip you up from behind 
My rhymes, confuse niggas like somebody try to gang-bang 
wearin a blue shirt and red pants, 
throwin up signs with their left hand 
Standin out on the corner of wetlands 
with a confederate flag for a headband 
God dam eggplants, niggas gettin me vexed man 
Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sav 
and I can't seem to get away from it 
I dreamed that I stabbed Leviathan through the stomach, and ate from it
In my past life I slayed hundreds, and in the life before that 
I played trumpets, to warn you that I was comin
There's one billion ways to die, and I already tried 
nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine 
When I aim and fire my rhymes, like a hundred cannon balls flying 
Striking you one at a time, in a parallel line 
Why the art of emceein is steady dyin
That nigga Canibus is still in his prime, bust a rhyme

Half unconscious

Smoke the most enormous trees in the rain forest

Never equipped to spit wit Bis

Let me point out the main differences

Say you write a little bit 
That don't make you a tight lyricist
Cause you don't practice or stick with it
Look at the 60 hour shifts I spend wit this
I never quit, I got a gift for the art
A low maintenance cost
No physical movin parts
In '98, niggas thought I was God
How the fuck did that change
I'm still one of the illest niggas in the game
So look inside yourself and tell me what you see

So don't try this at home  yo.

My style of rhymin is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans 
Because I recognize its all about timin' 
Me and my freestyle alliance practicin' African voodoo science 
In front of 20 ft. bonfires lookin' skyward 

Calculating May 5  2000 the nine planets'll be in alignment 
The arrival of the prophet in the cockpit 
Of a starship the size of the Hale-Bopp comet 
With mercury ion rockets 

And a big ass ""Canibus comin soon"" poster on the side of it 
I'm known geographically and intergalactically 
That's why I got extraterrestrials that want to battle me 
They even tried kidnappin' me 

And they would've snatched me 
If their craft didn't get trapped in the Earth's gravity 
Engines stalled and failed. Crashed into a farmer's field 
And that's really what caused Roswell 

Undercover operatives workin' for COM 12 
Disguised as a nigga signed with a record deal 
Lyrically I'm off scale 
So all hail or get tossed towards Hell, whatever y'all feel 

Briusin' niggas, confusin' niggas like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens 
Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles 
Hear the wild wolf growl 
Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds 

Wack niggas want to be down but its not allowed 
Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you'll get punched in the mouth 
With the southpaw southern fist 
I'll bust your shit. Swell your lip and get the Bubba shrimp 

Back the tougher shit. What a wimp 
You giant Goliath. Niggas get shot with a rubber sling 
I'm an experiment gone bad. 
My brainwave's on an ????? graph. Yo, I'm stark ravin mad 

Your whole scientific staff'll get killed in a nuclear blast 
When I throw the ????? flask in my hand 
Flammable liquids in the lab explode 
And you get stabbed with all the flyin glass 

Trained to blow up commercial aircrafts 
Trained in chemical weapons class 
Just to see how long a nigga's breath'll last 
I put him in a leather mask 

Spray his ass with a can of ???? gas 
Then watch him grab his neck and gag 
Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh 
""You want to battle?"" is the type of question you should never ask 

Nigga, pick a tougher task. See who the fuck'll last 
Whoever lose'll get a solderin' iron up the ass 
You need to recognize 
My hand is quicker than the eye 

Quicker than the 5 speed Jamiroquai drives 
A lifespan longer than 9 lives. Infinite rhymes that can't die 
A nigga with a divine mind 
I dedicate this to the wise. Dedicate it to dames 

Dividin' myself into 100 ten times 
You can't deny the offering's an offer 
Flows that glow with aurora's the spark of light 
Water fly like a saucer 
With the torque of a Porsche 
Murder a million MCs then autograph all of their coffins 
Been gettin' it on since I been born and I'm a live long 

And I'm a be gettin' it on till I'm gone 
Look at all the stages I been on. All the songs that I spit on 
I took an oath to rip everything I get on 
A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndromes 

In the wristbones from grippin' microphones this long 
I'm just a small fish in a big pond 
And gets pissed off whenever I gets picked on 
Nigga try to flip and get flipped on 

My army march a million strong 
Like the nation of Islam with suede timbs on 
Extremely hostile 
Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles 

A lyrical lynch mob 
Shittin' on niggas drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on 
Duckin' down low like Vietnam fightin' the Vietcong 
Screamin' ""incomin'"" when I see a bomb 

Speak to your leader. Surrender your arms 
You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds 
Plus 800,000 to even consider a war 
And 200,000 more to even look hard 

You better drop your flag and withdraw 
My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors 
And smash y'all. Attach y'all to the back of my horse 
And drag y'all across the motherfuckin' asphalt 

9 out of 10 niggas is frauds 
You know who you are always talkin' about your bitches and your cars 
Your jewelry and your girls. It's like we from two different worlds 
You motherfuckers really get on my nerves 

'Cause I'm beyond them, on some futuristic cyborg shit 
I close my eyes when I freestyle so I could read what picture crossed in 
Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience 
To barbecue your brain organs 

You feel like you've been thrown in a microwave oven 
I flame broil suckers and hit 'em with some more shit 
The raw shit. Call my reinforcements, the four horsemen 
Take a big piece of chalk and draw a line across the stage pulpit 

I dare a motherfucker to cross it 
I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin 
Tell him it's important. Tell him to call Sting 3 way and sing a

Break your camcorders so you motherfuckers can't record it 
Call the news, I'll kill your reporters 
Start a lawsuit, I'll kill your lawyers

My album's gold cause my album was the bomb, shit 
Y'all niggas got your ass beat cause you asked for it 
Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid 
'Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys 

You fuck 'em in the ass, then you give 'em cash for it 
That's some sick shit homeboy 
A hundred years ago, they'd have took you to see Sigmund Freud 
You fraudulent. Feminine. Fragile as a feather is 

With an effortless blow, I'll crack your whole skeleton 
You think you're better than Canibus, where's the evidence? 
You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship 
You need to shut the fuck up cause your breath stink 

Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints 
Battlin' me you never win

Claymation characters wit verbal vernacular
Slappin' ya, like a white water rafter

Ya' body already been splashed with acid and you turn to ashes
Assassins camouflaged in the grass blastin'
Leavin' blood all over ya' lady like Jackie O'Nassis

I'll fly ya' body outta Dallas
Perform plastic surgery while we airborne and switch caskets
Then lie to the masses, I'll tell 'em that
You got murdered over some East West beef, between rappers

Radio stations'll express their sadness
Play classics back to back and pass out stop the violence pamphlets
Just imagine, every night ya' girls fuckin' ya' best friend
While you in hell throwin' tantrums

I'll be lampin' in a mansion somewhere out in the Hamptons
Givin' some pretty ass bitch a spankin', nigga you can't win

So don't even bother askin', Angela Bassett
You'll just get ya' ass kicked
Get ya' head chopped off and dropped in a basket
My left arms taken but my right ones free
That means I could diss another muthafuckin' emcee

My lyrical is more visual than television screen pixels

Creepin' wit a four-five and reachin' for ya door knob
Throw a gun under ya chin, see how quick your whore rise
One shot could have a short slide, right out the North side

I'm nasty, but my small joints grip the bar point
Drop on top of the blue line, right beside the red one
Keep the flow fearsome, 'til the day my career done

Enough damage to cancel your tour (Fuck why'all!)

[Canibus]
Now I said it once and I'll say it a thousand times
I got thousands of rhymes, the rechargeable alkaline kind
You want to a piece of mind? Fine, we can take it outside
Otherwise you're wastin your time, cause I'ma shine 
for the one-triple-9, niggaz gamblin damage they eyes
Goin blind, tryin to keep up with these lyrical lines
The type of nigga you can't flow behind without a dope rhyme
You fuck around and get clotheslined til you nosedive
We can rhyme fair and square or fair in the sphere
Anyplace, anywhere, you niggaz don't have a prayer
Cause doomsday is near, faggot niggaz is scared
They stand and stare as I appear upon a cushion of air
With a long white beard flamin, hot enough to sunburn Satan
Hotter than white people takin vacation
out in Jamaica out in the sun bathin; 
sun bakin in gamma ray radiation
til they skin color look cajun
Motherfuckers start agin to the point
where they faces shrivel up like raisins
and they become cancer patients

[Chorus]
[Canibus]
Yo, yo, yo.. I manipulate the metaphysical
power to hold my breath for half an hour
Continuously breathin outward; you ain't an MC you a coward
I make wack rappers lose control of they bladders 
and piss in they trousers
Pink pussy possum niggaz play dead
While my heat waves hit, and verbal x-rays evaporate shit
Water molecules get transformed to vapors
My lyrics turn the Pacific into a dry lakebed
Electromagnetic cassettes melt tape decks
Niggaz battle in space; tryin to hold it down 
but they can't cause they weightless
Amateur swordsmen gets stabbed through they face mask
trying to escape death
A world where the whole globe will contract Ebola
from drinkin spring water darker than Coca-Cola
Human with AIDS, computers with Y2K
I rock rhymes counter-clockwise until doomsday

Blood spillin' in the streets

Blood spillin' in the streets

Aiyyo wit two precise niggaz, holdin' the right biscuits
There'll be a lot of cats leakin' out they life liquid
Niggaz who actin' hard this ain't Columbia Pictures
When we throw two in yo' ass while you huggin' on your mistress

From Philly, where cats quick to mute you at
Cuckoo cats, twist back your FUBU cap
Crucial black, two chicks to screw you at
Then they shove a pool stick where you doodoo at

While you checkin' on your pagers, weapons in your faces
Shot blazin', cops section off the pavement
Hoppin' out with gauges, prepare for the occasion
We throw about eight in, the house that you was raised in

Mouthin' off fakin'll make you a loud patient
Achin', with your arms in a alcohol basin
And while your brain's achin' I'ma have your dame slavin'
Cocaine and apron, over a flame bakin'

Niggaz take it for granted until they layin' dead on the granite
Innocent bystanders get shot by standin'

Can you feel it? Nothin' can save ya
'Cause this is the season of the infrared laser
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is show you how you can get spotted by one too

'Cause I don't give a fuck, I just cock back and bust
With more arms than an octopus, as if one gun wasn't enough
I fuck around and pull eight out
Blast your face off or blow your brains out
Nigga, I'll leave you laid out

Then I pull the gat in my waist out, put it in your mouth
And keep squeezin' 'til the whole clip is sprayed out
Take the gun in my ankle brace out, shoot you in the stomach
Till I see the last meal you ate drain out

Your face look spaced out, I gut you like a trout
Scream my name out while I'm scrapin' your rib cage out
Squeeze with the index, spray like a bottle of Windex
Bullets buzzin' by your head like insects

From your head to your mid-sec'
And I ain't even shoot you in the legs or your limbs or your dick yet
Your masculinity is questionable, you probably a homosexual
Just the thought of havin' a woman lay next to you probably threatens you

You probably look at grapes and see testicles
You probably fantasize about vegetables
Like cucumbers and bananas havin' sex with you
And you probably let gerbils crawl up your rectum too

Shame on you, I defecate on you and simultaneously urinate on you
And pour some acid rain on you
I stop your heartbeat with heat
You weak nigga, I'll leave your blood spillin' in the street

Barrels big enough for you head to fit in the circle shit

Just to handle the kick I gotta glue it to my hands and shit
We got permits to murder shit
We critically injure niggaz who deserve the shit, put 'em in a tourniquet

Bomb proof Suburbans with tractor-tread tires
So we can ride through the dirt with it, drive over curbs with it
Merc in it, even over slippery surfaces we can swerve in it
And crash into niggaz who don't deserve they shit
Try stoppin' the dudes, you gotta be bruised
Cockin' the tools that knock you out your socks and your shoes

We'll leave you shoe less and keep shootin'
Look how much life liquid you losin', you need a blood transfusion
In the back of a medic truck, shots in your neck and gut
While we holdin' our weapons up, I'm still reppin' Philly, what?

Peep the math

Mau Mau be about land and freedom

Reperation and apologies, for Africa to America oddesseys

Guerilla-type tactics on them socialistic fallacies

It be about, the devestations of the social doministic thought

Keep a brown man down sport

They wantin to keep our (?) set nigga

The way Franz Fanon put it, you lucky I ain't ""wretched"" yet


[Big Black - Mos Def]

Yo, you fucked up in the game now

It's Big Black, Mr. Chairman of the Mau Mau

I hear the world in all-black surround sound

Barricaded so you can't move around now

Doin this for my clan that ain't around now

Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now

My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down

There's faultlines in the ground now - shake 'em down

Black fathers, black mothers, black brothers

handcuffed to each other, goin upstate in black buses

Head on a spear, contusions ear to ear

Canibus,"Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing 
Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence 
Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin' 
Prosecution set it with your opening statement

Your honor, before we get started
I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed 
Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara
His two year old daughter T'want to 
And the baby's mamma Sandra 
[He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!]

Order in the court!

I'm sorry for the outburst your honor 
I have an original copy of the police report 
January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught
The forensic report states there was a gun in the car 
And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm 
Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle 
Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you 
You said you was outside the store in Manhattan 
So could you please tell this court what you saw happened 

Yeah he killed Tyrone 
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything 
The worst shit I saw in my life 
I want to testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie 

Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?

Yes that's him right there 

Are you sure?

Yeah without a doubt 
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I ain't hold no grudge 
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood 

You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before 
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?

Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!

Objection sustained, prosecution next question 

I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour 
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class 
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass 
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass 
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask 
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor 
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure 
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet 
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it 

Is that the moment when he shot him?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah man that's when he popped him 
I was so scared I laid there, played possum 
He started to blast this way, 'til the gat was empty 
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display 
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor 
I can't remember no more, that's all that... 

Okay, okay calm down 
I have no further questions your honor 

Court is now in session, now gettin' back to business 
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness 

Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin' for the case 

Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor 
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it 
It happened so fast, I didn't see a lot of it 
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus 

Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous 
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages 
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]
You lyin' in the stand to get him fryin' in the pan 
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone 
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home 
Was you mad because he came home bangin' your chick [what you talkin' 'bout?]
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin' and shit 
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin' on him 
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him 
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone 
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone 

Man you crazy man I was right there... (Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk...) 

No he wasn't! He's lyin! Fuck you you liar!
Man fuck that he's lyin he wasn't even there man!
(He killed Tyrone man! Fuck that!) No I didn't! 
Man he's lyin' man! He's lyin' 

Order in the court now I'm warning you defense 
Tell your client take it down, matter fact 'proach the bench 
Counsel in my chambers so that we can situate 
Let the jury be excused so they can go deliberate...

Yo man, Mr. Haley what kind of defense is this man!
What you doin' man?! She gon' fuckin' hang me man!
No! Sh-she's got it in for me I'm tellin' you man!
You promised you'd get me off man!

In the case of the State vs. Kirk Jones you heard it 
Both sides testified and the jury reached a verdict 
Guilty! All counts from theft to murder one 
(Huh? Wha-wha-what?! Guilty?!] 
By the time you gettin' out you gon' have a grandson 

Fuck you bitch I'll see you in hell bitch!
Fuck that!! Fuck that!! Fuck, get off me! Fuck you Pat Haley!!
(What?! Get him out of my courtroom!!)
Fuck the judge, fuck everybody!! 
(Baliff, baliff remove him from my courtroom...)
Fuck this shit!! I hope you all burn in hell!!!
You're gonna die bitch!! Fuck you!!!

You will spend the rest of your life in jail for this!
You will be held for contempt of court, and anything else I can find that....",State Vs Kirk Jones,2000

Fuckin heathen, wrap my hands around ya neck region
Then I start squeezin `til ya stop breathin

This is what we stand for
Justice, Truth and the value of a single human being

I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5

Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November

When I come back, there'll be no need to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother, ""Go to school in September""
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, Jerry, wear his condom

Yeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice

Check out the bizarre style that I display God
Ha ha ha ha ha
Kinda like when the biz went
Eh eh eh eh eh
But this is the Canibus with the
Ha ha ha ha ha
Now
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ain't just the name of the song
Ha ha ha ha ha
It's probably my favorite response
When I'm walking on the street or I'm out at the mall
And people be talking that blah blah blah
Ha ha ha ha ha
But anyway, a regular day is just like this
Canibus writes a rhyme then Canibus spits, Like
Ha ha ha ha ha
I eat eat eat rhymes, niggas don't be understanding that shit
Why you think I went and put a fucking mic on my arm
'Cause it belongs to me and I belong next to Ghengis Khan
In a coffin carbon-dryed with my body in bronze
Like Han Solo when he got frozen in Star Wars
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm great but I'm not the greatest
Ha ha ha ha ha
I believe I'm god but I'm not aethiest
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm crazy but I'm not the craziest
I'm just a normal heterosexual homosapien
Ha ha ha ha ha
The industry tried to cave me and I was an arch angel
But they changed me into Damien
Ha ha ha ha ha
The evil spirit of rap, the evil rapper
Ha ha ha ha ha
Rip the jacker
Master of the ceremony, most people know me as such
My disciples know me as master 'Bus
I can 
Ha ha ha ha ha
Change their life with a touch, cause I'm
Ha ha ha ha ha
Lyrically gifted as fuck
Can-I-Bus, could bust it down pound for pound
My style'll make a thousand mc's bow
Ha ha ha ha ha
You can yah yah yah cha cha cha cha cha all you want
Why'all niggas know the Canibus is the one
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
The rhyme creator
At the drop of a dime I spit 100 be	-a-rs
I'm a S-T-A-are since the day I was born
And I'll be a star til the day that I'm gone
Ha ha ha ha ha
You can agree with uh-huh or disagree with uh-uh
Whatever, niggas can't front
Ha ha ha ha ha
If they respond too late to the 911 call
They find you on the floor with a razor blade in your palm
Deep cuts an inch wide and 5 inches long
Paramedics feel for a pulse to see if you gone
You was pronounced D.O.A before you got to E.R.
The doctor swore that suicide was the probably cause
Probably because, you weak insecure motherfuckers 
Feel lost when you hear me roar
Ha ha ha ha ha
Like-uh the predator starring Schwartzenegger
Before he triggered the bomb he went
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
The evil spirit of rap, the evil rapper
Ha ha ha ha ha
Rip the jacker

Its legibly unimaginable, mathematically incalculable
Inextricably infalible
Let's not forget utterly impossible or
Morally unsermountable to assume that I could lose if I battled you
My scholastic aptitude is 1602
Hundred bars was just a glimpse of the truth
Physical proof that I'm the best at this
I've contructed sentences 
That'll stand longer then stone henges megaliths
My first and second albums consists of more then a million terabits
More then any of you rappers ever spit
Vote for me as president, In about a day or so
I be up in the white house getting feletio
By an administrative assistant with deep throat
Butt naked on the floor knee deep in some coke
Or on a speaker phone freestyling with some of my folks
Humping a ho tampering with the republican vote
I'm like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, fighting swordsman
Dodging arrows from the arches 'cause I'm a horesman
Flying circles around you like flying saucers
Flying circles around the royal air force's flying fortress
Maximize my wins, minimize my loses
Til I'm exhausted then lounge like the lyricists on Rawkus
I'm unsigned right now, it's like I'm an orphan
Looking for a home taking all calls and offers
Notify the prince and the duke of earl
I'm probably the illest english speaking mc in the world
Ghetto fabulous, verbally hazardous
Ask any baptist, roman catholic or satanic activist
Even them trippy hippies on college campuses know about Canibus
I've got rhymes like beads on an abacus
My styles totally out the bracket
Scientist in thick glasses and pocket protectors want to patent it
My talent is unmatched by any rapper in this rapping biz
By any rapper on this planet's grid
Show me where he is, I sign the ordenance
To bomb his coordinants with Agent Orange and torture him
Burn the skin off of him, throw a towel on him and stomp on him
Rip the towel off then pour salt on him
Continue my verbal assault on him til its 12 in the morning
And turn into the werewolf monster on him
Rip his heart out, eat it while its still pumping
The blood still running, it tastes like boiled dumplings
Starving artist, I turned down scholarships to Oxford College
'Cause I heard they didn't serve porridge
Smartest then any man in Scotland yard is
Used to work for MI6 but quit 'cause I couldn't take orders
I was the original James Bond before Sean Conn', Roger Moore, 
Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosman
The most awesome walking, talking, breathing
English speaking mc in the European region
Rip you to pieces like communism leaflets
Beef with 'Bis is like playing chess without the pieces
Modern Christians without Jesus, Rasta's without Reefer
Jamaican's in Princeton without Visa's
Radio's without speakers, Mother nature without the 4 seasons
Without a jacket outside when its freezing
I'ma tell you straight up, no lie
Canibus is the illest motherfucker alive

The evil spirit of rap, the evil rapper

Canibus,"I take it back, back to the Golden Era of Rap
When it was exactly that
Not specifically jams in the park
But when emcees used to talk with advanced thought

D.J. Premier on the boards,
Can-I-Bus on the bars with the Lyrical Law
Just listen to the rhymes, don't behave cruel to be kind
And I'ma show you how I'm nice with mines
Forced to start from scratch to rhyme from the heart when I rap:
Looking forward to not looking back
I spit supernatural, look out for the planet sized shrapnel

You got to honor it, fuck the politics!

The cuneiform symbols on my uniform tell you what I been through

Cptn. Cold Crush get it crackin'

The phonograph fascist, let's see who can reload fastest
Your chronograph is still in the past tense
Double shot glass of absinthe still spitting fantastic
You an absent has been, I'm still rapping
A Roman gladiator clashing, chariots crashing
Chest plates split in half with axes, blood splashing
What you wanna speak about? Let's weed it out
Before it turn into something somebody gotta bleed about
If I feel the need for speed do not freak out
Armour upgrade beneath seat mount, no seat belt
Breathe in, breathe out, then lean out
White phosphorus smoke screen the whole street out
Riot squad gotta reroute, Swat team can't see now
R.P.G. launch out the tree house
Got a casualty, tell me what the beef is about
He don't wanna talk, let him bleed out, don't need him now

Lyrically wave-theory like Timothy Leary

To fail to capture the meaning attached to the words

About this chick I know
They call her ""Amphetamine Annie""
She's always shoveling snow

I sat her down and told her
I told her crystal clear
""I don't mind you getting high
But there's one thing you should fear""

""Your mind might think its flying, baby
On those little pills
But you ought to know it's dying, 'cause
Speed kills""

But Annie kept on speeding
Her health was getting poor
She saw things in the window
She heard things at the door

Her mind was like a grinding mill
Her lips were cracked and sore
Her skin was turning yellow
I just couldn't take it no more

She thought her mind was flying
On those little pills
She didn't it was going down fast, 'cause
Speed kills

Well I sat her down and told her
I told her one more time
""The whole wide human race has taken
Far too much methedrine""

She said I don't care what a Limey says
I've got to get it on
I'm not here to just see no man
Who come from across the pond

Cannibal Corpse,"Walking down the street, the smell of death in the air
What a rotting stench
My imagination runs wild at what this could be
Open up the can to discover a dead body

Or what was left of one, pieces in a bag
Blood is everywhere what a retched sight
Cut up really small by a razor sharp knife
Lying in the garbage no one else knows
What I have found, what should I do
Take it to the police or make it into stew
This was an evil committed by the insane
Looking down laughing, I am the same

The sight of death drives me nuts, I must kill, to control my brain
Swept away by my lust to cause pain, mutilation is my only want
The evil inside me gives me the strength to kill at will
My life is the means to cause death in the most sinister ways

I see it in your eyes the fear that keeps me alive
I'll take it away, your life will end today
I'll leave you to rot, what a sick odor
Scream all you want, but you can't stop this horror

Fresh burial sight, my hunger grows tonight
Undying lust for cadaverous molestation

Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot
Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch

Raging fires of hell, burning through my soul
My love for a dead fuck, I cannot control
The child soon will rise, all evil will survive
Birth through death

The newborn needs a feast, its mother is the meal
Chomping on her flesh, his teeth tearing her skin
I love to fuck the dead, demons in my head
Tearing at my brain

Bleeding sores beginning to stench
While you lick the festering stump
Green infection discharging pus
Devour the putrid afterbirth

Feasting on flesh by the hour
Lungs explode as I cave in your chest
Probing through your organs - searching for meat
Chewing the heart of my kill builds by evil will
Bodies emptied of blood to fill my sacrificial chalice
I stalk my prey at night, I need to kill tonight
To strengthen my evil soul, those that I kill worship me below
I am your worst reality, pain and torture of humanity
Violent ways of insanity, there is no end to this cruelty

In my grasp, I'll kill you fast, I'll send your soul to hell

Hospital of immortality, butcher their patients bloody red

He tortures his patients through evil means

You can't try to fight them, first they change your brain
Beyond the realm of evil, their means are insane
Mutilated beyond belief, but still kept alive
Pathologist of death gouging out your eyes

As they eat your pancreas
Human liver, for their diner
Or maybe soup with eyes
Cause of death, still unknown
Gnawing meat, from your bones
Bone saw binding in your skull
Brains are oozing a human stump
Needles injected, through your eyes
Pulling off flesh, skinned alive

Skin ripped off to expose muscle tissue
Butchered for human stew

Raped before and after death;
Stripped, naked, tortured.

I am lost and sickened
Disoriented by this bleak environment
How I came to be here escapes my memory
This is a desert, deep scarlet grains
Stretch the horizon and the sickly brown sky
Gale force winds pepper my face
The sand tastes foul,
the sand tastes like blood

Savagely cruel, barren expanse, the atmosphere,
a caustic fog
Every breath reminds me of pain
Dust of dried blood filling my lungs
On the horizon I see a chasm, a distant pulse
begins to beat

buoyant in their own blood

my body fails and drops

Screaming victims fall
Repulsive beasts attack
Gore pours from the torso
Hellish creatures stab
Organs, grisly trophies
Rewards for their rage
Blood drips from their jaws
They disembowel the corpse
Kill with speed
Victims bleed
Wretched souls
Headless on poles
Savage thirst
Vesseles burst
Torn apart
Eat the heart
Vengeance taking form
Endless hatred for the living
Plunderng the world
Paroxysm of the damned
Rapture of their rage
Euphoria from butchery
A dark world will eclipse all life
Barbaric ways forever reign

Sullen mastery is an answer uncontested

Begged for retribution before meeting with demise

Vigilante hardcore to the penis

I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life

If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya

Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile

Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, 'cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
Yous'a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby

Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces

And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype

Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin' a tiger cub to his knees 
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga, you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Cannonball Adderley,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Remain to love until they droop and die

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,1958
Cannonball Adderley Quintet,"And those weird China blues
Never go away
Sad, mad blues
For all the while they seem to say

Oh, Limehouse kid

Goin' the way
That the rest of them did
Poor broken blossom
And nobody's child
Haunting and taunting
You're just kind of wild

Oh, Limehouse blues

Can't seem to shake off

And tears for your crown

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last

Cannonball Adderley Sextet,"187, gang related, I'm accused 
 And after every court date my face is on the news 
 They say I wrote a song about a murder 
 I maintain my innocence, it's nothing but a coincidence 
 I'll admit it looks kind of shady 
 from the outside looking in 
 The situation is serious but people don't comprehend 
 I was 17 years young back in '92 
 Facing 25 to life for something I didn't do 
 My song is supposed to be a big admission on my part 
 And they're using the lyrics against me when my trial gets ready to start 
 My songs are being misinterpreted 
 It ain't nothing but the D.A. trying to prove premeditated 
 They've got X-Raided stuck, majorly crossed up 
 The D.A. got a fucked up witness and my lawyer is a dump truck 
 I've been sitting in the county, three years have already went by 
 They're pressuring my Locs, trying to get them to testify 
 Snitching ain't no joke, it's hazardous to your health 
 When you point one finger at me, you're pointing three back at yourself 
 My homies got convicted for murder in the first degree 
 Ain't no doubt about it, they'll try to do worse to me 
 They take me in the court room in front of an all white jury 
 With the family looking me with barely concealed fury 
 My lawyer standing next to me, prepared to represent 
 And help me get convicted cause to him 
 I'm guilty till proven innocent... 
 Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life? 
 They trying to give me 25 to life cause I'm guilty till proven innocent... 
 I open up the front page of the Sacramento Bee 
 And read the article that Dan McGrath wrote about me 
 He has his own opinion and it's his job to write it 
 I say he's being biased and completely one sided 
 The media write their stories for the public to consume 
 And any chance I have of getting a fair trial in Sac is doomed 
 Any potential jurors mind is being contaminated 
 From reading all the bull they wrote about X-Raided 
 I never told anybody to go out kill somebody's folks 
 And blaming it all on me and 
 a song I wrote is a complete joke 
 They're looking for a move but they're looking in the dark 
 Putting a noose around my neck and a bullet in my heart 
 Just because I'm capable of killing doesn't mean I kill 
 And just because I'm capable of killing doesn't mean I will 
 I wish they all knew, how can I make you feel me? 
 X-Raided didn't do it but I've gotta ride cause I'm guilty till proven innocent... 
 Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life? 
 They trying to give me 25 to life cause I'm guilty till proven innocent... 
 I'm knowing I'm going to end up in the pen 
 Fighting my appeal and hoping that I win 
 It's me and Baby Bread fighting this fucked up case 
 Like Dooney and be	-Dub trying to get these years erased 
 In Sac there ain't no love when you're from the Garden Blocc 
 Maniac, see-Mooney, Baby Snake and Lil' Venom already got washed 
 I'm trying to keep my head up but my load is getting heavy 
 It makes me want to do like Sicx: take some Tylenol and get it over with 
 But instead I just maintain and do everything to keep my composure 
 Representing the Blocc to the fullest and riding like a soldier 
 I told you fools the X-Loc ain't going out like the average 
 I didn't kill your folks but if you run up then I gotta loc up like a savage 
 On that ass, bitch, it ain't nothing personal thang, it's just about survival 
 And I'm going to be 125 years old before I die 
 if I can help it 
 You made your threats and I felt it but I ain't dead yet 
 So you niggas talking about 
 what you're going to do when you see me 
 I'll be on the weights, wearing state boots and a beanie 
 I wish I didn't have to be this way but it's reality 
 So I'm strapped based on the fact 
 I'm guilty till proven innocent... 
 Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life? 
 They trying to give me 25 to life 
 cause I'm guilty till proven innocent",To Life,1964

Guerilla-type tactics on them socialistic fallacies

Keep a brown man down sport

Yo, you fucked up in the game now

It's Big Black, Mr. Chairman of the Mau Mau

I hear the world in all-black surround sound

Barricaded so you can't move around now

Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now

My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down

There's faultlines in the ground now - shake 'em down

Head on a spear, contusions ear to ear

For Africa Maxima, I'ma drive you out of here

As in bible college that's cool but what about tryna model that book you holding
Aye try to follow

Some talk it good but don't walk good, they eat up facts and don't meditate
They a sit around and have deep talks but the lifestyle so disarrayed

Can't have more without being faithful, I heard that said from so and so
Or maybe that was said by such and such
That's the goal, now hustle up

And I ain't even gone use metaphors
It's enough for me tryna just spell it out, instead of tryna get super deep just take the wisdom then flesh it out

You probably think I ain't go deep enough, like spit a couple triple entendre right
Metaphors, that real rap, say a line that’ll smash mics

But I ain't tryna be nobody favorite rapper, I just wanna give you that real life, I got views for anybody, Thats insight, and it's insight

Application yes application live the gospel just be about it, that I'll livin that real difference, between yo talk and real life I promise

Chase that high all the way to into the grave
You lost in your low so you're high everyday
And everything you crave only makes you a slave
And Christ is the only way you ever gonna 'scape
If it's one hitta, quitta, get it
In your mind that your time's gon' pass
And if you gon' get it, spit it, lick it
You got one life and it ain't gon' last
You ain't stimulated, you manipulated by a hater
And he hate it when you rehabilitated
If smoke is the evidence, you takin' His benevolent gift
And telling him split while you're in hell in yo hit , so get up

Ohh, you think you high but you really getting low
Yeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know
That in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try
I know your lighters up but I'ma blow your high (Eyyy!)
I'ma blow your high (Eyyy!) I'ma blow your high
I know you're trying to free your mind
But you just wasting time
And Jesus is alive

[Canon:]
Wait a minute ya'll
Let me take it down a river while they rolling down the hedonism boulevard
Anything that got em' feeling, maybe money or the Lamborghini in the magazine about the sports car
Everybody wanting satisfaction 
But there's no regard for The One who has it
And everybody wantin' grabbin'
But you gotta get it from above where they stash it
You can try to get high
You can feel alive
But the reality, your soul dry
You gotta find anybody with a better high
You ain't fillin' half of the $20 bag full of weed that provides it
Gotta make a U-turn cause if you turn
You can see The One who turns
But if we never make that turn 
You will never be content with the high you've earned
You will never be happy
Running with the love of kush
For the love of kush, I promise
You can either be a slave to an object
Or rather be a slave to the God who's honest
They ain't never seen a high like I got
But they fallin' in the puddle like a raindrop
Steady running from the top of the balcony
Looking over the Hollywood valleys falling from the rooftop

Ohh, you think you high but you really getting low
Yeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know
That in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try
I know your lighters up but I'ma blow your high (Eyyy!)
I'ma blow your high (Eyyy!) I'ma blow your high
I know you're trying to free your mind
But you just wasting time
And Jesus is alive

The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
Who by the unrighteousness they request the truth
For although they knew God, they did not honor Him or give thanks to Him
They became futal in their thinking
They exchanged the truth of God for a lie
And worshiped and served the creature instead of the creator who is Blessed Forever
Amen",Blow Your High,2010

Milonga pa' recordarte.
Milonga sentimental.
Otros se quejan llorando
yo canto pa' no llorar.
Tu amor se seco de golpe
nunca dijiste por que.
Yo me consuelo pensando
que fue traición de mujer.

Varon, pa' quererte mucho,
varon, pa' desearte el bien,
varon, pa' olvidar agravios
porque ya te perdone.

tal vez no lo puedas creer,
tal vez te provoque risa
!verme tirao a tus pies!

Es facil pegar un tajo
pa' cobrar una traición
o jugar en una daga
la suerte de una pasión.
Pero no es facil cortarse
los tientos de un metejon
cuando estan bien amarrados
al palo del corazón.

 II (bis)
Varon, pa' quererte mucho, etc.
Milonga que hizo tu ausencia.
Milonga de evocación.
Milonga para que nunca
la canten en tu balcon.
Pa' que vuelvas con la noche
why te vayas con el sol.
Pa' decirte que si, a veces,
o pa' gritarte que no.

When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.

Which the saint had printed.

Cantorum Choir,"In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone,
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain,
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air,
But his mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.

What can I give him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb,
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part,
Yet what I can I give him: give my heart.",In the Bleak Midwinter,1993

Cantorum Choir,"Once in royal David's city 
Stood a lowly cattle-shed 
Where a mother laid her baby 
In a manger for His bed
Mary was that mother mild 
Jesus Christ her little child

He came down to earth from heaven
Who is God and Lord of all
And His shelter was a stable
And His cradle was a stall
With the poor, and mean, and lowly
Lived on earth our Savior holy

Jesus is our childhood's pattern
Day by day like us He grew
He was little, weak, and helpless
Tears and smiles, like us, He knew
And He feeleth for our sadness
And He shareth in our gladness 

And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love 
For that Child so dear and gentle 
Is our Lord in heav'n above 
And He leads His children on 
To the place where He is gone",Once in Royal David's City,1993

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001

VIP at the bank, I can go on Sundays
At the strip club, two girls in front of me
Bend over hut one, hut two, hut three
Polo on my drawers, Polo on my shirt
I put Polo on your bra bitch, that Polo, Polo, Polo
Every time you see me takin' photo after photo
At the red light nigga photo after photo
Dress to impress, snow on my chest
I don't like her if she got a 'fro between her legs
I'm a real nigga, and bitches like real
So you is what I ain't and it is what it is

[Chorus]

Whoa kemosabe, smokin' is my hobby
Whoa kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby
Whoa kemosabe, I met her in the lobby
Then I took her to my room and I got that sloppy toppy
No matter what I'm doing, no matter where I'm going
I am so far ahead I'll see you niggas in the morning
Two chains on my first chain started cloning
If I die tonight I got a bank roll on me
Versace, cheese on my broccoli
Gold rollie on are you watchin' all my watches
Stretchin' out like Pilates
Wash it in my condo, suicide doors
Rest in peace to my car door

[Chorus]

Look, I am gettin' to that paper ma I'll see you later
Let the top back all you see is gator
Bad bitch with me got my name on her
She got the buy a purse pussy, spent some change on her
All I do is fuckin' rap and rap and fuck some groupies
Fuck her with the camera rollin' make a fuckin' movie
Everywhere I go I'm strapped got that fuckin' tooly
Shout out to all my niggas in the hood, every city that I roll I'm Gucci
Whole team with me, dough we spendin', two litre sprite, OZs in it
Double cuppin' then double up got another chick she want to come for lunch
Got a best friend I made her roll up the blunts, 
Don't do that check and let the ho get choosin'

Stop playin man, the fuck is you talkin 'bout?

I'm in the crib watchin Larry King Live, the new Guccis on
Refrigerator, smokin some kush, this nigga's a lighter
Swisher, becomin a roach, go get the glass ashtray
Pour the glass of Crut, tap the bottle then toast
Barrie took a sip for the cause, yeah my son
Soon to be 3, tried to fill his bottle then run
Then I got a collect call, heard niggaz down the block is fightin
Some nigga got, knifed up brawlin
Heard the kid was 19, Lil' Infinity too
His father worked up at the dealer he loved boo
They tried him for his Louis', son wasn't havin it though
Yeah, yeah my nigga, the color of glue
Decided on a intervene, guess who tried to wild on me my nigga
This is like out of the blue
I'm in the Range stretch, jumped out, tucked the chain
Proceeded to talk to him, then you heard the heavy face slap
Think I broke my wrist, now I'm at the hospital vexed
Fucked up my writing hand, that's my check
Now I wanna kill this lil' nigga true
Only thing that stop my gun flamin cause he related to you

Who? He ain't related to me
Just that I knew him for like 18 years until he violated, stealin my gear
If my lil' homey, yo he eat anything for me
Send him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me
Come home and still blow cats for me
Pump crack, stabbin all them hoodrat shorties
A live gunslinger well known, born to dance
When the heat is on, Stapleton days, shoot hisself in the groin
The gun went off, it looked like a flick
When he fell to the floor, holdin his nuts, screamin ""God damnit
Shit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all lookin at me for?
Call the police, do somethin
Motherfuckers standin around, watch when I get better
All hell's gonna be terror
Death to you, you,"" he pointed at Red
I said chill that's fam duke
He put real work in that make you cute, fuck that

Capadonna,"Ah-yo
Here's a little story ghetto situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-a** big brains and straight out the hood

[Ghostface]
Yo,
Ah-yo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong

Right before she went to rest she had me singin this song
She must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
I don't know

She had the high-glow's switchin
See her in the club you hear others chicks b****in
But Dawn quit to bust a b**** a** and s***
See she did 12 months over a ratchet

Not no crab s***
Got bagged with the mag
Taxi cab s***
Clit was hangin out her panties with no where to stash it

It was cla**ic
Nowadays she's laid back
Helpin me perfect my rap
Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat

Wife everything
Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
Lickin gla** bowls in her cat clothes
'Cause crazy stacks

Finicky thing
Her kittin drink pollar spring
Take naps
Near her jewerly box

She play with all the rings
And when she step out the tub its like an ill flick
Caramel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode

Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN

[Cappadonna]
Ah-yo, she gotta be gone
Waitin on my sweet strawbeery pecan rican LaShawn
Holdin my taffy down when I'm gone
Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes

That's why I'm eatin her candy
And suckin her toes
Sweet sexy LaShawn
She got body like what's goin on

On some marvin gay s*** like lets get it onnnnn
Sugar
Let's get it on
Ah-yo she a diamond in the rough

Black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
F*** cookin for me
She stash me out when the feds come lookin for me

I'm not cheatin on her or beatin on her
I spend the weekend on her
We on the block when the bills start creepin on her
She right there when it gets sticky

She strict politic to the vicky's
And a fly aviator the color of sky
God on her side

Indian chick with cat eyes
Mad respect with the fat thighs
Plus her guns for the revolution
Would straight leave her if she prostituting

Yo my girls the bomb
Intelligent mind
Sky blue louis vetton
Leg muscles, deep dimples

Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
Pretty feet peitete a** nice shoes on
The sunshine for my quiet storm
Keepin the food warm while I'm gone

It won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon'

[Trife]
Ah-yo, ah-yo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn
Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen
You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe
Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue

Pretty young thing, with a body like vida
A** off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva
Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba
She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up

Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin condoms!
'Cause she my b****, the only cat that I lick
Throwin that a** like Ciara on the top of that whip

Latin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print
Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh
Even at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride...

Capadonna,"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, yeah, yo

Catch me on yo' brochure with beachballs, at least three whores
Head wop Queens know how to work they jaws
They skintone is coffee and milk, mixed up
Ass as big as my boss' wife, stomach ripped up
Spitting liquor in they mouth, cold Moet
Captain Morgan, taking flicks, posing, holding my tech
With cowboy hats and coach bags, they party like rockstars
Bo Gary watches, just chill, they down in the shark bars
And me, gunslinger, clips, cock D
My fashion on, I'm rocking 'em new Rasheeds
I'ma finish ya, go in brother like Mr. Cee
You could find me fucked up like the mice in cheese
Life's a B, Bentley and big bills
Bottles, biscuits, bitches, blunts, bad boys bodying pit bulls
Karate, black belt and I bring booze
To big bar brawls, ball games blasting, fuck 'til my balls blue

We like the black Yankees, old vets who sit in the rest
Thankful, counting up currency and move when it rain, pour
From every bitch that we bless, we hit up, automatic love
The Cuban Link niggaz is the realest
My wallet walk, speak to niggaz, cops, judges
We put it down, Columbian style, with three killas
Based on money, dummies'll die
It ain't funny, trying to front on mine, we get in ya mommy
Keep cool, nigga, read him the rules, before he bleeding in pools
And fuck my shit up, and I'ma just lose
Paid a lot of paper to live here
American Gangster status, Big Brother, lemme get in ya ear
You know what time it is, crime it is
No matter what rhyme it is
We gon' stay fly, hit lye, rock diamond shits (no question)
Based on a general's fist of fury
Neck, arm, money, all of that's crispy jewelry

Let me show you how I g ride, nina on both sides
Nobody riding shotgun but the four-five
Nigga, if you won't try, I'll give ya something to regret
Throw that mothafucking semi to ya neck
Throw the other black Jimmy to ya chest
If you budge, you get stretched, nothing more, nothing less
Pay respect, I'm a element of Homicide Housing
In other words, bitch, I'm the resident from Homicide Housing
Known for drug dealing, stack thousands
Four hundred grand in the couches, two hundred grand on the houses
At any time I could move up out this
And go and cop some shit up in the moutains

Aiyo, aiyo, you know ya boy stay fresher than produce
Timberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth
I grind daily, Patriotic like Tom Brady
I'm the bomb baby, cuz what I write is beyond crazy
I'm the Don with the teflon armor, good karma, mac palmer
Call me Arab Diesel cuz I'm a track bomber
Roger that, my niggaz ain't got it cracked
All we do is dollar stack, get twisted like bottlecaps
While you on the block getting indicted
We island hopping, globe trotting through the friendly skies flying United
There's a party over here and everybody's invited
The headliners is Theodore and everybody's excited

Fuck that, 'bout time we took it back to the block
The task force coming, I got crack in my sock
White Rock on the dinner plate, get cash, shit is hot
Smash whips on the Interstate, we dash on the cops
It's them dudes, drug slingers, 1-6-Ooh
Crime figure, rhyme spitter, his gun spit too
Call 'em Sex Pistols, ravishing, nigga, I'm Rick Rude
And ain't many mothafuckas could fit up in Rick's shoes
Man, listen, ice glisten, they love the life we living
That's a given, like football players love white women
White linen, a tight denim, that ass look right in 'em
Shit, I'm riding 'em, cool as Kahlua's with ice in 'em, shit

Aiyo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo I pass the mic to Cap (Nah, I pass it back)
Never, son, hold that, you the master of the rap attack
So knick knack patty wack (This is how we do it black)
(Slap you with the almanac) Where actual facts is sold as facts

We on our grown man shit like Quincy Jones
Travelling across the world while we smoking the bone
We grinding, y'all niggaz know what we do
We get it in with the Murderland, Chi-town too
Hit you up, something nice 'til the death of Yakub
Swagger stuck on ya face like a New Jack tool
Right back at you, yeah me and my dude Toney
We don't fuck with fake contracts and niggaz that's phony

Che il cielo vi attraversa
E trovo inopportuna
La paura
Per una cultura diversa
Che su di me riversa
La sua follia perversa
Arriva al punto
Che quando mi vede sterza
Vuole mettermi sotto 'sto signorotto
Che si fa vanto
Del santo attaccato sul cruscotto
Non ha capito che sono disposto
A stare sotto
Solamente quando fotto
(torna al tuo paese sei diverso)
Impossibile vengo dall'universo
La rotta ho perso
Che vuoi che ti dica
Tu sei nato qui
Perché qui ti ha partorito una fica
In che saresti migliore
Fammi il favore compare
Qui non c'è affare che tu possa meritare
Sei confinato
Ma nel tuo stato mentale
Io sono lunatico
E pratico dove cazzo mi pare

Io non sono nero
Io non sono bianco
Io non sono attivo
Io non sono stanco
Io non provengo da nazione alcuna
Io, sì, io vengo dalla luna

Perché ti fotto il lavoro
Perché ti fotto la macchina
O ti fotto la tipa sotto la luna
Cosa vuoi che sia poi
Non è colpa mia
Se la tua donna
Di cognome fa Pompilio come Numa
Dici che sono brutto
Che puzzo come un ratto
Ma sei un coatto
E soprattutto non sei

Non mi prende che di striscio
La tua fiction
E piscio sul tuo show
Che fila liscio come il Truman
Ho nostalgia della mia luna leggera
Ricordo una sera
Le stelle d'una bandiera ma
Era
Una speranza
Era
Una frontiera
Era
La primavera di una nuova era
Era
(Stupido ti riempiamo di ninnoli da subito
In cambio del tuo stato di libero suddito)

Non è stato facile per me
Trovarmi qui
Ospite inatteso
Peso indesiderato arreso
Complici satelliti che
Riflettono un benessere artificiale
Luna sotto la quale parlare d'amore

Scaldati in casa
Davanti al tuo televisore
La verità
Della tua mentalità
È che la fiction sia meglio
Della vita reale
Qui invece è imprevedibile
Qui non è frutto
Di qualcosa già scritto
Su un libro
Che hai già letto tutto
Ma io io io no io io io
