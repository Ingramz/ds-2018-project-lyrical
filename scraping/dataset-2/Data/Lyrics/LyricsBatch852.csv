Pimpinela,"Te quitaran del paso
Me pediran nombrarte
Me llevaran a otro lugar why que?
Aún bajo siete llaves
Tus fotos why tus cartas romperan
Pero nunca lo que yo siento por ti

Corazón gitano, no te olvidare
Corazón gitano, siempre te querre
Si creces tanto en mi vida, día tras día
Corazón gitano, todo sabe a ti
Corazón gitano, contigo yo aprendí
A subir hasta la luna, sin miedo a la locura

Un codigo secreto lleva tu amor why el mio
Levantará una mullara entre los dos
Why seguire contigo
Me llevaran al ultimo rincon
Why escribire tu nombre en la pared

Corazón gitano, no te olvidare
Corazón gitano, siempre te querre
Si creces tanto en mi vida, día tras día
Corazón gitano, todo sabe a ti
Corazón gitano, contigo yo aprendí
A subir hasta la luna, sin miedo a la locura

Corazón Gitano

Corazón gitano, no te olvidare
Corazón gitano, siempre te querre
Si creces tanto en mi vida, día tras día
Corazón gitano, todo sabe a ti
Corazón gitano, contigo yo aprendí
A subir hasta la luna, sin miedo a la locura

Corazón gitano, no te olvidare
Corazón gitano, siempre te querre
Si creces tanto en mi vida, día tras día
Corazón gitano, todo sabe a ti
Corazón gitano, contigo yo aprendí
A subir hasta la luna, sin miedo a la locura

Pimpinela,"Hoy han vuelto a mi mente
De un rincón del corazón
Los lugares y la gente
Que la vida se llevó

Y aunque el tiempo ha pasado
Aunque todo ya cambió
Siempre siguen a mi lado
Siempre siguen a mi lado
Siempre están donde estoy yo

Las cosas simples de la vida
Jamás se pueden olvidar
Y con el paso de los años

Se quieren cada día más
Trayéndonos esos recuerdos
Que sin querer te hacen llorar

Las cosas simples de la vida
Vuelven un día sin llamar
Trayéndonos esos recuerdos
Que sin querer te hacen llorar

Hoy ha vuelto a mi memoria
La nostalgia de tu amor

Las palabras, las historias
Que mi padre me dejó
Y aunque todo está tan lejos
Aunque todo ya pasó

Al mirarme en el espejo
Al mirarme en el espejo
Hoy los vi a mí alrededor

Las cosas simples de la vida
Jamás se pueden olvidar
Y con el paso de los años

Se quieren cada día más
Trayéndonos esos recuerdos
Que sin querer te hacen llorar

Las cosas simples de la vida
Vuelven un día sin llamar
Trayéndonos esos recuerdos
Que sin querer te hacen llorar

Pimpinela,"Señor Juez, Señor Juez
Esta carta es para usted
Mi mujer me ha dejado
Por una telenovela

Cuando llego a mi casa
Nunca huele a comida
Mi mujer siempre en el cuarto
Y la televisión prendida

Oye, soy yo
Hay panigassi de mi vida
Oye, soy yo
Hay panigassi de mi vida

No me habla, no me mira
No se baña, no cocina
Los niños tienen hambre
Al menor le dio un calambre

Se nos murió el perro
Se nos va a morir la abulea
Y en casa no hay quien pueda
Con la telenovela

Ho no, no hay quien pueda
Con la telenovela
Ho no, no hay quien pueda
Con la telenovela

Déjame que te la cuente
Ella está embarazada
Ese hijo no es suyo
Pero el no sabe nada

Por mi no se preocupé
No diré ni una palabra
Por un plato de comida
Y una cerveza bien helada

Si, un plato de comida
Y una cerveza bien helada
Se nos murió el perro
Se nos va a morir la abulea

Y en casa no hay quien pueda
Con la telenovela
Ho no, no hay quien pueda
Con la telenovela

Lamento yo decirle
Suicidarme ya no puedo
Porque tengo que saber
El final de la novela

Pimpinela,"Hace dos años y un día que vivo sin él
Hace dos años y un día que no lo he vuelto a ver
Y aunque no he sido feliz aprendí a vivir sin su amor
Pero al ir olvidando de pronto una noche volvió

¿Quién es?
Soy yo
¿Qué vienes a buscar?
A ti
Ya es tarde
¿Por qué?
Porque ahora soy yo la que quiere estar sin ti

Por eso vete, olvida mi nombre, mi cara, mi casa
Y pega la vuelta
Jamás te pude comprender
Vete, olvida mis ojos, mis manos, mis labios
Que no te desean
Estás mintiendo ya lo sé
Vete, olvida que existo, que me conociste, 
Y no te sorprendas, olvida de todo que tú para eso 
Tienes experiencia

En busca de emociones un día marché 
De un mundo de sensaciones que no encontré
Y al descubrir que era todo una gran fantasía volví
Porque entendí que quería las cosas que viven en ti

Adiós
Ayúdame
No hay nada más que hablar
Piensa en mí
Adiós
¿Por qué?
Porque ahora soy yo la que quiere estar sin ti

Por eso vete, olvida mi nombre, mi cara, mi casa
Y pega la vuelta
Jamás te pude comprender
Vete, olvida mis ojos, mis manos, mis labios
Que no te desean
Estás mintiendo ya lo sé
Vete, olvida que existo, que me conociste
Y no te sorprendas, olvida de todo que tú para eso

Pimpinela,"Con tristeza sin hablar
En aquel atardecer
Nos miramos sin llorar
Cuando ya partia el tren

No podia ser verdad
Se moria nuestro amor
Why yo sola en el anden
Aguantando el corazon

Con un nudo en la garganta
Te dije adios
Con el alma echa pedazos
Perdi tu amor

Con un nudo en la garganta
Te vi partir
Why al sentir que te alejabas
Pense en morir

No te quize lastimar
No era esa mi intencion
Yo queria solo amar
Tu querias el amor

Si pudiera olvidar
Algun dia este dolor
Pêro sigo estando aqui
Aguantando el corazon

Con un nudo en la garganta
Te dije adios
Con el alma echa pedazos
Perdi tu amor

Con un nudo en la garganta
Te vi partir
Why al sentir que te alejabas
Pense en morir

Aunque ya ha pasado
Mucho tiempo
Todavia sigo viendo tu imagen
En cada tren que parte
En cada tren que llega

Con un nudo en la garganta
Te dije adios
Con el alma echa pedazos
Perdi tu amor

Con un nudo en la garganta
Te vi partir
Why al sentir que te alejabas
Pense en morir

Pimpinela,"Porque aún queda la esperanza, porque nada está perdido
Porque aquellos que no escuchen el deseo de la gente
Morirán en el olvido

Por la fe de tu familia, por los sueños de tus hijos
Porque sobran las razones para continuar luchando
No hay que darse por vencido

Aguante campeón why tire pa´delante
Aguante campeón why tire pa´delante

Porque haya más trabajo, porque acabe la injusticia
Porque dejen de engañarnos why de una vez por todas
Nos devuelvan la sonrisa

Porque duele la impotencia, pero más duele el fracaso
Porque nada es para siempre, hoy debemos ser pacientes
Pero no bajar los brazos

Aguante campeón why tire pa´delante
Aguante campeón why tire pa´delante

Porque esto es urgente, porque se nos va la vida
Porque mientras que unos hablan hay millones de inocentes
Que se mueren cada día

Porque no estamos solos, porque somos mayoría
Porque hay más gente honesta, es que yo estoy segura
Que esto va a cambiar un día

Pimpinela,"Tú eres mi hermano del alma, realmente el amigo
Que en todo camino y jornada está siempre conmigo
Y aunque eres un hombre aún tienes alma de niño
Aquel que me da su amistad, su respeto y cariño

Recuerdo que juntos pasamos muy duros momentos
Y tú no cambiaste por fuertes que fueran los vientos
Es tu corazón una casa de puertas abiertas
Tú eres realmente más cierta en horas inciertas

En ciertos momentos difíciles que hay en la vida
Buscamos a quien nos ayude a encontrar la salida
Y aquella palabra de aliento y de fe que me has dado
Me da la certeza que siempre estuviste a mi lado

Tú eres mi amiga del alma en toda jornada
Sonrisa y abrazo festivo en cada llegada
Me dices verdades tan grandes con frases abiertas
Tú eres realmente más cierta en horas inciertas

No preciso ni decir todo esto que te digo
Pero si es bueno sentir que eres tú mi hermano amigo
Yo no preciso ni decir todo esto que te digo
Pero si es bueno sentir que eres tú mi hermano amigo

Pimpinela,"Sali-de casa contento diciendo que lindo dia
Yo saludaba a la gente why nadie me respondia
Why sin querer empuje a una senora que con voz de lora
Mirandome fijo me dijo, ""Idiota, no ve por donde camina""

Buena onda, buena onda
Que escriban cien veces los que rezongan

Volvi-a casa en la noche cansado why deprimido
Prendi-la tele why me dije, ""al fin un poco tranquilo
Why de repente casi muero de un infarto
Era mi senora que llena de crema salio gritando
""Donde te habi-as metido?""

Que viva la gente que tenga why ponga

Pimpinela,"Ella ponía alma y vida, miedo, vergüenza y resignación
El se encargaba de las heridas, de los insultos y humillación
Cuéntale al mundo lo que pasa, no calles más tanto dolor

Abre las puertas de tu alma, pide ayuda, por favor
Ella esperaba, día tras día, que algún milagro salve a los dos
El le marcaba la otra mejilla con la hebilla de un cinturón
Cuéntale al mundo lo que pasa, no calles más tanto dolor

Abre las puertas de tu alma, pide ayuda, por favor
Ella creía en sus promesas hasta que todo se derrumbó
Golpe tras golpe contra una mesa, perdió el hijo que nunca vio

Pimpinela,"Aunque me quede callada y sea indiferente
No te confundas conmigo, que no soy lo que parece
Todos tenemos secretos que no se pueden decir
Pero tú nunca te olvides que cuando vas, yo volví

Ojos que no ven
Corazón que presiente
Esto es así aunque lo niegue la gente

Ojos que no ven
Corazón que presiente
Esto es así y el corazón nunca miente

Te veo sólo de noche, es un misterio tu vida
Eres como un fantasma que entra y sale a escondidas
No sé por qué te sorprendes si siempre fuimos así
Siento algo últimamente, algo que nunca sentí

Ojos que no ven
Corazón que presiente
Esto es así aunque lo niegue la gente

Ojos que no ven

Mejor dejemos un tiempo, ella sospecha de mí
Hoy vivo sola y tranquila, tratando de ser feliz

Pimpinela,"Volvió de nuevo con la misma amenaza
Voy a marcharme esta noche de tu vida

Y en vez de hablarle y suplicarle como siempre
Mirándolo de frente le dije, ""Adiós, mi vida""
Se quedó tan confundido
Que no supo qué hacer

Cuando vi que se callaba como nunca me agrandé
Y le dije en la cara tantas veces, ""¡Márchate!""
Que de los nervios, al poco rato
Me empezó a lavar los platos

Ya lo ven, ya lo ven
Es como dice la gente
Ya lo ven, ya lo ven
Perro que ladra no muerde

Con el orgullo destrozado en mil pedazos
Me fui mirando para atrás por si volvía
Cuando de pronto escuché aquel portazo
Me dije, ""No hagas caso, ya volverá algún día""

La llamé un mes entero y no me quiso responder
Me citó una mañana y mientras iba yo pensé
Debe haberse arrepentido pero cuando al fin llegué
No había nadie, sólo una nota, ""En la calle está tu ropa""

Juntos nada nos puede

Sarna con gusto no pica
Amor sincero no muere
Solos no somos nada

Haciendo entre los dos un culto al egoísmo

No pidas que me ría en las mañanas
No pidas al mal tiempo buena cara

Si buscas señales de cariño
Pídeme un beso, con eso alcanza

No pidas que me vista de muñeca
No pidas que no use tu tarjeta
No quieras que me quede en la ventana
Esperando a que vuelvas tejiéndote calceta

No pidas que lo hagamos a diario
No pidas que me tire del armario
Ni que prenda fuegos artificiales

Pimpstress,"[3] - I'm going to vauco in my black seville
I follow two my behind a truck with half a mil
I make my first stop at my homeboys ranch 
I ask him ""what's in the bag"" he says ""two acres of plants
It's easy going in but hell gettin out
I want to make this paper and I think I know how
surprise surprise I done made it back home
in an ice cream truck ""who want to buy a snow cone""
  
Hook - repeat 2X

I'm going to the valley
Vauco the valley
I'm goin to the valley what you think fo
  
[4] - From Texas to Cali we get our ye from the valley
We be hustlin on blocks moving in and out the alley
We call it medicine that's what you need when you get sick
Sometimes it's hard rock sometimes it's white pearl brick
Across, across the state line just me and my girlfriend
From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks
  
[5] - Going back to the valley staying on top of my game
Meeting up wit my bitches snow white and mary jane
Only thing that ever mattered to me 
Stacking dollars shit we making a week
Who the cowards who the killas who's the niggas wit scrilla
Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me
  
[6] - Going to the valley fo' soldiers in a caddy 
And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking 
leaving you hoe ass niggas unhappy
Chopping burs when able, fucking hoes on the table
Watching cable in a Sable, Dope House is the label
Selling em three for ten to my closest friends
Rolling back to H-towm big body Benz
  
hook
  
[7] - Houston Texas cowboy wit a dime and a fiesta saddle
And I'm moving mo weight then a whole herd of cattle
I grip up the grain blowing up the panhandle
mobile phone on scramble cause rap hustlin is a gamble
Brick moving these H dudes gonna keep you grooving pursuing
Shit, hell on my surella ice water lyrical good fella
SPM got the hook up, say watch out 
I hit the highway, let twenkies crawl
I'm going to the valley
  
[8] - Man I'm flipping up to Mexico to hit some licks
In a Navigator bus bringing back some bricks
Get to checkpoint now I'm past the border
tell my guy alemar to play some more
Fat money cause we in the mix
I got that white girl and that stinky bitch
Better ryders and roamers can't really ask 
""We going out T?"" ""Bitch I'm headed to the valley
So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride
Chunk a deuce to the guys and I'm back to Southside
Cruisin wit a couple of pines
Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house
  
[9] - Cruisin to the valley checking up on me campos
Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green
My windows are tinted so nobody sees in it
Wit mary jane and snow white the sky's the limit
  
Hook

[10] - My package is small, stack em in the entire wall
Fuck the chotha must be loca
Everything a nigga want make it to the border wit the motha
Pockets rising better quit sizing me up
But these coffe beans fucking the smell up
What's up, back in the city 
de bull lada I'm talking pronto
Call me the head honcho start a new revloution
like a back poncho 
He yah see yah wouldn't want to be yah
Gots to flee, start the G
Switch the ride I'm headed back to the valley
  
[11] - Get um up hit em up
They want to know what it is all about
They way that we roll down south
Start baby wit dope house josie wells gonna 
there ain't nuthin funna then being and outlaw runna 
stunna pimpin in a humma millennium smuggler
Dope game juggla, no nuts no glory
Real mobsters, they never worry
but we ain't home yet so don't get happy
we ain't paid Officer O'Malley
Thinking of my profits going to the valley 
It's all cavi
  
[12] - I'm flipping to the valley federalies
Fucking wit michael decodie motorcycles
?? cruises my disciples 
I'm the type to crew smoke two and synas
wit my G's I'll hunt you 
like Arnold hunts Sarah Connors
Primadonnas big tymers, playa, and rob reports
benz sports,courts, naked hoes, lascivious resorts
I get short my last resort tell L
to keep the Cali cause little down wit his essays 
parlaying down in the valley
  
Hook
  
[13] - I'm a creep 59
to the end of the rainbow land of the llello
Dope fiends on my payroll, got rocks to blow
behind the stop and go they holla 
goodness graious great balls of snow
Don't speed or trip when you see the lights
cause they can tell you're nervous just by looking in your eyes
in H-Town the business in booming
but it won't last long if you don't know what you're doing
  
[14] - Yeundo pal el valle in a nice Expedition
Got me creepin for mi ruka and my boys blowing swishas
Mcallen brownsville harlingen
six hour trip to get my endz
I'm out to get my Benz
on the lean coming clean
lean man flashing green
el meadow meadow meadow
???
thendo vact is none stop
daily stackes to the top
???
keep my hoes by the flock
  
[15] - Who rides like me come wrapped that tightly
L be's moving by the ton
Packed up in tanks under the trunk, 59 to 77 
Collecting my lot not even sweating, back on 35
wit my cheeder just gettin mine
You know me your boy O-Z
Never left lonely wit out my G see
One trip cocks a flip 
The way I flip multiplies a chip
I'm steady ?? cash flow
Transactions stacking paper rolls
The currency connect from Houston to the valley

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I play rock guitar but I'm not that great
I like to go on dates and I like to stay up late
I live in San Francisco and hangin' on the Haight

Do you like the Golden Gate? I did when I was eight
Maybe I can come and visit? Maybe you should wait
See, I'm really forty-seven, I have kids and a wife
I weigh three hundred pounds and I hate my life

Are you serious? Yes, well, I've got a secret too
I'm not twenty, I'm really thirty-two
I only have one leg and I like to sniff glue

Behind the monitor truth is hidden from your eyes
Marcus didn't know but he was in for a surprise

we've been dating for a while but let's cut to the chase
I don't know what you look like and I wanna see your face
But what does it matter? You know who I am inside
What if you're not a woman and this whole time you lied?

You got me there, I'm not really a female
I'm a guy who pretends to be a girl through email

But I'm not buying, I'm not buying,
I'm not buying their incentives, their lies,
Their empty promises -- just chains in disguise
-- while we let them steal away our very lives!

Tell me why there's still a 40 hour work week
While unemployment's on the rise?
Why do we keep overproducing
But still it's hard just to survive?
Why does ""surplus"" food rot
While hungry people die??

We're stripped of human dignity,
Forced to live in poverty,
'cause in this land of the free
Our ""freedom"" is all fake.
We're wage slaves to the company,
Land slaves to the property,
And tax slaves to the economy
Of the capitalist state!

It's illegal to squat or live on the street,
But rent is extortion when you have to pay to sleep...
But I'm not buying it. ..

We're just endentured servants
Living on the master's land,
Serfs trying to buy back
Our freedom on the lay-away plan...
But I'm not buying, I'm not buying, I'm not buying

I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth  not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone

Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of gray

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before times took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
When friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some in a tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever",High Hopes [Edit Version][Version],

Blown on the steel breeze.

Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon

Don't touch me child
Please, know you drive me wild
Please you know, I'm feeling frail

Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know why
Very, very, very frail

Oh, my girl sitting in the sun
Go buy candy and a currant bun
I like to see you run

In the shadow under the trees
Down by a stream in a hollow

For the white King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight

They let him in by a back way
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read

Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
And this is what she told the gathered round

Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint take all the white
Make up a newborn color
Cover your neighbor we'll be all right

In a smile I saw a single eagle in the sky
Wheeling, soaring, gliding high
On a hill there lived a man with many shining things
Shiny gold, shiny car and shiny diamond rings
Wining, dining, shining king
Now the eagle flies in clear blue skies
Drinking in the clear blue well
Back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies
But fifty more come rolling off the floor production line
Then a man commuting like a village on the sand
In his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land
Screaming, dealing, movie man
Here we go, hold your breath to see if something blows
Close your eyes, count till ten and see the sunrise rise
Gliding high into the sky
By the holy mansion, let the guardian rise
Upon the finger of the king
On high the eagle flies, that glitter all of gold
Then wheeling in a cloudy sky, he flies into the sun",Crumbling Land,1970

Perhaps the price is just too steep.
Is your conscience at rest 
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start 
To just the beating of your heart.
Just one man beneath the sky,
Just two ears, just two eyes.

You set sail across the sea 
Of long past thoughts and memories.
Childhood's end, your fantasies 
Merge with harsh realities.
And then as the sail is hoist,
You find your eyes are growing moist.
All the fears never voiced 
Say you have to make your final choice.

Who are you and who am I 
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die 
Beneath one infinite sky.
There'll be war, there'll be peace.

All the proud men turned to dust.

Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired

It was, I recall
In the form of a scroll
With gold leaf adorned
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away

And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed
With his own rubber stamp
It was dark all around
There was frost in the ground
When the tigers broke free
And no one survived
From the Royal Fusiliers Company Z

They were all left behind
Most of them dead
The rest of them dying

Took my daddy from me",When the Tigers Broke Free,1983

Memories come rushing up to meet me now

I had a dream

Goodbye Max
Goodbye Ma
After the service
When you're walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold november air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream

A place to stay
[Bloke:] ""Oi! A real one...""
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And what's more
No-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue
Kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no-one kills the children anymore

As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord

Using words you will find are strange
And mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change

Now sleeps the swan

It's falling, in a golden door

The early morning sounds
And I go down

Touch the sky

With your nerves in tatters

He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be

There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words

You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. 
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. 

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. 

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking 
Racing around to come up behind you again. 
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, 
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle",Introduction,2008

Pink Floyd,"""Icy wind of nights be gone this is not your domain”
In the sky a bird is heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea","Grantchester Meadows [Live BBC Radio Session, 12 May 1969] [Live]",2016
Pink Floyd,"Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White was the light 
That shines through the dress that you wore

She lay in the shadow of a wave
Hazy were the visions overplayed
Sunshine in her eyes 
But moonshine made her cry everytime

Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye
Deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between
The hopefull and the damned","Green Is the Colour [Live BBC Radio Session, 12 May 1969] [Live]",2016
Pink Floyd,"It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here 
And I'm much obliged to you for making it clear 
That I'm not here
And I never knew we could be so thick 
And I never knew the moon could be so blue 
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes 
And brought me here instead dressed in red 
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song

I don't care if the sun don't shine 
And I don't care if nothing is mine 
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you 
I'll do my loving in the winter

And the sea isn't green 
And I love the queen 
And what exactly is a dream 
And what exactly is a joke",Jugband Blues [2010 Mix],2016
Pink Floyd,"Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
A drink, a drink, a drink, a drink

What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been
Far away
Away, away, away, away, away, away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do, I can't think what to say
She sees through anyway
Away, away, away, away, away, away

Out of the front door I go
Traffic's moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be
Be, a-be, a-be, a-be, a-be, a-be
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room

So fuck Ill, you can be the illest
See how many real niggaz feel it
I don't ever plan to go back to the streets, it's cold
Back to work with a mother fuckin' week in a hole
Lost with blind motivation, I ain't a thug
I'd rather be Royce five-apostrophe, nine-quotation
So how you love that nigga, the game done changed
You got a problem on your hands and this a nigga with brains
Yeah

Sinking halfway to the bottom

So I curl up in a ball
And cry in the comfort of my home

I don't know why
I feel like shit
I say I'm fine but I'm not fine

I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide
All my deepest feelings

And all I see are demons
I try to hide all my deepest feelings

I think there's something wrong with me
'Cause all I see is death

I look like I've been doing meth
And I sleep for nineteen hours on a Thursday afternoon
And every now and then I cough up blood
And I don't know what to do

I don't know why
I feel like shit
I will not see a therapist

If you wanna fucking kill yourself 
Put your fucking hands up (yeah!), 
Razor blades in the air everybody (yeah!)

Pink Martini,"Brazil, when stars were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured someday soon
We kissed and clung together

The morning found us miles away
With still a million things to say

And now when twilight dims the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I am certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil

And let forever, begin tonight

That I heard in plays
I was acting a part.

But now when I whisper
Amado mio?,
Can't you tell I care
By the feeling there
Cause it comes from my heart

I want you ever
I love my darling
Wanting to hold you
And hold you tight

But all, will you ever know what you are?

There is a place where only you alone go
There is a world that only you alone know

Along an endless balcony
Above the Adriatic Sea
I try to storm the Kremlin of your heart
In Florence, we were on the mend
But that Mazurka had to end
We missed the naked trees of Gorky Park

But all, will you ever know what you've lost?

So I took the train to see you there
Your wife is sweet and you're well fed
Your daughter, tucked away in bed
Still you looked at me with great despair
I hear snow is falling on Red Square

So I have invented my own
Darling, this place is a lover's oasis
Where life's weary chase is unknown

Far from the cry of the city
Where flowers, pretty, caress the streams
Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in
Don't let it abide in my dreams

Picture me upon your knee
Just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me alone
Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends and relations on weekend vacations
We won't have it known that we have a telephone

Dear, day will break, you'll awake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For to take, for all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you and a girl for me
Can't you see how happy we would be?

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself, this could be heaven or
This could be hell?
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the hotel California
Any time of year, you can find it here

Her mind is tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls
Friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the captain, please bring me my wine?
He said, we haven?t had that spirit here since
Nineteen sixty nine?
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They living? it up at the hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said we are all just prisoners here, of our
Own device?
And in the masters chambers, they gathered for the
Feast
The stab it with their steely knives, but they just
Can't kill the beast

I had to find the passage back to the place I was
Before

Just across the muddy water from the Carolina side 
They say home is a place you go where they have to take you in
I don't know if it's really so but I'm goin' back down again 

Oh Augusta take me in
Oh Augusta take me in 

Savannah river from the overpass
Shinin' bright in the mornin' light
Like a fire in a whiskey glass 
I can hear the sirens clear cross the water and around the bend
And I can see that's it's gonna be a little hard to make amends 

Oh Augusta take me in
Oh Augusta take me in
'Cause I just can't seem to win
Oh Augusta take me in 

Now I'm standin' on the shoulder, of Sandbar Ferry road
Starin' down at the same old ground that I used to walk before
The only change is I'm a stranger now, but I remember when
There was a time when I swore I'd die before I'd ever come back again

Oh Augusta take me in
Oh Augusta take me in
'Cause I'm goin' back down again
Oh Augusta take me in
(No and I can't win)
Oh Augusta take me in
(Goin' down, down again)

Well there's a black train a rolling through the hills of Tennessee
Taking my baby so far away from me
Oh black train, my baby?s on that black train
Kiss me goodbye to the lonesome whistle strain
Then disappear down the line, on that black train
Said she didn't know if she loved me anymore
Needed some time away to know for sure
Oh black train, my baby?s on that black train
Kiss me goodbye to the lonesome whistle strain
Then disappear down the line, on that black train
Nobody knows just where my baby went
Three lonely years oh and I ain't seen her since
Oh black train, my baby?s on that black train
Kiss me goodbye to the lonesome whistle strain
Then disappear down the line, on that black train
Kiss me goodbye to the lonesome whistle strain

She knows how to stoke a man's desire
She lead you down a path of burning coals

Sweet temptation calling me once more
I swore I wouldn't give in like before
But here I am knocking on the devil's front door

My name sounds like heaven on her lips
But hell ain't far from her forbidden kiss

Give me one good reason why

Sometimes it's like coal

Sometimes it's like jail
Now I don't always know what love is
But I know this love is fine, this love is fine
We ought to get a little, a little bit closer
No I don't always know what love is

Con quel sorriso di plastica 
Mentre fai la ginnastica 
Io per lei 
Ho due occhi da bambino 
Se sei tu il mio destino 
Allora portami via 
Io per lei 
Ho deciso di cambiare 
Di smettere di rovinare 
Sempre tutto per colpa della solitudine 
Di questa solitudine",Io Per Lei,1998

Sorride e non ti dice la sua età

Pino Daniele,"Generale dietro la collina
Ci sta la notte cruccia e assassina
E in mezzo al prato c'è una contadina
Curva sul tramonto sembra una bambina
Di cinquant'anni e di cinque figli
Venuti al mondo come conigli
Partiti al mondo come soldati
E non ancora tornati
 
Generale dietro la stazione
Lo vedi il treno che portava al sole
Non fa più fermate neanche per pisciare
Si va dritti a casa senza più pensare
Che la guerra è bella anche se fa male
Che torneremo ancora a cantare
E a farci fare l'amore, l'amore dalle infermiere
 
Generale la guerra è finita
Il nemico è scappato, è vinto, è battuto
Dietro la collina non c'è più nessuno
Solo aghi di pino e silenzio e funghi
Buoni da mangiare buoni da seccare
Da farci il sugo quando viene Natale
Quando I bambini piangono
E a dormire non ci vogliono andare
 
Generale queste cinque stelle
Queste cinque lacrime sulla mia pelle
Che senso hanno dentro al rumore di questo treno
Che è mezzo vuoto e mezzo pieno
E va veloce verso il ritorno
Tra due minuti è quasi giorno, è quasi casa, è quasi amore",Generale,2002

e chiudi dolcemente gli occhi tuoi
vedrai che la tristezza passera'

Voglio star con te
baciare le tue labbra dirti che
in questo tempo dove tutto passa
dove tutto cambia
noi siamo ancora qua

E non abbiam bisogno di parole
per spiegare quello
che e' nascosto
in fondo al nostro cuore
ma ti sollevero'
tutte le volte che cadrai
e raccogliero' i tuoi fiori
che per strada perderai
e seguiro' il tuo volo

e' stare insieme a te
senza catene
stare insieme a te

Vieni piu' vicino
e sciogli i tuoi capelli

il sole ti accarezza
ti accarezzo anch'io
e tu sei una rosa rossa

Vieni piu' vicino
accendi questo fuoco amore mio
e bruceranno tutte le paure
adesso lasciati andare

Sulle panchine in Piazza Grande
Ma quando ho fame di mercanti come me qui non ce n'è

Dormo sull'erba e ho molti amici intorno a me
Gli innamorati in Piazza Grande
Dei loro guai dei loro amori tutto so, sbagliati e no

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
A modo mio avrei bisogno di sognare anch'io

Una famiglia vera e propria non ce l'ho
E la mia casa è Piazza Grande
A chi mi crede prendo amore e amore do, quanto ne ho

Con me di donne generose non ce n'è
Rubo l'amore in Piazza Grande
E meno male che briganti come me qui non ce n'è

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
Avrei bisogno di pregare Dio
Ma la mia vita non la cambierò mai mai
A modo mio quel che sono l'ho voluto io

Lenzuola bianche per coprirci non ne ho
Sotto le stelle in Piazza Grande
E se la vita non ha sogni io li ho e te li do

E se non ci sarà più gente come me
Voglio morire in Piazza Grande
Tra i gatti che non han padrone come me attorno a me

Fuori qualcuno urlava scendi sotto ti offro un tiro
E suona il cellulare
È l’ennesimo attacchino
Da sempre qualche infame dà il mio numero in giro
Fa parte del gioco ci sono I pro e I contro
Al mondo
Niente è gratis dico pronto, pago il conto
Guardo lo specchio senza ribrezzo
Con gli anni che ho ammetto adesso
Potrei dare un prezzo a quello che ho
Pensavo bastasse il rock’n’ roll
Bastasse l’instabilità
E invece anch’io ho scadenze tasse e responsabilità
Così la vita assomiglia a quella di mio papà
Ora capisco ho una famiglia
Se sto disco non va non mangerà
Non sono quello che magari ti aspettavi tu
Che mi hai giudicato dai tre minuti che hai visto in tv
A volte mi sento la cavia dei vostri tabù
Ma non pensiate che sia quello che voglio io

Voglio di più di gossip e mode
Di quello che vedi sesso e banconote
Voglio di più di un tormentone
Di questi anni amari di groupies e droghe
Sai che non striscerò per farmi valere
Vivrò così cercando un senso anche per te

Ieri mi sono alzato alle quattro del mattino
Dopo i concerti dormo male chiudo gli occhi e li rivivo
E suona il cellulare la mia band è ancora in giro
Il concerto è stato uguale a me
Tutto esaurito
Sembra impossibile il mondo gira sul mio dito
Ed è incredibile se penso a quanti mi prendono in giro
O se penso a quanti mi credono un mito
Ma io ho capito senza lei io sarei solo col mio oro un fallito
E anch’io ho scadenze e responsabilità
Ma questa vita è facile confronto a quella di papà
E meno male perché quel coraggio non l’avrei
Dopo due anni andrei al lavoro col cannone e sparerei
Non sono quello che magari ti aspettavi tu
Uguale a 100 altri cantanti che vedi in tv
Non voglio il posto da sciamano della trend tribù
O quello da santone o dell’esempio di virtù io

Voglio di più di gossip e mode
Di quello che vedi sesso e banconote
Voglio di più di un tormentone

Voglio di più di un tormentone
Di questi anni amari di groupies e droghe
Sai che non striscerò per farmi valere
Vivrò così cercando un senso anche per te

E cerco un senso
Perché quello che mi date è vecchio
Non ci credo

Più mi mette al centro

There must be a God

Pino Donaggio,"Siamo qui noi soli
Come ogni sera
Ma tu sei più triste
Ed io lo so
Perché

Forse tu vuoi dirmi
Che non sei felice
Che io sto cambiando
E tu mi vuoi lasciar

Io che non vivo
Più di un'ora senza te
Come posso stare una vita
Senza te
Sei mia
Sei mia
Mai niente lo sai
Separarci un giorno potrà

Vieni qui, ascoltami
Io ti voglio bene
Te ne prego fermati
Ancora insieme a me
Io che non vivo
Più di un'ora senza te
Come posso stare una vita
Senza te
Sei mia

Io che non vivo
Più di un'ora senza te
Come posso stare una vita
Senza te

Pino Gioia,"Io così sai, non ti ho vista mai 
Splendida come tu adesso sei 
Cosa c'è? 
Quale luce lì nel fondo palpita 
Saperlo io vorrei 
Come mai la tua serenità 
È indecifrabile come la verità 
Ma chi c'è? 
Dietro quel sorriso enigmatico 
Capir di più vorrei
Dimmelo 

Monna Lisa sai 
Monna Lisa non dirmelo mai 
Ho paura che ne soffrirei troppo 
Chiunque sia non è 
Chi può mettersi mai fra di noi 
Fa che sia per te un sogno di troppo 
Libera tu sei 
Libera se vuoi 
Ma se tu vorrai 
Potrai dimenticarlo 

Sembra che tu sia al di là di noi 
Un'isola persa nel mare ormai 
Dove sei? 
Lontana sembri quasi irraggiungibile 
Capir di più vorrei 
Dimmelo 

Monna Lisa sai 
Monna Lisa non dirmelo mai 
Ho paura che ne soffrirei troppo 
Chiunque sia non è 
Chi può mettersi mai fra di noi 
Fa che sia per te un sogno di troppo 
Libera tu sei 
Libera se vuoi 
Ma se tu vorrai 
Potrai dimenticarlo",Come Monna Lisa,2011
Pino Palladino,"Well, it's up in the mornin'
Everybody off and runnin'
Everybody got some place to be
Some people never go walkin'
Some people just stop talkin'
And I was slippin' away
You came and pulled me through
I want to stay in the land of the living with you

I want to stay in the land of the living
I want to stay here with you
I want to stay in the land of the living
I want to stay here with you

We work and we worry
This old world's in such a hurry
So many things we just don't see
Some people always cryin'
Some people just stop tryin'
And I was slippin' away
You came and pulled me though
I want to stay in the land of the living with you

We got to do what we can about all this pain and sorrow
But try to live just a little
We could all be gone tomorrow
When I look at you girl, my heart rejoices
You taught me somethin':
Considering the choices

I want to stay in the land of the living
I want to stay here with you
I want to stay in the land of the living
I want to stay here with you",Land of the Living,1984
Pino Palladino,"You can make money, you can make good
Friends
You can make mistakes and you can make
Amends
You can make it easy when push comes to
Shove, but
You can't make love
You can make advances, you can make
Big plans
Plant sloppy kisses all over her hands
You can tell her everything you're dreamin'
Of, but
You can't make love
Love's a little word that been kicked around
Used too much, beaten down
What in the world are you thinkin' of? 
You can't make love
You can go through the motions with your
Magic spells
Buy all the potions that fifth avenue sells
You can try to call down all the stars above,
But
You can't make love
You can buy her diamonds, you can go out in style
You can make a promise, you can walk
Down the aisle
You can make a life for her that fits like
A glove, but
You can' t make love
Oh, it takes so long
You gotta be strong
Before it's gone
What in the world where you thinkin' of,
Boy
You can't make love",You Can't Make Love,1984
Pino Palladino,"Locos por saber, locos por sentir, 
cambiamos el tiempo del porvenir,
seres que al pensar que al adivinar hemos seducido, 
hemos despertado
otras generaciones.
Fuentes que al hablar sin dudar jamás hemos predecido, 
hemos anunciado
otras revelaciones.
Osea, amamos la libertad, somos dueños de un mismo lenguaje,
la fuerza va en nuestra edad, vamos juntos en el mismo viaje.
Oye, así es la vida, disfrútala.

Pino Palladino,"De repente cuando te enamoras 
va escapando el sueño en un segundo,
todo aquello que era tan difícil se te vuelve fácil.
Ahora sabes que ha sucedido.
Cuantas veces te conté mi vida 
why otras tantas me diste consejos,
que hoy no sé lo que te digo amiga, es algo que
no estaba escrito en el guión de nuestra vida.
(estribillo)
Tiempo al tiempo se verá si es amor o no,
tiempo al tiempo, o un capricho del corazón, 
tiempo al tiempo.
Todo cambia tan deprisa, todo es de distinto color
te das cuenta nuestro destino será tan sencillo, 
complicado
que hoy lo vamos a lograr, 
sólo tu, sólo yo, esta vez es así,
nuestra historia de amor empieza ahora aquí.
Con un beso cerca de tus labios 
has cambiado amigo por amante
why aunque quieras caminar despacio 
nada es como antes.
why ahora sabes que ha sucedido.

Pino Palladino,"
Sip a glass of cold champagne wine
The rug that we lie on feels divine
And there's no parallel for we two
Ecstasy the word of the night
Ringing in our ears, we're inflight
There's no substitution
For what we have
No others can have

There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
No-one could ever have 
What we have
There's nothing like this

The lightest conversation has its flow
Aural communication don't you know
And I feel quite content right now
Stick with me and we'll make history
An exclusive pair in love we will be
There's no substitution 
For what we have
No others can have

There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
Not even remotely like this

Pino Presti,"Adesso arriva lui 
Apre piano la porta 
Poi si butta sul letto 
E poi e poi 

Ad un tratto io sento 
Afferrarmi le mani 
Le mie gambe tremare 
E poi e poi e poi e poi 
Spegne adagio la luce
La sua bocca sul collo 
Ha il respiro un po' caldo 
Ho deciso lo mollo, 
Ma non so se poi farlo 
O lasciarlo soffrire 
L'importante è finire 

Adesso volta la faccia 
Questa è l'ultima volta che lo lascio morire 
E poi e poi 
Ha talento da grande lui 
Nel fare l'amore 
Sa pigliare il mio cuore 
E poi e poi e poi e poi 
Ha il volto sconvolto 
Io gli dico ti amo 
Ricomincia da capo 
È violento il respiro
Io non so se restare 
O rifarlo morire

The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf

Long ago there were three pigs
Little handsome piggy wigs
For the big, bad the very big, very bad wolf
They did not give three figs

Number one was very gay
And he built his house with hay
With a hey hey toot he blew on his flute
And he played around all day

Now number two was fond of jigs
And so he built his house with twigs
Hey, diddle diddle he played on his fiddle
And danced with lady pigs

Number three said, ""Nix on tricks
I shall build my house with bricks""
He had no chance to sing or dance
'Cause work and play don't mix

Came the day when fate did frown
And a wolf blew into town
With a gruff huff puff, he puffed just enough
And the hay house fell right down

One and two were scared to death
Of the big bad wolf's breath
By the hair of your chinny chin I'll blow you in
And the twig house answered yes

No one left but number three
To save that piglet family
So when they knocked, he fast unlocked
And said come in with me

Now they all were safe inside
But the bricks hurt wolf's pride
So, he slid down the chimney and oh, by Jiminey
In a fire he was fried

Oh, oh, oh, the three little free little pigs

Pinto Colvig/Mary Moder/Dorothy Compton/Billy Bletcher,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?,1994

Your the answer when I prayed
I will find someone 
And baby I found you

All I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart
From being broken apart
You gave your love away
And I'm thankful everyday
For the gift

What I'd give if I could keep

You'll still be beautiful

Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it.
Finding beauty in the dissonance.
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any
Sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers/brothers",Schism,2001
Pip Pyle,"I can tell like the ring of a bell
A chime that is clear and true
But if a crack, the sound is flat
Like happiness that's become untrue

Out of the East, the sun flew West
Trailing its golden spray
My heart burns, when fortune turns
The trail to light my way

Days go by, I watch the sky
My eyes forever quest
The sun returns, though my hope yearns
Forever things point the rest

Sun heart burns, moon glow turns
Stars will trade hope for happiness
Hope for happiness, happiness, happiness

Flowers grow wild, just for the child
Sniff this sprinkling bloom
When you grow up, hope colours up
The things that cause us gloom

Tell can you now how fun is made?
It's how happiness is really found
Look for advice, be told more than twice
By people all around

Sun heart burns, moon glow turns
Stars will trade hope for happiness
Hope for happiness, happiness, happiness",Hope for Happiness,2005
Pipe Band,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me. 
I once was lost but now I'm found, 
Was blind but now I see. 

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fear relieved 
How precious did that grace appear, 
The hour I first believed. 

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
And grace will lead us home. 

When we've been there ten thousand years 
Bright shining as the sun; 
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,
Pipedown,"Stay, stay focused
There's no time to be outside yourself
Don't let them ever tell you
You can't acknowledge doubt

I think we've had enough
Make me sick 'til I've had enough

Hate, pain
Things I'd like to live without
But now the demons in me
Are there and they won't come out
They are the ones that keep you, distract you
From your home
And while you're filled with anger
You will only stand alone

I think we've had enough
Make me sick 'til I've had enough

Don't waste away
The ends not far away
Don't kid yourself
Your hatred lies with no one else - no

But always please remember

Pipedream,"There's a place in my heart
That I go when I dream
A place that nobody can see
Every night I see love
I see someone who's waiting
Waiting for someone like me
He must be out there
Somewhere, someone for me

Tell me how long
‘Till I'm not just dreaming
How long, ‘til somebody cares
How long, ‘til I meet an angel
And give him my heart,
When can I start
How long ‘till I fall in love

I sit every night
By my window just wishing
And searching for one perfect star
Can anyone hear me
Dunno if you're listening
Please send him right here
To my arms
He must be out there
Somewhere, waiting for me

Tell me just how long, will it be...

Tell me how long
‘Till I'm not just dreaming
How long, ‘til somebody cares
How long, ‘til I meet an angel
And give him my heart,
When can I start
How long ‘till I fall in love

I've always believed
That my dreams would come true
That one of these nights
He would appear
He'd be here in my arms
I see it all, so clearly
How it could be
I wish he was kissing me now...

Tell me how long (how long)
Till I'm not just dreaming
How long, ‘til somebody cares (‘til somebody cares)
How long, ‘til I meet an angel (my angel...)
And give him my heart (heart...)
When can I start
How long ‘till I fall in love (in love...)

Piper,"Happy Birthday. So make a wish.

Please accept my apologies, I wonder what would have been.
Would you have been a little angel or an angel of sin?
Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys.
Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes.
I paid for the murder before they determined the sex,
Choosing our life over your life meant your death.
And you never got a chance to even open your eyes,
Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life.
Would you have been a little genius? In love with math?
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad?
Would you have been a little rapper like your poppa The Piper?
Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters?
I wonder about your skin tone and shape of your nose,
And the way you would've laughed and talked fast or slow.
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen.
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would've been.

Happy Birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed

I made a mistake

I got a million excuses, as to why you died.
And other people got their own reasons for homicide.
Who's to say it would've worked and who's to say it wouldn't have
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad.
The fear of being my father has never disappeared,
I ponder it frequently while I'm sippin' on my beer.
My vision of a family was artificial and fake
So when it came time to create, I made a mistake.
But now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you.
Maybe you really forgave us knowing we were confused.
Maybe, every time that he smiles it's you proudly knowing
That your father's doing the right thing now.
I'll never tell a woman what to do with her body,
But if she don't love children, then we can't party.
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen.
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would've been.

Happy Birthday
What I thought was a dream

In a place without time and space. Happy birthday.

Prometo no llamarte más y no inventar ni mentir
Prometo no seguir viviendo así
Prometo no pensar en ti

Prometo que a partir de ahora lucharé por cambiar
Prometo que no me verás, que no voy a molestar

Que no voy a fallarte en nada
Que tengo mucha fuerza de voluntad
Que no te fallaré en nada

Pirate Robot Midget,"You and I - we may look the same
But we are very far apart
There's bullet-holes where my compassion used to be
And there is violence in my heart

Into fire you can send us
From the fire we return
You can label us a consequence
Of how much you have to learn

You can try, but you'll never understand
This is something you will never understand
Can you hear it now?
Hear it coming now?
Can you hear it now?

On hands and knees
We crawl
You cannot stop us all
Our bones, our skin
We will not let you in

You have set something in motion
Much greater than you've ever known
Standing there in all your grand naivety
About to reap what you have sown

Time will feed upon your weaknesses
And soon you'll lose the will to care
When you return to the place that you call home
We will be there, we will be there

On hands and knees
We crawl
You cannot stop us all
Our blood will stay
We will not go away

On hands and knees

You can not stop us all
Our blood, our ways
Will never leave this place

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

How can we be friends, if we can't be lovers

A kick, a punch no more

Two years I gave in and I did not sway
And I swore to my family I'd keep it that way
Saved by the good Lord and hurt in their eyes
But life would back splatter and I compromise
If heartache won't kill you, you find something that will
And it turns out this battle is only uphill

Look up in the sky.
It's a bird it's a plane.
Nah baby girl,
That's a shootin star with your name.
I ain't gonna lie,
I've told a lot of lies and played a lot of games
But with you it's not the same.
For you, I'm'ma ride.
I want you by my side,
I feel like them ghetto boys. (She playin with my mind)
I'm'ma tell you one more time. (She playin with my mind)
For you I'm'ma grind.
You were there through the pain.
You stood right by me, thanks to you I survived.
I guess it's true what they say,
Love is blind.
We together til the day that we die.
Until death do us part.
Baby you my heart,
They can take all the houses and the cars.
But they'll never take my superstar.

I love just who you are,
I ain't gon' try to change ya.
You are a shooting Star,
That's why you are my favorite.
(x2)

Shake that.
Move that.
(x2)
Shake that. (x2)
Move that.
Shake that.

I love just who you are,
I ain't gon' try to change ya.
You are a shooting Star,
That's why you are my favorite.

Pitbull,"We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Man, I’ve been on the grind, 
One in the head, sixteen in the nine
I’m extra man! The game is mine, in due time 
It’s all right, I’m patient man!
I know how to play my position, I know how to play my part
I know how to play these bitches, I know how to play with they hearts
I’ve done some dumb things, but for the most, 
I’ve played it smart
Who cares if you run things
Cuz I’m as live as one O six and park!

But a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks!
Only the strong survive, it’s do or die
Get it right! That’s why I roll for my peoples!
Cock back, go to war with my peoples! 
Break bread with my peoples!
Man I’ll die for my peoples!

That’s why they respect 
Everything that I do
Everywhere that I go
Every fiend, every foe
Every bitch, every hoe
Man I sold it all!

From the X to the blow
Mark my words I’m next to blow!
P to the I, I to the T, T to the B, B to the U, double the L!

Man I’m watching the game closely
Uncle Luke that man done coached me 
He told me the who, what, where’s, and why’s 
How to cross T’s, how to dot I’s 
Little did he know he created a monster!
Pitbull nigga, I’m that monster!
DB, them chico’s is monsters! 
Lil’ Jon, that nigga is a monster!
Everybody in the click is well equipped
Ready for pit to take over shit!
This here is not a game, this here is our lives…
We can’t fuck this up, we gotta get it right
If you wit us and you ready for war
Then let’s ride!

Let’s show ‘em how we do in the south
Kick in they door, run in they house
Since them boys think they spit fire
Fuck it! put the gun in they mouth!
Follow me now
All these bitches wanna swallow me now!
All these niggas that I don’t even know
Wanna holla at me now
Cuz the wanna be down
But fuck ’em man!
Me I turn it up a notch 
To my hustlers be careful when they murdering the block!
To my killers be careful when you burning up the glock!
Last thing you wanna be is running from the cops

Haters can hate, but it aint ‘gon stop!
Everybody knows I’m blow just listen to the flow
This chico got it on lock! ha!

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold Diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 1)
I'm in the cut in the club
Scopin the scene
Cup half way full
Smokin the green
She got her hand on my nuts
What does that mean?
Pointed at her friend
And she said, they'll tag team
Now who said dreams don't come true
Its like I'm dreamin
When I come through
I always find something to run through
Speak into the mike mami
Mic check one two
Drunk in the club
Off the chain
But who gives as fuck?
That's why I came
So pour it up
And get down
Ya'll have no choice
But to listen to Pit now

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 2)
Everybody knows
Pit's got tight raps
When I'm in the club
DJs bring it back
With no questions asked
But the number one question is
""Does he got cash?""
Lil Jon's at the bar
While me and them eastside boys smoke out
Roll another one
No doubt
Get a couple hoes
Roll out
Beef, you don't want none
To go down
dumb diddy dumb dumb
My times now
The city I'm from
Is covered with federals
That'll make your crew run run
Your crew run run
Its next to come

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 3)
I convince mami to creep on the DL
Even though my head spinning
Like some sprewells
Skip the details
Its the vodka bottom line
that's testin my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
Or those chains or that ice or them cars
All that's bullshit
If that's what your lookin for
Keep lookin hoe
Cause you got the wrong one bitch
I'll let you know
Mami's like damn
That Cuban's shot out
Bitch I came to the club
To wild out
If you came to act up
Then you need to get from me bitch
And back up

Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)

With the coke and blow dirty, we're off the chain meng 
Rap game, crack game, cut it, cook it, chop it, record it 
Album shop it, its all the same thang 
Y'all look at these blue skies and think paradise 
I look at these blue skies, and think what a disguise 
That's why its called the ""Magic City"", it's a treat to your eyes 
Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind 
Word of advice don't follow the streets, follow the signs 
'cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost, cause it might just cost ya life 
Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs 
So watch where you put the map on the dash 
Cause they might end up clapping ya ass 
Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night 
They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes 
Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here

Might swang up on ya then hurt ya, nobody here gon help ya 
2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killers 
Vicious like silver-back guerillas see then peel ya 
Niggaz down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya 
Serve ya, for ya or for ya (Feel it!!!) 
You pussy niggaz been hatin on us for too long 
So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song (thats what's up) 
'cause the time is now (now), the place is here (here) 
I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear 
Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes 
So that when everything go down, it won't be no kind of surprise 
And I got no time for yo lies (No time for lies!!), save 'em for peter 
Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater (BITCH!), let's get it dirty!

We call 'em verts and donks, some we call box chevys 
Seven-duece, seven-trey, seven-four, seven-five 
M-I-A-M-I till I die, 3-0-5!!! 
Candy paint and leather, they don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better 
Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers 
'cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters 
This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors 
So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches 
And niggaz cocaine cooking brick flipping bitches trippin for figures 
This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it 
That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it 
This is for everybody in county, TGK, Metro West and Stockade 
Doing time 
And if you got more than 365 
And you're up the road rep MIA with pride, That's right!!!

'cause to be honest I can't, so Pal...
Why don't you just give us the keys and pounds
Now Guess What He Said?

[Chorus 2x]
y'all want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!
y'all want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!
y'all want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!
y'all hurry up and wait! y'all hurry up and wait!

I've been brought up
By street cats who didn't get caught up

I'm the new Tony Montana, only I'm just a

(Verse 1)
He went from a street kid doin regular street things
Straight to a street king
Takin over the city, block by block
Breaking down bricks, servin them rock by rock
He's everything a young gun want to grow up to be
But if only these young guns could see
That murder, money, and lust is slowly murderin' us
'cause the drug game ain't what it used to be
So look deeper when they paint you a picture
And try to sell you a dream
'cause a lot of these drug lords turn to the feds, or turn into fiends
The crack game ain't everything it's cracked up to be
Now that same cat that was a, neighborhood celebrity
Is coppin rocks off the news kids on the block
At the same time tryna school them
But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that he's doin'
Hustlin's like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptoms
And if you know this, you won't skip fame
But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power
Don't let your life go sour over power

(Chorus)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

(Verse 2)
Not only did my father used to deal dope
He used to do the dope he used to deal, I'm juss' keepin it real
Now my father doesn't have shit
I don't have shit
We don't have shit
'cause he didn't stack shit
With all the money he made, he didn't think for one second to put money away
That's 'cause his mind was clouded with white thoughts
He's lucky that he didn't end up outlined in white chalk
The only thing I can say I gained from my father is
Knowledge of the street game
And I hope that y'all follow this
I can't say I haven't sold weed or cocaine
But I can say this
Money that comes quick, leaves quick
And y'all better believe this
'cause this I've lived and witnessed
Catch a couple of charges
Now you're on the Lord's shit list
Now you're forced to do business
Until this business does you of course
You can die doin' dope, or dealin dope, either or
You choose the road that you need to follow
And you choose the people that you look up to as role models

(Chorus)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

(Verse 3)
I know about hustler's
But I won't mention no names
'cause they still got cases pending
And some are even, appealing, life in the cage
At least they made it past the first phase, they passed a certain age
Hustlin's like AIDS
At first your infected with HIV, and then it's full blown
Only difference is, instead of havin' no immune system
You become immune to the system of havin dough, by dealin blow
It's a fast life and even if you survive, your mind will die slow
Dirty money attracts, dirty things
And if you plan to deal dope I hope you're ready for the murder game
'cause that's what it brings
I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryin' to preach, no
I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but yet
Like a faucet, I'm tryin' to leak
Any foe, tell these young'ns and their kinfolk
And let em' know there's more to life than a G of coke
If you used to push weight then you relate
'cause you already had a taste of, hustler's withdrawal

(Chorus)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)",Hustler's Withdrawal,2004

You've got those body parts, I just want to explore
Coma with me loco, ven paca mi amor

Tell me baby, honestly, what is it exactly you got to lose
Nothing there's always some time in the wall*

Reducin they business
If I wasn't doin this
Then I'd go do him in

I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

El que dicen que decapite
Por que mira que tengo gana
De bajarte una tea
Pero sin manos solo con arte
Pa' que tu aprendas, digo tu receta

Esto no empezó hoy, toma lo que te doy

Ya no dan para mas, repito
Que el oro la plata why la fama

Los van a tumbar, que va

Que hacer atención, que viva la suerte
Why muera la mala intención

Teach me I wanna learn
Kamasutra, please me, please me
Show me how to give it you, mami now

Just tell me what you like, I can kiss, I can nibble

Yo a ti no puedo sacarte de la chola

Pero no se si ella esta sola
Vamo' a echarle ron a la chambola
Si no resuelve, el tiempo lo disuelve
Formemos un party encendido pa' ver si vuelve
Dile que me observe
Y que me conserve
Sabe que conmigo toa la noche hara full server
Que me responda, que agarre la onda
Yo lo que quiero es que vayemos a otra ronda
Que se disponga, que no se me esconda
Que si nos vemos toy seguro que se monta
Dile que conmigo nunca le dio de una monga
Nos bebimos un cuarto de mama-juana en caÃ±Â¡Â Â§orda
Al que le caiga el sello que se lo ponga
Tan molesto porque le saque la ronda

Pitbull,"We gon take it from the bottom (M-I-A-M-I to Houston!)

H-town! Pitbull, Bun B
My dogg Demi, keep ya head up, I gotchu, I promise!
All my chicos, I gotchu, I promise!
Miami, I gotchu, I promise!! I'ma take over this bitch! I promise!
So get ready mothafuckers, this is not a game!! (eeyo!)

I'm from the dirty dirty, where a lot of these cats mix the weed
With the coke and blow dirty, we're off the chain meng
Rap game, crack game, cut it, cook it, chop it, record it
Album shop it, its all the same thang
Y'all look at these blue skies and think paradise
I look at these blue skies, and think what a disguise
That's why its called the ""Magic City"", it's a treat to your eyes
Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind
Word of advice don't follow the streets, follow the signs
Cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost, cause it might just cost ya life
Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs
So watch where you put the map on the dash
Cause they might end up clapping ya ass
Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night
They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes
Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here
Yo life'll get taken here, I just thought I should make it clear! Yeah!

[Chorus: x2]
Everything we do is dirty!
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!
We pound that twat, dirty!
Miami!!!, we're dirty!
Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty!
Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty!

Straight up outta Texas, the reckless, PA to be exact
Where the streets is cutthroat and fiends kill you for a G of crack
8 G's and Cadillacs, Chevy's cut on the deltas
Might swang up on ya then hurt ya, nobody here gon help ya
2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killer
Vicious like silver-back guerrillas see then peel ya
Niggas down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya
Serve ya, for ya or for ya (Feel it!)
You pussy niggas been hatin' on us for too long
So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song (that's whats up)
Cause the time is now (now), the place is here (here)
I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear
Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes
So that when everything go down, it won't be no kind of surprise
And I got no time for yo lies (No time for lies!) save 'em for peter
Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater (bitch!) let's get it dirty!

[Chorus: x2]

These boys from the bottom are obsessed with old school Chevy's
We call 'em verts and donks, some we call box Chevy's
Seven-duece, seven-trey, seven-four, seven-five
M-I-A-M-I till I die, 3-0-5!
Candy paint and leather, they don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better
Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers
Cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters
This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors
So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches
And niggas cocaine cooking brick flipping bitches trippin' for figures
Clip oh no he didn't

This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it
That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it
This is for everybody in county, T-G-K, Metro West and Stockade
Doing time
And if you got more than 365
And you're up the road rep M-I-A with pride, That's right!

That you thought was so sexy 
And even though you had a man 
He was still turnin' you on 

Move the feelin' right 
And I see you standin' there 
Not an ordinary night 
Feeling lust is in the air (hey) 
Way your body looks 
Its turnin' me on 
They way you lick your lips slow 
Makes me want you even more

Don't know your name 
But your turnin' me on

And I left my man at home

Get you out my site

This feeling is so wrong (hey) 
I wanna approach you 
Let you know how I feel 
Wanna do more to 
Try to seal this deal 

[Chorus]

End of the night 
Can I 
Wait for you outside 
We can 
End this evening right 
We can 
Kick it on the side 
I need to experience 
What you can do 
We'll have a private party 
For just me and you 

[Chorus]

First time I ever been so 
Attracted to a stranger 
Don't know if this is wrong but 
Don't mind if in a danger 
You caught my eye 
Minute that I saw you 
Knowin' that a may wanna get to know you 
Can I get your name 
Makin' me say (your turnin' me on)

Stop, whoa, back it up, now let me see your hips swing

Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that
But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips swing, and, look, just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back
I heard somebody yell ""savage where the chorus at?!""

Uh oh, let it pop, ladies drop it like it's hot
Hell yeah, that's the spot, now bring it back to the top
Stop! woah, now back it up, now back it up
Let it rise then watch it dump, shaking your junk in the trunk
And, I, like, the way you move it smoothly
Now why, don't, you move that booty, to, me
I'm tryna come up with some thoughts of attack,
Until I heard somebody yellin' out ""savage where the chorus at?!""

Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, whoa, back it up, now let me see your hips swing
