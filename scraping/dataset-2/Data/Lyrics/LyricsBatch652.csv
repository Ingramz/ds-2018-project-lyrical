My freak",Take Me Over [Ferry Corsten Fix],2011
Manufactured Superstars,"I went out to the club the other night
To, you know, dance with my bitches
That guy was there again
Is it like
I'm sorry for what I said last weekend
I told him I didn't mind, which was a lie
But I was equally sorry
And I didn't want to apologize
It was just a drunk text

In my head I was writing a fiction of us
Behind my eyes, I was begging for
Things my lip? could never ask
And my mouth kept pouring
Desperate clauses of random intent
He asked me if he could text me later
After the club
He hands me another ?hot of vodka
And I say, sure

I'm on the dance floor when I get a text from adam
I'm too lazy to type, so I send him a photo I took up a dancer's skirt
And tell him to come and get it
Not realizing what I had just said
Later on, she comes up to me
Holds up her phone ?creaming at me and I say
I'm sorry, it was just a drunk text

I should've known they knew each other
No one is safe in the twitter sphere anymore
To take the world sex, and mix it with texting
It's called sexting
When you add drunk sexting
The words just don't make sen?e

It's a hot mess of misspelled obscenities
Body parts, questions
I'm not sure what it means to ask

I get a text from my best friend
She's up?tairs getting bottle service
She's like
This guy wants you to wet your lips with this bottle
He wants me to bring more girls up
He's ?ome kind of pimp
Are you fucking kidding me?
It's just another moment
When one stupid reply can lead to the walk of shame
And I'll be damned if I end up in some lame diner after I do this
With last night's lingerie in my purse
It's just a drunk text
It's just a drunk text
This is the last time I ever drink and text
It's ju?t a drunk text
It's just a drunk text",Drunk Text [Radio Edit] [Edit],2011
Manury,"You act like a prima donna,
Playing so hard to get.
Sittin' so cool and nonchalant,
Draggin' on a cigarette.
You keep a wall all around ya.
I'll get through some day.
I want your love, baby,
Push, don't shove
Gonna chip that stone away.

Chip away,
Chip away at the stone.
I won't stop until your love is my very own.
Chip away,
That's what I'm gonna do.
Sweet little mama,
I wanna get next to you.

You stand like a marble statue,
Trying to look so hard.
All decked out in your antique dress,
While the boys all promenade.
Even a rock will crumble,
If you strike it night and day.
If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust.
Gonna chip that stone away.

Chip away,
Chip away at the stone.
I won't stop until your love is my very own.
Chip away,
That's what I'm gonna do.
Sweet little mama,
I wanna get next to you.

Chip away,
Chip away at the stone.
Honey, I won't stop until your love is my very own.
Chip away,
That's what I'm wanna do.
Sweet little mama,
I wanna get next to you.

 Yes I do, yes I do.

 Chip away, chip away, at the stone.
Chip away, chip away, at the stone.

I won't stop.
I won't stop.
I won't stop.
I won't stop.
I won't stop.
I won't stop.
 
Chip it.
I'm gonna nip it, all night long.

Manus Lunny,"Where are you tonight I wonder
And where will you be tonight when I cry?
Will sleep for you come easy,
Though I alone can't slumber
Will you welcome in the morning
At another man's side?

How easy for you the years slipped under
And left me a shadow the sun can't dispel
I built for you a tower of love and admiration
But I set you so high I could not reach myself.

I look through my window at a world filled with strangers
The face in my mirror is the one face I know
You have taken all that's in me, so my heart is in no danger
My heart is in no danger, but I'd still like to know

If there is a silence then it can be broken
If there beats a pure heart to her I will go
And time will work its healing and the spirit will grow stronger
Ah, but in the meantime I'd still like to know.




",Where Are You (Tonight I Wonder),1987
Manus Lunny,"My heart was ance as blythe and free
As simmer days were lang,
But a bonnie westlin weaver lad
Has gart me change my sang.

Chorus:
Tae the weaver's gin ye go fair maid,
Tae the weaver's gin ye go,
I rede ye richt, gang ne'er at nicht,
Tae the weaver's gin ye go.

My mither sent me tae the toon
Tae warp a plaiden wab;
But the weary weary warpin o't
Has gart me sigh and sab.

Chorus

A bonnie westlin weaver lad
Sat workin at his loom
He took my heart as wi a net
In every knot and thrum.

Chorus

I sat beside my warpin-wheel
And ay I ca'd it roun'
But every shot and every knock
my heart it gae a stoun.

Chorus

The moon was sinkin in the west
Wi' visage pale and wan,
As my bonnie westlin weaver lad
Convoy'd me thro' the glen.

But what was said or what was done
Shame fa' me gin I tell
But Oh, I fear the kintra soon
Will ken as weel's mysel.

Manwell,"Somedays I'm feeling like
I can't win, can't get it right and 
It don't matter how hard I try
Today is not my day
When it feels like I'm going crazy
And it looks like nothing's changing
Come sun come rainy day
You are still the same

In the dark, in the light
In the morning and night
In the good, in the hurt
In the places I hide
When I rise, when I fall
You'll be there through it all
At the start, at the end
In the center of the center of it

Some nights I lay awake and 
I can't push these thoughts away
I'm worried where I'm gonna go
Where I'm gonna be are You gonna be there for me
When it feels like the doors are closing
Gotta trust that You're doing something
Come sun come rainy day
You are all I need

There will be days I will forget
Everything You've done for me
But when I go back there again
I'm reminded

In the dark, in the light
In the morning and the night

In the dark, in the light
In the morning and night
In the good, in the hurt
In the places I hide
When I rise, when I fall
You'll be there through it all
At the start, at the end
In the center of the center of it

In the loss, in the win
In the beauty and the sin
At the start, at the end
In the center of the center of it",Center of it,
Many,"Decidí vivir, no fue suficiente 
Me atreví a soñar, entre tanta gente 
Aposte por mi, no quería perderme 
Aposte por ti, porque me haces fuerte 
Tu y yo somos fuerte 

Lucharemos juntos, aquí no existe el fracaso 
Dios nos da la libertad y el vigila nuestros pasos 
Las caídas no vienen con instructivos 
Podremos estar caídos, pero jamas destruidos 

Y confió en ti, se que tu puedes lograrlo 
El mundo esta en tus manos, anda sal a conquistarlo 
Estamos todos juntos, tu no pierdas la cabeza 
A veces hay que caer, para levantarnos con más fuerza 

No tengas miedo, que de esto yo hago alarde 
Para poder triunfar, créeme nunca será tarde 
Tu puedes soñar, lo que vas a conquistar 
Juntos vamos a pelear, nada nos va a derrumbar 

Lo que ayer perdí, no me pertenece 
Porque todo pasa, porque todo vuelve 
Creo en compartir, no voy a mentirte 
Decirla verdad, hoy me hace libre 
Hoy me siento libre 

Más allá del sol, ya no existe el miedo 
Porque los valientes tocarán el cielo, tocarán el cielo 
Y si en el camino tropiezo 
Me levanto y lo intento otra vez 

No prometo no caer, porque aquí nadie es perfecto 
Prometo levantarme, porque yo es mi sustento 
Esta vida no la miro tan confusa, es que mis sueños 
Son más grandes que cualquier excusa 

No existen limites, pero si las victorias 
Se que tu corazón esta dispuesto hacer historia 
Después de cada derrota, ganamos enseñanza 
Tu brillas más que nunca, con la luz de la esperanza 

Trata de ser feliz y brilla como un gran destello 
No hay nada ni nadie, que destruya nuestros sueños 
Todo cambiará yo tengo la seguridad 
Solo ha que tu tristeza se vuelva felicidad 

Hoy estoy aquí 
Nada me detiene 
Preparado estoy 
Para lo que viene 
Para lo que viene",Nada Me Detiene,2016
Manzanero Big Band Jazz de México,"Como yo te ame jamas te lo podras imaginar
Pues fue una hermosa forma de sentir, de vivir de morir 
Why a tu sombra seguir, asi yo te ame.

Como yo te ame ni en sueños lo podras imaginar
Pues todo el tiempo te perteneci ilusion no senti
Que no fuera por ti, asi es como te ame

Como yo te ame por poco o mucho tiempo que me quede por 
Vivir es verbo que jamas podre volver a repetir
Comprendo que fue una exageracion lo que yo te ame
Como yo te ame no creo que algun dia tu lo quieras entender 
Tendras que enamorarte como lo hice yo de ti para asi saber
Lo que yo te ame

Manzanero Big Band Jazz de México,"Somos novios
Pues los dos sentimos
Mutuo amor profundo
Y con eso ya ganamos
Lo mas grande de este mundo

Nos amamos
Nos besamos como novios
Nos deseamos
Y hasta a veces
Sin motivos, sin razón
Nos enojamos

Somos novios
Mantenemos un cariño
Limpio y puro
Como todos
Procuramos el momento
Mas oscuro

Manzanita,"Why yo que hasta ayer solo fuí un holgazán 
Why hoy soy guardián de sus sueños de amor 
La Quiero a Morir 

Podeis destrozar todo aquello que veis 
Porque ella de un soplo lo vuelve a crear 
Como si nada, Como si nada 
La Quiero a Morir 

Ella para las horas de cada reloj 
Why me ayuda pintar transparente el dolor 
Con su sonrisa 
Why levanta una torre desde el cielo hasta aquí 
Why me coce unas alas why me ayuda a subir 
A toda prisa, a toda prisa
La Quiero a Morir

Coro: 
Conoce bien cada guerra 
Cada herida, cada ser 
Conoce bien cada guerra 
De la vida why del amor también

Eeehhhhhhyyy
Eeeehhhhh

Me dibuja un paisaje why me lo hare vivir 
En un bosque de lapíz se apodera de mi 
La Quiero a Morir 

Why me atrapa en un lazo que no aprieta jamás 
Como un hilo de seda que no puedo soltar
No quiero soltar, No quiero soltar 
La Quiero a Morir

Cuando trepo a sus ojos me enfrento al mar
Dos espejos de agua encerrados en cristal
La Quiero a Morir

Solo puedo asentarmerme, solo puedo callar
Solo puedo enredarme, solo puedo aceptar
Ser solo suyo, Ser solo suyo
La Quiero a Morir

Manzanita,"Io non posso stare fermo con le mani nelle mani
Tante cose devo fare prima che venga domani
E se lei già sta dormendo io non posso riposare
Farò in modo che al risveglio non mi possa più scordare
Perché questa lunga notte, non sia nera più del nero
Fatti grande dolce luna e riempi il cielo intero
E perché quel suo sorriso possa ritornare ancora
Splendi sole domattina come non hai fatto ancora

E per poi farle cantare, le canzoni che ha imparato
Io le costruirò un silenzio che nessuno ha mai sentito
Sveglierò tutti gli amanti, parlerò per ore ed ore
Abbracciamoci più forte, perché lei vuole l'amore

Poi corriamo per le strade e mettiamoci a ballare
Perché lei vuole la gioia, perché lei odia il rancore
E poi coi secchi di vernice coloriamo tutti i muri
Case, vicoli e palazzi, perché lei ama i colori
Raccogliamo tutti i fiori, che può darci primavera
Costruiamole una culla, per amarci quando è sera
Poi saliamo su nel cielo, e prendiamole una stella
Perché Margherita è buona, perché Margherita è bella

Perché Margherita è dolce, perché Margherita è vera
Perché Margherita ama, e lo fa una notte intera
Perché Margherita è un sogno, perché Margherita è il sale
Perché Margherita è il vento e non sa che può far male
Perché Margherita è tutto, ed è lei la mia pazzia
Margherita, Margherita
Margherita, adesso è mia
Margherita è mia",Margarita,1999

Que sucediera algo así
Quien me lo iba a decir
Con lejos que estabas tú de mi
Tan solo en mis sueños
Fuiste mía, no

Estando junto a ti
No me parece realidad
Fuiste como una estrella

Te alejabas mas y mas
En la inmensidad

Que estés a mi lado diciéndome te quiero
Besando mi boca acariciando mi pelo

Estoy tan enamorado
Que aun no puedo creerlo
Que estés a mi lado diciéndome te quiero
Besando mi boca acariciando mi pelo

Me siento tan feliz

En el que no quiero despertar

But now the group is fallin' apart

'Cause there isn't anyone to blame
I hope there's no hard feelings

Caught in a rock and roll time warp
Just tryin' to find the way to get out

Four years on
And things were really gettin' too intense
Critics ravin' 'bout our album
But we're makin' fifty cents
And in the end
We was facin' the hard, cold truth

And I've been floatin' round
Like an old newspaper
Blowin' down some windy street
Feelin' so alone and incomplete

But there's nowhere to hide
Where the night can't find me.
Where the light of the sun can't blind me
Like the light in a woman's eyes
There's nowhere to hide
>From the dream that drives me
Like a fire burning deep inside me
Oh I know she'll be here tonight.
Can the future be foretold
In a faded photograph
Can a dream be bought or sold
Well I guess I have to laugh
Sippin' on a scotch and soda
A shadow in the corner booth
So philosophic and drunk on grown-up truth.
Half-forgotten fragments
Of a high school dance
In the dead white hours of winter
When we loved so hard
That we thought it would never end
Trying to remember
How it used to feel
When a kiss was something special
And I wonder now
Will it ever be again

Golden high school dream
An illusion nothing real could ever touch
Funny love seemed so much more intense
At seventeen
When I knew she'd never love me
Half as much

I recall the desperate vow I made
I must find a way somehow to win her heart
I've got to make her mine

Gonna run away
Till I prove that I'm a man
Gonna run away
Be the best I know I can
Got to run away
Got to find my space and time
And I cannot rest a day until I make her mine

Of a timeless memory
And I knew but still refused to comprehend
The fantasy more glamorous
Then she could ever be
Was the course of least resistance

I must find a way somehow to win her heart

Lived deep within my soul
In a yesterday where love
And dreams remain
But disillusion clouds my eyes
And the winter takes it's toll
For the spring has gone
And will not come again

Sent from above, oh and she was bringing me love.

Though she was twenty-two

The sun rises on a statue of Mary
The old ladies file into commune
A fat guy in a blue Members Only

The pizza joint is for peppers and eggs

Dance all crazy with the rubbery legs

In the evening they still ring the bells
Stop by the Smockey for a short amoretto

Where'd you go Mr. Rocky Balboa?
Angelo Bruno, what has happened to you?

Marah,"Hey, I got on the bus
Found myself a seat
More people pilin' on
I watch the busy street
Snow was comin' down
And more was on the ground
What's rollin' into town
Said I'd better get back home

I seen a rain soaked mattress
‘neath the apartment house of death
Strewn in a vacant mess
All watered-down and wet
I seen the horse cops take the beat
Makin' horseshoes in the sleet
Outside the dollar store
I didn't have a broken heart
I was not that lonely yet
When life played a trick on me
I'm afraid I didn't get

Seen two lovers in the park
Felt the blood rush to my fists
They were sittin' on a bench
Entangled in a kiss…
Which wouldn't mean a goddamned thing
It wouldn't be no big to do
But even from behind I could see that she was you

She was…
Faraway you – what is it you do?
Treat me so cruel, act so faraway

Sittin' on the bus
Heard the driver signal sound
More people pilin' on,
Other people climbin' down
I seen a dumpster bum appeased
Dinin' on a dumpster feast
He looked up at me,
We turned the corner headin' east
And then we made a couple rights
My face had faded white
Stopped at a traffic light
And made a left on 17th…

Then I got off the bus
Found my apartment door
Held the keys up to the lock
And they jangled to the floor
Well I jangled down beside ‘em
And I guess I might've slept
‘Cause when I woke up in the mornin'
I was still out on the step.

Singin'…
Faraway you – what is it you do?
Treat me so cruel, act so faraway",Faraway You,2000
Marah,"There was a dumpster in an alley
Looked like a black bear in the road
There is a stain of blood, a Sixers cap
And the stench of piss and beer
There was an outskirt's glow of lamplight
From a half a block away
And there was the ghost of greed,
The ghost of fury and the ghost of fear

There was a charred spot in the gutter
That would slick up in the rain
There was a half tin can
That been burned over the brand (name)
Tall windows paned and plywood, where houses closed forever
And the every night mosquitoes
With no intent to land

There came an old dog with a bad limp
He had a slow gait and a hunger
There was some pigeons on a wire
And they were open-eyed and still
There was an aura to the whole place
Like someone else was lurking
Such is the history of where someone has been killed…",The History of Where Someone Has Been Killed,2000

Screamin' “Gimme back, back all that money Tyrone”
So he snapped her neck back and slapped his lover

Spillin' out the facts of the city's dirty secrets

My heart is the avenue wind rattlin' street signs
With its delicate din…

Vacant of smiles and void of all joy
My heart is the ghetto at midnight

And watched the tracers fly
Through the jungle trees
Like fireflies on a windy night
Pulled up and onward by the breeze
I can still hear the far off tin-canny sounds
Of their machine guns come unwound
And I was shakin' like Little Richard
And I was sweatin' like ol' James Brown

Over by my window sill
The moon was still
On my cigarettes and wine
Sometimes there's wear I pray to Jesus
Sometimes there's where I pray to die
But I could still sense the circling danger
Of those invisible bastards of a piss-hot day
I was shakin' with ol' Proud Mary

Because the chopper's filled with your gut-shot friends
Your hearts are filled with fear

Fables tell of men who fell
With swords dangling from their chest
The old guys down at the taproom swear
The Japs could kill you best
But late at night I could still hear the cries
Of three black guys I seen take it in the face
I think about them sweet Motown girls they left behind
And the assholes that took their place

Take the hits boys take the hits
Don't smoke your bottle and don't lose your wits

Drinking small wines

I've been crying on an airplane

When I'm out on the street
I get light on my feet

When the air we breathe becomes poison dope

Sometimes we dream of new found freedom
But we're brothers for a reason

Behind me like a friend breathing

Even down by the sea
I hear my name on the breeze

Like a fortune is burned

With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

'Frosty the snowman' is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know how he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That ol' silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around, oh

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say, he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, “Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away”

Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin', “Catch me if you can”

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop or

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin', “Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day”

Marc,"On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to show off for us
There is the sun, the sand, and the arena
There are the bulls ready to bleed for us

It's time when grocery clerks
Become Don Juan
And all the ugly girls
Turn into swans

Who can say what he's found
That bull who turns and paws the ground
And suddenly he sees himself all nude
Who can say what he dreams
That bull who hears the silent screams
From the open mouths of multitudes

On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to suffer for us
There are the picadors and the mobs revenge
There are the toreros and the mob's revenge,
there are the toreros - and the mob kneels for us

It's time when grocery clerks
become Garcia-Lorca
And the girls put the roses in their teeth
Like Carmen

On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to drop dead for us
The sword will plunge down
And the mob will drool
The blood will poor down
And turn the sand to mud

It's time when grocery clerks
Become Nero
And the girls scream
And shout the name of their hero

And when finally they fell
Did the bulls dream of a hell
Where men and worn out matadors
Still burn
And perhaps with their last breath
Would they pardon us their death
Knowing what we did at
Carthage, Waterloo, Verdon, Stalingrad, Iwoa Jima , Hiroshima, Saigon",The Bulls,1983

In my room
Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Thinking how lonesome I've grown
All alone
In my room 
In my room
Where every night is the same
I play a dangerous game
I keep pretending she's late
And I sit and I wait
Over there is the picture we took
When I made her my bride
Over there is the chair where I held her
Whenever she cried
Over there by the window the flowers she left
Have all died

I was the boy with the angel's eyes
And the blush in surprise
When you hold my hand in full view
Now I'm so wrecked that my eyes bleed
Watch me recede
Nails curl back
From the quick as they
Curl with my lips

Standing limp in the pool of the light
So callous and cruel
Bones are piercing me through
And the shadow of you
Is the shadow of my former self
A quick recollection and smile for old times
Sometimes I feel like I'm being unkind
Skintight yet sallow
Saddened by the shallow
Reaching for the glow

At the end of the tunnel
Somewhere up the ladder stands
I shout as the car glides
Over the kerb to the wall
And the hiss of the steam is the siren
Drawing me onto the rocks
Always as ever in no man's land
With my driver slumped over my wheel",My Former Self,1983
Marc,"Dancing
The little lights are dancing
And the clock on the wall is announcing another day
I keep hearing things you used to say

The way
And your mouth so dry
As you fake the kiss
Playing the part you do best you can

Lying there naked across the sheets
Like a lizard in the sand
Becoming me and failing to see
The little girl you've become

And you fall as you slink across the room
Your lips parted in a kiss
Parading your flesh in the way you know best
Like a broken seductress

I'm casting my mind back to my fourteenth year
When I learnt about what we call the pleasure of love
And it was new to me then
And a wave of sadness shivers my skin

As I think about what can never be felt again
As I think about what never can be felt again",Once Was,1983

With your face staring at the wall
Playing with reminders of yesteryear
Persona that hasn't got a place at all
Your were in love with the caress of a camara
And I was in love with you
Now the mirrors' dimmed and cracked
Like your aura and your glammer
Make the legend
Easier to live through

And I once loved a smile
And I once dreamed a look
I collected your memories too
Now the eyes hold the flame
And the face holds the pain
As you try to live your legend through

And I once loved a smile
And I once dreamed a look
I collected your memories too
Now the eyes hold the flame
And the face holds the pain

Aging to an art
Wishing we could grow together
When we only grow apart

It's so sad you never gave in smiling
Aging to an art
Wishing we could grow together
When we only grow apart

Life behind the shades is a life all in the mind
With no place in the living at all
You die with the dreams and so it seems
With imagination's down fall
Keep up the whispers
Incite the adoration
That glows around the image of you
With a kiss to the screen
As you play out the scene
As you try to live your legend through

And I once loved a smile
And I once dreamed a look
I collected your memories too
Now the eyes hold the flame
And the face holds the pain
As you try to live your legend through

And I once loved a smile

Marc,"And if one day I should become
A singer with a Spanish bum
Who sings for women of great virtue
I'd sing to them with a guitar
I borrowed from a coffee bar
Well, what you don't know doesn't hurt you
My name would be Antonio
And all my bridges I would burn
And when I gave them some they'd know
I'd expect something in return
I'd have to get drunk every night
And talk about virility
With some old grandmother
That might be decked out like a Christmas tree
And no pink elephant I'd see
Though I'd be drunk as I could be
Still I would sing my song to me
About the time they called me ""Jacky""

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

And if I joined the social whirl
Became procurer of young girls
Then I could have my own bordellos
My record would be number one
And I'd sell records by the ton
All sung by many other fellows
My name would then be handsome Jack
And I'd sell boats of opium
Whiskey that came from Twickenham
Authentic queens
And phony virgins
I'd have a bank on every finger
A finger in every country
And every country ruled by me
I'd still know where I'd want to be
Locked up inside my opium den
Surrounded by some china men
I'd sing the song that I sang then
About the time they called me ""Jacky""

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

Now, tell me, wouldn't it be nice
That if one day in paradise
I'd sing for all the ladies up there
And they would sing along with me
And we be so happy there to be
'Cause down below is really nowhere
My name would then be ""Jupiter""
Then I would know where I was going
Become all knowing
My beard so very long and flowing
If I could play deaf, dumb and blind
Because I pitied all mankind
And broke my heart to make things right
I know that every single night
When my angelic work was through
The angels and the Devil too
Could sing my childhood song to me
About the time they called me ""Jacky""

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

Caught between two love affairs
I brush my teeth and comb my hair
My lonely neighbor called today
And asked me, has he gone away

I lied to her like I lied to him
I lie to myself about everything

Love, what is love?
Love, what is love?

Love is a time
Love is a place
Love is a season
Love is a case of love

Love is a time
Love is a place
Love is a season
Love is a case of love

And so my life repeats itself
Like rhythms in a drum machine
The one who was the one to come
And all of those who might have been

I cry for them like I cry for him
I cry to myself about everything

Love, what is love?
Love, what is love?

Love is a fever
Love is a dream
Sometimes so hard, it can make you scream
Love is a liar
Love can be cruel
Love is an icon, love is a jewel

They let you down
They leave you standing in the rain
They take the joy and leave the pain

Caught between two love affairs
Is it true that no one really cares
My lonely neighbor leaves today
And no one comes to take her place
I lied to her like I lied to him
Now they're gone can I lie about anything
What is love?
Love, what is love? Love, what is love? Love, what is love?",Jacky,2012

Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Thinking how lonesome I've grown
All alone
In my room 
In my room
Where every night is the same
I play a dangerous game
I keep pretending she's late
And I sit and I wait
Over there is the picture we took
When I made her my bride
Over there is the chair where I held her
Whenever she cried
Over there by the window the flowers she left
Have all died
Repeat chorus
All alone, in my room
All alone...
...in my room
All alone, all alone, in my room",In My Room,1984
Marc Almond,"Remember me
I was the boy with the angel's eyes
And the blush in surprise
When you hold my hand in full view
Now I'm so wrecked that my eyes bleed
Watch me recede
Nails curl back
From the quick as they
Curl with my lips

Standing limp in the pool of the light
So callous and cruel
Bones are piercing me through
And the shadow of you
Is the shadow of my former self
A quick recollection and smile for old times
Sometimes I feel like I'm being unkind
Skintight yet sallow
Saddened by the shallow
Reaching for the glow

At the end of the tunnel
Somewhere up the ladder stands
I shout as the car glides
Over the kerb to the wall
And the hiss of the steam is the siren
Drawing me onto the rocks
Always as ever in no man's land
With my driver slumped over my wheel",My Former Self,1984
Marc Almond,"He woke to the sound of the birds in the morning
Felt charged with a new lease of life
Time to break out of his present surroundings
A mother, a child and a wife
He'd not said good-bye to his last thread of childhood
It lay just beyond his front gate
So he packed just a few things
And he packed in his job
And he prayed he'd not left it too late

He turned and he said
""Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back""

Joy held his heart
As he took to the road
Cast all his sorrow
To the breeze
Knew in his heart
It was the right thing to do
For he had to search out
His belief
Spring came and fall went
The year ran away
Love, hate and heartache ran too
Felt himself drift
Into memories of home
And the loneliness he lived on through

He turned and he said
""Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back""

And he'd learnt about life
But he'd lost out on love
He was no longer only a boy
There were lines on his face
From the sun and the wind
But no lines there through
Laughter or joy

Shoes full of holes
But with fire in his soul
He walked down the dirt beaten track
Mother was gone
But his wife and child were living on
And they cried
""It's the boy who came back""
Goodbye through the evening
Goodbye through the night
Goodbye through the dreams
Through the sleep
Goodbye to our yesterdays
Hello tomorrow
It seems we were destined to meet

He turned and he said
""Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back""",The Boy Who Came Back,1984
Marc Almond,"I love you when you're black and blue
I love you when you're sad
Love like sparks flies out of you
The best love that I ever had

Could this be a crime
To feel so sublime?

My heart cries like the sea at night
For love crimes thrown away
And though I pray with all my might
I know you'll never, ever stay

Could this be a crime
To feel so sublime?

Come to me my pale face baby
Come to me and don't be pale
Just two minutes silence
For my dead heart

Could this be a crime
To feel so sublime?",Crime Sublime,1984
Marc Almond,"Sitting on the kerb
You wipe the tears away again
The gutter holds your sallow hearts
That melt down with the rain
Barbed and brittle hands that push
The hair out of your eyes
Pavement fires a-flicker
Like a host of fire flies

My song calls from the gutter
And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
In cardboard box city
My song calls from the gutter
And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
A dark cacophony

The wolven of the orphan gangs
Take turns to search and steal
They splash about the puddles
And are trodden under heel
They bathe their pearly faces
In the lights of Chinatown
And they lick their pearly fingers
When the street lamps flicker down

My song calls from the gutter
And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
In cardboard box city
My song calls from the gutter
And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
A dark cacophony

All night I've been up
With the bitterest thoughts
I can't seem to throw
All my cares to the wind
Makes me sleep feverish
Makes me sleep scared
Pillow of secrets
And blanket of sins

My song calls from the gutter
And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
In cardboard box city

My song calls from the gutter
And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
In cardboard box city

My song calls from the gutter
And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
In cardboard box city

And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
A dark cacophony",Gutter Hearts,1984
Marc Almond,"Found me out drunk and abandoned
All my horizons in flame
Crying tell all my friends to forget me
'Cause I'll never see them again

Oh go tell them all to forget me
There's no love left in me for them
Something is stirring deep inside of me
And I'll never see them again

How long do you think that you're going to lick
All of the boots that kick you?
You've had your face in the dirt for too long
Sweet revenge long overdue

Oh go tell them all to forget me
There's no love left in me for them
Something is stirring deep inside of me
And I'll never see them again

I looked at the Manhattan skyline
The bitterest tears in my eyes
A big ball of slime in the cesspool of life
Under an open sore sky

Oh go tell them all to forget me
There's no love left in me for them
Something is stirring deep inside of me
And I'll never see them again

It took me all this time to realise
That Hell was a city on Earth
And Jesus died for me to despise
The pitiful waste of his birth

I craved for the filth of the city
Gold pathway of dreams from my heart
But acid of misery ate up the gold
And sent me right back to the start

Oh go tell them all to forget me
There's no love left in me for them
Something is stirring deep inside of me
And I'll never see them again",Hell Was a City,1984
Marc Almond,"The cops had the boys
Up against the car
Down Santa Monica Boulevard
Baby food for the rich and sick
Thank LA for spawning it

High piled hair
Low slung breasts
The big hung boy
The deep cut dress

Ran a chicken ranch
For a guy named Tex
I didn't know who Tex
Would bring home next
One from a slum
One who was a bum
One on the run
Somebody's son
One whose mother was in on the kick
Baby food for the rich and sick

There's cops at the hatch
But she doesn't even hear
She's too busy practicing Santeria
Oh Chango Chango
Oh Chango Chango
Chango Chango won't you bring me luck
Plenty of money
Oh yes! And a little bit of love

Trussed up tight
On a mattress of thorns
Four limbs tied to the corners of the bed
Mummy's goodbyes ringing in my head
Mummy's goodbyes ringing in my head
Goodbye, Goodbye

There's someone on the till
And someone at the tools
Hot brand iron
And a collar of steel
Somebody put my name on a runaway list
I never thought I'd get caught like this

She's down below at a coconut shrine
Cryin' Chango Chango won't you bring me a man
Chango Chango won't you bring me a man
A man who is clean
Who never acts mean
And you know where he's been
Someone from a dream that is
Someone who'll take me away from here
ME! The finest Madame in Mexico City
Being Den Mother in a nursery

I'd like to put them out of their misery
But a gun to the temple doesn't quite seem like me

Marc Almond,"She was always alone
Kept herself under lock and key
Just her sorrows for all to see
She would break up and cry for me
Throw her away
Blow the ash from the ashtray
Leave her alone to play
Leave her alone to pray

And now you wonder why
I put out the flame to die
I'll hold on to my mystery
Secrets that make up me
In what's real and fantasy

Tenderness is a weakness
It tears down your fortresses
Makes you easy access
Tenderness is a weakness
It makes you so vulnerable

He was always alone
Told me he liked it best that way
Just a victim of circumstance
Just a loser who'd lost his chance
Truth, love and lies
They were all and the same to him
But he'd never given in
To the ultimate sin

And now you wonder why
I put out the flame in my eyes

Makes you easy access (and I guess that)

It makes you so vulnerable
To that sick dangerous feeling

I cried for you
I even lied for you
I died a thousand times for you
I committed endless crimes for you
I sold my soul to some Devil
To do with what he will
Now I'll lock up my heart
And throw away the key
Love have no part in my destiny
Love have no part in my destiny

Marc Almond,"Oh I bet your life
You're sick of the sight
Of those eat in, take out, throw up pizza bars
Love's just got to pass your way in time
You smell of prison, smell of crime
I just didn't want to say I told you so

Someone called hey yesterday boy!
Take your well worn body away from my sight
Friends run like rats from a sinking ship
Leaving you naked to the night
Now you're known as the last resort
By the vultures on the make
They say
You have to eat the hamburger
To appreciate the steak

You always feel the sting of words
As children are so cruel
They called you ugly, ugly head
When you were at school
You've tried to make the best of things
But it seems you've given in
They call you ugly, ugly head
Something makes you feel the living sin

Things must feel so insecure
When you're on your last legs
You're swimming in the coffee pot
Drowning in the dregs
But you haven't got the sense to die
(or get a decent job)
To look into a mirror
Or at the very worst some kind of god
You need something to believe in
I just wish it was yourself
Try to summon up the guts
To rectify your ailing health
For there's something round the corner
Waiting just out of sight
That'll stop you feeling low and limp
And naked to the night

You always feel the sting of words
As children are so cruel
They called you ugly, ugly head

Marc Almond,"Oh you have the saddest eyes
I have ever seen
Secret sorrows of a heart
That breaks so easily
Don't let me catch you crying
Don't let me catch you crying

Watching through the pane of glass
The final silent scenes
You became a fading face
In morning's half forgotten dreams
Don't let me catch you crying
Just hear the sad breeze sighing

You have, you have

You have the first ice of winter
I have the first rain of summer
You have the sad signs of sorrow
I have to leave you tomorrow
Words on a torn piece of paper
Escape from the window forever
Memories don't seem to matter
When crushed under heel in the gutter

Oh you have the saddest eyes
I have ever seen
Secret sorrows of a heart
That breaks so easily
Don't let me catch you crying
Just hear the sad breeze sighing

You have, you have

I stumble out along the rain washed streets
Blinded with tears and kicking at cans
Wrecked and wild with an ever-crushing loneliness
Feverish and tousled with an ever-crushing love
I know I won't find any answers here
I know my pleading voice bounds back an echo
It ricochets back down the cavernous alley
Hey don't be a stranger
Sad how misguided and confused
We suffer inside stumbling from one 
Shaky stepping stone to another 
Reaching out for a blind, blind love
Reaching out for a blind, blind love

Small we fall easy prey to self-pity
Wishing I was with you on the other side
Maybe tomorrow I may join you in Paradise
Maybe tomorrow I may join you in Paradise
Maybe tomorrow I may join you in Paradise
Maybe tomorrow I may join you in Paradise

Now I pray
The phantom pains
Not to come again
A million tears
To slip away
And take the vessel
Of my blame

We have got to brave the storm
The people who do us harm
I will never walk alone
The pavement of this bitter town

Us forever breaking hearts
Breaking rules and making fools
Forever having have to hold
The key that takes me to your soul

Always feel the loner
On the outside looking in
Always fall the victim
Of the seven deadly sins

Saviour, Sinner, Dreamer, Fool
They howl from the balconies
I just have to laugh and say
Well this is my kind of ecstasy

Us forever breaking hearts
Breaking rules and making fools
Forever having have to hold
The key that takes me to your soul

Smiles may come and go
But how I love you when you cry
Baby you're the arrow
Through the apple of my eye

Getting a little older, wiser, sadder with the years
Missed chances
Forgotten romances
Starting now to loosen with the tears
I could fall in love
Any time, any place, any where
But I spent last night
Treading on valentines
Treading on valentines
You know it didn't mean a thing
I didn't make me give two damns
You know I thought I'd never fall in love
It only worked in films
Response, responsibilities, bravery, hardship
Giving up and giving too
Here's little things I think I mean
Some consequence to you
I'll never get the chance again

All flash by me
Steaming neon's in the rain
Diamonds down the memory drain

Stomach aching
Pass the time while our hearts are breaking

So don't you have faith in me?
Misted mornings
Damp in sorrow
Love me just the same tomorrow
Something blue and something borrowed
And a bruise inside of me

I'm drunk on your delivery
Intoxicated by your eyes
Got to find an antidote
Before we say goodbye
Car wrecks and romantic moons
With you and I the stars
We're somewhere in a midnight movie
Somewhere off afar

There's no ice cream in the interval
No sweets or cigarettes
Just you and I
And a cast of thousands
Trying to forget

Blacked out with  hymns of pain and sorrow

Missed chances
Forgotten romances

We fool each other
When we've suffered through enough

Fuel and fire me

Building up to explosions

Unpredictable child
Emotional blackmail
Always destined to fail

I don't want to stop yet
Got to make you break down
Got to make you break uncontrollably down

Never, never giving
Hurts so to see me win

With the softest of shells
Always ending the same

Turning cigarette ash grey
Sprawled across troubled beds

Reaching for the pills
In lonely rundown motels

Dust to dust
Disaster after disaster
Must be some dark kiss on your lips
A promise of heaven or hell in your song
Tomorrow it'll all be gone be gone

I saw it once so I know it's true
You let it out on Sundays when
You let it beat me black and blue
When you went and stole my heart
I saw it go so I know it's true
It was a ruby, ruby, ruby red
It was the most precious gift I could give to you

It was as red as the sun in the evening sky
It was as red as the fire in a panther's eye
It was as red as the rose under the summer sun
Like a fire from a killer's gun

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

Well it seems you have a soul
You let it go so I know it's true
It was a ruby, ruby, ruby red
It keeps me warm when I'm feeling sad and blue
Well you went and stole my heart
I saw it go so I know it's true
I wrapped it up in a bouquet of barbed wire
It was the wickedest gift I could give to you

It was as red as the sun in the evening sky
It was as red as the fire in a panther's eye
It was as red as the rose under the summer sun
Like a fire from a killer's gun

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

Oh just like Johnny Rio baby
I need to be desired
I give up looking for my past
For the ones I left behind
Ruby red, ruby red, hey, hey, hey

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

It was the most precious jewel
I could give to you
Colour me red when I'm feeling blue
The colour of a kiss
In a young girl's dream
The mark of a guillotine
A drop of blood from a single thorn
Red wet sheets in the afternoon
A red light leading to my tomb
Ruby red all around my room

Ruby, ruby red
Oh shine a light onto this boy's bed
Oh, ruby, ruby, ruby red",Ruby Red,1987
Marc Almond,"Once in a night
I spent in Istanbul
I had a dream of a forbidden world
Where even angels
Fear to look upon
A place where all of love is doomed to die
Her face appeared
Through clouds of bitter wine
Sour as the morning's early hours
She took my hair
And she curled it around
Her fingers
I was but a fool for love
The scent of Turkish oils
Mixed with the harsh tobacco
In the overcrowded bar
Hashish
And cool mint in her hair
I was a fool for love
I was a fool
She sang to me
A torch song softly laced
With mysteries Arabian
It poisoned my mind
A sickness in my soul
I tried
I didn't want to hear at all
A curtain fell
Before my eyes I did
Succumb into her healing breast
She sang that song
I gave her all my soul
And my all
To the pleasures of the flesh
I cried that night
For those forsaken times
Those times when I was
Simply satisfied
I turned to dust
That night a thousand times
That night a thousand times I died inside
And through what's left
Of my sad life I hear
Her singing in the fevers of the night
Look into the mirror of my eyes
And tell me what you see
It's not your love I need
You'll see
Sorrow, tears and darkness
These are the pleasures
Beyond your dreams
I found myself
Down by the sea
A hundred years ago
When I was in my teens
And years go by
I turned into a man
My childhood trapped within the sand
I crawled through life
On broken glass through hell
It seems I wakened my desires
And woke one day
Wet with the sweat of fear
Wet with the sweat of fear
As now with you
I'll reveal your mother
Come to me
I'll take you to the safety of the womb
Tell me your secrets
Sorrow tears and darkness
Pour out your heart
Sorrow tears and darkness
You'll be a fool
A fool for love
And hell had never seemed so good
As when I lost my soul
Became a fool for love
Help me, please to find my way
Look into the mirror of my eyes
Your kiss has clouded up my mind
And tell me what you see
I was a fool, a fool for love
It's not your love I need
I cried for those forsaken times
You'll see
She took my soul in Istanbul
Sorrow tears and darkness
She left me on that night to die
These are the pleasures beyond your dreams
These are the pleasures beyond all my dreams
I am lost
Help me to find my way
Here in a world where angels fear to gaze
My love is doomed to die
Alone tonight in Istanbul
And I a fool
For
Love
















",She Took My Soul in Istanbul,1988
Marc Almond,"A little bitter
A little sweet
That's how I like my life to be
I'll take it neat
Bitter sweet
That's how I see the world

I like the dark
I like the mornings in the park
The summer heat
Bitter sweet

To paradise, Jack
Paradise, Jack
Let's go

I got the sorrow
I got the smile
I got a box under the stars
Shoes on my feet
Bitter sweet
That's how I see the world.
I got the joke
I got the twist
I got a lazy afternoon
I'm a man over the moon
Man of the world
Oh let's go
Let's go
To paradise, Jack
Paradise, Jack
Let's go
Let's go
To paradise, Jack
Paradise, Jack
Chain me to a tree
Watch me
I'll set myself free
Escape from situations
Houdini would be proud of me
I'll lie around like Byron
And write verses to the moon
I'm the crime and I'm the siren
I'm a fighter in the ring of life
I've got the medals
I've got the scars
I've got a pocket full of hope
I got the beat
Bitter sweet
That's how I see the world
And the moon is in my head
The moon is in my head
The moon is in my head
",Bitter Sweet,1988
Marc Almond,"He brings me flowers every morning
He brings the world onto my bed
He makes my bedroom into spring time
Violets, gardenias, roses red
He brings me tea and serves me chocolate
And I lick honey from his finger tips
He makes the world a little brighter
He makes my shadows a little lighter
I know where she keeps her money
I know she has but little time
I know that she completely trusts me
I've got her where I want her
She's completely mine
I've seen her brooches thick with diamond
I've seen her count her beads of jet and pearl
I'll bleed her of her soul and riches
I'm so happy that
Oblivious the bitch is
Kept boy
You kept me enraptured
Kept boy
You keep breaking my heart
Kept boy
I kept you encaptured
Kept boy
You keep playing the part
He cooks me dinner with the trimmings
He polishes my silverware
With tears of joy my eyes are brimming
Without him my world would be very bare
I know where she keeps her papers
Her testaments, her deeds to own the house
Her trusting look keeps me in stitches
I'm so happy that
Oblivious the bitch is
Kept boy
You kept me enraptured
Kept boy
You keep breaking my heart

I kept you encaptured

Keep playing the part
Kept boy

Kept boy
You keep breaking my heart
Kept boy
I kept you encaptured
Kept boy
Keep playing the part
He brings me flowers every morning
He brings the papers to my bed
Opens the curtains to my bedroom
And chases bad dreams from my head
And as we celebrate your birthday
The one you thought would be my last
There's something bitter in the champagne
Something working very fast
Oh, oh, how I'm, how I'm feeling very dizzy
The ceilings, the ceilings are becoming roundabouts
I caught your eyes upon my riches
Not so oblivious this bitch is
Kept boy
You kept me enraptured
Kept boy
No more playing a part
Kept boy
I'll keep you forever
And ever (x10)
Kept boy
I'll keep you forever
And ever (repeat to fade)

Marc Almond,"The clock on the wall has just told you
Your hour has come
And you know those that God loves
Die young

But remember
There is never forever

You're thinking too much about
Who will think badly of you
You throw away chances
Let love pass you by

But remember
There is never forever
Only the moment
There is never forever
Only the moment

Don't be afraid of the dark of the night
Just reach for your feelings
Let your mood tell you
You're making the right moves

The days fade away
And before you can say
I wish I'd made all the right moves
It's too late

With guilt on your shoulder
With fear in your heart
You're bedeviled by angels
Belittled by fools

But remember
There is never forever
Only the moment

Marc Almond,"Something's gotten hold of my heart
Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, turning me down
Making me smile and making me frown

In a world that was small
I once lived in a time that was peace
With no trouble at all
But then you came my way
And a feeling unknown shook my heart
Made me want you to stay
All of my nights and all of my days

Yeah I gotta tell you now
Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Yeah something has invaded my nights
Painting my sleep with a color so bright
Changing the grey, changing the blue
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you

I've got to know if this is the real thing
I've got to know what's making my heart sing, woah yeah

You smile and I'm lost for a lifetime
Each minute spent with you is the right time
Every hour, yeah, every day, yeah

You touch me and my mind goes astray
And baby yeah",Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart,1988
Marc Almond,"Do you remember those hazy amber days?
We were but children having the time of our lives
We had no regard or respect and a floor was a bed
And a bed held the mysteries of life

They had to end but so soon
And to sit in the dark of my lonely room
Made it all seem so cruelly real

Say no goodbyes, no regrets
For the things that we said and how we said
That we only wanted an answer to our dreams
We wanted an answer to our dreams

Ignorance is bliss
When adulthood we can't resist
To embrace the years with grace
What a waste, what a waste

The fun we had, the fun we'll have
Reckless immaturity

Woh, for stars we are and stars we'll be
Just you and me
Woh, for stars we are and stars we'll be

You fell into my life
Unforgettable smile
Unforgettable lies

In the name of the cross
Or a banner of love
With the hand of a friend
Or under a blanket of trust

Around my head
When a war breaks out
It'll be no surprise

Your unforgettable smile
Your unforgettable lies
And I've got to stop running
To make my start

We've got to get together
Before we fall apart
They're pulling down the old slums

They're bringing back the old rules

Marc Almond,"I'm a labyrinth of hopes and fears
Of tears of frustration and of anger
But if you can break through this wall
And search amongst it all
You'll find a man there
Who has a heart of love
Who is afraid of getting jaded
Growing older
Who needs someone to love him
Through life's winter
When the weather grows a little colder

I know I have a darker side
A cruel streak
I'm selfish and demanding
But I'm a man with a vision
It just takes a little understanding

And in my hand
The grains of sand
A thousand million moments of emotion
Oh...these
Oh...these my dreams are yours

I'm a boat well rocked by wave and wind
I've sinned, I'd win
No prizes for perfection
But at best I've given all my all
My shoulder for your tears
And your protection
And if one day I don't wake up
Remember I was good upon reflection
And if they say I was a fool
Be cool, but demand correction

A thousand million moments of emotion
Oh...these
Oh...these my dreams are yours

You can have my smile my tears

To adorn you
I'll whisper in the night to you
Promise to adore and never scorn you
And as we grow a little older
Try to understand more of each other
I will be your golden eye
Your master of illusion
Or just your lover

I'll be a dragonfly, a butterfly
A secret or a little lie to test you
A song a verse a lullaby
A symphony once in a while
To try and impress you
I'll take your heart to the limit
The colors of my joy
My tears to dress you
But sometimes dear
My heart's my own
I don't wish to exclude you or
Distress you

When your kisses burn
Why are my lips like ice?

Who recount the wars
And stronger than
The great who've made us make them

The murmur of summer
The rising of blood
The mother soft songs
The children's prayer
And the noise of the earth

Dried it in my hand
Covered it in poison
And I threw it on the land
On wasted ground it tried to root
But choked upon the sand

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Tuesday I took a bird
Such pain to hear it sing
I blackened it with petrol
And oiled it's little wings
I tainted the breeze
As I threw it to the wind

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Wednesday I took a man
He begged please help me die
For he lay in pain and suffering
It made his loved ones cry
I can be terrible and gentle
In the blinking of an eye

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Thursday I took a woman
Heavy with a child
My old friend rape had paid a visit
Had stayed a little while
In a back street I touched her
With a wire and a smile

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Friday I took a city
Cursed it with a plague
Powdered crystals, smoking pipes
To crush and to enslave
And a row of dirty needles
Lines the route onto the grave

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Saturday I took a country
Praying for the rain
Parched throats and swollen lips
Without a harvest grain
And I wiped out generations
And I'd do it all again

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

On Sunday I took the world
A bomb I did employ
Seven days to create life
And one day to destroy
Every woman every man
Every girl and boy

And there's room in my diary for you, my friend
And there's room in my diary for you

Now as I close my diary
And I've made my final date
I blow away the ashes
And I stoke the smoking grate
I've no distinction between pain and joy
No line twixt love and hate

There's no room in my diary for you, my friend
There's no room in my diary for you

Marc Almond,"She's in my veins
Gold in my veins
She is my pain
And my joy
Time and again
Waxing or waning
I am insane
For La Luna
Madame de la Luna
When she is sleepy
She's creepy, mysterious and wicked
When she is full
She is full of promise and joy
Beaming her smile
All the while
Across Heaven's horizons
Weaving her dreams
Into hearts of lonely boys
But when I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
When I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
She'll bring out the killer
Bring out the lover
She loves a tyrant, a pirate, a dreamer, a crook and a liar
A joker, a trickster, romancer, a dancer and fool
Cold as the frost but in her heart is a fire
Hanging around the dark throat of the night like a jewel
But when I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
When I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
Moon, moon, delirious moon
Alone in the blue
Like a silver balloon
Moon, moon, delirious moon
Dancing a waltz
To a lunatic's tune
Madame de la Luna
Bewitching is she
I cannot live without her
She's scattering stars
Dancing with Mars
Cheek to cheek
With La Luna
Cheek to cheek
With La Luna
Madame de la Luna
She sings as she brings in the harvest
She pulls out her tongue
At the cruel Ethiopian sun
When she's hiding
The dark can bring a terrible vengeance
A pounce in the shadows
A moment alone with a gun
Adrift on a sea of indigo silk
Passionate like an Arabian torch
Enticing two lovers to jump off a bridge
Changing the man into the wolf
Sometimes she's a terrible flirt
Causing mischief and mayhem wherever she can
Sometimes she's a woman that hurts
Sometimes she is a man
Encouraging drunks to sing coarse serenades
Lighting the way for the young renegades
But when I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
When I'm under the moon with you
I'm in Heaven
She says better times are gonna come soon
Better times are gonna come soon
Trust in the moon
Trust in the moon

Marc Almond,"I remember the sea I remember
How I thought she would sing forever
Though her voice it became a whisper
But the sea still sings in her heart

To the furthest shores of alaska
From the bow of a floundering tanker
Her shores in eternal winter
But the sea still sings in her heart

She waits for the moment
So still and alone
On her shoreline a necklace of feather and bone
No laughter of children
Where nothing will grow
But the sea still sings
The sea still sings
The sea still sings in her heart

I remember the sea, I remember
How she rose in a terrible temper
On a stormy night in September
How the sea still sings in her heart

Taking back all her stolen treasure
Giving back all our waste with a pleasure
Hand in hand with a furious weather
How the sea still sings in her heart

No longer distraught and no longer alone
She took all our shorelines and made them her own
Drowned all the people asleep in their homes
The sea still sings
The sea still sings
The sea still sings in her heart

The mermaids were singing a warning
The mermen were teasing and taunting
The sirens a song that was haunting
Tearing each ship from it's mooring
And the sea shed her black coat of mourning

I remember the sea I remember
The stillness and calm of the water
And a song that went on forever
The sea still sings
The sea still sings
The sea still sings
The sea still sings in her heart
",The Sea Still Sings,1990
Marc Almond,"She draped herself in widow weeds
Veil of black and buttoned sleeves
Hid her face from the world
A shadow where once had been a girl

Her husband of past twenty years
Had passed away leaving her in tears
Heart full of the future's fears
She kneels beside his grave

Where should be colour every day
Just widow weeds, her friends all say
""please stop your tears and throw away
Those widow weeds of black and grey""

Then she did wail a chilling sound
Beat her fists and hit the ground
She moaned his name, she pulled her hair
She chanted verse and muttered prayer
How could a man so just, so good
Leave her a widow like he could

Where should be colour every day
Just widow weeds, her friends all say
""please stop your tears and throw away
Those widow weeds of black and grey""

And deep within chador of lace
The deep etched sorrow on her face
This madonna in her cowl of grief
Subservient in her belief

Then came the reading of the will
Grief had hold within her still
But unable to believe her ears
She stopped her sobbing, halted tears

Not a penny, not a pound
No provision to be found
Not a thought of recognition
The will was read with cold precision

Anger jumped up in her breast
Well maybe this was for the best
Even as the will was blessed
She tore away her veil

Tears of rage to tears of joy
No more grief from death's envoy
No more weeping, gnashing teeth
No more prostrate with grief

She thought he loved her
So sure he loved her
She thought he loved her
So sure he loved her

But all his treasure all his wealth
Just signify love for himself
Just signify love for himself

The chador fell unto the earth
Witness a woman's rebirth
Witness a woman's rebirth

She exorcised grief's ugly demon
With a new found sense of freedom

Where should be colour every day
Just widow weeds, now she can say
She stopped her tears and threw away
Those widow weeds of black and grey

A singer with a Spanish bum
Who sings for women of great virtue
I'd sing to them with a guitar
I borrowed from a coffee bar
Well, what you don't know doesn't hurt you

My name would be Antonio
And all my bridges I would burn
And when I gave them some they'd know
I'd expect something in return

I'd have to get drunk every night
And talk about virility
With some old grandmother
That might be decked out like a Christmas tree

And no pink elephants I'd see
Though I'd be drunk as I could be
I'd sing that song they sang to me
About the time they called me 'Jacky'

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

And if I joined the social whirl
Became procurer of young girls
Then I could have my own bordellos
My record would be number one
And I'd sell records by the ton
All sung by many other fellows

My name would then be Handsome Jack
And I'd sell boats of opium
Whiskey that came from Twickenham
Authentic queens and phoney virgins

I'd have a bank on every finger
A finger in every country
And every country ruled by me
I'd still know where I wanna be

Locked up inside my opium den
Surrounded by some china men
I'd sing the song that I sang then
About the time they called me 'Jacky'

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
And I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

That if one day in paradise
I'd sing for all the ladies up there?
And they would sing along with me
And we be so happy there to be
'Cause down below is really nowhere

My name would then be Jupiter
Then I would know where I was going
Become all knowing
My beard so very long and flowing

If I could play deaf, dumb and blind
Because I pitied all mankind
And broke my heart to make things right
I know that every single night

When my angelic work was through
The Angels and the Devil too
Could sing my childhood song to me
About the time they called me 'Jacky'

Marc Almond,"When I was seventeen
I was chasing after dreams
In southport
I had to get away
Or end up in a nursing home alone
When I was seventeen
I had a special love
And southport
Didn't seem a bad place after all

On the promenade
The carnival facade is peeling
And the floral clock
Has stopped a moment caught in time
Such a sad decay
Well, it's something like the way I'm feeling
For such a dream so big
Southport seemed a little bit too small

And I was still naive
I really did believe in magic
Thought I had found a love
And treasured it above all else
But then I looked beyond
I saw another life was waiting
I was chasing after dreams
I had to find them by myself

I hope you understand
Such a love could never be
The sea has turned my soul
And it aches to be free
I will always think
Of southport at the fair
Summer on the beach
The fun that we had there

With southport in my mind
But las vegas in my heart
I set out to search for the stars
But every dream I dream
Follows where you've been
And it's tearing my heart apart

When I was seventeen
I left to find my dream
From southport
January came
I blame myself for out goodbyes
Nothing is so sad
As the sea side out of season
And nothing is so sad
As you and I

When I was seventeen
I was chasing after dreams
In southport
I had to get away
Or end up in a nursing home alone
And now it seems I'd never been
A boy of seventeen
In southport
It didn't last
A lifetime passed
A love outgrown

Was it all a dream
Or was it all for real
I'm standing on the pier
I'm trying not to feel
The tears are in my eyes
Your face is in the sand
I'm trying to look down
I'm reaching out my hand
I'm falling to the wind
I'm waiting for the sea
But the sea is never in
It's never in for me
In southport
(it's never in for me)

Day and no dawning
And the tears that keep falling
Over me
Dream with no ending
Darkness descending
And the years that keep calling
Out to me

And soon comes the morning sun
Exposing my desires
And then my heart will die
My eyes will burn as I start to cry
Eyes that seem only to weep
Eyes that reveal a fear
Where should be only sleep
A fear tomorrow may find me here
I push my tired body on
In keeping the dawn at bay
Afraid of what I`ve become
Afraid of another day
And soft is the rain on my face
Lady Night weaves her magic spell
Hiding that which I fear
The face I knew only so well

Night and no morning
Day and no dawning
And the tears that keep falling
Over me
Endlessly searching 
My hunger returning
Loneliness burning
Into me

If I believed in God
I`d pray for the dawn to stay away
For as the dawn awakes
This light will flicker, flicker and die
Eyes that are hungry as mine
Eyes that are desperate as mine
We look and we recognise
Both seeing something we despise

My eyes have seen tomorrow
My eyes have seen the truth
The all revealing eyes
Eyes that once burned, burned with youth
Eyes will reveal what is true
Eyes that look deep, deep in mine
Eyes that belonged to someone I love
Those eyes belong to someone like you",Night and No Morning,1991

Is a beautiful brutal thing
It sings at night like the wind
It stings your heart like a whip
It rocks your soul like a ship
And love
Is a beautiful brutal thing

Or nothing at all

Or as small as a distant star
It's the cushion to break your fall
Love triumphs over all

Is a beautiful brutal thing
And it gives the sweetest of pain
It wakes your spirit and then
You feel like living again
And rain
Falls when you think the Sun
Has just begun
To shine above
And love
Is mysterious as it's old
It's the secret you've never told
It's the tears of sorrow and joy
For that girl or that boy
It makes you feel
It makes you feel
It makes you feel
A beautiful brutal thing
And love
Is a beautiful brutal thing

Or nothing at all

Or as small as a distant star

A man against the world
But don't look at me
And see an unhappy man
With some powder and some paint
And the patience of a saint

I'm not up there on the shelf

Apart from just myself
I've had my fill of bitterness
I've had my fill of dirt
I've had enough of emptiness
I've had enough of hurt
I think we'll get the last laugh
If we don't break down and cry
And find the joke's
On you and I
Look at us
Do you see us in a burlesque show
Look at us are we in vaudeville
We've tasted every thrill
Every powder every pill
And we're still here
I've had enough of broken cups
I've had enough of scenes
Of other people's laughter
When we go through our routines
The lilies aren't in season

To think about the road I've run the miles I've come
There is a bed where troubles melt away
My lonely hours or hours with you
The times that we've come through

There is a bed where we shared times of love
And out of love those nights are memories best forgot
We argued about trivial things
And slept apart a wall we built among the sheets

There is a bed where sickness left its touch
And fever damp the sheets where I would shake all night
Cold burning on my brow
Hallucinations here and now
A fight to live or die

There is a bed where first we both made love
And left the marks, reminders of how good it felt
The hard, the soft, the sweat in midnight's hour
We built the fort, we climbed the tower

There is a bed where years will make us wise
Truth and lies defeat, despise and forgiving
The sheets our cradle birth to death
The twists and turns of love, the life we're living

There is bed where nights I lay awake
To think about my future to forget my past
My bed a boat to sail the seas
To land where safety finds me gripping to the mast

And though I feel the years slip through my fingers
Sorrow lingers and won't go away

A bed where I can end my days

Sprawled across a black piano
Hollerin' the blues

What a way to go go go

You know, like the way when you treat me nice
Love that's as rough as morning mouth
Open up the stitches let it all fall out

Home is side by side we lie
Love the lie we're living
Glamour and the tragedy
For playing and forgiving
Broken bracelets, broken dates
And half a bottle of heartache

Frills and thrills the worlds evils
Knocking me off of the windowsill
Twenty million stories to not get to you
God I'm coming, hallelujah

Home is side by side we lie
Love the lie we're living
Glamour and the tragedy
For playing and forgiving
Broken bracelets, broken dates
And half a bottle of heartache

Bee stung lips and beefsteak eyes
Kick mark hips and a blue back tie

Repeat chorus
Broken bracelets, broken dates
And half a bottle of heartache

Whoa.....yeah
You gave me broken bracelets, broken dates
And half a bottle of heartache

Marc Almond,"The one who has me for his own
Is on the town and not alone
In his blue suit and his new tie
He slams the door without goodbye
Tonight my eyes are jealous green
Tonight I'm melancholy mean
He meets in secret rendezvous
Some dame to tell his troubles to
The heel

He'll promise her most anything
A sable coat, a diamond ring
She'll find him out when it's too late
And all she'll get will be the date
But while the dawn's a distant thing
In his embrace her heart will sing
A dizzy head will spin with lies
And all too late a woman cries
The heel

The neon lights that flash below
Ignite my room with double glow
And in the gloom I hear a laugh
It's coming from his photograph
I wring my hands and mop the floor
And swear to even up the score
But where a kitten cried tonight
A panther waits to claw and bite
The heel

I dare not play my radio
One more complaint and out I go
I'm sick of playing solitaire
The ace of spades is everywhere
There'll be no sleep for me tonight
The sheep I count are never white
They all turn out to be jet black
And who's the leader of the pack
The heel

At dawn I know he'll stagger in
Demanding coffee black as sin
And as I take it from the tin
I'll slip a little powder in
He'll look at me and start to cry
And cross his heart and hope to die
And mumble I know how you feel
But I've been on a business deal
The heel

Then as the pot begins to perc
I know my plan will never work
When he starts to drink it up
I grab his hand and break the cup
It's only jealousy I know
That brought my thinking down so low
Why must I wait for him and grieve?
Why don't I just pack up and leave?
The heel

But now he's reeling on the stair
I'll try to act like I don't care
For in my heart's arithmetic
I find it takes two heels to click
We're in a web of love and hate
Where it will end is up to fate
I'll let him have his little flings
I'll be the chewing gum that clings
To the heel",Heel,1994
Marc Almond,"Drawing back the curtains
Sluggish city daylight in the afternoon
Here's that special silence
Just before you walk out of the hotel room
Each time we're so close I assume
That we'll never be again
Oh, how long must we pretend?

A casual affair
Was all that you could spare
From your emotional change
A calendar of greetings
Strangers on the street
The best we've ever arranged

Now I just can't stand all the pain
All the constant break and mend
Oh, how long can we pretend
That we're just good friends?

I gave you my devotion
Hiding nothing up my sleeve
If I walked clean out of your life
Would you even notice me?
So much tangled up emotion
Should I stay or should I go?
If I walked clean out of your life
How long would it take you to know?
Are we such good friends?

And how sordid this has become
As the means approach the end
And how long can we pretend?

I gave my devotion
Hiding nothing up my sleeve
If I walked clean out of your life
Would you even notice me?
So much tangled up emotion
Should I stay or should I go?

How long would it take you to know?
Are we still good friends?",Just Good Friends,1994
Marc Almond,"I went walking down by the river
Feeling very sad inside
When all at once I saw in the sky
The little white cloud that cried
He told me he was very lonesome
No one cared if he lived or died
He said sometimes the thunder and lightening
Make all the little clouds cry
He said, ""Have faith in all kinds of weather
Through the sun will always shine
Do your best and always remember
The dark clouds pass with time.""
He asked me if I would tell all my world
Just how hard those little clouds try
That's how I know I'll always remember
The little white cloud that sat right down and cried
",Little White Cloud That Cried,1994
Marc Almond,"I've spent many a night
Lying on my back
Waiting for the dawn
To pierce and crack
And the ceiling
Hanging from the sky
And I envy the boy 
Who grabbed the toy
And ran away
And found a joy
While I stood in the shadows 
Wondering why

Flying towards me
Then he laughs
A woman's face
The terrible taste
Of the morning after kisses
And goodbyes
I could never seem to catch my footsteps
Have desires, they fly away
Every day I have to fight the plague

How can I sleep in hours like this
When anguish tracks me like a fist
My nakedness exposed, I can't stand
Still I...try to remember lips on lips
Hips on hips and ice on fire
In gloom and glow 
When did they leave the man

In the mirror of the night I see
A face that staring out at me
Like a fallen star
Burned itself out
Like a deadly scrapes 
Across the ground
My voice cried out
In a gravelled sound
No one's there to hear me
But the plague

Straining hard to see
Running after me
I keep pounding pounding on the door
But it's all so vague
When you meet the plague
And I keep coming
I keep coming back for more ",Plague,1994
Marc Almond,"All hands on deck
We're all afloat
I heard the captain cry
Explore the ship
Replace the cook
Let no one leave alive
Across the straits
Around the Horn
How far can sailors fly
The twisted path
Our tortured course
And no left alive
We sailed for parts
Unknown to man
Where ships come home to die
No lofty peak
No fortress bold
Could match our captain's eye
Upon the seventh
Seasick day
We made our port of call
The sun so white
And the sea so blue
No mortal place at all
We fired the gun
And burned the mast
And rode from ship to shore
The captain cried
We sailors wept
But our tears were tears of joy
How many moons
And how many Junes
Have passed since we made love
A salty dog
And a seaman's log
Your witness my own pain

Marc Almond,"Try hard to make the world look bright today
Try hard to make my nightmares go away
Try hard to keep the fear away
The cold of day, try hard
Try hard to play the games the world would like you to play

But people, they don't really listen
Their smiles are the keys to the prison
I'll call on the angels, to hold my head softly
They'll always remember

Try hard to make my money last the day (no way)

Marc Almond,"A stiletto scrapes the pavement
Leaving a red streak of paint
Breaks a sweat upon the sailors
To them she is a saint
Tattoo on the muscle
That says
'in love forever I'
She'll take them and she'll break them
Oh come hold me till I die.

Anarcoma, anarcoma, anarcoma

There's a ladder in her nylons
Where we can climb up to the stars
Join a queue of borsalinos
As you bend over the bar
Tattoo on her muscle says
'beware, behave, be mine'
She'll eat them up for breakfast
One at a time

Anarcoma, anarcoma, anarcoma

Well come on if you need loving
Pirondelllo don't be shy
It just takes a little money
And we'll get there by and by
For I've got a little more
Than any other girl
You pay a little extra
For a trip around the world
And if the world is not enough
Then I'll take you to the sky
Put you in an armhold
Blacken both your eyes
For you'll find no other woman
That will love you like I do
I'll just open up the oven door
And leave the cooking up to you

Anarcoma, anarcoma, anarcoma

And she took me to her room
That had never seen the light
Those sheets had seen a legion
And she beat me up all night
And over morning coffee
She shook her black hair from it's mess
Her lips a gash of lipstick
And she sucks a cigarette

You could be mine
You could be mine

Marc Almond,"And here I sit
A cowardly boy
Adventure only dreams

A captain of
A pirate ship
A million crimson themes

I wish to be
Content you see
To take the softer seat

To summon gut
To play the slut
My bass drum for to beat

Hey!

Gyp the blood
Gyp the blood
Anchor in my heart
Skull and crossbones to the breeze
A heave ho to depart

But it happened that
There came a ghost
To visit on my soul

I coloured him
From picture books
With eyes as rich as gold

A ghost who would
Embody
All my sickly frame would be

A hero
And a challenger
Of heart and spirit free

Hey!

Gyp the blood
Gyp the blood
Anchor of my heart
Skull and crossbones to the breeze
A heave ho to depart

And gyp the blood
And I retook
The world upon our backs

And we drank from dawn
To dusk
How the warm breeze took our drags

For we had the reins
On europe we
Had our anger like a flame

The balls to fight
The system
And the nerve to win the game

Gyp the blood
Gyp the blood
Anchor of my heart
Skull and crossbones to the breeze
A heave ho to depart

So purity
I would spit upon
All saintly sights be damned

For it seems correct
To kill and steal
To be a proper man

I find myself
Full up with hate
To lose it on the world

An eye for deeds
Of darker shade
And a lip so wickedly curled

A skull encrusted
Captains hat
Fell down upon my brow

I gathered all
My hopes and schemes
All wisdom for to know

And rip the shirts
I wore around
My shoulders like a robe

Dark ermine trim
And tainted grin
Grim warnings to forbode

And all the love within me
Would be churned for something sour
My angels tongue ripped from my throat
And tortured by the hour

For I have no time to learn
For love wounds me with it's touch
May the gods take me a screaming
May the gods take me a screaming...

Gyp the blood

Anchor of my heart
Skull and crossbones to the breeze
A heave ho to depart

May the gods take me a screaming

Marc Almond,"Ahh you people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors
And I'm scrubbing these floors while you're gawking
Maybe once you tip me and it makes you feel swell
In this crummy southern town
In this pit of hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talking
No
You'll never guess to who you're talking

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you wonder: ""who could that have been ? ""
And you see me kind of grinning while I'm scrubbing
And you say ""what she got to grin ? ""
I'll tell ya
There's a ship
The black freighter
With a skull on it's mast-head
Will be coming in

You gentlemen say: ""hey gal, finish them floors
What's wrong with you ? earn your keep here""
You toss me your tips and look to the ships
But I'm counting your heads as I'm making the beds
'cause there's nobody gonna sleep here tonight
No
Nobody
No-one
No-one

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say: ""who's that kicking up a row? ""
And you see me kinda staring out the window
And you say: ""what she got to stare at now ? ""
I'll tell ya
There's a ship
The black freighter
Turns around in the harbour
Shooting guns from her bow

Well you gentlemen can wipe those smiles off your face
'cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frigging place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up, safe and sound
And you yell: ""why do they spare that one ?
""why?
""why the hell do they spare that one ? ""

All the night through with the noise and to do
And you wonder: ""who is that person that lives up there ? ""
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking fine with a ribbon in my hair
Well just look at me now
And a ship
The black freighter
Runs a flag up it's mast-head
And a cheer rings the air. hey!

My ? ? ? on the dock is a swarming with men
Coming out from the ghostly freighter
They're moving in the shadows where no-one can see
And they're chaining up people
And delivering 'em to me
Asking me: ""kill them now or later ? ""
Asking me: ""kill them now or later ? ""

Noon by the clock and so still at the dock
You can hear a fog horn miles away
And in that quiet of death I'll say:
""right now !""
""right now !""
And they pile up the bodies
And I'll say: ""that'll learn you.
That'll learn you.""

And the ship
The black freighter
Disappears out to sea
And
On
It
Is
Me !

Marc Almond,"I was only a child when I met you.
You came from the Burma Lagoon.
You said, ""Would you like a bit of travel?""
You promised me all but the moon.
I asked you what you did for a living.
And you swore, God's my witness, to me.
That you worked for the railroad people,
And would never ever follow the sea.

You said a lot, Johnny.
Not a word was true, Johnny.
You betrayed me, Johnny
The moment we met.
I hate your guts Johnny.
Don't stand there grinning
Take that cigarette out of your mouth, you pig.

Surabaya Johnny,
Why did you treat me so wrong?
Surabaya, Johnny,
My God, and I do love you so.
Surabaya, Johnny,
Why am I feeling so low?
You have no heart, Johnny.
And I do love you so.

At first, it was always Sunday,
As long as I pleased you at night.
But only a few weeks later,
Not a thing I did was right.
Up and down we tramped through the Punjab,
The river along to the sea.
But now when I look in the mirror,
There's a broken face that I see.

You wanted no love, Johnny.
You wanted the loot, Johnny.
But your lips, Johnny,
I could never forget.
You asked for everything, Johnny,
I gave you more, Johnny.
Take that cigarette out of your mouth, you shit

Surabaya, Johnny.
Why did treat me so bad?
Surabaya, Johnny,
My God, and I love you so.
Surabaya, Johnny.
Why am I feeling so low?
You have no heart, Johnny,
And I do love you so.

I wish I had paid more attention
To that nickname of yours and the rest.
All along that bloody awful coastline,
You have been a notorious guest.
In a sixpence-a-night bed one morning,
I will wake to the thunder of the sea.
And your ship will be leaving the harbor,
And you won't even wave to me.

You have no heart, Johnny!
You're a bastard, Johnny!
Why did you leave me?
Can you tell me that?
I love you more, Johnny,
Than the first night, Johnny.
Take that fucking cigarette out of your mouth, you shit.

A fish from the China Sea
At times one sees it crossing
Diminished in his eyes
Being sea man he forgets
Bars and oranges

He looks at the water

He had a soapy tongue
He washed his hands and was still
Level world hilly sea
A hundred stars and his ship
He saw the balconies of the pope
And the golden breasts of the Cuban girls

He looks at the water

Just me and the world alone
Oh why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

Oh why is the world filled with people
It makes for a painful life
You'll disappoint me if you don't disappoint me
Come and dance with the tip of my knife

Why is the night filled with laughter
At expense of the sickest of jokes
While the world is a blot and it's cistern's fill up
On the dross and the shit we call folks

Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone
Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

Oh why is the world filled with the people
They snear and they snide and they moan
And the way I am now it seems I am one of them
Having grudges of my own

And why is this street a-crawling with cockroaches
Insects with two arms, two legs
Leaving their stink and their filth and their debris
I'll break all their faces like eggs

Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone
Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone
Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

Oh why is the world filled with people
A-choking the air with their breath
Grunting like hogs in the sludge and the sewerage
Cringing from wonderful death
Oh why do my ears have to ring with their bantering
Bitching and ignorant words
Giving me aches with pathetic opinion
People, it's fact, are insufferable turds

Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone
Why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

Oh why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone
Oh why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

And I can't bear the little creeps
That tell me they hate my hair
They're always incredibly ugly
If they dropped dead tomorrow I wouldn't care
They feel that they have to comment
Have to put up with their penneth-worth
They're sick, hypocritical, mincing, unwitty
Not worth a spit in the dirt

They're not worth a spit in the dirt
They're not worth a spit in the dirt

Oh why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone
Oh why can't I be on my own
Just me and the world alone

Marc Almond,"And if one day I should become
A singer with a Spanish bum
Who sings for women of great virtue
I'd sing to them with a guitar
I borrowed from a coffee bar
Well, what you don't know doesn't hurt you
My name would be Antonio
And all my bridges I would burn
And when I gave them some they'd know
I'd expect something in return
I'd have to get drunk every night
And talk about virility
With some old grandmother
That might be decked out like a Christmas tree
And no pink elephant I'd see
Though I'd be drunk as I could be
Still I would sing my song to me
About the time they called me ""Jacky""

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

And if I joined the social whirl
Became procurer of young girls
Then I could have my own bordellos
My record would be number one
And I'd sell records by the ton
All sung by many other fellows
My name would then be handsome Jack
And I'd sell boats of opium
Whiskey that came from Twickenham
Authentic queens
And phony virgins
I'd have a bank on every finger
A finger in every country
And every country ruled by me
I'd still know where I'd want to be
Locked up inside my opium den
Surrounded by some china men
I'd sing the song that I sang then
About the time they called me ""Jacky""

If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way

Now, tell me, wouldn't it be nice
That if one day in paradise
I'd sing for all the ladies up there
And they would sing along with me
And we be so happy there to be
'Cause down below is really nowhere
My name would then be ""Jupiter""
Then I would know where I was going
Become all knowing
My beard so very long and flowing
If I could play deaf, dumb and blind
Because I pitied all mankind
And broke my heart to make things right
I know that every single night
When my angelic work was through
The angels and the Devil too
Could sing my childhood song to me
About the time they called me ""Jacky""

If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour

I brush my teeth and comb my hair

And asked me, has he gone away

I lied to her like I lied to him
I lie to myself about everything

Love is a season
Love is a case of love

And all of those who might have been

I cry to myself about everything

Love, what is love?
Love, what is love?

Love is a fever
Love is a dream
Sometimes so hard, it can make you scream
Love is a liar
Love can be cruel
Love is an icon, love is a jewel

They let you down
They leave you standing in the rain
They take the joy and leave the pain

Caught between two love affairs
Is it true that no one really cares
My lonely neighbor leaves today
And no one comes to take her place
I lied to her like I lied to him
Now they're gone can I lie about anything

And by the sunrise I'll belong to you

I'm talking to the radio

Clean my teeth and comb my hair
Look for something new to wear
And start the nightlife over again
And kid myself I'm having fun

'Mother, things are getting better'
Watch the mirror, count the lines
The battle scars of all the good times
Look around and I can see
A thousand people just like me.

Give yourself to the heat
Sacrifice yourself to the beat
The rhythm of love
The beat of your heart
Don`t follow the rules
This love can be cruel

Come on now
Oh yeah!

The law of the night...
It`s the danger you love
The danger you feel
The fear is your fuel
Excitement is real
The joy of the ride
Your heart at the wheel
Is your mind in enough confusion?

Feeling so free
Is all that you know
Your hand on the gun
With no-one to know
And all your desires
Have nowhere to go
You`re in need of a love transfusion

Give yourself to the heat
Sacrifice yourself to the beat
The rhythm of love
The beat of your heart
Don`t follow the rules
This love can be cruel

And you`re lost in a passion of fire
As you climb between shadow and light
Just a slave to the rules of desire
You surrender to the law of the night

The law of the night
The law of the night
Is fueling you on
The flick of the knife
The draw of the gun
The thrill of the ride
While still on the run
No time to think of tomorrow

The glamor of violence
Deep in your soul
Your hand at the wheel
With nowhere to go
You`re taking a trip

Marc Almond,"In the city of nights
In the city of nights

As the lights go on there`s a magic glow to the sea
But as we move through the streets we can feel the fear
As night goes on there`s a tragic show in the city
Those songs are on the ebb and mixed with tears

And down the alleyway the drunks are fighting
Over who will have the last drink from the can
It all seems so romantic in the lying
But what a sad existence for a man

There`s speeders, dealers, girls of easy virtue
Laughter, lies and lovers sparkling eyes
Glitter boys and girls out for the dancing
Good time girls and boys out for the highs

And there`s a hotel on hope street
Where the concierge will understand your needs
She doesn`t care your colour or religion
And she always has a room for you and me

In the city of nights
In the city of nights

There`s an oriental flavour in the city
Marta Haries, saris and sarongs
Incense candles, prayer and incantations
Golden girls Arabia in their song

It seems the doors are closed on the asylums
And in the street they`re putting on a show
Talking to themselves they get no answer
Or suggestions for a better place to go

In the city of nights
In the city of nights

A young man dreams of the open sea
In the year from no God knows where he`ll be
No open door to set him free
No open door to set him free

Girls sell kisses to the lonely men
Boys turn tricks with the sleight of hand
Women fear to walk where men desire
Inspiration, hope and fire

Hey don`t be a stranger
Make a friend don`t let it end you
Hey don`t be a stranger
There`s a light burning in the city
In the city
In the city of nights

As the sun goes down there`s a wind blowing through the city
A darker day as summer says goodbye
Another world is waking in the city
All live fears, important knowing eyes

And there amongst the litter and the debris
The sally army busking out a song
Drowning out the sound of breaking windows
Sing along, sing along, sing along

Her grace unmistakingly latin
You can buy her a drink

When she powders her nose
Nobody knows

And after her dance
In a dressing room dusty and dirty
She squints in the mirror
And tells herself never again
She's pushing an age that hits on the wrong side of thirty
She pulls off her wig
But the stain of the make-up remains

Exotica rose
Lives in a rented apartment
She's working all hours
To meet all the bills and demands
She's a girl with a difference
Or two in every department
Life isn't easy
With a wife and two kids on her hands

Marc Almond,"On a dark night in a lost hour
In a town built from neon and chrome
Where las vegas seeks the desert
In an old broken down casino
There the gambler slapped his money down
Dirty dollars one hundred or more
Placed his last bet on a poker game
Crossed his heart for the winning score

But the players at the table
Two men of the phantom creed
Seemed to play with sombre purpose
Than a reason and pure greed
And the gambler felt his back freeze
And fear brushed his ageing brow
For he'd seen those men before in his dreams
Here they sat before him now

And the one smoothed back his black hair
With a comb slicked by brylcream and grease
Flipped the cards with a flippancy
Of a wily and slippery ease
With his sharp suit shade of lilac
On a shuffle he made the cards sing
Gold studs and menthol cigarettes
Rubies set in a skull ring

And the other of the clergy
With a colour and robe of pale ivory
Silver grey at the temples
And a smile that was stern and was kindly

Jack of hearts lead, wait for aces
Became faces of family and friends
Until the deck showed him a picture
Of his life from beginning to end
Reverend life he flipped an ace
And the gambler felt blood in his heart
For he knew this was the game of games
He would need all the reverend's heart

Anger, lust and gluttony
The gambler seems hit hard
Each failure and each feature
Mapped out in the slippery cards
Greasy mr.d. flashed a winning grin
And stood facing reverend life
The reverend paled as he saw the score
The gambler felt pain as a knife

His troubles, tribulations
Revelations and regrets
A wife, a child, a fight to trial
Turned by the hand of death
And the gambler saw his hand stained
With the blood of his family ties
And with the yellow smile of mr.d.
In his mind he crumples and dies

And these two great men from different worlds
Faced each other and shook of hands
The reverend shrugged ""ah well next time""
And departed for heaven's land

And the flames leapt and the soul screamed
And the cards scattered round the room
And life is always a gamble
A game from the cradle to tomb

And the flames leapt and the soul screamed
And the cards scattered round the room
And life is always a gamble
A game from the cradle to tomb

The king with the wooden crown
A throne alone
He's looking so sad and alone

King of his world
He roams through his kingdom at night
It looks so good
Until it all fades into the morning light

Sad but so beautiful
Dark yet so wonderful
Hold your head high because
Sorrow becomes you, you wear it so well
Sorrow becomes you it's easy to tell
Though my heart always rules
I'll be king of the fools

Ruled by kings with wooden crowns
They are the fools

Like a king with a wooden crown

Chasing his youth his heart, nose to the wind
I really must cure my tender nostalgia
Bury deep my stars beneath the veil of night
I must postpone my Spanish chòteau
Dreams that befuddle like an old wine
I must also give up those sunny states
To become a man
And when that day comes
You will forgive me, you won't be surprised
When I show my teeth, when I show my bite
Then I will be a man
And I will stand tall
I really must share my classes with others
So my youth can pass at last, so I forget
I really must scrape my nails on my heart
That my life hardens with sorrow and pain
I must upset my guardian angels
Who soothed me too much
And when that day comes
You won't be annoyed
If I scratch a bit, if I practice being....so savage!
You will forgive me, you won't be surprised
When I show my teeth, when I show my bite

And I will stand tall
And you will be prepared to find before you
Someone who's like you, a wolf among the wolves

Marc Almond,"Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease the candle flame
A thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away
Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me, me, me and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
That never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay
For yesterday....when I was young, young, young,......young

Telling me you landed on your feet, after all
Now your bedroom eyes are looking tired
My baby has your sparkle died
You smile
But all the while your heart
Hardens up
With a cry

You're good at living out a lie
You know you're giving out a lie
You're always living out a lie
You know you're giving out a lie

I kissed your mind
While on the run
Once more I've been too near the sun
You filled the role
And love was hot
I watch the tv
Weeping now
It numbs my passions
Sleeping now
Some opera shallow drama
Fills up my life
And I ask myself why

I'm good at living out a lie
You know I'm giving out a lie
I'm always living out a lie
You know I'm giving out a lie

The poison barely passed our lips
The words are threads
The truth that never should be said
Friends can go between
Each pouring fuel upon the fire
The spider weaves her web
Of honesty and lies
But I need the pain
To feel alive
A twisted reason
To survive
I'll say I hate you
And with all of my heart
I will try

Oh god
Its just another lie
Its just another lie
Its just another lie
Its just another lie


It wasn't always cruel like this
Our dreams were chiffon and cerise
But promises made off our heads
Were just like pissing in the wind

Going out into the street at night
The answers he may meet hm hm
With sick and twisted minds
He shares the searching questions
His heart bears hm hm
And from the dregs
The answers find their way into his supple mind
In time the planted seeds will grow
Into a twisted vine below

And now his aimless days begin
To drift into sordid sin hm, hm
And soon his dislike turns to hate
As the stamp of life seals his fate hm, hm

Marc Almond,"On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to show off for us
There is the sun, the sand, and the arena
There are the bulls ready to bleed for us

It's time when grocery clerks
Become Don Juan
And all the ugly girls
Turn into swans

Who can say what he's found
That bull who turns and paws the ground
And suddenly he sees himself all nude
Who can say what he dreams
That bull who hears the silent screams
From the open mouths of multitudes

On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to suffer for us
There are the picadors and the mobs revenge
There are the toreros and the mob's revenge,
there are the toreros - and the mob kneels for us

It's time when grocery clerks
become Garcia-Lorca
And the girls put the roses in their teeth
Like Carmen

On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to drop dead for us
The sword will plunge down
And the mob will drool
The blood will poor down
And turn the sand to mud

It's time when grocery clerks
Become Nero
And the girls scream
And shout the name of their hero

And when finally they fell
Did the bulls dream of a hell
Where men and worn out matadors
Still burn
And perhaps with their last breath
Would they pardon us their death

Marc Almond,"Way back then I was a champion
A fighter in the ring
And all the crowds would cheer
My praises they would sing
Now I am a forgotten man
A hobo out alone
No champ to push me on
Nothing, no-one to call my own

I was a dark eyed boy
Stars in his eyes
Promises made flesh and blood
Grip of arm
And granite charm
Oh, times were golden
Times were good
Sinew young
And skin of ore
Molten and streaming with dreams
Now I nod away the days
Barely remembering names it seems

Oh, I would smile
To hear the bell
Ringing out my glory
Like a bull I paced the ring
My bloody territory

I held on high
The fist in glove
The symbol of my power
Now I wait
A punch drunk fool
To fade away forever

Broken noses
Broken jaws
And many broken hearts
An idol
And a hero
Till my courage fell apart
And now my brain a-ringing
With the final bell and count
They hold my hand up limply
Told the world
That I was OUT!
I didn't mind the scars
The blood
The crushing of the hand
But to lose a nation's
Love, respect
Is something I'll never understand

I'm gonna bury my head
And cry",The Champ,1998

Having heard all

They organized a grand feast
At the end of this feast 
The devil rose to deliver his speech
This is the jist of what he said
Okay!
Okay
The world up there is like a sea 
Of raging fires that spit and roar
Okay
And man has fought like crazy
With dangerous games of war
Okay
Trains are derailed
A crash
His boys filled with ideals
Place bombs on the tracks
Well that creates original death
That death creates without confession
Confessions without remission
Okay
Nothing is sold 
But all is bought
Honour and sainthood
Okay
And states change secretly
Into anonymous societies
Okay hey hey
And the mighty extort their dollars
From countries that are poor
And Europe also rips the scars
With it's post colonial gorge
That creates death from starvation
And starvation of nations 
Okay
And man has seen so much of it
That his eyes have become grey
Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
And no songs seem to exist
Except when sung on stage
Okay

And jack-ass poets get the elbow

Marc Almond,"A lover spurned, a lesson learned
On love you've got your fingers burnt
Shed bitter tears, now love has turned
The sweet revenge of a lover spurned

A passing phase, a week of love
But all at once you had enough
It pales so soon, waned with the moon
No deep concern for a lover spurned

She'll destroy you with her little games
See you swallow all the blame
Make you pay in many ways
For the pleasure of watching you squirm

She'll tell her friends to treat you rough
That you just weren't good enough
Make the going really tough
For the pleasure of watching you burn in hell

And every day, more guilt to pay
A lesson learned from a lover spurned

It was all so cozy for you
You had a wife, two children
And a beautiful house
And me, well you wanted me

When it suited your needs
And now, now I have nothing
Just a handful of faded photographs
Nothing but a cold empty heart

But I'm not easily forgotten
I'll appear when you least expect
To make you pay
You asked for it that way

She'll come to get you with a knife
Write poison letters to your wife
Totally destroy your life
For the pleasure of watching you squirm

She'll make a fool of you at work
Drag your name through the dirt
Make sure that it really hurts
For the pleasure of watching you burn in hell

A lover spurned, a lesson learned
On love you've got your fingers burnt
Shed bitter tears, now love has turned
The sweet revenge of a lover spurned
The sweet revenge of a lover spurned
",A Lover Spurned,1998
Marc Almond,"And he dances every night
Framed in candles
And white white light
All is revealed
When all is too bright
You're such a pleasure
A wonderful pain
Makes me never want
To love again
But sorrow always comes
To those with fickle fame

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

We are consumed by corruption
Old before our time
Hurt by others' hunger
Scarred by love as greed (how I need)
How cruel the birthday of 17
Youth behind you
The long years ahead
Showing you what you might have been
Instead of drifting, drifting, drifting

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

Foundations crumble
Walls subside
We all break apart
When there's heartache inside
Hold back those years
Those tears
With a futile pride (we're gonna come clean)
Beware of love
And of dark-eyed men
They're sweet and they're tender
But they have no hearts
Just long smashed
Cruel shards of broken glass

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

And all those songs
That made me cry
Keep flooding back
And years of new discovery and you
Disturbing my dreams
Now we're flowing down that river
Heading for the delta
I don't know which way to flow
But my heart's a forest fire
And yours a field of snow

I don't know which way to flow
Don't know which way
Don't know which way
To flow",The River,1998

Run with me
And tell me

Soothed all your fevers
Tousled your hair
Gave you my treasures
My shells and my shingle
Made you feel happy
When things seem so bad

The sea says
I gave you stories
Adventure and mystery
When all was not well
I sung you to sleep
Crept into the cracks
Of your imagination
Made you feel happy

Please don't go to pieces
Things can't be so bad
Why looking so sad

Then got up and walked away from me
And played around with me like I was a game
Every night was a one night fling
When I'd given them everything
They never even asked me for my name
God they never even asked me for my name
Now I've found real love
Make no mistake about it
Now that I feel love
I just can't live without it
So if you love me
The way I love you
Why can't we spend our lives as one
My reputation was all over town
As a woman who was passed around
I knew every wrong way to go
Seen every room with a bed inside it
And every habit I've tried, I tried it
But from now on I say hell no
No but from now on I say hell no
Now I've found real love
Make no mistake about it
Now that I feel love
I just can't live without it

Marc Almond,"A winter morning sun in New York
Champagne wakes and checks the time
It's hard to keep a cup of coffee down
When there's so much on your mind

Kicks a cockroach 'cross the bedroom floor
Checks the mirror, grabs some clothes
Waits for the aching to subside
Where to find it? No one knows

And they say you're doing fine
They're just playing with your mind
And they never even know your name
But they all want you to shine, to glitter all the time
They all want a little taste of Champagne

Takes the subway, early afternoon
Downtown to Eighth Avenue to the Show Palace Theater
Where Champagne bares all
In a low rent, nude revue

In the darkness, shadow people
Stare at Champagne glassy eyed
Takes the tips and imitates a smile
Waits for the aching to subside

And they say you're doing fine
They're just playing with your mind
And they never even know your name
But they all want you to shine, to glitter all the time
They all want a little taste of Champagne

Later in a room, on a little glass pipe
Sweet dreams to help him forget his life
He leans on the wall, rolls back his eyes
And says to all the aching, ""Goodbye""

Two young kids with wild ideas
Years gone by we sweated and saved
For a cupboard with a view
Now too old for work they say

Living out our yesterday
When wild ideas could all come true

We could settle into being old
But all that glitters could be gold
So meet me in my dream
I won't fall asleep without you
Meet me in my dream
Underneath the Vegas lights

Look around our shabby room
Paper peeling curtains frayed
Faded photos on the wall
Like us they've all seen better days
We drew our savings from the bank
For roulette wheels and reckless nights
Sinatra's records on our minds
Fruit machines and neon lights

We threw away our everything
And blew it on a final fling
So meet me in my dream

Marc Almond,"Sad little boy of the street
Hands of a thief
With the mind of a dreamer
Dodging the puddles with feet
Of a torero in an arena
Sings an old andalucian song
Dancing along
Using his dirty red coat as a cape

Rain thundering down
Sounds like the applause from
Hundreds of people
He feels free as the wind
Free as the swifts
Around the cathedral
Kneels to acknowledge his fame
Forgets all his pain
Little toreador in the rain

Bathed in a rainbow of pink
Purple and blue outside la molina
The pavement reflecting the neon
Lights this torero in his arena
He looks down at his clothes
Imagining those
Worn of sequin, gold and brocade

He kneels and kisses the beast
Fearing the least
Knowing death will not find him
But maybe one day he will face
The horns of the devil
His childhood behind him

Brave young man from the streets
No more a thief
No longer a dreamer
Stands in front of the beast
A golden torero in an arena
It starts to thunder and rain
Remembering that day
He danced like a fool on the wing of a dream

Sand turning to mud
Soon where his blood will splatter and mingle
Free, free as an angel
Up with the swifts
Around the cathedral
Never to be seen again
Dreams all in vain
There lies the toreador in the rain

Little toreador in the rain
Little toreador in the rain

And warms me in my bed
A vision shimmering, shifting
Moving in false firelight
A vision of a vision
Protecting me from fear at night
As the seasons rolled on
And my love stayed strong
I don't know where you end
And where it is that I begin
I simply open my mind
And the memories flood on in
I remember waking up
With your arms around me
I remember losing myself
And finding that you'd found me
And the seasons rolled on
And my love stayed strong
Be my child, be my lover
Swallow me up in your fire glow
Take my tongue, Take my torment
Take my hand and don't let go
[Chorus]
Let me live in your life
For you make it all seem to matter
Let me die in your arms
So the vision will never shatter
And the seasons rolled on
And my love stayed strong
The seasons rolled on
My love stayed strong
My love stayed strong
And my love stayed strong
[Repeat chorus]",Vision,2000
Marc Almond,"And so they say they're leaving
While you sleep away the day
You go out every evening
Collecting waifs and strays

They follow their illusions
They don't know what to do
They need a clear direction
That's why they turn to you

You're pleading
Please don't leave me
Don't go from me so soon
I need to be found
For I'm a stray too

Don't go
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow

On the streets of Paris
On the streets of Rome
They find a home
In shadow or in coffee bars
Down the winding alleys
Through the brightly lit arcades
No matter where they are

In and out of life they wander
Little waifs and strays
They stay until you fall in love
That's when they slip away

In the dark you'll see
Those sad brown eyes come shining through
Your heart will melt
You felt the way they looked at you

Don't go
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow

You find you need someone
To love your days away
Just when your heart is crying out
Please stay
Don't go away

Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow

Yes it's true
I'm a stray too",Waifs and Strays,2000
Marc Almond,"Atmospheres are tense today
Mother and father are growling again
Silently seated around the table
You're the one that's getting the blame

Father looks at you like a snake
You play with the food upon your plate
No one seems to be on your side
Things that threaten to hurt your pride

Mothers love to be concerned
Using lessons that she learned
Fathers never undestand
When children have the upper hand

Smiling you did your time at school
Crying quietly like a fool
Saturday night and Sunday morning
Did all the things they asked you to do

They say that home is where the heart is
But home is only where the hurt is
Pull the wool over the eyes
Forget your worries that you started

Mothers love to be concerned
Using lessons that she learned
Fathers never undestand
When children have the upper hand

When you stay out every night
The first time from your bedroom site
Started to show some concern
But by then it was too late

Fear it's time to pull away
Shut yours ears to all they say
Be yourself you know it's true
Because in the end what's left is you

Mothers love to be concerned
Using lessons that she learned
Fathers never undestand
When children have the upper hand

Mother loves to be concerned
Using lessons that she learned
Father nevers undestand
When children have the upper hand

Marc Almond,"Now you're kissing other guys
And when you kiss you close your eyes
Do you hold regrets or do you easily forget
Can you be so quickly swayed
Can tender words just fade away
Can you blame me for feeling betrayed

As one love dies a new begins
Do you say the same to him
If he knew the things I knew
Would he say ""I love you too""
Soon you'll turn, for him too late
Recrimination and heartache
Would you blame him for feeling betrayed

Put all your trust in someone who
You believed was true to you

To take from everyone you find
Capture hearts with your cute smile
Hypnotize and beguile
Cruel love is the game you play
Were you treated once this way
The world dealt you a bad hand
And you're gonna make it pay
You were...

And overkill

That's what you call a star

In other people's closets
Too many people taking
Without leaving deposits
Too many people bringing me down
Bringing me down

Well they may find me on a hotel floor
High heels in a pool of gore
Curtains closed
And a bolted door
Breaking every law

And if I die before I wake up
I pray the Lord don't smudge my make-up
The dress will be fine when the hem I take up
The dress will be just fine

Sometimes I feel like a moral-less child
Sometimes I feel that I've gone too wild
Spilled my guts
Done myself in
Died for a multitude of sins
It feels good to die for your sins
It feels so good
So good boys

And end it all in tears
Lets all holler and beat our breasts
Ending it all in tears

It had to be
The standing joke of the year
You were a sleep around
A lost and found
And not for me I fear

You in a cocktail skirt
And me in a suit
(Well it just wasn't me)

And now your life's a mess
So insecure you see
I put up with all the scenes
And this is one scene
That's going to be played my way

Take a look at my face

I never knew you
You never knew me

I can see the makeup sliding down
Hey little girl you will always make up
So take off that unbecoming frown
What about me- well
I'll find someone
That's not going cheap in the sales
A nice little housewife
Who'll give me a steady life
And won't keep going off the rails

Take your hands off me

Take a look at my face

Ran a chicken ranch
For a guy named Tex

One who was a bum

The little lights are dancing
And the clock on the wall is announcing another day
I keep hearing things you used to say

The way

Lying there naked across the sheets
Like a lizard in the sand
Becoming me and failing to see
The little girl you've become

And you fall as you slink across the room
Your lips parted in a kiss
Parading your flesh in the way you know best

What's that stubble on your chin
It's buried in the rot gut gin

You walked too far along the street
Where only rats can run

I sing my songs, my star shines bright
I stop and smile, I take my bow
I leave the stage and then somehow

Backstage, I'm lonely, backstage, I cry
You've gone away and each night I seem to die a little

Out on that stage, I play the star

Come back my love, come back to me
I need you now so desperately
What good is fame? It's just a game
I'd give it all to be the same

Running from the truth

Autumn turns the leaves to gold
Slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old
That's the cruelest part

All the sad young men
Seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold
Someone to love them for just a little while

Tired little girl
Does the best
She does the best that she can
Trying to be gay for her sad young man

While grimy moon
Watches from above
All the sad young men
Why they play making love, making love, making love

Misbegotten moon
Shine for sad young men
Let your gentle light
Guide them home again
All the sad young men

",The Ballad of the Sad Young Men,2007
Marc Almond,"The subway station's closed again
Sleeps beneath its veil of rain
My footprints' broken trail behind
Steals the nightlights from my mind

The dark deserted streets then clear
Today has lived and died in here
So I leave the chapel gloom 
To find the shelter of my tiny room

But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright
It's all right till the last winding train fades from sight
Then alone in my room I must stay to lose or win
While these wild bedsitter images come back to hem me in

The panelled patterns on the door
Chase shivering shadows to the floor
Upon the pillow worn and thin
The memories of hopes begin 
The carpet with its flowers and shredding
Spires a foot before my bed
The crack that won't return again
Advancing through my broken window pane

But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright
It's all right till the last winding train fades from sight
Then alone in my room I must stay to lose or win
While these wild bedsitter images come back to hem me in

The friends I've left back home all write
With laughing words that warm my sight
Saying, Tell us, how's the city life
I reply and say just fine 
(Oh, you must be something)
And so you see I can't go back
Until I either win or crack
I'm standing in a one way street
The stage is set
(Oh, now you're set)
The story incomplete

But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright
It's alright till the last winding train fades from sight
Then alone in my room I must stay to lose or win
While these wild bedsitter images come back to hem me in",Bedsitter Images,2007
Marc Almond,"Off comes the make up
Off comes the clown's disguise
The curtain's fallin'
The music softly dies

But I hope your smilin'
As you're filin' out the door
As they say in this business
That's all there is, there isn't anymore

We've shared a moment
And as the moment ends
I’ve got a funny feelin'
We're parting now as friends

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
If I had this to do again and the evening were new again
I would spend it with you again, but now the curtain falls

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
People say I was made for this
Nothin' else would I trade for this and to think I get paid for this

Thank you, goodnight
But now the curtain falls

",The Curtain Falls,2007
Marc Almond,"That candy color clown they call the Sandman
Tip toes to my room, every night
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper
Go to sleep, everything will be alright

Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
Someone to hold in my arms
And feel the magic of their charms

Because I want someone
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover, where are you?
With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old

Because I want someone
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Someday, I don't know how
I hope you'll hear my plea
Someway, I don't know how
You'll bring your love to me

In dreams, in dreams
My love lies all in dreams

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and I'll dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till my lover's dreams come true

Because I want someone
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
No, I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

But never before have I been so sure
You're the someone I dreamed I would find

It's the way you make me feel
The moment I am close to you
It's a feeling so unreal
Somehow I can't believe it's true

The hoping that we'll never part
I can't believe this is really happening to me

We were strangers a moment ago
With a few dreams with nothing to show
The world was a place with a frown on its face
And tomorrow was just, I don't know

But the way you make me feel
The moment I am close to you
Makes today seem so unreal
Somehow I can't believe it's true

Tomorrow will come but I fear
That what is happening to me
Is only a dream

Where do we go from here?

Living for trivial information
It's a hopeless situation


Blinded by lies

False Gods and fake religions

Ulterior motives and bad intentions

Nobody knows what waits round the corner
We gotta keep dancing

Through the years


We gotta keep smiling through our tears

Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times




These darker times

Why has it come to this

Urban decay and revolution

Suicide is the only solution

Am I being unrealistic


To feel so nihilistic

Don't judge the stage of my mind
'cause brother we're two of a kind



We gotta keep dancing

Through the years


We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears

Nobody knows where we go from here

In these darker times



We gotta keep dancing
Through the years


We gotta keep smiling

Through our tears


Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times



Each night twisting

Turning in my bed

I'm trying to make sense of it all

Is it all in my head?



These darker times
Who shall I talk to now


Nothing going on in your eyes

Only the darkness in your eyes

It's a soulless situation

It's a spiritual vacation

Turn on the TV

Pass the remote

Turn off the light

And abandon all hope



We gotta keep dancing

Through the years

We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears


Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times




We gotta keep dancing

Through the years

We gotta keep smiling

Through our tears

Nobody knows where we go from here

In these darker times

We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears

Where soiled goods are sold

He has found it hard at first
But on his brow there sits a curse
For when the young must suffer
At the hands of men

Were never there to ever last

He found his urge to laugh
An urge to cry

He'll find close friends
No friend at all
He feels so lonely, tired and small
How few are chosen from
The golden call

There's something in us all it seems
To crave adventure
Hunt for dreams
But corruption the seducer spoils our schemes
And surely as the snow will melt

Grabs his soul and heads for home
With lessons learnt under his belt

In your play-the-game eyes

Should I cry
Should I live
Should I die?

I'd like to drown me in my coffee
Counting hours with cappuccinos


Sitting framed within the window




I sit here acting like I'm reading
I'm lonely

I'm reading minds


And sadly dreaming
There's some of me left to believe in

That businessman smell
Found in one night hotels

The sheets are unwashed

Tobacco and sweat
From the stories they tell


And initials in dust


The man at the desk
Throws you looks of disgust


Soon I'll try hard to lose you
Drown you in my cappuccino

Come tomorrow


I won't know you from Adam or Eve

Look me in the eyes

And tell me you love me

Once, before you leave

Marc Almond & the Willing Sinners,"He woke to the sound of the birds in the morning
Felt charged with a new lease of life
Time to break out of his present surroundings
A mother, a child and a wife
He'd not said good-bye to his last thread of childhood
It lay just beyond his front gate
So he packed just a few things
And he packed in his job
And he prayed he'd not left it too late

He turned and he said
""Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back""

Joy held his heart
As he took to the road
Cast all his sorrow
To the breeze
Knew in his heart
It was the right thing to do
For he had to search out
His belief
Spring came and fall went
The year ran away
Love, hate and heartache ran too
Felt himself drift
Into memories of home
And the loneliness he lived on through

He turned and he said
""Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back""

And he'd learnt about life
But he'd lost out on love
He was no longer only a boy
There were lines on his face
From the sun and the wind
But no lines there through
Laughter or joy

Shoes full of holes
But with fire in his soul
He walked down the dirt beaten track
Mother was gone
But his wife and child were living on
And they cried
""It's the boy who came back""
Goodbye through the evening
Goodbye through the night
Goodbye through the dreams
Through the sleep
Goodbye to our yesterdays
Hello tomorrow
It seems we were destined to meet

He turned and he said
""Well we always have time,
Time on our side
And there's time for this boy to turn back""",The Boy Who Came Back,1984

I love you when you're sad
Love like sparks flies out of you
The best love that I ever had

Could this be a crime
To feel so sublime?

For love crimes thrown away
And though I pray with all my might
I know you'll never, ever stay

Could this be a crime

My song calls from the gutter
And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
In cardboard box city
My song calls from the gutter
And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
A dark cacophony

The wolven of the orphan gangs
Take turns to search and steal
They splash about the puddles
And are trodden under heel
They bathe their pearly faces
In the lights of Chinatown
And they lick their pearly fingers
When the street lamps flicker down

With the bitterest thoughts
I can't seem to throw
All my cares to the wind
Makes me sleep feverish
Makes me sleep scared
Pillow of secrets
And blanket of sins

And the gutter sings to me
A roundabout of down and outs
In cardboard box city

But acid of misery ate up the gold
And sent me right back to the start

I know my pleading voice bounds back an echo
It ricochets back down the cavernous alley

Stars in his eyes
Promises made flesh and blood

The fist in glove
The symbol of my power
Now I wait
A punch drunk fool
To fade away forever

Broken noses
Broken jaws
And many broken hearts
An idol
And a hero
Till my courage fell apart
And now my brain a-ringing
With the final bell and count
They hold my hand up limply
Told the world
That I was OUT!

He's trampled by the jaded by the sly

An urge to cry

He'll find close friends
No friend at all
He feels so lonely, tired and small
How few are chosen from
The golden call

There's something in us all it seems
To crave adventure
Hunt for dreams
But corruption the seducer spoils our schemes
And surely as the snow will melt

Grabs his soul and heads for home
With lessons learnt under his belt

Turn my mind to sweet sweet pain
And I wail just like Yma Sumac
Mother Fist she never complains

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word

Now I don't care if I'm in a prison
In confinement solitary
A soldier lost in the legion
Or a sailor out on the sea
A beggar, thief or a rich man
A gunman mercenary
A one legged crook
An Armenian cook
As long as my mother's with me

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word",Mother Fist,1987
Marc Almond & the Willing Sinners,"Poor Mr Sad
He's flown away
In search of his heaven now
Heaven knows why
And Mr Sad
Left me a note to say
If he finds his heaven now
He won't have time to cry
So I'm gonna fly, fly, fly away
On my wings I made
Out of sorrows I threw away, away
Maybe, I'll be back one day
Who knows
Poor Mr Sad
He lives for dreams
He's out of his mind it seems
With schemes that gleam
Too bright for me
But what the hell
I've nothing to lose
I built my wings today
So I say
Please wait for me
Because I'm gonna fly
So I'm gonna fly, fly, fly away
On my wings I made
Out of sorrows I threw away, away
Maybe, I'll be back one day
Who knows
Poor Mr Sad
Gliding in the sky
You flew to your heaven now
Now I know why
I flew in search
Of years I left behind
But something
That's in your mind
Is something nobody can take away
It's yours forever
",Mr. Sad,1987
Marc Almond & the Willing Sinners,"And he dances every night
Framed in candles
And white white light
All is revealed
When all is too bright
You're such a pleasure
A wonderful pain
Makes me never want
To love again
But sorrow always comes
To those with fickle fame

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

We are consumed by corruption
Old before our time
Hurt by others' hunger
Scarred by love as greed (how I need)
How cruel the birthday of 17
Youth behind you
The long years ahead
Showing you what you might have been
Instead of drifting, drifting, drifting

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

Foundations crumble
Walls subside
We all break apart
When there's heartache inside
Hold back those years
Those tears
With a futile pride (we're gonna come clean)
Beware of love
And of dark-eyed men
They're sweet and they're tender
But they have no hearts
Just long smashed
Cruel shards of broken glass

And the tears are gonna come
The tears are gonna come

And all those songs
That made me cry
Keep flooding back
And years of new discovery and you
Disturbing my dreams
Now we're flowing down that river
Heading for the delta
I don't know which way to flow
But my heart's a forest fire
And yours a field of snow

I don't know which way to flow
Don't know which way
Don't know which way
To flow",The River,1987

Stained wine glasses
And outside the snow
Broken windows
Wilted flowers

She sings my sad then happy heart
How I loved any kind of love
And you the love of art

I painted walls flamenco orange
You painted me in greys and charcoals
We stayed together, braved the winter
I was happy, but then I had you

I saw it once so I know it's true
You let it out on Sundays when
You let it beat me black and blue

It was a ruby, ruby, ruby red
It was the most precious gift I could give to you

It was as red as the sun in the evening sky
It was as red as the fire in a panther's eye
It was as red as the rose under the summer sun
Like a fire from a killer's gun

Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head

For the ones I left behind

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

It was the most precious jewel
I could give to you
Colour me red when I'm feeling blue
The colour of a kiss
In a young girl's dream
The mark of a guillotine
A drop of blood from a single thorn
Red wet sheets in the afternoon
A red light leading to my tomb
Ruby red all around my room

Oh, ruby, ruby, ruby red",Ruby Red,1987

To think about the road I've run the miles I've come
There is a bed where troubles melt away
My lonely hours or hours with you
The times that we've come through

There is a bed where we shared times of love
And out of love those nights are memories best forgot
We argued about trivial things
And slept apart a wall we built among the sheets

There is a bed where sickness left its touch
And fever damp the sheets where I would shake all night
Cold burning on my brow
Hallucinations here and now
A fight to live or die

There is a bed where first we both made love
And left the marks, reminders of how good it felt
The hard, the soft, the sweat in midnight's hour
We built the fort, we climbed the tower

There is a bed where years will make us wise
Truth and lies defeat, despise and forgiving
The sheets our cradle birth to death
The twists and turns of love, the life we're living

There is bed where nights I lay awake
To think about my future to forget my past
My bed a boat to sail the seas
To land where safety finds me gripping to the mast

And though I feel the years slip through my fingers
Sorrow lingers and won't go away
There is a bed that is my sanctuary
A bed where I can end my days

Among those in search of one fast kiss

Really have nothing at all

Fuelled by sweeter times

Ran a chicken ranch
For a guy named Tex

One who was a bum
One on the run

Here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine;
But other hearts in other lands are beating
With hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.

And sunlight beams on clover-leaf and pine.
But other lands have sunlight too and clover,
And skies are everywhere as blue as mine.

A song of peace for their land and for mine.

Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine

You'll party all night long
You'll party till you can't take any more.

Marc Anthony,"What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion

Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Every time I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
Let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Begging, pleading
No more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I
I keep going right back

Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back

Getting nothing in return

Solo vivirá, solo vivirá lo nuestro
Y amarnos hasta quedar sin aliento

Soñar despiertos
Vivir lo nuestro

Volar tan lejos
Como palomas libres
Como el viento

Soñar despiertos
Vivir lo nuestro

Voy a gritar que yo te quiero
Para que el mundo ya sepa
Que yo te amo
Sin ti me desespero

Soñar despiertos
Vivir lo nuestro

Ah! Vivir lo nuestro

Soñar despiertos
Vivir lo nuestro

Soñar, volar sin miedo

Soñar despiertos
Vivir lo nuestro

Dejame, dejame amarte

Marc Anthony,"Por amar, por amar
Cuantas veces la vida se da
Por amar, por amar
Cuantas veces la vida se da

Por amar
Quien no hizo castillos
Por amar
Quien no fue soñador
Y entregó hasta su orgullo
Y sus sueños
Por amar
Como prueba de amor

Por amar se da todo en la vida
Mil te quieros también el adiós
Una lagrima y una sonrisa
Y se hiere a quien tanto se amó
Por amar yo me fui de tu vida
Y lloré estando lejos de ti
Buscando tus brazos
Y hoy canto feliz

Por amar, por amar
Por amar te entrego el corazón",Por Amar Se da Todo,1995
Marc Anthony,"Amanece un día más
Que te llamo a pesar
Que tú no estás.
Y es que todo alrededor
Me recuerda tanto a ti
A tus cosas a ese amor
Que vive en mí

Que solo estoy no puedo más
Que alegría si quisieras regresar
Nuestra casa sigue igual
Todo espera tu llegar
Hay necesidad en mí
Por este amor ten compasión
Ya yo no puedo estar sin ti

Se me sigue olvidando que no estás
Y te busco a mi lado al despertar
Y me aferro a tu almohada sin querer
Que conserva el aroma de tu piel
Se me sigue olvidando que no estás
Que tu amor ya más nunca volverá
Más yo sigo soñando que vendrás
Pues no quiero aceptar la realidad

Que voy a hacer si estás en mí
Si te llamo cuando sé que te perdí
Y es que todo alrededor
Me recuerda tanto a ti
A tus cosas, a ese amor
Que aún está vibrando en mí
Que no me deja ya vivir

Se me sigue olvidando que no estás
Y te busco a mi lado al despertar
Y me aferro a tu almohada sin querer
Que conserva el aroma de tu piel
Se me sigue olvidando que no estás
Que tu amor ya más nunca volverá
Más yo sigo soñando que vendrás
Pues no quiero aceptar la realidad

Se que te has marchado
Y te sigo esperando
Y es que se me sigue olvidando
Se me sigue olvidando que no estás
Converso en las noches
Con mi soledad
Se me sigue olvidando
Y me miro en el espejo
Y me pregunto a dónde estás
Se me sigue olvidando que no estás
No puedo aceptar que se me fue
Se me sigue olvidando
Y me hago daño
Cuanto te extraño
Y yo me engaño
Si pienso que te olvidé

Rubén!
Levantalo, Sergio
Jojoma!

Se me sigue olvidando
Se me sigue, se me sigue
Se me sigue olvidando
Que te olvidé

Y yo conservo en mi mente
Que este amor está presente
Se me sigue olvidando
Yo no se ya que hacer, tu ves
Se me sigue olvidando
Se me sigue olvidando
Yo no se ya que voy hacer, tu ves

Ay, yo no se, yo no se, yo no se
Ay, yo no se, yo no se, yo no se
Se me sigue olvidando
Yo no se que voy hacer
Si no tengo tu querer
Se me sigue olvidando
Se me sigue olvidando
Se me sigue olvidando
Se me sigue olvidando
Ya no se que hacer
Nena como te extraño
Te extraño
Nena como te extraño",Se Me Sigue Olvidando,1995
Marc Anthony,"Tú en la vieja mesa
Tomando otro vino
Con otra mirada
Con otros amigos

Yo desde la barra
Contando cariños
Bebo sorbo a sorbo
Todo tu destino

A través del ruido
Se cuela tu risa
Media luna alegre
Corazón sin prisa
Piazzola en el aire
Suena con tu disco
Mis dedos ya buscan
Mano en mi vino

Vieja mesa tapiada de amor
Sienta mis recuerdos
Vieja mesa
Voz de mi acordeón
Llévame a tu puerto
Vieja mesa tabla de ilusión
Madera que suena
Vieja mesa lugar de ocasión
Nudo de mi espera

Vieja mesa tapiada de amor

Marc Anthony,"A veces tu recuerdo
Me ataca por la espalda
Surge de una canción
De un perfume
O sin razón
Hiriendo sin piedad
Mi corazón 

A veces tu recuerdo
Se esconde en otros labios
Me habla con tu voz
Y me dice ""mi amor""
Y pretendo
Que te estoy besando 

Y sigues siendo tu 
El centro de mi mundo 
Sigues siendo tu 
Mi dolor mas profundo 
Lo que no pudo ser 
Lo que siempre amare

Y perdona usted señora
Pero cuando el alma llora
El silencio no es remedio
Para calmar el sufrir

Hasta ayer, hasta ayer

Supe que tienes otro amante
Al que quizás con el tiempo
Le harás lo mismo que a mi

Hasta que me volvió preso
Y en su juego despiadado me
Entregó con su pasión

En ignorarme cuando te miro a los ojos

Y pensar que hoy vives en m
No saba que poda existir
Este amor entre los dos
Hay tanto amor entre t y yo

Tus palabras me llenan a m
Me motivan y me hacen sentir libre
Todo el tiempo que estuviste aqui y nunca te vi
Y la luz de amor brillaba ardiendo en tu mirar

Que ciego fui-nunca te vi, y hoy te siento
Muy dentro de mi

Marc Anthony,"Yo pensé que el amor no existía
Que de mi ya se había olvidado
En el alma
No iba sanar
Que las cosas que hoy siento
Por ti
Nunca mas las podría sentir
Que era un sueño imposible
Encontrarme con alguien así

Yo creí que el amor era un mito
Un tesoro perdido en el mar
Que esta vida tan gris que llevaba
No iba cambiar
Pero ahora que te tengo aquí
Me doy cuenta que nada es verdad
Que el amor cuando esta para uno
No tarda en llegar

Llegaste a mí
Con tanta vida para dar
Y descubrí todo lo hermoso
Que es amar
Llegaste a mí
Con tanto amor para brindar
Y comprendí
Que valió la pena esperar por ti
Con tu forma de mirar
Y tu manera de querer
Amor, llegaste a mí

Keep your heart here with mine
Life's a dream we are dreaming
Race the moon  catch the wind

If that is all in life I ever do

Heroes rise  heroes fall
Rise again, win it all
In your heart, can't you feel the glory
Through our joy, through our pain

We can move worlds again
Take my hand, dance with me
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do

I will want nothing else to see me through
If I can spend my lifetime loving you
Though we know we will never come again

Save the night, save the day
Save the love, come what may

There's even talk about you wanting me
I must admit that's what I want to hear
But that's just talk until you take me there oh

Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feeling cause I need to know

De felicidad
Y por qué te ahogas
Por la soledad
Di por qué me tomas, fuerte así, mis manos
Y tus pensamientos te van llevando

Yo te quiero tanto
Y porque será
Loco testarudo, no lo dudes más
Aunque en el futuro, haya un muro enorme
Yo no tengo miedo
Quiero enamorarme

No me ames, porque pienses que parezco diferente
Tú no piensas que es lo justo ver pasar el tiempo juntos
No me ames, que comprendo la mentira que sería
Si tu amor no merezco, no me ames, más quedate otro día

No me ames, porque estoy perdido, porque cambie el mundo
Porque es el destino, porque no se puede, somos un espejo
Y tú así serías lo que yo de mi reflejo

No me ames, para estar muriendo
Dentro de una guerra llena de arrepentimientos
No me ames, para estar en tierra, quiero alzar el vuelo
Con tu gran amor por el azul del cielo

No sé que decirte, esa es la verdad
Si la gente quiere, sabe lastimar
Tú y yo partiremos, ellos no se mueven
Pero en este cielo sola no me dejes

No me dejes, no me dejes, no me escuches, si te digo no me ames
No me dejes, no desarmes, mi corazón con ese no me ames
No me ames, te lo ruego, mi amargura déjame
Sabes bien, que no puedo, que es inútil, que siempre te amaré

No me ames, pues te haré sufrir con este corazón
Que se llenó de mil inviernos
No me ames, para así olvidarte de tus días grises
Quiero que me ames sólo por amarme
No me ames, tú y yo volaremos uno con el otro
Y seguiremos siempre juntos
Este amor es como el sol que sale tras de la tormenta
Como dos cometas en la misma estela
No me ames
No me ames
No me ames",No Me Ames [Ballad Version],1999
Marc Anthony,"Days have passed
And still no sign of us
Not a hint of what used to be
When you lived in that part of me
This blinding silence
Lives in every room

Of what once was a happy home
Now we're sitting here all alone
Could this be that it was all a lie
And we're just afraid to say good-bye

[Chorus: x2]
Am I the only one
Who sees what we've become
I see no sense in going on
Or asking what went wrong
We sit and stare at what could be
We both just grew apart you see
And through no fault of our own
It's our house but not a home
It's strange to know
There's truth in what I say
Baby, I know you feel the same
and the truth is
No one's to blame
Two lonely dreamers
Playing by the rules
All we thought of
Was me and you
Now we're faced
With a simple truth
I'd love to say that this is all a lie
But that just means I'm scared to say good-bye

Could this be that it was a lie
And we're just afraid to say good-bye

Turn away from the one I love
How could I
When I know what my heartâ??s made of
Could it be
That your soul lives inside of me
How could I ever say good-bye

Why was I so afraid to tell her
That for her I would fight a thousand soldiers
But just like an angry child
I kept my feelings locked inside
There were rivers of tears
Flowing from her eyes

So how could I
Turn away from the one I love
How could I
When I know what my heartâ??s made of
Could it be
That your soul lives inside of me
How could I ever say good-bye

When you fall in love
You never know how long it lasts
But the one thing I knew in my heart
Is that I was fading much too fast

So how could I

That your soul lives inside of me
How could I ever say good-bye",How Could I,1999

'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she's not real it's all right
'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time

I've so many things I want to say
I'll be ready when the perfect moment comes my way
I had never known what's right for me
Till the night she opened up my heart and set it free
But now I just spend all my time with anyone
Who makes me feel the way she does

'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she's not real it's all right
'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time

Now I just spend all my time with anyone
Who makes me feel the way she does

'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she's not real it's all right
'cause I only feel alive when I dream at night

Marc Anthony,"I just wanted you to comfort me
When I called you late last night you see
I was falling into love
Yes I was crashing into love
Of all the words you said to me
About life, the truth and being free
Yeah you sang to me
Oh how you sang to me

Girl, I live for how you make me feel
So I question all this being real
'Cause I'm not afraid to love
For the first time I'm not afraid of love
This day seems made for you and me
And you showed me what life needs to be
Yeah you sang to me
Oh you sang to me

All the while
You were in front of me
I never realized
I just can't believe
I didn't see it
In your eyes
I didn't see it
I can't believe it

When you sing to me

How I long
To hear you sing
Beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you
This time I'll see it
In your eyes
I didn't see it
I can't believe it
Oh but I feel it
When you sing to me

Just to think you live inside of me
I had no idea how this could be
Now I'm crazy for your love
Can't believe I'm crazy for your love
The words you said just sang to me
And you showed me where I want to be
You sang to me
Oh you sang to me

Marc Anthony,"Chorus:
Ya te veo que me estás mirando
La conciencia me está matando
No puedo olvidar como ella me quiere a mí
Babería de tus placeres
Pero sé que su amor me espera
No puedo olvidar como ella me quiere a mí

Veo, lo que me estás haciendo
Sé que quieres seducirme
why mi mente está en batalla contra mi deseo
Siento que en cualquier momento yo podré
Como un loco rendirme a tus pies
Pero tus encantos yo resistiré

Repeat Chorus
Hay noches, que sueño hacerte el amor why más
Al despertar veo mi realidad
Que puedo perder a quien en verdad me ama
Debo confesarte toda la verdad
Aunque tu amor me hare volar
Entre tú why yo nada puede pasar

Repeat Chorus
Ella me quiere a mí
Todo el amor que tiene alla me entrega a mí
Ella cree en mí
Es la única que me ha podido amar así
No lo puedo negar

De felicidad
Y por qué te ahogas
Por la soledad
Di por qué me tomas, fuerte así, mis manos
Y tus pensamientos te van llevando

Yo te quiero tanto
Y porque será
Loco testarudo, no lo dudes más
Aunque en el futuro, haya un muro enorme
Yo no tengo miedo
Quiero enamorarme

No me ames, porque pienses que parezco diferente
Tú no piensas que es lo justo ver pasar el tiempo juntos
No me ames, que comprendo la mentira que sería
Si tu amor no merezco, no me ames, más quedate otro día

No me ames, porque estoy perdido, porque cambie el mundo
Porque es el destino, porque no se puede, somos un espejo
Y tú así serías lo que yo de mi reflejo

No me ames, para estar muriendo
Dentro de una guerra llena de arrepentimientos
No me ames, para estar en tierra, quiero alzar el vuelo
Con tu gran amor por el azul del cielo

No sé que decirte, esa es la verdad
Si la gente quiere, sabe lastimar
Tú y yo partiremos, ellos no se mueven
Pero en este cielo sola no me dejes

No me dejes, no me dejes, no me escuches, si te digo no me ames
No me dejes, no desarmes, mi corazón con ese no me ames
No me ames, te lo ruego, mi amargura déjame
Sabes bien, que no puedo, que es inútil, que siempre te amaré

No me ames, pues te haré sufrir con este corazón
Que se llenó de mil inviernos
No me ames, para así olvidarte de tus días grises
Quiero que me ames sólo por amarme
No me ames, tú y yo volaremos uno con el otro

Keep your heart here with mine
Life's a dream we are dreaming
Race the moon  catch the wind

Ride the night to the end
Seize the day  stand up for the light
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do

Heroes rise  heroes fall
Rise again, win it all
In your heart, can't you feel the glory
Through our joy, through our pain

We can move worlds again
Take my hand, dance with me
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do

I will want nothing else to see me through
If I can spend my lifetime loving you
Though we know we will never come again
Where there is love, life begins

Over and over again
Save the night, save the day
Save the love, come what may
Love is worth everything we pay

Protege a tu suerte caprichosa

Dan su olor y sus besos
De la forma de hablarse y mirarse
Que hacen que el techo del cuarto sea de cielo

Qué dependencia
Sus sueños despiertos
Sus promesas calladas
Que le gritan al alma
Lo que se lleva por dentro

Como guerreros con miedo
Bajo una luna dormida
Ellos prefieren callar a decir la verdad
Y descubrir las heridas

De qué depende, depender
De sentirse inseguro
Incapaz, inmaduro
De qué depende depender

De esconderse entre muros
Que uno mismo ha hecho suyos
Puede ser, no lo sé, sólo sé

Qué dependencia
De sus preguntas respuestas
De su alegría y tristezas
Sus calmas tormentas

De su apego a la muerte
Que se disfraza de vida
Y así se pasan los días
Y de repente los años
Y con los años la vida

De qué depende depender
De qué depende lamentar
Sentirse inmaduro
Inseguro, incapaz

De qué depende depender
Esconderse entre muros
Que uno mismo ha hecho suyos
Yo no lo sé

Ven, echa pa'ca
No te demores niña
Que aquí te espero
Con ganas de amar

Ay echa pa'ca
No esperes más
Te voy a amar
Hasta el final

Ven, echa pa'ca
No te demores niña
Que aquí te espero
Con ganas de amar

Ven, echa pa'ca

Que aquí te espero

Marc Anthony,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,2002

I'd never known love to be so pure and gentle
In all I've seen love was quite this simple
It was for me so lonely and so temperamental

Holding you is the safest place no doubt about it
Kissing you makes me wonder how I lived without it
Wanting you is as natural as natural can be
Love won't get any better

Finally I hold my head up high 'cause you belong to me
And I'm catching myself smiling over everything
You should know that I am proud to have you next to me
I'd never known love to be so pure and gentle
In all I've seen love was never quite this simple 
It was for me lonely and so temperamental

Kissing you makes me wonder how I lived without it
Wanting you is as natural as natural can be

Girl I'm in love with you
I live to kiss and touch you

You'd be the one to run to
I'd say I do

Is all I want to do",Love Won't Get Any Better,2002

Marc Anthony,"I been sleeping on the roof of my building
It's cooler than the street
I been watching the setting sun
As it bounces off the avenue
Turning into gold dust at my feet
Carlos and Yolanda
Dancing in the hallway
To an old melody
Spanish eyes and soft brown curls
My love, my love
Come to me

I believe I'm in the power of st. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight
I know that these jitterbug days I'm living
Well they won't last for all of us
But they'll last for a long summer night
I can feel the fire in her eyes
Tonight, tonight
Under satin summer skies

Bernadette

Baby, baby, baby
Be my special one
I seen you move in from across the street
I like the way you walk
I love the way you run

Yolanda

Baby, baby
No more baby talk
Papi, this ain't mayaguez

Bernadette & Yolanda

This is the island of Nueva York

Yolanda

We'll go through the projects
Make out on the roof
Count the stars like silver studs
On my motorcycle boots

Umbrella man

Wastin your time here man, they don?t know what I do
Watcha lookin at, little ghetto weed
Sucio, I feel like killin you

Banana colored light skinned spics 
You feel your peel so fine
I'm Hernandez, the umbrella man
Your future's locked in mine
The chaplains, and the golden guineas
The red wings and the crowns
The mighty mau maus, those shines from Brooklyn
They want to cut the vampires down, down
The savage skulls, the Fordham baldies
They'll treat you like you're piss
From the heart of the barrio now my brother
We tell them mother fuckers suck on this.

I think we got something to talk about
You're a coolie from the turf
That's cool, but you don't get no respect around here unless you belong to a bopping gang...
I mean, you either belong or you get hurt
Or you can buy some protection from me.

Cause if someones got to die
To pay for the shit they've done
I believe in an eye for an eye
Now what you believe in Salvador Agron, Mr.Agron,
Senor Agron.

Sal

I believe I'm in the power of St. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight 
I believe he watches over us all
Don't tear apart
This satin summer night

Umbrella man

Well did you bring me my money
My cab fare, my new shoes
I got expenses, you know
Where's my weekly dues

Sal

I ain't giving you my fuckin money

Umbrella man

O ye mother fucker where's this hibarro from
You go when I say, I call, you come
You know it takes a strong man to survive
It ain't no accident that you?re still alive

We stand for the neighborhood
He still lives with his mother 
But he sneaks down 
A coolie in the shadow of the playground
You want to fight for your people
Don't you sal

Sal

Well, yeah if I got to

Umbrella man

Come here I want to show you something
This is the cave of the vampires 
Count Dracula's castle
The very sight could turn a white man grey
Made in the shade use my umbrella
Black like the night we fly in
That blade is all you need to keep the dogs away
So you want to be a vampire man that's cool
We're always looking for young blood

Carlos apache collects the dues
So bring us something that we can use

If you got the balls then come on me te mano
If you got the balls then come on me te mano

Frenchie cordero goes down to hells kitchen 
To sell the irish some weed
Well this patty boy's mama was on the stoop
Starts bitching about spics is a mongo breed
Now here comes her son, he looks like a ton
Of cornbeef floating in beer, and he says...
Fucking Puerto Rican dope dealing punk 
Get your shit brown ass out of here yeah 

He says fucking Puerto Rican dope dealing punk
Get your shit brown ass out of here yeah

Well these shanty town Irish beat his ass good
And fractured his collar bone 
Conio, all I was thinking, what home of the brave?
It's a fucking war zone

If you got the balls then come on me te mano
If you got cohones come on me te mano
If you got the balls then come on me te mano
If you got cohones come on me te mano",Satin Summer Nights,2006
Marc Anthony,"I speak to you in Jesus's name
As Jesus speaks through me,
The evil we do can't be blamed upon our destiny
I have walked through the valley of death-row to the shore
I have stumbled through silvery water to my savior, my Salvador!

It took me four years to learn
I was in prison not in church.
And two more to begin the book of my soul's search.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

A wild boy from the streets of El Barrio
An orphan from the hills of Mayagez

And when I wrote my story
The words flew from the page
And my soul in solitary
Escaped its iron cage.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

Mama, I got your letter today
The next time that you write I'll be transferred far away.
I'm leaving Greenhaven's towers of stone
Where the Latin population will soon be minus one.

Time is an ocean of endless tears.

I know how hard it's been for you these many years,
You say the Aguinaldo makes you dream of home
Where once we strolled the beach at El Malecon
Go back don't you worry, I am your grown-up son.

The politics of prison are a mirror of the street.
The poor endure oppression
The police control the state.

Correctional facility
That's what they call this place
But look around and you will see
The politics of race.

A forest and a prison
Where the snow and guards are white

If you want to keep your sanity
You'll teach yourself to write.

You were a child of sixteen
With a twelve-year-old mind
You came here numb and batter",Time Is an Ocean,2006

Al estilo africano

Cuando niño mi mamá se murió
Solito con el viejo me dejó

En el que me encuentro yo

Cuando a su mamá llamó

Tengo un pollo sabrosito
Con el que quiero casarme
Pero acaban de informarme

Que no, que no me puedo casar
Porque es novia de mi amigo
Y eso sí da que pensar

Odio a todos los que aman
Y que felices están
Porque yo no puedo tener

Un amorcito que me comprenda
Y que me diga papi
Y que me quiera bien

Dios mío ayúdame
Quiero olvidar
Ayúdame, ayúdame

Ayúdame a olvidarla te lo pido, ayúdame
Ay que yo la quiero tanto
Y no, y no la quiero perder

El que se encontró mi pana

Y yo que me la pasaba gozando
De la noche a la mañana

Que problema con Mariana

Del año 68

El escote en su espalda
Llegaba justo a la gloria

Yo quiero agradecerte amor todo lo que me has dado
Quiero corresponderte de una forma forma u otra a diario

Pero a mi me toco sufrir cuando confié y creí
En alguien que juro que daba su vida por mi

Quisiera gritarte
Que vuelvas conmigo
Que si aun estoy vivo
Solo es para amarte
Pero todo pasa y a los sufrimientos
Como a las palabras
Se las lleva el viento.

Por eso regreso borracho de angustia
Te lleno de besos y caricias mustias
Pero estas dormida
No sientes caricias

Me duermo contigo

Solo esta mi almohada.",Almohada,2010

Es hermoso dar amor.

Das la vida en un instante,
Sin pedir ningún favor.

Este amor siempre sincero,
Sin saber lo que es el miedo,
No parece ser real.

Que me importa haber sufrido,
Si ya tengo lo mas bello,
Y me da felicidad.

En un mundo tan ingrato,
Solo tú amada amante,
Lo das todo por amor.

así tus ojos no me vean
así no sientas mi presencia
yo estaré ahí, cuidando tu sonrisa eterna",Cautivo de Este Amor,2013
Marc Anthony,"Aturdido y abrumado, por la duda de los celos
Se ve triste en la cantina a un bohemio ya sin fe
Con los nervios destrozados y llorando sin remedio
Como un loco atormentado por la ingrata que se fue
Se ve siempre acompañado del mejor de los amigos
Que le acompaña y le dice ya esta bueno de licor
Nada remedias con llanto, nada remedias con vino
Al contrario, la recuerda mucho mas tu corazón

Una noche como un loco, mordió la copa de vino
Y le hizo un cortante filo, que su boca destrozó
Y la sangre que brotaba, confundiose con el vino
Y en la cantina este grito a todos estremeció

No te apures compañero si me destrozo la boca
No te apures que es que quiero con el filo de esta copa
Borrar la huella de un beso, traicionero que me dio

Mozo, sírvame, la copa rota
Sírvame que me destroza, esta fiebre de obsesión
Mozo, sírvame, la copa rota
Quiero sangrar gota a gota, el veneno de su amor

Y es que tu has llegado a romper el hielo de todas mis fantasías

El beso que me imagine
Tu piel que me ha cerrado la frontera
Tu boca nunca despertó
Tu amor no me reconoció
Caímos como estrellas de madera

Y te busco en cada espacio en cada esquina de la soledad
Espera
Que no podre sobrevivir
Espera
Que no estoy listo para renunciar a ti
Espera
Que se encendió mi corazón
Espera
Mis sueños rotos corren en tu dirección
Sin ti las noches me disparan a traición
Espera

Perdóname si te falle
Si por amarte te asfixie
Mis brazos no intentaban ser cadenas
Tu nombre no me deja en paz
No hay forma de volver atrás
Y darle vuelta a este reloj de arena

Con otro amor así
Sonriendo tanto
Yo me quede indiferente

Murió para siempre
Tuve que sufrir para olvidar
Todos esos falsos juramentos

Morir de amor fingiendo estar alegre
Queriendo amar y estar indiferente, indiferente

Es mi sonrisa donde escondo el llanto
Mi cuerpo tiene aquel perfume tuyo
Que me recuerda como estoy sufriendo
Y que de celos yo me estoy muriendo

Comprendí que solo a ti te quiero tanto
Y me quede indiferente
Si al lado de él ya vives tan contenta
No hago falta más, luchar para que
Te amo más que a mi vida

Hay de que me sirve lo que yo te quiera

Así aseguro que es infame lo que alegas
Fui su éxtasis intenso de placer

Yo también
Le ofrecí un amor a lo Romeo y Julieta

Marc Anthony,"Hace dos años y un día que vivo sin él
Hace dos años y un día que no lo he vuelto a ver
Y aunque no he sido feliz, aprendí a vivir sin su amor
Pero al ir olvidando de pronto una noche volvió

¿Quién es? (Soy yo)
¿Qué vienes a buscar? (A ti)
Ya es tarde (¿por qué?)
Porque ahora soy yo la que quiere estar sin ti

Por eso vete, olvida mi nombre, mi cara, mi casa
Y pega la vuelta (jamás te pude comprender)
Vete, olvida mis ojos, mis manos, mis labios
Que no te desean (estás mintiendo, ya lo sé)
Vete, olvida que existo, que me conociste
Y no te sorprendas
Olvida de todo, que tú para eso tienes experiencia

En busca de emociones un día marché
De un mundo de sensaciones que no encontré
Y al descubrir que era todo una gran fantasía, volví
Porque entendí que quería las cosas que viven en ti

Adiós (ayúdame)
No hay nada más que hablar (piensa en mí)
Adiós (¿por qué?)
Porque ahora soy yo la que quiere estar sin ti

Por eso vete, olvida mi nombre, mi cara, mi casa

Marc Bolan,"Afghan woman, deemed a princess
Born a true blue thoroughbred
Head a chiselled face of fables
Omen of no ill

Hills that spread around your chamber
Blooms that twine around your ears
Blossoms of the royalest texture angel of the years

Clad in sacks and scraps of linen
Living 'neath your waterwell
Praying that my youthy pauper's face
Will quench you well

Gazelle girl striding through your palace
Precious jewels nestle in your hair
Rameses born with platinum future
Take my heart and care.



",Afghan Woman,1978
Marc Bolan,"Trucking down by the roadside
Met a man with a starhide
He said boy wouldn't you like to look
But could it give me love
Give me little love from her heart

Bopping down by the whirlpool
I met a girl she was god's tool
I said girl wouldn't you like to rock
But could it give me love
Give me little love from god's heart

Walking down by the westwind
I met a boy he was my friend
I said boy we could sing it too
And we do
Give us love
Give us little love
Give us little love from your hearts

And then we'll walk.

Made from Madras silk and satin

For the skull hewn in Scarlatti fashion.

Sights the visions of the blinds
Shoreside stream of steam
Cooking kings in cream of scream.

Cleans his chalcedony bed
A silken word of kind
Was returned from Nijinsky Hind.

Giant of Inca hill
Loosed his boar to gorely kill
The dancing one horned waife
In doublet of puffin-bill.

Kittened lamb on God's ground
Ridden by the born of horn
Jigged like a muse on life's lawn.

He roars at the boars who massively sleep at his feet.

Where people walk hand in hand,
I tell you I know where it is

Near the Land of the Golden One,
Far beyond the rising sun
You pass the oceans of this land
Pass the man with the golden hand
You smile as you watch the Dragons fly
And play upon the golden shore
And bang upon his magic door
Behind which people never die
When finally you make the scene
You see things you never dream
You thought they were only in your mind
Where Unicorns and young Gods play
From the break of dawn to the end of day
Always happy and kind in their minds.

Timeless wonders cease to wonder
When you know the spell you're under Is mine.

Singing songs of lonesome sailors
Golden cats in temples only knowing
That the spell of time Is his.

With my greased-up levis,
Baseball boots above my head

And my purple coloured dodeville
She even took my panpipes and my elixir of life pill

He crucified me with his pixie coloured lies
His hair was black, he had a bend in his back
He tied my cousin Eddy to the railroad tracks

Jasper C. Debussy that's his kind of fun
Jasper was born with a moth in his mind
The moth was too soft on the curtain behind
He startled the face of a friend of my girl's
He cut out her eyes and he wore them with furs
I get half the dues, wear my shoes
Tonight you might laugh while crying the news
'cause Jasper C. Debussy, that's his kind of blues

He wears scarlet pantaloons and five foot one inch hose

Then I came to her shack

We go inside the place it's a mess
She said my name's the liquid poetess
She unties her mouth
And her buckskin dress
She drinks from a bottle
Labelled tenderness
I'm in one hand in the other's a can

She puts me in the can
And smiles through the wall

Dressed in a bayleaf she's trying to hide
I asked her name she said Germaine
Do the rock do the one inch rock.

Reflections looked most better than all
Cared too much, hating hatred
Seeing things deformed and almost cold
Crying sadly, shielding gladly my eyes
From the ugly side of fat men seeing, almost
Thin men peeping, sleeping, looking, falling
Dizzy from their windows high

The men of magic thinking if evil
He was bringing sunless children
Seeing all the bad,
'cause beauty was too ugly
And faceless people
Wondered at the beautiful forms they had

Now the mirror's broken
I'm smiling, seeing good things
Yet despite foot splinters swirl in the air
Forever call him beauty

Weird things blackening the fairest maiden's hair

Marc Bolan,"All alone I sit at home
With my chrome guitar
Even Michael Mouse
He has a house with someone there
You handsome bitch, you movie twitch
And seranade the dudes that move and
Smile so vile and masquerade, they masquerade

An adjacent kid with a Jamacian lid
And switch-blade knife, steals the
Truth from your golden tooth then he
Turns you in

So you hold hands tight on a marble night
And maybe dismissed, but know that
Zeus is never loose with his Grecian kiss
His Grecian kiss

Fiery skies in children eyes
Fade into youth bleeding blood and tears
On all the ears, that heard your gold
So you walk the dog and you stroll the fog

On a dome sky earth, and lie too hard
Is an English bard, you better hide your tracks
Better watch your mind

Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon

Empty head, steel bed, Dipseys no good
All alone, no telephone, to hype up my baby,
Goin' to see my baby in the afternoon,
Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon

Bent spent, psychedelic mailman's head,
Gorging up my spokes like the ghostly dead
Ally pally angel chewing up my blues,
Goin' to see my baby in the afternoon,
Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon

Oh my Venus loon it'll make you swoon,
It'll make you feel good
It'll make you feel good
Oh my Venus loon it'll make you swoon,
It'll make you feel good

Her nose is smashed her frame is bent
She's covered in flies
Everyone I ever loved, I'll love 'till I die
Goin' to see my baby in the afternoon,
Goin' to take my baby on a Venus loon

Oh my Venus loon it'll make you swoon,
It'll make you feel good

I met a man who said that he was magic
Wonderful things he said
Pointed hat upon his head
Knew why people laughed and cried
Why they lived and why they died

He walked the woods without a single sound
Golden eagles at his door
Cats and bats played on the floor
Silver sunlight in his eyes
The wizard turned and melted in the sky.

I grew all debonaire
When I had the 1980's air, in your hair
That's right
I went to the city sight
A young love took my soul away
Peering eyes and Persian skies, removed my eyes
And took them right away, took them all away

Gonna walk upon the waters
Go ooo yea

Girl you gotta cook
You got the chariot by the hook
I'm riding in the rain
Got my blue suede shoes
Gonna give up all my pain
And go ooo yea

Baby you know who you are
Baby you know who you are
Don't you know who you are

Standing on your porch
You wear your pleasure like a torch
Hiding in the road
Like a Pasolini toad
Gonna give up all my load
And go ooo yea

Now it's neat sweet ready for the moon based grind.

With your black velvet cape and your stovepipe hat,
Be-bop baby the dance is where it's at.

Surprise, surprise
The boys are home
My gaurdian angel
Run down my telephone
The heats on, mister
Can't you hear them scream,
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
The curfew comesat the crack of night
The sad old wino
Aches to dissapate the fright
The jet jump jiver
Speeds past his machine, but
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
A broken god
From a musky world
Sweetly mouth touched
Him on its spur
His prison guards
Were very hard to clean, but
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
Do it, do it, do it to me babe
Do it to me babe, aha!
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
The wizard of oz,
And the bums and thieves
Ruled my girl
With tuetonic teeth
But all was lost
When her mouth turned green
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
Silver surfer
And the ragged kid
Are all sad and rusted
Ah, they don't have a gift
Believe me Pope Paul,my toes are clean
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
Black is black
And white is white
Some go to heaven
And some get it night
The bomb was a brute
But his winged screams......
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
Yea ... aaaaaaaah

Marc Bolan,"Jasper was fine but he had glass eyes
He crucified me with his pixie coloured lies
His hair was black, he had a bend in his back
He tied my cousin Eddy to the railroad tracks
The train it come, he started to run
Jasper C. Debussy that's his kind of fun
Jasper was born with a moth in his mind
The moth was too soft on the curtain behind
He startled the face of a friend of my girl's
He cut out her eyes and he wore them with furs
I get half the dues, wear my shoes
Tonight you might laugh while crying the news
'cause Jasper C. Debussy, that's his kind of blues

Mama

Jasper he dressed in the darkest of clothes
He wears scarlet pantaloons and five foot one inch hose
His face is like a rock and his eyes like the night
He's like a grim faced dog that's looking for a fight
Silhouette looks like a furry Persian rat
When you see him coming mama, you'd better run
Because Jasper C. Debussy that's his kind of fun

I met a man who said that he was magic
Wonderful things he said
Pointed hat upon his head
Knew why people laughed and cried
Why they lived and why they died

Shadows followed him around
He walked the woods without a single sound
Golden eagles at his door
Cats and bats played on the floor
Silver sunlight in his eyes
The wizard turned and melted in the sky.
