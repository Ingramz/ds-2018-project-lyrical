Chalino Sanchez,"Eres flor que al correr de los años
No has perdido jamas tu ternura
Yo no e visto brillar las estrellas
Me persigue una perra amargura

Esos labios que un día me dijeron
Tu recuerdo lo guardo en mi pecho
Esos ojos que un día me rogaron
Hoy sonriendo me brindan desprecio

Esos lindos ojitos azules
Con que adornan graciosa tu frente
No creí que con una 
Mirada sentenciara mi pena de muerte

No e podido olvidar tu cariño
No me culpes te sigo queriendo
Tu te encuentras tan lejos de mi
Yo me encuentro tu ausencia sufriendo

Me despido florita del alma
Me despido llorando y cantando
Aunque tu no me quieras mirar
No me importa yo te sigo amando

Esos lindos ojitos azules
Con que adornan graciosa tu frente
No creí que con una 
Mirada sentenciara mi pena de muerte",Florita del Alma,1992
Chalino Sanchez,"He pensado en la vida
Si tu me quisieras
He llorado en pensar
Que mi vida te sobra

He pensado olvidarte
A correr de los años
Pero nunca podre
Me persigue tu sombra

Esperando, esperando
Y soñando con tigo
Esperando que el tiempo
Te arrastre conmigo

Esperando la noche
Al perder tu cariño
Como cuando llegaste
A cambiar mi destino

Ya sabias que te traiba
Muy dentro de mi alma
No sabias el dolor
Que tu hausencia me daba

No pensaste que el tiempo
Nuestras vidas cambiaba
No mirabas el llanto
Que mis ojos lloraban

Hoy que solo el destino
Podra castigarte
Marchitando tu vida
O negandote anelos

Lloraras tus desgracias
Al estar ya perdida
Y veras que se sufre
Si te falta un consuelo

He pensado en la vida
Si tu me quisieras
He llorado al pensar
Que mi vida te sobra

He pensado olvidarte
Al correr de los años
Pero nunca podre
Me persigue tu sombra",Me Persigue Tu Sombra,1992
Chalino Sanchez,"Mi bien yo necesito decirte que te quiero
Decirte que te adoro con todo el corazón

Que es mucho lo que sufro, que es mucho lo que lloro
Que ya no puede mi alma al grito que te imploro
Te imploro y te abro el nombre de mi única ilusión

También quiero que sepas que ya hace muchos días
Que estoy enfermo y pálido de tanto no dormir

Paso mis noches negras tan negras y sombrías
Que ya se han muerto todas las esperanzas mías
Que ya no se ni donde quedo mi porvenir

De noche cuando pongo mi sienes en la almohada 
Hacia otro mundo quiere mi espíritu volver

Camino mucho y mucho al fin de la jornada
La sombra de mi madre se pierde en la nada
Y tú de nuevo vuelves en mi alma aparecer

Que hermoso hubiera sido vivir bajo a aquel techo
Los dos unidos siempre amándonos los dos

Tú siempre enamorada yo siempre satisfecho
Los dos una sola alma los dos un solo pecho
En medio de nosotros mi madre como dios

Se que te estas casando mi bien no lo sabia
Que quieres tú que yo haga rosario de mi vida
Que quieres tu que yo haga con este corazón

Ese era mi esperanza vaya que a sus fulgores 
Pues en el hondo abismo que existe entre los dos

Adiós por la vez última amor de mis amores
La luz de mis tinieblas, esencias de las flores
La mira del poeta, mi juventud adiós",Nocturno a Rosario,1992
Chalino Sanchez,"Voy a jugarme un albur
Con una baraja de oro
Que si la gano ya estuvo 
Y si lo pierdo ni modo
Porque yo soy de los hombres que cuando pierdo no lloro.
Las mujeres son barajas
Ayy que saber barajar
Pa saber cual es la tuya
Es la que vas apostar
No ya despues de perdido
Quiran volver a jugar.
Y si juegas sin malicia
Porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando lo sota de oros
Te aparece un caballero.
Disperce mi buen amigo
Es que yo llege primero.
El que no lo quier creer
Que le entre a lo pantera
Pierde dinero y mujer
Y hasta la portamoneda
A veces llega a su casa
Con la camisa de fuera.
Y nimodo de reclamos
Porque yo llege a caballo
Estoy regando el rosal pa cortar
La flor de Mayo.
Perdoneme rey de copas
Pero yo soy de a caballo.
Y si juegas sin malicia
Porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando a sota de oros
Te aparece un caballero
Dispense mi buen amigo
Es que yo llege primero.",Baraja de Oro,1993
Chalino Sanchez,"Ay te mando esta carta de luto 
Pa' decirte lo mucho que siento 
Es tan grande el amor que te tengo 
Que ya siento mi corazón muerto 

Esta carta con sangre va escrita 
Más no creas que es por falta de tinta 

Solo quiero que al verla comprendas 
Que se encuentra mi vida marchita 

Si esta carta de luto te escribo 
Porque triste y negro es mi destino 
Pero al fin lograré consolarme 
Porque Dios me mando este camino 

Al llegar esta carta a tus manos 
Solo quiero pedirte un favor 
Que te fijes muy bien lo que dice 
Para alivio de mi corazón 

Cuando escuches sonar las campanas 
Del reloj que esta frente al panteón 
Solo quiero que mires al cielo 
Y que reces por mi una oración 

Si esta carta de luto te escribo 
Porque triste y negro es mi destino 
Pero al fin lograre consolarme 
Porque Dios me mando este camino",Carta de Luto,1995
Chalino Sanchez,"Navegando en los trenes del sur 
A una indita muy linda encontré 
Que vendía ramilletes de flores 
Recorriendo las vías del tren 

Encantado de aquella morena 
Le compre un ramito para mi 
Y al poner la moneda en sus manos 
A la indita formal dije así 

Hay indita que vendes tus flores 
No le vendas a nadie por dios 
Y al cantar de un hornito de troya 
Tuve toda la mas linda flor 

Pero el tiempo y las olas de vuelta 
A esos rumbos me hicieron partir 
Yo busque en la estación a la indita 
Pero en cambo mi tiempo perdí 

Hasta que una señora ya anciana 
Mis tristezas deseaba saber 
Me entrego un ramillete marchito 
Y me dijo aquí esta su merced 

La que viene a buscar ya esta muerta 
Y al partir este ramo dejo 
Se la entrega al señor pasajero 
Que en mi vida fue mi único amor",El Navegante,1995
Chalino Sanchez,"Una tarde nublada y sombría
Cuando el sol se empezaba a meter
Ella alzaba la vista y me veía
Hoy la encuentro y no hallo que hacer

Rinconcito que en el alma adoro
Que del cielo ha venido a caer
Como a ti yo te quiero chiquita
Yo riquezas no quiero tener

Ay si no he de tener esa dicha
De mirarte en brazos dormida
Que dios padre me quite la vida
Si eres tú mi ilusión y mi ser

Ya me voy pasen muy buenas noches
Ya mi lira no quiere sonar
Oigo tristes sonidos de voces
Pobrecita ella quiere llorar

Rinconcito que en el alma adoro
Que del cielo ha venido a caer
Como a ti yo te quiero chiquita
Yo riquezas no quiero tener

Ven a mi que te estoy esperando
Con los abrazos abiertos mi chiquita
Como un pájaro herido volando
A besarte tu dulce boquita",Una Tarde,1995
Chalino Sanchez,"A donde quiera que voy 
Me acuerdo de ti 
A donde quiera que voy 
Te estoy mirando 

El viento me trae tu voz 
No hay música que oiga yo 
Que no me deje llorando 

Que tierra pisando estas 
Que estrellas te alumbraran 
Tu camino bueno o malo 
Que boca borrando esta 
Los besos que yo te di 
Corazoncito tirano 

A donde quiera que voy 
Me acuerdo de ti 
Mi alma se muere por ir 
Juntito a tu alma 

El sol sin luz nunca es sol 
El mar sin agua no es mar 
Y yo sin ti no soy nada 

Que tierra pisando estas 
Que estrellas te alumbraran 
Tu camino bueno o malo 
Que boca borrando esta 
Los besos que yo te di 
Corazoncito tirano",Corazoncito Tirano,1995
Chalino Sanchez,"Nada mas abri la boca 
Que ya estava por casarme 
Y la gente que es curiosa 
Termino por preguntarme 
Al saber quien es la novia 
Ya querien desanimarme 

Decien que eres al siega 
Pero no me importa tanto 
Yo te quiero pa mi esposa 
No para tirar al blanco 
Cuando no me veias me tientas 
Pa que sepas por en dode ando 

A mi los chismes 
Me vienen flojos 
Y no me importa 
Lo que digan por alli 
Te quiero mucho 
Bien de mi vida 
Y nunca nadien 
Me podra lejar de ti 

Y no te obliges chiquita 
Que estando bien con dios 
Los santos valen un cero a la izquierda 
Si senor' 

Tambien dicen que eres fea 
Pero a mi no me interesa 
Por que nunca te a quiero 
Pa concurso de bellesa 
A un que fueras cacarisa 
Para mi eres mi princesa 

Por alli dicen que eres flaca 
Eso ya me lo sabia 
Alcavo que no te quiero 
Pa poner carniceria 
Si quisiera una gordita 
Se que me la consegia 

Me dijieron que estas prieta 
Y que no te voy a mirar 
Yo tengo mucho dinero 
Y te mando a miquelar 
Para que relampagueres 
Y te vea en la oscuridad 

A mi los chismes 
Me vienen flojos 
Y no me importa 
Lo que digan por alli 
Te quiero mucho 
Bien de mi vida 
Y nunca nadien 
Me podra lejar de ti",Los Chismes,1995

Chalino Sanchez,"Año de 1900 y los que van a contar 
Murió anastacio pacheco principal de canatlan 
El principio del enojo fue que anastacio 
A la malale reclamaba a unos weyes al señor victor ayala 

Le dice victor ayala yo no soy tu roba weyes 
Y tengo plata sellada en ese real de los reyes 
Decia timoteo gonzales que le pasa compadrito 
El que con usted la quiera con migo amarra cortito 
Le dice victor ayala compadre si usted lo mata 
Le doy un wey escogido y unas 3 o 4 vacas 

Tomo la daga en la manose also la manga asta arriba 
Porque le había prometidque por el daba la vida 
Murió anastacio que era hombre rico era valiente 
Cual era un leon pero el mas hombre muere a traición 
Desde su esposa también sus hijos cuando le dieron esa razón 
Y fue un llorar sin consolación 

Vuela vuela palomita parate en ese árbol seco 
A publicar la noticia de ese anastacio pacheco 

Murió anastacio que era hombre rico era valiente 
Cual era un leon pero el mas hombre muere a traición 
Desde su esposa también sus hijos cuando le dieron esa razón 
Y fue un llorar sin consolación",Anastasio Pacheco,1998
Chalino Sanchez,"Ayer baje de la sierra 
Ya me estaban esperando 
Eran 100 hombres de verde 
Tenían el paso bloqueado 
Pero se llevaron plancha 
Yo venia por otro lado 

Al barrio de tierra blanca 
Muy cerquita del infierno 
Voy a ver a mi borrada 
A escondidas del gobierno 
Son 2 pendientes que tengo 
Que ahí noches que yo no duermo 

No se apunten zopilotes 
Que todavia no me he muerto 
Por que me puse perjumenes 
Ustedes piensan que apesto 
Si deberás me traen ganas 
Nomas arriesguen su resto 

Me gusta pescar charales 
Para echarlos de carnada 
En la ciudad de Nogales 
Me tiraron por la espalda 
Si me quieren rematar 
Los espero en Ensenadaa 

No es que me guste la bronca 
Pero aprecio la emocion 
Que me toquen con la banda 
Esa pieza del barzón 
Después voy para las quintas 
Me lo pide el corazon 

Bonitas las olas santas 
Nadie lo puede negar 
Si quieres ganar dinero 
Acércate a Culiacan 
Cuando bajes de la sierra 
No lo vallas a olvidar",Ayer Bajé de la Sierra,1999
Chalino Sanchez,"Dicen que venían del sur
En un carro colorado
Traían cien kilos de coca
Iban con rumbo a Chicago

Así lo dijo el soplón
Que los había denunciado
Ya habían pasado la aduana
La que está en El Paso, Texas

Pero en mero San Antonio
Lo estaban esperando
Eran los rinches de Texas
Que comandan el condado

Una sirena lloraba
Un emigrante gritaba
Que detuvieran el carro

Para que lo registraran
Y que no se resistieran
Porque si no los mataban
Surge un M-16

Cuando iba rugiendo el aire
El faro de una patrulla
Se vio volar por el aire
Así empezó aquel combate

Donde fue aquella masacre
Decía Lino Quintana
Esto tenía que pasar
Mis compañeros han muerto

Ya no podrán declarar
Y yo lo siento sheriff
Porque yo no se cantar
De los siete que murieron
Solo las cruces quedaron

Cuatro eran del carro rojo
Los otros tres del gobierno
Por ellos no se preocupen
Irán con Lino al infierno

Dicen que eran del Cantil
Otros que eran del Altar
Hasta por ahí dicen muchos
Que procedían del Parral
La verdad nunca se supo
Nadie los fue a declarar

",La Banda del Carro Rojo,1999
Chalino Sanchez,"Cuatro espadas me apuntan al pecho 
Por confiar demasiado en mi suerte 
Yo soñé ser feliz en tus brazos 
Pero tu me sentencias la muerte 
Una espada es que ya no me quieres 
La segunda es mirarte perdida 
Las que faltan las tienen tus ojos 
Que sin verme me quitan la vida 
Si el destino me trajo hasta ti 
Tal vez fue por castigo de dios 
Cuatro espadas que hoy me hacen sufrir 
Nos tendrán que matar a los dos 

Que te cuesta volver a quererme 
Si bien puedes seguirme adorando 
Y con una mirada curarme 
Cuatro heridas que hoy siguen sangrando 
Si no puedes volver a quererme

Chalino Sanchez,"Que hare lejos de ti
Prenda de mi alma
Sin verte sin ohirte
why sin hablarte

A cada instante
Intentare por olvidarte
Porque es un imposible nuestro amor

Como quitarle el brillo
A las estrellas
Como impedir que corra
El ancho rio

Como negar
Que sufre el pecho mio
Como
Borrar de mi alma esta pasion

(Y ya sabes que te quiero chiquitita)
Talvez el cruel destino
Nos condena
Mi bien de que me olvides
Tengo miedo

Mi corazon
Me dice ya no puedo
No puedo
Mis angustias soportar

A las estrellas
Como impedir que corra
El ancho rio

Como negar
Que sufre el pecho mio

Borrar de mi alma esta pasion",Prenda del Alma,2001

How many nights have you laid awake fearing the next crusade 
Did you sleep well last night

And I worry 'bout it 'cause

And all is fine 
And I wake and 
I'm standing here 
If it's not a dream 
Then I can't believe 
That I'm awake 
 
I see a place where the houses are all just exactly alike 
All of the cars are one color and there's only one type 
Each has the same dog and same cat and same fucking tank of fish 
Dinner's the same time and all the same dish

Waiting for the day 
When we open our eyes 
And I wake 
And it seems to me 
That's it's all or it's nothing 
Are we so blind

I look for some direction and I find 
A woman who won't reach me

I ask him what it means 
And he says 
It's up to you

What you have to do 
And he said 
It's up to you

And I turn up loud my old guitar and play 
Some Ramones or Hendrix thing

Is that you didn't mind a thing 
And all I say just goes right through 
Have you seen my lonely days 
Do you know

And I know that it's strange

I think it will take us more than filling graves
And I say that you can not force appreciation
Lie on lie

If it seems that's the way I'm fighting
I will just pass away the pieces of my life

Chalo Rivas,"Una tarde nublada y sombría
Cuando el sol se empezaba a meter
Ella alzaba la vista y me veía
Hoy la encuentro y no hallo que hacer

Rinconcito que en el alma adoro
Que del cielo ha venido a caer
Como a ti yo te quiero chiquita
Yo riquezas no quiero tener

Ay si no he de tener esa dicha
De mirarte en brazos dormida
Que dios padre me quite la vida
Si eres tú mi ilusión y mi ser

Ya me voy pasen muy buenas noches
Ya mi lira no quiere sonar
Oigo tristes sonidos de voces
Pobrecita ella quiere llorar

Rinconcito que en el alma adoro
Que del cielo ha venido a caer
Como a ti yo te quiero chiquita
Yo riquezas no quiero tener

Ven a mi que te estoy esperando
Con los abrazos abiertos mi chiquita
Como un pájaro herido volando
A besarte tu dulce boquita",Una Tarde,2003
Chalwell,"Everyday I hear a different story,
People saying that you're no good for me,
""Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you""

If you loved me baby you'd deny it,
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand

But you know that I'll forgive you,
Just this once, twice, forever,
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,
Just as long as we're together.
And you do

[Chorus]
I don't want your freedom,
I don't want to play around,
I don't want nobody baby,
Part time love just brings me down.
I don't want your freedom,
Girl, all I want right now is you.

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you
But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once twice forever
'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

Dear Daddy
You have plans for me

Oh yeah
I was your only son.
And long before this baby boy could count to three

You knew just what he would become.
Run on off to school
Your child your man grows up a fool

Run on off to school.
When you tried to tell me what to do

I just shut my mouth and smiled at you
One thing that I know for sure

They make rules for fools
So get wise.

Dear Daddy
Now I'm nineteen as you see

I'm handsome
Tall and strong

So what the hell gives you the right to look at me as if to say:
Hell
What went wrong?
Where were you last night? You look as if you had a fight.
Where were you last night? Well
I think that you may just be right

But don't try keep me in tonight

'cause I'm big enough to break down the door
Bad boys
Stick together never sad boys
Boys like your are bad through and through

Still girls like me always seem to be with you.
We can't help but worry
You're in such a hurry

Mixing with the wrong boys
Playing with the wrong toys

Easy girls and late nights
Cigarettes and love bites.
Why do you have to be so cruel? You're such a fool.

Everywhere I go a man want some part of me
Dirty Dirty hookas and hoes on 11th avenue

Coz they show me love

I do it the Cali way

And when I hit the Chi

Another girl another drop

16 bars
24 a pop
40 for a song
You can gimme what you got

I'm in there driving cars
I push them off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down
Just so I can shop

If you need a bird
I could get it chopped
Tell me what you need
You know I get ?em by the flock

I call my homie black
Meet me on the ave
I hit Wash Heights
With the money in the bag

We into big spinners
See my pimping never dragged
Find me with different women
That you ****ers never had

For those who say they know me
Know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between
You'd better focus on the beam

I keep it so feen
The way you see me lean

Ask me what I paid
And I say, yeah I paid a guap

And then I hit the switch
That take away the top
So chicks around the way
They call me cream of the crop

They hop in the car
I tell them all aboard
We hit the studio
They say they like the way I record

I gave you black train
And I did you wrong
So every time I see them
Man they tell me that's their song

They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck
Then compliments the arm

Which compliments the ear
Then comes the gear
So when I hit the room
The shorties stop and stare

Start to hate
Rearrange their face
Little do they know
I keep them things by waistside

I reply
Nobody gotta die

On arrêtera jamais d'fumer
Au fond du trou désespéré
J'ai vidé mon sac en entier
Papa va me détester
Si j'fais d'la musique commerciale
J'ai des pulsions animales
Enterrées tout au fond du sable

Mal à l'aise j'sors mon téléphone et je joue
Antisocial jusqu'au bout

Hier j'ai fait un rêve où la fumée était la conclusion
Bombe atomique pour voir deux jolis champignons
J'entends colère vivre en moi, coup d'état
Comme si l'Italie me criait Vendetta
Artistes rincés n'ont plus l'étincelle
On compte sur moi pour leur dire d'aller se faire mettre
Quand est-ce qu'une chanson mettra le feu aux poudres
Pas d'application à nos problèmes pour les résoudre

On est tous des bombes humaines qui perdent leur temps à réfléchir
La-la-la-la

Survivre aux vagues quand la horde débarque
Pour tout casser sur son passage, poussée à bout sans état d'âme
S'enfuir dans les flammes
Torturées sentimentales
Je t'en prie prends les armes, ton cœur en ruine je n'en ai pas

Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

It's got me frightened

At last darkness tuck away with me
Out into the night's perfume

They'll never touch you

Sleep, the sun is creeping over a bleeding sky
I hear no fighting

This time when in crept morning

Rise, but scream like fire

Dance beneath the lightening

I'm the one who reached for love and missed.
Can you come down to me?
I'll be waiting with that same look on my face.

And, I still comb the night for stars behind a wind-kissed windowpane.

Under an honest sky, 
When the world's shadows stood 
At shoulder side by side,

As you walk your boots make a loud sound that ruins the quiet of this town. 
She set out to crush you. Sorrow set out to crush you down, but she missed you somehow. 
With nowhere to go but through miles of sun, bones of thoughts life puts flesh on.

You're moving to the beat of an old song in your head; staring at a girl in the corner of the room, I remember why I stay alive. 
I been on your mind, guess that's good enough. 
Good enough of a reason to feel loved. 
Something we never talked about and you'd never explain, is how you got to where you are with someone else's name; and I ought to hate you by now but I can't give up on you.

I'd just as soon dodge the moon as I'd try and dodge the thought of you, everyday's a song and you're the proof. It wasn't so long ago when you put me out of doors with nothing but a suitcase full of poems. 

You said I was sunlight at midnight...a poet with the sea on my lips. 
You said my life rhymes with the lonesome lines that drip from my fingertips.

There was nothing I wanted more
Than to have you company
And I can still see you standing
At that door watching me leave

And one good thing I got
When I left that time was
That your face was the last thing
I saw as I pulled out

We all got to fall down
What I know now, I'll sure loan out to anyone

I'll be singing around your door

You'll be there to sing along
And I'm steady tryin' to holler at you",Steady Tryin' to Holler,2001
Chamberlain,"July in a thunderstorm, and the rain shook that screened-in porch. 
We were supposed to meet her parents in Duluth; we used the weather that day as an excuse. 
We just laughed and talked slow while the gutters overflowed and our hearts did, too. 
That was the best. Will it ever be that good again? The word reached me in Denver that day. 

I knew I could get you back if you would just look in my face. 
I pulled up. you were standin' in that dress. 
I guess I've always been so easily impressed. 
We spent three eternal days just the way that they all oughta be. 

That was the best. Will it ever be that good again? 
My room sat at the back of that old house. 
Seventeen with a typewriter and a radio I could never play too loud. 
Stayin' up chasin' the Muse all night?. Sneakin' cigarettes by the candlelight. 1
Ten hours of dreams?the sun wakes up, I go to sleep to dream some more. 

That was the best. Will it ever be that good again? That was the best. 
Will it ever be that good again?",That Was the Best,2001
Chamberlains,"When you're in love
Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart
How do I trade 
The best I had for less
Without giving up
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends

How do I know
When to let go
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

There's no winning bets
The battle's just begun
I know it's over
But I still feel the same
You'll always remain number one

More and so much

Old Manhattan melodies 
Echo through my broken heart 
And call me back to you

From Redd's showroom ya heard me (off top)
We still balling, we still doing this shit ya heard me
We still in it (believe that) it's that flame shit

The wheels on my truck, go round and round
I'm sitting 24 inches, off of the ground
How that sound, mama said o what you'd like
Hold it rocking flights, red, white and blue stripes
But hold up, down South still on nonstop
Cause we been representing down here, for a while
With no solo album, I was still amazing
Stayed full of them trees, I was purple hazing
Look at me now, Redd ain't playing around
Two skinny, but my stacks keep weighing me down
They say balling is a habit no, I can't help it
Now I got more green, than a Boston Celtic
So I'm going all out, on a money route
Now I think these niggas, really know what I'm about
I don't know where you been, I don't know where you from
But around these parts, we get it how it come

See I'm a flosser, balling like you see it
Recognize me as a balla, legend in the streets
Best believe I did it all but, that will never stop me
From feeling like a flosser, cause I'm a balla

What y'all want to do, what y'all gotta say
You bump that Screw down here, okay
How you niggas acting, how you niggas roll
My album went platinum, my shit ain't gold

I'm still in the game, why'all catch my drift
I got that work cheap dog, peep my flip
When I hop out the truck, why'all catch my drift
The rolly's so icy, bitch get off my dick
We ride the finest cars, you know we stay stunting
Rims so big on the six, they sit funny
If it ain't broke don't fix it, blunt it and blist it
In a all blue something, with the plates unlisted
Like Nike, keeping you bitch niggas in check
Yeah whodi you know me, they boy is back
With two bricks, two chicks and two platinum Macks
I stay grinding, so you know I stay shining

What y'all want to do, what y'all gotta say
You bump that Screw down here, okay
How you niggas acting, how you niggas roll

Copping a brand new Bentley, Coupe to ride
With mo' cake than a bakery, we got cream
Candy truck radio up, like Raheim
7-1-3 nigga, that's the name of my team
We still get full of that syrup, and gangsta lean
I still be ghetto fab, if I drove a yellow cab
Yung Redd enough said, my niggas got cash
Don't get it twisted up, my wrist lit up
You gotta show me something, for me to get up
Just call me a rough neck, but I cash enough checks
To put me in a Vet, and roll off with a set
The streets give me respect, for everything that I did
As a kid I always kept a strap, close to my ribs
But I don't know where you been, and I don't know where you from
But around these parts, we get it how it come

What y'all want to do, what y'all gotta say

Chamillionaire,"[Chorus: Chamillionaire] 
Big Swangaz and Vouges 
Them 20 inches sittin low 
We Ball 24's 7's all that we know 
Screens and neon lights gon show 
When my trunk unlock pop and show 
Ya already know 
Paint drippin off the door 
Not Engaged with no lady, fall in love with em no! 
You may think I'm crazy never knew this type of love before 
I'm love with my foreign, yes I'm married to my dough.... 
I'm in love with my money... mmmm 

[Chamillionaire] 
You can catch me squeezing grain 
Sittin crooked on D's and swangz 
Color changin lizard he's insane 
Ya womans missing then he's to blame 
Charge it to the game keep the change 
Most marriages blyossom and die... 
When its over I'm tellin her bye 
But she acts like I'm tellin a lie 
While you fallin in love with a she... 
I rather be dubblin a G 
Could you see me in a car that rhymes with rent me and starts with a be 
Could you see a Bentley 
Parked in the crunkest spot in ya hood 
Candy coat on top of the hood 
And my fist on top of the wood 
Sparkling good 
Say you ain't after my change I don't believe ya 
If a skeezer ask me to feed her 
With my visa then I'm gon leave her 
Koopa don't want ya koopa don't need ya 
{ But I Love You } that's sweet 
I rather be ridin on glass feet 
With leather up under my ass cheeks 
Its not like I changed over night 
Been actin like this since last week 
Better Ask P my money stretched like an athelete at a track meet 
Seen him last week in a Jag Jeep 
{ But they don't even make them yet 'causezin } 
Ok I'm lyin I don't know what it was 
But I swear that boi was sittin on buttons 
I know you want a relationship with a balla but no thanx Look 
I'd rather be shining my twanks 
You must think this is a bank but it ain't 
Money increase and never would shink 
Hoes that be dikin even be fightin.... 
When I pull up on 20 inch titans 
'cause I got what them girls be likin 
Them uhh... 

[Chorus] 

[Paul Wall] 
Hold on hold up a second man 
I never mack to a metro dame 
You better respect the game 
See my gecko chain and correct ya brain 
I love my car like it was my girlfriend I like to carress the grain 
Followed the wheel and I got aroused 
Swung in the ditch and I wrecked the frame 
Broke up with my foreign car and fell in love with my cadillac 
The Ringling Brothers enquired to how my trunk turns flips like an acrobat 
I act a rat, 'cause I'm from the gutter 
Ya girl stutter when I pull up next to ya 
You been with the girl 6 months Paul Wall 
Is the reason she won't give sex to ya 
Why all that plex in ya 
'cause a german company made my rims 
My big body's pregant with twins I'm bout to induce a baby benz 
Ya car was fly in the hood but my candy paint just wet ya flames 
I'm sittin on 22 inch baby sitters babelous threatin ya name 
Forgot to change the diaper so when I crept in the lane I left a stain 
Everytime it rains, paint drips It makes a mess and I get the blame 
My TV's are the pet I train I can make em roll over and play dead 
My car was blue on the freeway 
But when I stopped at the light it changed to red 
You betta re arrange ya head thinkin I trick my cash to a broad... 
Go ahead and ask ya broad I got more green than the grass in a yard 
And that's so raw It ain't hard for me to get the class to applaud 
I shine like a blasting star, glass on a car more blacker than tar

",N Luv Wit My Money,2001
Chamillionaire,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro,2002

When the base going down better protect ya neck

They have you scared to throw up ya hood on ya own set, 'cause

They don't run they mouth, they too busy running they block
Ya better be fast thinking you can run from a glock
Snap, crackle, pop soon as you run up you get dropped
I know boys with out guns that'll still come jack you
Have you running from your car before they even attack you
If you scared you better not show it at all
Put a mug upon ya face like you ready to brawl
I know boys that's unemployed still working that work, patna (partner)

And know they telling lies when they see the judge and plead You honor it wasn't me he get lock
And as soon as ya boy get hot
He start right where he stopped
Can't go on the block with a knot in ya sock and don't glock

Come from the heart that's why boys are feeling me
I den whipped up soft and brought back some orgies
This is for my niggas in the jail, my niggas on probation
Knowing if they violate what kind of time they face
Hustling anyway minimum wage ain't nathin

Chamillionaire,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

Want you to know that, g'yeah

Got a high rise and a bachelor pad, rims tumble like acrobats
A buck sixty where the dash is at, platinum card no maxing that

Balling is a habit baby
Chinchilla, makes my jackets baby
I don't want to get cash, from rapping crazy
I'm gutter I grind, stop acting crazy
Capping on wax, ain't really me
Ten G's a day, that's a brilliant week
Big faces breeder thee
Caugh nine packs, I sneeze a ki
Roll through Panama, floss the Benz
Wipe my Timberland's, off with ten's
50/50, the Lil' Twin
Leave the rap game, with a flawless win
Take a flight, in a G-4-7
Spend the night, in a East Coast setting
I'm so hot dog, I need more relish
2004, watch B.C. fetish

I'm like Tarzan, swanging through trees
It's so much, ice in my mouth
When I take a deep breath, I get brain freeze
Millionaires want to hang with me
R&B girls keep singing to me
The FEDs think, I'm exchanging ki's
Everyday new car, I'm exchanging keys
Boys riding in 7-45's, that was cool last year
But I'm V-12 in a 7-60, Kenyon passing me beer
I step in the club cameras flashing, girls want to take my pic
Which girls am I taking home, I can take my pick
50/50 in fur coats, so please no finger prints on his mink
I tip the bar tender more money, than I spend on the drinks
Lil' mama keep skipping and wink, she give me glances
I'ma make a move, on them sexual advances
And by the end of the night, I can garuntee I'ma be up in them panties
I ain't never slept in the same room, twice in my house
Frosty the Snowman can build a house, with the ice in my mouth
I got more diamonds than South Africa, flawless ice is immaculate
I'm flipping the game like a spatula, now these girls ex-boyfriends mad at us

Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name
(You're not breathin')
That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side
Chamillitary Mayne
And now for The Sound of Revenge

[Chorus]
When I call you on the phone
You're never at home
You been gone for so long and I feel so alone
Your love of money gone ruin our relationship
But you say it isn't and that's a lie
[Chamillionaire]
Girl I ain't trippin' I Know that you're feelin' alone
But I feel you should know I'm still in luv wit my dough
And since they say time is money
I'm wastin' my money sittin here chillin' so good bye

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
She love a trick to treat
She be calling me up, Koopa let's eat
I'm Sorry, but I gotta radio interview to do
I gotta hook up with Milla Mack, and Greg Street
Maybe we can retreat, to get a bite to eat
Take a night to sneak, to a tight lil' suite
You can invite some freaks
But get it right I'm cheap
You could leave, with tonight's receipt
Makin' moves wit hatter
Ke'Noe and Dobey, BeBe and Jabber
When I'm not in the lab
You know I'm trying to grab a
Couple G's chick please, what are you getting mad for
In the morning
When I hook up with Killa Mike, Lil' Jon and them
All of my calls, I'm gonna forward them
To the answer machine, please call again I'm busy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
I'm Still in Luv wit my money
I'm still infatuated wit my cash
Ain't no need for relaxin' and chillin
I'm Stackin, and Killin' on a grind I mash
But I still make time for my lil' mama
But I ain't got no time for a little drama
I'm tryna pull out in drop top
Throw 22's on a lil' somethin' foreign for the summer
You can call me but I ain't gone answer
All this stress gone cause me cancer
Imma call up whodi in the club on and throw a couple dollars on a Dancer
So don't hastle me, just leave me alone, quit callin my phone
You say you an independent woman, then stand on ya own
Baby girl I'm gone, holla at me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: 50/50 Twin]
Get Mad, I chase cash
Do you contribute to fillin my stash
Smellin your piss bitch, go buy glass
Never deposit, but withdraw fast
Co-Dependant trash
Act with class but poor doin bad
Got a senada, can't afford a jag
I'm the best thing that you done had
Stumbled upon a gold mine thought you
Stuntin' with that dolce I bought you
An additional time gon cost you
Speakin gibberish are you
Who gave you permission to trip
You gon trip,take a trip
Car, plane take a ship
Music grind stand right here
Ten mill you might get recruited
The world don't twirl around beauty and booty
It twirl around cash and music
Cheer people up and help them through shit

In South Park on MLK, on Sunday we clown
From the streets of Antoine, to the Homestead hoods
From Mo City to Studewood, it's all good
I'm riding on platinum grey, with Z-Ro and Trae
Gon let the top down, it's a beautiful day
Haters jealous on the sidelines, running they mouth
'Cause I roll with T.I.P., the king of the South
Boys know I'm Paid In Full, so they clocking my dollas
Me, Poppy, Joe and Fox all riding Impalas
I'm breaking bread with Mike Jones, and Slim Thug the Boss
It's Paul Wall, still representing Swishahouse
I'm with my boy Big Kaila, I don't bar no hater
I'm on the grind for paper, I'll holla at ya later

If she's a dime tell her I'm fine, and she'll say true-true
Turn up the bang if you into, something color changing the rims do
Sound like a train cause when I stop, they be like choo-choo-choo
And I'm thugging too homie, the heater kinda like Al Bundy's hand
Believe me every time you see me, it's gon be in her pants
If I do a crime and you snitch, homie the heater will snitch too
'Cause if the police come around, it'll be pointing at you
Somebody give mouth to mouth to this mic, after it melt
'Cause the only rapper out rapping me is me, after myself
I hope you internet thugs, that will swear that I ain't the tightest
Have cyber sex with Cita, until you catch a virus
Why is he saying this, to piss boys off
I officially claim myself, the rap King of the South
The say I'm the greatest of all time, and I say who and they say you
And I say naw, give that title to the late great DJ Screw, rest in peace

How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see

Making ball and look easy baby, we don't practice like... 
Sliding in I'm never super post when

Telling me it's a birthday, new shoes and her persuade, 
You should go appreciate the quire, I ain't the one you persuade, 
She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel, 
Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the...

Told Brad to send me a track, 
He send me a track to sound like a trap, 
I don't know normally do this, 
But hey when I do it sound like the trap, 
Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap, 
I'm just hoping you try to try me, 
Get drag around by your suit tie, 
You can catch me in the forn city, 
They don't even know I rap, 
First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map, 
Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai
She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai
Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's, 
Read the sign and say stop please, 
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking, 
My making woman looking knock me, 
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two, 
My trunk are open like pickable, 
Me I'm... to be sipping through, 
Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.

Hold up man, just hold up man, 
Rap to state then pour down, 
Chew up cheese then throw up grants, 
Then guess some bread you know I'm jam, 
It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine, 
One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine, 
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day
If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay, 
Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel, 
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill, 
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast, 
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist, 
Check it out when my lack is out, 
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed, 
Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test.

If ya can't sleep anymore while the raindrops pour
And you look our your window and hear footsteps on the floor
If you saw a crooked smile and a glistenin' jaw
Don't open the door fa' sure time for bad weather why'all, let it reign

[Paul Wall]
Bad weather's ruin about, if you travel my route
It's time to flood the market, 'cause there's been a drought
Review the resume, my team is undefeatable
You fabricate ya life with stories unbelievable
I'ma ballin' star, you a fallin' star
All used up like no minutes on a callin' card
I'm the bank you ain't nothin' but a dollar or two
You just sand on a beach, and I'm the wave that swallows you
Nobody follows you, your like bad directions
Ya life needs an eraser, there's to many corrections
Ever since I was born, I've been far from the norm
I'm the one that kept ya girl warm when you was gone
Now you and ya born needin' ya palm
Watchin' thorn or outside a dorm, humpin' ya horn ya heart torn
You get warned down the scarecrow and a crop full of corn
Grab an umbrella 'cause them boys bringin' the storm

That's why she so down
Creepin so much

She loves to keep it deep inside her
I would say a definite rider
And just because of the player she chose
It doesn't mean I'ma give her the go

She want to roll with a player like me
She callin me 'cause she's in the need
Of a player like me that's stackin G's
Better bring it back, pull it back
Don't be mad 'cause your girl keep callin
23's coop, she's callin me 'cause your boy is ballin
I know that she's gotta man
With a game plan, with the weddin plan
But, I'm not the man, we're not holdin hands
But, whatchu have, your man don't understand
She's callin me up when she leaves her job
That's what's up, when she leaves the club
Had too much she want to cut, that's what's up

You hear my phone ringing
She callin for a reason
No time for any teasin
This time what friends you bringin
Some say it's a booty call
It might be new to ya'll
Never trick my dawg
Never fuck 'em low
Ya'll already know what player she chose

So, I pick her up round quarter to 8
Chop the block and at quarter to 8
Get cha hot 'cause I know you can't wait
Pretty face, but I give her her space

I mean we can screw it nice and slow

Call a player when you get this pleasure

And if they do us opposite how they feel about me (me)

Why you couldn't leave and be speeding, off in some good breezing
You'll never spend another boring night, in some hood freezing
But posted up by standing water, during some good season

Had to tell you, that I'm really feeling your style
Saw you walking by, and couldn't let you pass
Gotta tell ya, that I'm really feeling your smile

My life is real baby, you peeping me take a picture
You peeping me take a picture, (you should take a photograph) - [2x]

[Bun B]
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
(You see it's real, they be like look at that
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph)

[Chamillionaire]
Introducing the truest voice of the South, it's who else but me fool
Don't let all that foolishness they feed you, on T.V. mislead you
Don't let all the magazines, and them papers out there deceive you
The cups that be used to sip, but Caucasian kinda like my tee do
You see that hand be glistening, you see the Sedans we flipping
The hundreds of grands we getting, these units of scans we shipping
You see that Caddy tipping, them thangs on that Caddy twisting
That paint and that candy dripping, that drank and that can is missing
That ain't a Cola, though dry and you feeling sober
Boys trying to switch it over, apply it up in a soda
Home of the Houston hustlers, who grinding and hit the quota
Who fire and hit the doja, you high when you sniff the odor
Told ya you gotta have, a foreign or buy your slab
Afford it then buy it that's, important without it now
You ain't gotta take college class, to see that we bout our cash
You not if you gotta ask, let's take a pic by the slab hol' up

You see my slab, you see my candy slab
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
You see my chick, you see my chick is bad

Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph

[Chamillionaire]
When I'm tipping they'll probably watch me, the cops'll be paparazzi
And try to patrol my posse, we shining and glowing glossy
The jealous will try to top me, we keep it too real to copy
What I'm listening to ain't a floppy, that disc gon be Screwed and Chop-pied
All the ballers will ride to this, deposit deposit slips
Buy the car and apply the fifth, raise the trunk an entire lift
Use to go to that Kappa, but Kappa ain't been as crunk
So I'm popping up at Daytona, on chrome and I'm popping trunk
Jamming that ""Ridin' Dirty"", while riding beside the laws
And they staring over at me, trying to scare me like I'ma pause
Tell 'em naw they know I'ma crawl, all day in the robber cause
I'm trying to go wash the ride, till them tires have whiter walls
You peeping him take a picture, that chrome and that paint official
You smoking then take a swisha, there's plenty just take 'em wit ya
You chilling you ain't a sipper, then I'ma be hanging wit ya
Take a hold of the grain and grip a, handful and smile for the pictures nigga

[Hook]

[Bun B]
You see the bling up on my bracelet, and the shine on my chest
Syrup in my styrofoam, it's sweet with doja no cess
You done put it down with the rest, time to roll with the best
Cause when you ride with the original, you ain't gotta guess
I'm the connection that you need, when they say it's a drought
Cause it's not really a drought, them other niggaz just out
And I'm the plug you gotta have, when they say the river's dry
Cause it's not really dry, they just ran out of supply
I'm too fly for the clouds, too down for the green grass
Better wear tinted lenses, if you look at my clean ass
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
Candy still dripping, 4's is still tipping
Wood grain grass, steering wheel I'm still gripping
Repping for P.A.T., the West and the East
And I'm repping for Pimp C, till he get back on the streets it never cease

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
My life is real baby, ain't just a song (ain't just a song)
Gripping that wood wheel baby, and riding chrome (I'm riding chrome)
This is for the real playas, that get that do' (that get that do')
Tell me how it feel baby, to see I'm-I'm riding candy and chrome

Know I'm saying, gripping wood
Riding through the hood, and feeling good

Chamillionaire,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
should be a celebration of life.",Rain,2005

I'm a ri-i-der, I'm a rider
I'm too tough for y'all, and I will never fall
You can talk that talk, but I'ma walk that walk
And I'm riding, that's fa sho
I'm a surviiiii-iiii-vor, true survivor
If I walk out that do, and don't come back no mo
Let the liquor po, and let the people know
I was a rider, that's fa sho

We them niggas getting hated by haters, we them niggas that done made it outrageous
Stack the money in the streets nothing honey nothing sweet, I'm sick my chips contagious
Animals none of y'all can't cage us, got me feeling like the Heat and the Lakers
Had to switch up my team but what do ya mean, we already traded them traitors
Spend a lifetime surrounded by fakers, in the night time you high 'cause it's safer 
Spend a lifetime to grind and get paper, while all y'all crying I'm flying to Jamaica
Grinding steadily fine and cheddar he, know how to show ya the nine is deadly
Wanna be a pussy nigga fine then let it be, anybody crying that's around it's never me
Realer than the rest when it come to plex, get it off your chest if you so upset
Is that what it gon' be if it comes to yes, then I guess that day will become a mess
They messed up when they told me the sky's the limit, 
'cause I'm married to my money nigga I'm committed
If it's gold at the end of the rainbow then my gang go, get up in the vehicles and ride to get it
I'm a nigga that made it up from the bottom, I'm a always get into a lil' drama
Y'all don't know what it means to be a rider, gotta deal with anybody that got a problem
I'ma put supreme in the Impala, I'ma put some cream up in the bomber
Jack it that's it nigga go get a dollar, looking for me I'm busy my nigga holla

[Chorus]

Got the weight on my shoulder like solo flex, do the drama myself that's solo plex
I don't know what you do fo' yo checks, but my part of the do' way mo' they less
I'm gripping wood I know I'm fresh, 'cause I am that CEO and yes
The mo' I make they more upset, but I'll be damned if a nigga don't show respect
Ask the streets in the South about the kid, and they gon' tell ya I be doing my thang
We could do the beef or we could do the peace, as long as you ain't speaking my name
My partna told me you was jocking homie, and my other boy said the same
The result of that when I approached the cat, I gotta hit him with the pain like bang-bang
Physically and mentally, a rider a nigga that'll tell 'em see
I bomb on your ass it was meant to be, because I told y'all niggas not to mess with me
Do you let the beef slide, and let it die down with all your deciding
In the streets they know Cha-millionaire be riding, Batman my heat riding like Robin
Tell 'em that I got 'em if he's on my team, 'cause loyalty's something that you're gonna need
Loyalty's something others don't believe, like a ghost that most suckers ain't known to seen
But you know that a rider can notice hating, and use it to fuel all the motivation
Success is something that's fa sho to make em, back down they don't then I'm gonna break em",Rider [*],2005

And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix
This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the Pro Tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this
Somebody call the doctor (you're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin' (you're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name (you're not breathin')
that's about to be runnin' the game (you're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name  Chamillitary mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you
Y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(You're not leavin', you're not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now (you're not leavin', you're not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem? (you're not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace (you're not leavin')
I ain't think so yeah!

The feeling's great cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady
But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

[Chorus]
Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say but have it your way
I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em Sound of Revenge is on the way this isn't your day
Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
(Where have you been? Where have you been?)
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
(Somethin' for them, somethin' for them)
You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
(Sound in the wind, sound in the wind)
You turn around cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that? (Yeah what's that?)
That's the sound of revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

Ya head fast think you hold a mike with the killa.
Don't mess with the south homie, thats a dream,
Hallucinate or imagining so.
Double X.L. with the gats I mean,
Keep somethin' ready to blow in the magazine.

Chamillionaire,"[Chorus]
I want to know who you are but you seem very nice
So will you talk to me?
Should I tell you a story? Should I tell you a treat?
They think I'm crazy, They don't understand how I feel

See, it started off as just a simple conversation I gave her
The name of my record company, (Oh your a sanger)
I said my name's Chamillionaire and I'm a rap entertainer
(Oh you that guy they talking bout when they be whisperin, ain't cha
Bring your name up when they talking and say money will change ya
I heard a lot about how you can't deal with your anger
Heard the rumors how your always in trouble or danger
Not gotta judge you if it's true, there's no need to explain sir
You do have a right to be, you seem like your nice to me
And like your gonna buy me another drink, yeah would you like a seat?)
I tell the boy the same hennessey on ice for me
Her drink starts emptying as she's pouring out her life to me
Telling me about her goals and how successful she would like to be
And invite me to a session of her life and she
Seems so damn innocent but something isn't right to me
She pulls out her picture phone ""I got pictures, would you like to see?""
I'm thinking she gotta be friendly as hell
Giving a soul to me, it's like an identity sell
We never met is the story that my memory tells
Telling me tales like she doesn't handle hennessey well
Getting into it, getting intimate and into details
See, I just met you and you showing me your kids
""Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids""
Then who's in this picture, ""Man, let you show you just who it is""

[Chorus]

Umm, I don't remember her name but she look like an angel
She wasn't from here, I knew she didn't hang a
Round a part of the hood but hey the story gets stranger
Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain you see
She said she wasn't married but the rings on her finger
Told me she was langin and using the same uhh
Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her
Spitting the game I spit to 'em when I'm trying to bang her
(I bump into this dime, he told me that he used to know you
He told me about the loyalty and love he used to show you
He said what he said with a passion like it was so true
Wouldn't take advantage of the fact that the listeners didn't really know you)
There's pictures in my pocketbook, almost got it, I'll show you
She digs in her purse and while she fumbles around
I find that photo, I'm like ""Oh no there's some trouble in town""
I turn around as these two officers is coming in now
They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down
So close, I can see they barrels of the guns to the ground
So close that they can listen to either of us now
We turn back around and she says no need for whispering
Then she tells me that (I don't really give a damn whose listening
Try to make it last a long time was my mission
And he kept on tripping and then I got pissed at him
Hit 'em with my fist and my punches were never missing him)

[Chorus]

Okay, let's get this straight, your man cheated on you and now
You talking to a perfect stranger like it's making you proud
And the rest of this conversation she just telling me how
It wasn't her boyfriend in the pic but a familiar smile
She said (pictures can be deceiving like she knew he was foul
Look closer, you'll see a coward who uses a smile's power
Fleeing the smoke strength, couldn't stand it another hour
So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower)
Damn what do you mean? ( couldn't tell you that I missin him)
I don't understand what your saying, how did you get rid of him?
She dissing him, as I ask her what it is she did to him
She stops, Ay keep talkin I'm listening
(I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturing)
Henny spilling then she tell me (For real and
I got the feeling of what I'm feeling is that I wanted to kill him)
Something's wrong here and I know just who is the villian
The poison's getting louder, the moral is getting clearer
The officers is looking at us and I can tell they can hear her
Told me (It was protection, Reached for it in the stash)
The plastic is what she grabbed and she put it right on his ass
Bust it before the blast, she thought she was free at least
Baby I think you crazy, Sorry I'm pressing for time
I gotta go grind, time's putting to resting
Now I'm sweating and stressing, this girl's got me guessing
That this conversation is two types of evil confession
And she pulls a clearer picture, It's my damn ex-best friend
How you know him? She told me she was with him at his house
Watching movies on Sundays when they be chilling
And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him
The feeling was the worst feeling that she could possibly be feeling
Stood up and then I yelled out ""Why in the hell did you kill him?""
I didn't kill him, I have AIDS, he had sex with 'em and that's crazy",Think I'm Crazy,2005

When I look back at my life, I realize-realize something ain't right
I'm missing you Lord, in my life make it right
I got something to decide, just wanna make-wanna make everything right
Cause there's a huge void, a huge void in my life make it right

I'm staring up at the Pope, it soak it up while he spoke it
Mesmerized and repeated, like he the author that wrote it
The broads are the ones I love, just don't wanna be the corporate
So waiting for death to approach this, take the time to say no sis
I don't hate ya, for having these little seeds
At seventeen, best believe they're a beautiful breeze
Of fresh air when there's nothing else, I usually need
Just a smile look at em now, hoping you just believe
And my broad been in place forever, I'm gone but I'm chasing cheddar
Been gone could of kept it going, with a poem or a basic letter
But naw I just hate to tell her, try hard but I didn't let her
The groupies get at your boy, but you're my Cinderella
Look girl we can make it better, but there's a gift and a curse
While you healing a nigga feelings, yours are usually hurt
It ain't amount of cash on Earth, to match what you really worth
Know your turf has been the church, that's where you put in work
And you put in overtime, because you know the sign
And most danger that I've been lately, rap is mo' than rhymes
But you still hold me down, I'ma do way mo' this time
Got some time that I need to manage, girl you know that's right
And that's speakin' like a true deacon, cause even to see you sleeping
That comfortably ain't enough for me, anything that you needing
I'll cease anything that squeaks, and cease any sink that leaks
Ain't nothing gon interrupt, your sleep deep into them sheets and peep

[Chorus]

How your father call the police, have your mama put in the jail
When the arguments always started, and ended up in a cell
Hard to it was the thought of this, ring that you use to wear
As I darted out the apartment, and pawned it to get the bail
Argument after argument, drama wasn't hitting well
Target it ain't no harm in it, smart so I didn't tell
God that it was the hardest, yeah life was a living hell
Spent part of it steady dodging it, charging off in the trails
Father say he a Muslim, your mama say she a Christian
The Bible or the Koran, which one would you be picking
The cards are in your palm, ain't really no use in tripping
Be true to the one you choose, ain't really no use in switching
Yeah they gon' have to be mad at us, choice is something I had to trust
Standing up when I had enough, for my blessings not adding up
Take too many things for granted, right after that metal bust
Somebody's life is missing, that's when the spirit grabbing us

[Chorus]

A religion is what you missing, someone tell me how can it
Make people panic, mention God and all the weak people vanish
Take God your woman and your family, even your own life for granted
Until you slanted on the planet, with your face in the granite
And I won't have it, I don't wanna see my coaching divided
So I decided to remind it, there's a choice and provide it
So put your ego to the side, soon as you standing beside it
Raise your right hand, and let the spirit know it's invited
Don't need to fight it, I just wanna make it right 'fore they bury me
Cause the truth is like therapy, plus my conscience is tearing me
Into pieces as deadly was dealt, was not even fair to me
To the soldiers that passed in the game, we missing you terribly
Thank my family especially, in my mind like telepathy
Staying humble is the recipe, keep my faith and he blessing me
I use the energy left in me, to make sure they respecting me
Walk the steps of my destiny, like I know he protecting me
I'm a leader, believe the people won't get to see less of me
No they won't see the death of me, or no police arresting me
I live life so successfully, and just show em the best of me
On another level mentally, this position was meant for me

Plenty niggas get they head turned red for da bread 
Start off with da information, load it up in ya head 
Couldnt hold it, so it turned out its somethin' he said 
Wut he tell da FEDS (he need someone to call) 
Your decision was to snitchin' and they was there to listen 
When he told what he know, said they barely was trippin' 
Less time, now da niggas in a better position 
Unless you count the fact that the streets know he was snitchin' 
He was lookin' at a 30 but he only did 10, 
How your years turn to months, can he tell you dat, and 
He ain't really gotta answer, just the sweat in his hands 
Will he make it out to make it, mm well it depends 
Everybody know the info you was tellin ya friends 
Plus the streets know the deals that you made with the pen 
Russian Roulette, yep nigga bet the barrel will spin 
You hear that, yea nigga that's the sound of revenge 

Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold

Don't wanna do no time right? 
You wanna live that high life 
Like go withdrawal, have a hundred thousand in ya eye sight 
Enter ya crib, see the clouds peepin through ya skylight 
You be a copycat, (cat), 'cause mine right 
That's what he told me but I didn't listen 
Doin' crime for a dime wasn't my intention 
You insane, think his name sumin' I will mention 
Only snitches need someone to tell 
Alotta niggas in the game, hustlin' doin' they thing 
Usin' codes on the phone with they usual slang 
If you know what he know then you won't say a thing 
You wouldn't need someone to tell 
Careful bout the life you lead, ain't smart with ya life, 
You plead, the streets will ignite ya T, like you ain't got the right to breathe 
To choke on da realness, reality is what the fake don't know how to deal with 
Words leak from the teeth, but he'll say seal it 
Then go get a undercover brother he can chill with 
Find a nigga that be hustlin to make a deal with 
But the streets will hold court for him and'll deal with it 

Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta' take ya life slow or you'll miss it

This for the G's, street jugglin', move da fire 
When you talkin what you talkin' it ain't through the wire 
Police pull you over, now they callin' you a liar 
You got amnesia, don't even know the dude beside ya 
You don't know, you ain't sayin', you ain't heard what he said 
Told you a closed mouth ain't gon neva' get fed 
A open mouth'll get you county instead of the F-E-D-S 
Some scared niggas speak up so they'll be less in the red 
Niggas can't deal with no 95 so they day-to-day budgeters 
Its the hustlers that get put away by the customers 
You upstate, niggas use to be southerners 
Here the streets make the laws and don't answer the governors 
We the niggas that's too real to snitch on a snitch 
But make a snitch turn to puff with a flick of the wrist 
That ain't goin' get in arguments, just go get you a clip 
And they goin' think about the consequences, let em repent 

Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold
You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it

I got the diamonds in my mouth

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'ma get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers
Got so many, all my real niggas under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters
God damn, staying healthy is hard as a mo'fucker

[Chorus: x4]

It ain't no lying or fiction, up in me please
I don't exaturrate the price, it was fifteen G's
When they ask, about the colored diamonds in the piece
Yeah I'm one of the richest, southern niggas in these streets
Yeah I'm candy flipper, you can have a picture
While I pose like a playa, by the candy with ya
Koopa never have no time, for no panty pinchers
My nigga, how come you ain't take me to Miami with ya
It's a couple haters out there, that won't let me be
I feel like yelling F' the radio, like SPC
The movie room in my crib, got a empty sweet
I'm with Sway, I'm getting interviewed by MTV
Yeah I'm ill at rapping, but I'm still not capping
Ain't touched a damn drug, and he still ain't trapping
I don't change don't sleep, cause Chamil' ain't napping
Stop acting like platinum, with Chamil' can't happen
I'm a Northside rider, ain't got to worry
Cause the major deal, is not about to turn me
Yeah the controversy, ain't about to hurt me
I don't play no games, like I forgot my jersey
Still ride around the city, with none of my niggas with me
Still ride for H-Town, if don't none of these niggas feel me
Ain't gotta like me, or have none of these niggas hit me
I'm a be the M-V-P, if don't none of these niggas pick me
A lot of rumors in the streets, ain't none of it really pretty
Getting money, makes all of the drama seem itty-bitty
Pick a click, I don't hang with none of these niggas really
But I'm glad that the majors, is running up in the city cause I'm

[Chorus: x4]

Ever since 1999, I had diamonds in my grill
You just rapping that ain't platinum, homie you need to chill
Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill
Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal
These rappers finally get some fame, and think they got it locked
After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch
My gear clean, from my ear rings to my pinky ring
If you ain't spend thirty, boy tuck in your piece and chain (Southside)

[Chorus: x4]

Blucker-blucker-blucker, that's how my gun go
If I'm looking agitated, bitch you better run hoe
I use to do the baguettes, but now I'm VS-1's though
Princess cuts straight up and down, Johnny done those
I got loud ice, just like Paul Wall
Shining down South, brighter than all y'all
When it's time to get your jewelry done, who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip
Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips
These roach ass niggas, trying to make me bust my chips
But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch
I'm from the South, and I got diamonds in my mouth

Snatch the gat, brrr-at! And lyrically wreck that ass officially
I see you live in fairytales, niggas better switch beefs
I had a tooth fairy choke his ass up outa his sleep
Problem with Chamillionaire? Do they mention any names?
Hell no! You scared crow? Try your best to be brave
Got a Smith & Wesson bro, we know that you gon' behave
Safety, your locksmith, like you could get a key made
You all up on the thang like little girls turning teenage
You really a bunch of hoes like 6th street at Texas relays
Ohio to Chicago, I got niggas in them PJ's
Bully, skinny, but the arms strong like you was BJ's
I hear these rapping niggas but believe I'm not a fan of it
I'm here to rid the rap game of all its contaminants
I'm better than the average, I want her, I can have the chick
Doing the same pose as Paris Hilton in them camera flicks (haha)
The mathematics get big cause I'm demanding it
Raping the rap game while these other suckers is romancing it
They worried about its feelings, they don't wanna take a chance with it
Kissing up to the game with rose petals and a candle lit haha

Aay
I'm a southern boy, therefore I stunt
Y'all city slickers, we call it country dump
And I'm chilling like a villain off a killing
Looking at the ceilings like I'm a get in for realer
I'm a get it regardless, hard as it is
Who wants to be a millionaire? Know how I'm a get a million
And I'm in the pavilion
Chilling with my girl but I don't speak Sicilian
But we both count the same as
Long as when I say I'm with it, it come out the same as
If I wanna win with it but I'm out the game
Y'all boys trynna get me killed,  huh
You know the Feds are my biggest fans
I got to watch what the little one's saying, man
They see my momma and they wanna pull her over
Cause she ain't got no number on the back of the Rover
And yep, I'm locing
There's cooler ways to die but I'm smoking
There's cooler ways to ride but I'm soaring
Might do the young G5 or G4
Ay, you never know, when your boy might touring
Just trynna get me some air on Mike Jordan
Of this whole thing right here, I'm staring
Y'all boys just appear, I'm here, the Tardis
So applaud him, yeah
Chinky eyes, keep faring
Look like Keith Moorer, street aura, uh
Still I hustled in the street like he poorer
Run up on him you sleep and eat aura
Decent Christians, he owes momma, those
Gucci seatbelts will look better with the barker
Sit up in my office, you need to rebound
You got a box out, get up put a baller on

Chamillionaire,"Intro:
Uh huh... Yeaah
It's yours truly 
Houston's own Chamillionaire 
Holdin it down for the playa who dont believe in love at first sight (Love at first sight)
But the playa that believe that he can git loven the first night (First night)
Thats right (Thats right)
So before I git to discussion what type of eye candy I need
Or what type of visual stimulation she needs to be able to achieve
There's somethin special aboutchu that aint hard to see

Chorus:
Grown and Sexy 
From ya head down to ya toes ya know you fine (ya know ya fine)
Got that perfect face a perfect shape and perfect smile (a perfect smile)
But soon as ya turned around (Turned around)
There's somethin that I realized (Yeah)
You looked better from behind (You look better from behind)
Grown and Sexy

Verse 1:
From the moment ya flashed ya teeth
I knew that we had to meet
Ya face was the mona lisa, ya ass was a masta'piece
Asked you if you was married
and thats when ya answered “No.”
I asked if you had a nigga
and thats when ya said “Fo' sho.” (So)
I didnt care As you walked away I would stare
Atcha bottom, in apple bottoms
Ya waist was shaped like a pear
Really round at the bottom, a little thinna up there
So insteada lettin ya leave I pursued ya 
Just like the playa
That I am (and damn)
Couldnt help but to help myself
To a helpin cause I smelled some perfume that could make me melt
And ya shoulda seen my demeaner i had to control myself
Approachin you from the rear as I tap you right on ya' belt
And ya tried to looked suprised
like ya didnt know i was right behind ya
But I could tell by ya smile ya was waitin on me to find ya
Mess with my thought a bit
you was playin hard to git
You dont wanna look like a freak and pretend its hard to hit

Chorus:

Verse 2:
Lets give a toast 
to the ladies that look better up close
That look better by the behind
And better when you approach
Ya try ya best to git up close
until ya smellin her soap/ is so lovely ladies
from coast to coast
git in bed and she dont
98 and 99 rate you more than just a dime
bentley steerin-wheel body cause you look better from behind
Grippen around ya waist
turn it like im just tryin to git a better view
Cause god must abeen workin hard
When he asembled you
Im tryint to test-dirve ya rear and ya shaken
Im power stearin ya wasit n'
I see ya rearers are shaken
If ya think I couldnt handle it then ya really mistakin 
No one here to keep you near
Then you here for the taken
Im still waiten
For you to give me one good reason
Why you couldnt leave him speedin off with some good breezin
Ya neva spend another cold night in some hood freezin
But posted up by sand and water during some good season

Chorus:

Outro:
Had to tell ya that I'm really feelin your style
Saw ya walkin by and couldnt letcha pass
Gotta tell ya that I'm eally feelin your smile
But even better is the beauty of ya ass
Staren right into the beautiy of ya profile
There's something that i gotta ask
Can ya let me (Let me...) let me view ya beauty from the back

And the wheels look flat, trunk so heavy in the back
Got the speakers in the front, they be sitting on my lap
Got a bumper to the back, with the trunk weighing it down
Look they think it's a lowrider when they come from my town
That's a King Kong, in the trunk, that's the gorillas behind me

Yeah...
Chamillionaire..Mixtape Messiah baby
Always want to know something bout me man
want to know somethin bout me?
Don't judge me..don't judge me by my music
And don't judge me bout what you heard about me either
Chamillionaire..listen

Ay, My father was Muslim my momma's a Christian
I couldn't even look surprised when they said they was splittin'
Wasn't no bacon or grits in, off in the kitchen
It was missin', plate was full of non-nutrition
I was born skinny the hunger was forced in me
To get angry at my lifestyle, no smile wasn't born friendly
Born with a thorn in me, I'm scorned so I'm pourin' Remi
I'm thinkin' that's boys feel me, but boys is avoidin' me
Oh, got to excuse me for givin' you the truth
And being the type to give proof that you givin' an excuse
You gotta excuse me for gettin' in the booth,
and keepin' it real about life while you livin' in the poof...
fantasy, damnit he, isn't as big a man as me
If I tell him the truth he need to hear then he gettin' mad at me
The truth could hit ya as hard as assault & battery,
and make people that used to run with me switch up and challenge me
But ain't we family? y'all forgettin' what y'all were
Forget what ya boy heard, 'cause this is 'bout more words
It's all 'bout communication but niggas ignore verbs
If ya boy shouted I'm hatin', then that got ya boy served
Don't deny it if you a man, so you should be man enough
I'm far from feminine we take pisses while standin' up                                                                                                            They smokin' on cannibus while they tell us they jammin' us
Look a fan in the face and ask em' ""Are you a true fan or what""?
""Are you really a fan of us""? or are you type to switch
and get pissed and bootleg the disc 'cause I'm not, droppin' em' quick
They love ya and then they diss, they hug ya and then they hiss
They happy when you arrive and go right back to being pissed
Honestly man, I don't really even give a damn
Instead of being who you want me to be I be who I'am
I'm livin' life of my family and live life of Cham'
I don't live life for my fans
And don't, switch up my words just let me explain my thought
I appreciate ya support, I appreciate if ya bought,
my cd's with all ya heart but this music is just an art
But it's not as precious as life in the middle is where I'm caught
Lookin' out for my people, my motive is never evil
My motive was never see-through, my motive was always equal
Outsiders would lie and try to promote it they out (to) decieve you
They give a notice to you, but don't give a notice to me too
Ya, that's somethin' I call divide and conquer
They try to get inside the monster to divide the monster
So they can become the monster, then they'll try to stomp ya
Inside the circle of friends is where you'll find imposters
To hell with y'all niggas

Murder was the case and they blamed me

Officer, I didn't do it; you can't blame me for this
Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists?
You can call me what you wanna, man, but I ain't a snitch
No cooperation is exactly what you would get
Till I talk to my lawyer, you get no reply
You've obviously been watching too much CSI
I'm not a crash dummy so don't even try
To talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI
If you are not guilty of anything, then why did you run?
'Cause you the police, and, plus, I saw you cocking your gun
And the chamber wasn't empty it was obviously one
If you think I'm believing that one, you're obviously dumb)
Huh? (I know that you heard the sirens, you dived in
To the vehicle you was driving and ridin' in
Instead you shouldn't be whining, but abidin' by the law
Nah, it's obvious you're lying

Stop lying to me, boy it'd be best you confess
I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath
Saw the meth while I was inspecting your deck
Saw that you was ridin' dirty when I looked at the rest
Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop?
Who is his other friend who's wearing the sky blue?
Look at this pic here, he standing beside you
Tell me his name now, I heard he was Piru
Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes
For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs
What about this Pimp guy? He was on one of your songs
I coulda sworn he said he had a pocket full of stones
Am I wrong? hell yeah, I don't know who that is
I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich
And I'm a bond like James, bet I be out here quick
Man you ain't getting out of here, you must think that you're slick
In the car we confiscated the chronic and the clips
Diary that you had and all your blueprints
On the Death Row booklet, we found your two prints
Your thumb and your index the judge will love this

Be careful or you'll be history

Somebody tell 'em it's murda

And you can see you're screwed as the evidence pours in
The witness to the crime was at three in the morning
Gave us a description so we picked up your boy and
You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him
A big celebrity, a case we long for
You a pirate, why you got that eye patch on for?
Funny puttin' people in a hearse what I heard for
Where were you the night of April twenty-first, son?
Home I think that you got your facts wrong, gat's on you
Chamillionaire robbed, shot couple cats on Melview
What? we gonna have to jail you, too
In the line-up, don't speak until we tell you to
This the person who jimmed your lock, sir?
Well, he's dark, kinda looked like him, I'm not sure
Failing to nail 'cause assailant's another
Leave, I see an unmarked tailing a brother
Hit the Bodega, not no more game
This chick used to be all nice, acting all strange
Like she was gonna get it, pathetic

Yeah Jay-z I'm callin you out, you suck, you hang out wit 50 cent 'cause you're not worth a dollar buck.

",Flow,2007
Chamillionaire,"It seems that there's a deadly virus that's sweeping through the urban community
The side effects cannot often be seen because your pockets will not turn green
Some thought that there was no vaccine, But it seems that we have a cure
Chamillitary Mayne
Get off your couch and go get it

I'm up early in the morning thinking bout getting this money
All I know is I gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta get it, get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down 
I won't let you down

I'm up early than a mother, chasing mine cause I'm a hustler
Then tomorrow everything is gonna rewind
Only seven days a week and 24 hours a day
That ain't enough for me so I ain't wasting time
Cause only dreams come to sleepers and my life ain't getting cheaper
So you know them dollar signs, they on my mind
When they ask me where I'm goin? I say you already know
I'm bout to hit the streets and go and get what's mine, I won't let you down
Dreams of having finer things, Ridin blades and dreaming should
Make you wanna wake up and get it in real life than see the wood
In your grip, If you slip and don't grab what you see then good
Only place that you gonna be or ever see gonna be the hood

Boy that word ain't no excuse, You know what it mean to me
It means you passing over opportunities repeatedly
Write it on a piece of paper, Only thing I see is P
That paper, paper, paper chaser, better thing for me to be
Nah, my services ain't for free, make that money multiply
Early in the morning I be gone, chase with me, it ain't gonna be no tie
Try to explain and give em game, I don't know why I even try
You do the same if you was I, but you are you so you gonna lie
Make em think that you got cash, tell them ladies you got slabs
Only thing you get is laughs, You can't even bring down half
Of the bill that's on that tab, Only thing wrong with being broke
Is staying broke and making excuses bout it like there ain't no hope

I don't know how many times I gotta tell ya
In the hood, having no condition, I was having something
I remember it like it was yesterday
They was talking down on me and I lost a couple homies
I was getting mine while they used to play
They say I need to slow down but I ain't slowing down for nothing
I don't wanna let the paper get away
So when I'm in the streets grindin, ain't no need to be crying
The best way that you can help me is to pray I won't let you down
Partners that was getting lazy, Females that was acting crazy
Then promoters that tried to play me, Mixtape labels that didn't pay me
My old homies that ain't around me, Dissing rappers that came to find me
Major labels that didn't sign me, left all that nonsense behind me, I got paid

See, rich people ain't going to tell you how to get paid
And broke people act like they the richest people in the world
Always tellin people with money how to get it
Always spendin money that they thought they was gonna get.
Always buying things they can't afford.
Stop making excuses.
If chronic smoke makes him sleepy, he's gonna tell ya he got chronic fatigue
If liquor makes him drowsy, he gonna say he got that grey goose disease
If women keep taking his money, he gonna tell ya he slipped off his sleeve

[Chamillionaire]
Man... you knew that you had those warrants
You kept ignoring those warnings
You said that it was annoying
Like makin them payments wasn't important
Yo' tv in the pawn but you tell people it's in the storage
And when the police pull you over you be givin' an oscar performance
A ticket you can't afford it
With expired plates on your taurus
Your baby momma stay trippin cause none of them kids is supported
You messed up every appointment
Thats why you ain't got employment
With spiderwebs in your wallet your pockets look like they haunted
You always wanted to be famous, well you gonna get what you wanted
America's most wanted, they 'bout to see ya up on it
You normally move like a tortuise, but you get in your car and your floor it
But you can't even escape cause the repo man got you cornered

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
Better pick up your phone, better pick up your phone
Seems like every time I call you I just get a dial tone
Better pick up your phone, better pick up your phone
Seems like every time I call you I just get a dial tone

Betta check the check the checker you checking. you ain't gotta profit
And you try to hide until the repo man come and shake up dem pockets
I'm talkin to you cause your rent is due and you ain't tryna drop it
Til the lights turned off in your crib like lamps that ain't got no sockets
They comin' to get what you got and you tryin to say you ain't got it
You ain't paid a payment, a part of it, half a peice or deposit
So I suggest that its best that you use some reason or logic
Or the bill collect is comin' to come and see ya about it
Got it?

[Chorus]

[Krayzie]
Yall just betta have my dough because
I'm comin around the corner hundred miles and gunnin
Finna ride by dumpin'
If anybody owe me somethin', then I strongly suggest you run it
Yall better respect the bill collecta
Or you'll get chin checked like the rest of 'em
Never did joke when it come to the decimal
When it come to gettin dough I'm a professional (fresh ya know)
In it to win it
I get to bombin in a minute
Any and every thing over three digits
These suckas they really think krayzie be slippin'
But I'm here to tell em I den already bent em
Money is a mission gotta have that dolla bill yall
Fell its really enough to kill yall
I might fall but I get right back up and still ball
Stil raw
Still get down with the buck bang
So give me all my change
Bust brains, cause I gotta maintain
Got just enough game to get me paid
Just enough aim to leave you laid
Out on the pavement
Down on the game

Chamillionaire,"Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning,
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?,
Sending the troops in the war so I turn in,
To today's evening news.

Welcome to the evening news, I thank you all for tuning in,
Yes, I'm your host and your journalist,
here Chamillionaire, so let the news begin,
Our helicopters out in the streets
look at the screen, an' let's zoom it in,
'Cause Cashis is live at the scene,
hey Cashis how are you my friend?,
Got no time for no interviews (go-got no time for no interviews),
No time to trip we don't get confused,
'cause this type of news opinion and views
Got no time for no interviews (go-got no time for no interviews),
You know I keep my ear to the streets
so it's up to me to bring you the truth,
I saw a movie where George Bush had a bearded man on his squad,
So much power from oil money that poor folks can't sit by him,
No problem, Osama, Bin Laden, Been hidin'
So long that them pictures all starting to look like him on them milk cartons,
Don Imus made comments that made everybody forget about him,
That's him, Anna Nicole got pregnant and had kids by him,
Rest in peace Virgina Tech, too many innocent kids dyin',
Well let's just blame hip-hop and act like that's the big problem,

Now I would give you news about Katrina,
but you know I can't talk about Katrina,
'Cause everytime I talk about Katrina,
they look at me like it's a misdemeanor,
Anyways, there's way more important stuff that we can discuss,
George Bush is playing golf, everybody hush, he's about to putt.

Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning,
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?,
Sending the troops in the war so I turn in,
To today's evening news.
And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
This is your evening news.

I know you take offense to certain words,
I've heard worse, but I wouldn't blame ya',
They say he's a entertainer, don't worry about it, nevermind Kramer,
The Crocodile Hunter got stung,
and the lion turned on the lion tamer,
We keep sending troops to Iraq,
I figured that we must like danger,
Little kids don't learn in school
they go to school to go spray a gun,
If you a parent, then be a parent,
get off the couch and go raise your son,
Kobe just broke another record, today's game he hit 81,
Now they saying he's number 1, but yesterday they all hated him,
OJ was named innocent, he got no sentence, he's still alive,
It's very ironic that the lawyer that defended him had to die,
Well, now my cue card says the price of gas isn't really high,
But I'm not going to read that,
'cause we all know that that's a lie.

Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning,
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?,
Sending the troops in the war so I turn in,
To today's evening news.

We still haven't found Pac's killer,
still haven't found Biggie's either,
30 minutes into the case they got tired and took a breather,
Snoop Dogg just got arrested, everyday he get a new subpoena,
Innocent when murder was the case
so the prosecution got a middle finger,
Hip-Hop is sweeping the nation, but the contents seem so degrading,
Most rappers got new albums that white kids are anticipating,
If you don't like it on the radio
or the television then switch the station,
Flavor Flav get a lot of ratings, Bill O'Reilly somewhere is hating,
Kanye just said WHAT? the president ain't got time for that,
The White House is going to stay white even tho' we know Obama's black,
9/11 was a calculation, and some would say it was a timed attack,
He gave a speech on CNN, they bombed us, now we're bombing back,
Where the heck is Osama at?

And I would love to talk about Katrina,
but everytime I talk about Katrina,
they look at me like it's a misdemeanor
Anyways, there's way more important stuff that we can discuss
N'Sync, Makin da band and Milli Vanilli had broken up,

Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning,
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?,
Sending the troops in the war so I turn in,
To today's evening news.
And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)

Bring her around ya boyz but be careful they gon get you

See, I got a clue when Young Dro said his girlfriend got a girlfriend
That girlfriend of his girlfriend had Chamillionaire as her man
Then T-Pain said he was sprung, said he had fell in love with a stripper
I shoulda known that you was the stripper that was on the pole tuggin on his zipper
Kanye said that you was a gold digger, You always wanted to be major paid
I turned on my TV and then I seen you kissin on Flava Flav
We was both fans of UGK, we was both dreaming bout ridin blades
While I was dreaming, you was gettin laid on everybodys bed and I was getting played
Yung Joc knew that we was through, said he knew he didn't stand a chance
You stood still while my song played and his came on and you did his dance
You kept begging me for romance, I kept telling you that's enough
You turned on my boy Juvenile and then proceeded to back that up
Pitbull said 'Culo!' and I ain't even that good at Spanish
But I knew he was talking to you, I was down with you so I couldn't stand it
Don't try to lie, Don't try to cry, Ain't nothing more for us to talk about
Like Unk told ya take 2-Steps towards the door and just walk it out

Gave Bun B a little groupie love, you gave Pimp C a little groupie love
And then you bumped into the whole Screwed Up Click and gave every member in the group a hug
Even messed with my boy Slim Thug, he pulled up, you had a heart attack
You tried to mess with Game and 50 but neither one of em called you back
Ask J.R., my car was pushed to the limit on Cool & Dre
Plus Rick Ross was Hustlin' that money outcha like everyday
You knew that I loved you was them three words that I'd never say
Now your business all over the radio and its the penalty that you have to pay
You made the choice to go and be a freak, even had Akon been smacking that
Her plan was to get ran through by a linebacker or a quarterback
R Kelly didn't have to tell me about your bump-n-grind and your foreplay
I found out and I asked you if this was true, you said no way
Birdman said 'Believe Dat!', T.I.P. was like 'Shawty!'
Then Young Jeezy said 'That's Right!' and Lil' Jon said 'Okay!'
Heard you was messin with Ray J, you did a flick is what they say
I ain't even wanna look at the tape until P.Diddy said Press Play

I got ladies that love my ladies
Haters that hate my haters
I'm a Chamillionaire, but got billionaires for my neighbors (Rock On)
I been havin' paper, I been havin' stacks
The crowd screamin' loud in every city on the map
Got the groupies goin' crazy, they don't know how to act
I bring em backstage and tell em baby just relax

Rock on, they see the jewels is so sick,l like flu spit and flu cough
Take it off and you lost, the tough talk get tooled off
Keep the four iron near, keep on thinkin' that it's for golf
Nickel Plate on your head, silverware's food for thought
Grammy winner the haters is like 'How could this happen?' (how?)
On the red carpet so much they mistake me for Aladdin (wow?)
How I'm a rapper with revenue like a rock star?
If I'm near you can believe the black card is not far
'Teen Spirit' ain't what they smellin', they yellin' 'Where that Nirvana?'
The crowd is rockin' n rollin', them swishers full of marijuana
They judgin' me like your honor, your daughter's here with her mama
They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna
Famous look right at me and said 'Know why I got my lighter up?'
Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias I'm a 'Puff'
See how we rippin up tickets that police be writin us
Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up

[Chorus]
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
I got em screamin' loud as they be screamin' comin' out broads daily
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady
Like a rockstar (Lady)
Like a rockstar (Lady)
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star (Baby)
Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job (Baby)

And if it's for me
Then its foreign
I mean my cars, I mean my clothes
I mean my hos, I mean my flows
You dress different round then me I'm a clean your nose
Step into the line of fire hide the penal code
Compared to big foot, you just twinkle toes
I get ya girlfriend wet like wrinkled clothes
Rock star like, money, drugs, freaky hos
World tours, walkthroughs and T.V. shows
My hair's out (Hey!)
No Shirt (Hey!)

I'm so cool, I'm so smooth, I'm that dude, I'm so fly
Groupies tellin' me like a spy, the ground be tellin' me that I'm fly
The cloud see me and they cry just to get a glimpse of I
Got Mother nature so jealous she knockin' pigeons out the sky
Can't help it, i got em rockin' they pelvic-bones
And losin' clothes
The higher my album sales get
They love me, that's right you nailed it
They treatin' me like I'm Elvis
Naked pictures she mailed
She licked on a stamp and melted
So save your rap for the rookies, 'cause there ain't no rappers here
A show you do in a club is a show we do in the ampitheatre
We packin' stadiums, ladies come in I'll introduce ya
It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like LaLaPalooza
We outshinin' the losers, know i ride with the Ruger
You know I'ma producer, weapon upside ya medulla
Got no time to seduce a Super Head type of seducer
Groupies tyrin' to snake me, but Koopa denyin' Medusas

What part of the voyage is this?
Friendship and business don't mix
Wit anyone else its just business
Wit friends I'm personally pissed
Is this a curse or a gift?
Guess i was blessed wit my wish
Don't tell me that u feel my pain
That I sayin' its best if we switch
You take the fortune and fame
And see if its what u expected
Take the money and change
And be careful where u invest it
Just take the test and don't stress it
You get stopped by a detective
Tryna get in ya personal life
The gotta do yo best to protect it
The answer rests in a message
When I go I'll go in a blaze
But it wont be no captain savin'
Cuz where I'm goin ya saved
Tryna rain down on my parade
Till that umbrella get raised
They thinkin' that they can read me
Then they ain't knowin' my page
Tryin' to keep a smile on my face
Even at times when I engage
In business conversations
Wit people I know are snakes
If life is a piece of cake
Part of the icing is venom
Spent a lifetime tryin to bring me down
But I jus ain't gonna let em
Ya betta tell em

Bein more patient than patience
Tryin to wait for the good news to show up
But im unfortunately waitin'
Gotta be group participation
If its intercourse that we making
I was unfortunately done
And she was unfortunately fakin'
Cuz the only sexual spark


Is the spark he got for the dough
They say till death do us part
But that part is where she says no
There are too many emotions
Emotions like pins and needles
Actin' like emotions are evil
Like showin love is illegal
I thought that it was a eagle
But I've seen this vulture before
He thinks this is where i stop
'Cause he sees that I'm walkin slow
But no I think you should know
That soon as I get where I go
You'll remember the fact that
I had a purpose fa'sho

This road has many curves
Many bumps and potholes
It can even take you thru a loop if u ain't got yo
Shit togetha unpredictable weather could leave ya
Dehydrated frostbitten washed away or eitha
Ran ova by heavy traffic watch where you roam
Cuz its a challenge jus tryna make it home
But still I walk I keep my pace I keep my stride
Would hitchhike, but there's too much pride
I must find a narrow path
So I can walk and laugh out loud
Cry and sing without bein judged by the crowd
Maybe someday I could just fly away but for now
I'll jus beat my feet and get there someway somehow
And mile after mile after mile I'll smile
Keepin my head up even though rain's pourin down
And the road gets rough and the journey is long
I might get tired but I must move on

Used to treat me like the bad guy from Houston,
And the media was like Darth Vader,
People turnin' like turntables,
Stay crossin' over like crossfaders,
Try to switch up teams, like ball playas,
So our enemies are like our neighbors,
Keep 'em close, yeah very close,
Most of my folks are still on papers,
You can work, or you can have the work,
But we makin' more than all of y'all wages,
Motivation, makes hustlas make ya,
So we successful because y'all made us,
Used to not, give a flyin' eff,
When they greated us with that one finga,
Whole world jumped on the tip,
And we hit the switch and sat on swangaz,
In the hood they say y'all famous,
Grindin' hard, so we can ball later,
They be like damn, that boy made it,
If they say I didn't, that's wrong data,
First the braud, would try to say I'm fraud,
See me pull that waud, and that braud changes,
Callin' me, she wanna be on the team,
And now she's mad because I'm ignorin' pagers,
Boys thinkin' that they can serve me,
Y'all actin' like y'all waiters,
Same ones who used to walk pass me,
We was underground, but now we on majors,
Keep speakin', beggin' for a beat,
And I'll tell the streets to give that boy a favor,
Turn 'em purple blue and red, all flavors

That look like that,
Then you seen wrong,
Better sit back and relax,
Cause my platinum reign is gonna sing long,
And I don't blame boys for hatin',
Because they wasn't patient,
And they didn't know the plan,
I knew that something had them shakin,
It was gonna bubble like a Coka Cola can,

I could of caught that through the trees,

Let's give a cheers, (give 'em cheers!)
To everyone who thought I'd disappear,
Thought that every word I said,
Was a subliminal shot to disappear,
Now I'm in a different gear,
No beef, no hate, no dissin' here,
You must of been drunk to doubt me,
You obviously didn't miss a beer,
I used to argue about everything,
With folks that just didn't hear,
Realized, I was wastin' words,
Like whisperin' in a missin' ear,
I say it good and real,
They tellin' me it isn't clear,
My two eyes just didn't tear,
'Cause weakness is what I didn't feel, (yeah!)
It's a better result than last time,
But this grind, it's a different year,
I really should be commended,
For what I've accomplished,
Give a cheer

Thanks for openin' my eyes and helpin' to me to realize that tomorrow ain't promised, gotta live life to the fullest, whats life if you ain't enjoyin' it, know what I'm talkin' bout'?

My purpose really used to be so unclear
Science fiction with the swagger its so unreal
So fly that my nickname should be up here
Lookin' up is the only time when I appear
I'm a spartan, go ahead and through your spear
Slap failure in the face and still show no fear
They say no show but I show like yea (The champs here)
But the whole crowd know my cheer (Victory)
The media they write about you in the mass, spread rumors bout ya' life and write you was detatched
I know one of my three publicists would ruin my chance, so let me let you know I don't like you in advance but I (thank you)
And I extend their thanks to, to everybody sayin' stuff you know ain't true
You need to go and find God like Mase too, and just stay there with him and try to stay you
Gettin' away is important
I could pull a couple strings like a guitar hand
Better yet bring out the whole guitar band
Grab green we could swing somewhere like Tarzan
I swear to yall' the rap game really makin' me sick
The record industry's your home then I came to evict
Put some nonsense out and I bet you this one'll stick
I put real music out and I'm probly' gon' catch a brick
Brick, on top of brick we'll build a house
Tell whoever said that I'm still filled with doubt
Told me I'm in the right hole then sealed it out
Told me I'm on the right track and killed my route (Ouch)

You never miss a good thing till it's gone
Ya the flow is so fluid it's like drinkin' a song (Don't get the track listing wrong)
This ain't even a song
This is a beat that I must release therapy on
Everybody singin' that they wanna see me successful
Came into the game but now I'm feelin' like (Let's go)
Intimate moments never seem to be special
See the jet, you can bet I'm disappearin' like (Presto)

Never would understand what really matters to Cham so matter of fact the title is just a matter of plan (Victory)

Now that everybody's present and it's Victory night
Let me re-paint the pic, they wasn't depictin' me right (Now what you mean?)
Tell the world that I'm more than just a grille
Show ya how to put your hands on more than a wood wheel
If that's all your hearin' then let me just be for real
Take your contract, To hell with a record deal
Keep thinkin' I'ma lose if you want to
Been through 10 times more in life than you've gone through
Thats why, I always have to make the move on fools
Back on my feet like I got 2 gum shoes
Ya, why you think Em probly' goin' all crazy
Why you think Britney Spears goin' bald baby
Interview me you think you know it all lady
I'm outta here (ya) but not before yall pay me (Thank you)

I appreciate it
You know I'ma use the power respect and the million dollar check to do what I wanna do, but right now, I'm finna take a vacation

That's why I ain't in love,
Try to say I ain't in love,
Then I go right back on my word,
And we end up makin' up, hold up


[Chorus:]
I try and try to stay in love,
But no matter what I do,
It just ain't enough,
It ain't enough,
It ain't enough,
It ain't enough,
You say it ain't enough,
And everytime,
I think it's love,
It just ain't good enough,
And we breakin' up,
We breakin' up,
We breakin' up,
We breakin' up,
'Cause love just ain't enough


[Verse 2:]
See,
It's like I love,
And I hate almost everything about ya,
I be indian givin' a livin',
Takin' back everything I bought ya,
Even indian givin' a ceiling,
When I'm tellin' you get outta,
Here, you disappear,
Then the next day you come back home to papa,
And my mood get madder,
When I'm in the streets,
And I think I spot ya,
Thinkin' I forgot ya,
And I'm movin' on 'cause I think I gotta,
See I end up losin',
Everytime that I try to think I got ya,
'Cause you always move,
And I want to,
But I ain't gon' even stop ya,
You be all in my pocekts like feed me,
Makin' this type of livin' ain't easy,
I be givin' my all to you,
All you do is be talkin' greasy,
And I know you probably don't believe me,
Everytime that you say that you'd leave me,
I be gettin' impatient,


And waitin', hopin' that you'd make it speedy,
So I figured, I'd tell ya the truth,
'Cause I knew that it would free me,
Give ya everything that I could,
But you still kept actin' greedy,
You let the world come inside,
You shouldn't had been actin' sleezy,
'Cause now you pregnant,
With rappers that lie on half their cds


[Chorus:]
I try and try to stay in love,
But no matter what I do,
It just ain't enough,
It ain't enough,
It ain't enough,
It ain't enough,
You say it ain't enough,
And everytime,
I think it's love,
It just ain't good enough,
And we breakin' up,
We breakin' up,
We breakin' up,
We breakin' up,
'Cause love just ain't enough


[Verse 3:]
Now I can't even lie,
That I was in love with you,
We did everything together,
That lovers do,
The love done died,
I think it's time to move,
In a direction that ain't got nothin' to do with you,
And everytime, I think of us,
I think that it's time that I made some things adjust,
My love ain't as strong for you as I thought it was,
Baby I'm breakin' up with you now,
And it's all because


[Chorus:]
I try and try to stay in love,
But no matter what I do,
It just ain't enough,
It ain't enough,
It ain't enough,
It ain't enough,
You say it ain't enough,
And everytime,
I think it's love,
It just ain't good enough,
And we breakin' up,
We breakin' up,
We breakin' up,
We breakin' up,
'Cause love just ain't enough


[Talking:]
I ain't gonna lie,
I used to wake up with thoughts of you on my mind,
But now you just get on my nerves,
Even when you no even tryin',
People tell me that it's gonna be better,
But I tell 'em that they lyin',
My love for you is definently dieing,
And the way you changed,
Is not a good sign,
I wonder how you gonna feel,
When I'm no longer around,
Nah, don't even try to start cryin',
After you built me up,
And then tried to break me down,
It's just a matter of time,
Before I had to give you a piece of my mind,
And maybe I could spend the rest of my time,
Havin' peace in mind,
You couldn't even say one thing,
That you know that no one know,
Everytime I see you gossipin' about so and so,
You immitate,
You instigate,
You turn love, into instant hate,
You the reason why I punched my ex-homeboy in the face,
In the streets,
Chasin' the same money I gotta give to my lawyer to win a case,
Tearin' up my rap sheet,
'Cause now I got a rap sheet that can't get erased",We Breakin Up,2007

Welcome to the South
Try to criticize us for how we live
They gon do the same things that we just did
Betta watch your mouth
Try to criticize us for how we spit
Then say you respect the money that we get
Welcome to the south
Watch em criticize everything we did
And expect that us to never even trip
We know them grills and candy paint
So be careful what you say
Cuz we might just throw it right back in your face
Betta watch your mouth

[Verse 1]
[Chamillionaire]

Uh I cross the globe
I hit a hater
Same whispers from state to state
If you didn't say then this ain't for you
Don't worry bout it cuz you can't relate
Before you buy me then you criticize me
While you beside me
Lets get it straight
Cuz you remind me of the kid beside me
Same rapper that you say you hate
Wanna criticize then fine
Say the south got simple rhymes
Everytime I travel I'm in the backyard that act just like mine
Same rhyme just different times
I don't think that it changed a lil
Used to show our grills and they be like ew
Nowadays they all say thats ill
I remember when the major label
Wouldn't even come pay a visit
Used to say they had love for us but
They just blowin them suspect kisses
Now you watchin me see you plottin me
Can't act like we ain't suspicious
Shoot the slugs you shoot at us but when you bust your thang it misses, uh
I ain't leavin much trippin
Cuz im a man where I'm residing
Im decidin where I'm residing
Should never tolerate domestic violence
I know you'd rather me just relax and sit back in silence
But I'm the owner not just the client
Shit the south is where I stay at

Don't knock the swagga, don't knock the swagga
Then turn around and be a swagger jacker
You a man and you should be a man
Don't walk around without an Adam's apple
We was lookin at it from a distance
But we wasn't trippin cuz it had to happen
Styrophone cup and a snapla, you actin like you been a fan of rappers
You was hatin or participatin when you saw sub anuba slidin through
You and everybody else that did it, they applauded them and they applauded you
You actin like somebody made ya say it
Took your hand and then applied the glue
Turn around and give the mic to you
And now you end up lookin like a fool
Can't holla ya, some followers
and thats the reason I'm in the lead
The rest of yall are some benchwarmers and gettin mad cuz I'm in the lead
I'm switchin speeds, don't get fatigued
Yall behind in line, yall chasin me
Yall finna see my energy, so get off my back and let a playa breathe
I won't lie and act like I'm the one supportin everything
Like southern rappers ain't never lame
Like some of these boys don't eff up the game
Most of us do our thang
And the rest of em leave my ears in pain
But thats him and he sure ain't me
So don't look at us like we all the same

Never been a socializer
Flyin high, work grinder, knock ya gal you can't find her
She was sittin on butter
Hundred thousand under her ass
I was workin the wood, circle smokin candy mashin on the gas
I can't be you, I can't do you
I just do me, if you ain't
Been where I been then you can't
Be who I be if you ain't
Seen what I see and you can't see what I see
I put the bricks in the rolla with slabs on that wasn't free
Been a legend in the south since the year '93
Pocket full of stones, menace to society
The heart in the car chrome and folds, not B's
Now everybody pimpin and they all got keys

But every time they gave me my mic he told them hoes to let me go. 
DJ trippa suckin' on nipples pimpin on grands she playin' with cock 
Pull that zippa she aint Twista she get money fast now its in her mouth 
Nigga you know what I'm about if you silent I'm gonna ride 
I run the south this is my house I tell the truth even when I lie. 
Atlanta is the country and Georgia boys cool 
Its all you out of town fagot niggas fuckin' up all the rules. 
That ain't blow thats reckon 
That ain't dro thats popcorn 
You fuckin' right they comin' back 
Like you sellin' it cheap cause they stepped on, bitch

[Chorus: x2]

[Chamillionaire]
No reprise for the cars I'm stayin' up in the foreign. 
Wanna wake up my neighbors and the other clicks in the mornin'
If me and Bun wasn't tourin' I swear the game would be borin'
If bein' fake was a felony all yall rappers be starrin'. 
In Americas most wanted I missed that Pimpin' and Pac 
So it seems that me and Bun B is the realest people you got 
My paper chase gettin' faster I'm even beaten the clock. 
When it comes to gs the tick tock is gonna get beat to the dock. 
Gave birth to the hustle so let my fetus be shown 
When I pull out them baby Benjamin's and I skeet on your dome. 
I'm secreetin' the dough so don't leave your women alone 
Ill turn my dick to a dollar and give your women a loan 
My presence on the Texas streets is somethin' easy to spot 
I'll assassinate concrete for the G's I'm bleedin' the block. 
Boys'll see me on swingers and think its easy to plot 
But I bet them boys behind me wont be beamin' up Scott.

Hol' Up

Chamillitary mayne

All pussy niggaz make your way
To the exit right now

It's finna' go down

[Verse 1]
How you up on the East and West
And you ain't heard about me
That's like claimin you a boxer
And ain't heard of Ali
Breakin' off pussy niggaz saying words about me
Definition of a real nigga, is a certified me
I'm passin through customs with american I.D
Puerto Rican at the gate tellin me ""Hurry Papi""
Southwestern Airlines with the burner, I'll be
Lettin one off in the air, the other sure to fly free
If you hatin', Tough nigga, turn that dude to a stuttera
Govern like I'm a Governor, from the south I'm a Southerna
I'm never lovin' her, I just put rubber gloves in her
And I go get another hoe when her lover discovers her
(Haha) You niggaz know you in trouble
I'm more trouble if you don't know the hell you in trouble for
But please, please, don't make the punisher punish ya
If you gotta girl, then don't get a beat down because of her
Yo metal metal, hit yo head with the barrel
Make yo head cave in, have yo head lookin' narrow
Then I head to the ghetto, to get rid of my metal
Vehicle changin orange, to the red, to the yellow
Chamillionaire, one of the south's harders lyricist
Now you pussy's hearin this, salute the color changin pyramid
Other boys is trouble, other boys is gimmicks kid
If you speak up for em, then yo career disappear with his

[Chorus]
Southern niggaz don't dance
We be saggin' our pants
So low you could see our boxers mayne
We body rock, we body rock (what else?)
We body rock, we body rock (fa sho)
Southern niggaz don't dance
We be saggin' our pants
So low you could see our boxers mayne
We body rock, we body rock (what else?)
We body rock, body rock, body rock
Mayne!

[Verse 2]
Only imagine how close
All the diamonds in the jewel sit
Invisable set, canary yellow
As a tulip
I could spit some calm words
To you through my two lips
Or I could have them hollow tips
Poppin out them two clips
You pick, don't run up on me
with your tool slick
I be damned if I get jacked with a strap
Up under my blue knit
Don't do nothing foolish, cause I'll completely loose it
Give a player a new breathin hole with a pool stick
I got hoes, square rooted, doubles and cubics
They be come in groups of two or more
And they be wantin to do it
Got females that do lick, and some that strictly do dick
And if your freaky prove it, I'll go get the cool whip
If you love yourself so much, that you don't want to prove it
You can get up outta here and you could get excluded
Don't know what click that you with, I'm king of the new click
(What click?) Click color change clack, rap, I plan to rule this

[Chorus]
Southern niggaz don't dance
We be saggin' our pants
So low you could see our boxers mayne
We body rock, we body rock (what else?)
We body rock, we body rock (fa sho)
Southern niggaz don't dance
We be saggin' our pants
So low you could see our boxers mayne
We body rock, we body rock (what else?)
We body rock, body rock, body rock

Not A Criminal
",Not a Criminal [Without Gun Shots],2008
Chamillionaire,"My life
My life, really feelin hard times

Lookin' out my window, holdin' my weapon like Malcolm X and
And it seems I'm over-stressin', feelin' like hatin' is your profession
And I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin'
So I never be oversteppin' boundaries bounded to my weapon
When they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em ""I'm doin' super""
I got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya
Her little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future
And legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa
This recession is so pathetic, got me feelin' like I'm athletic
And success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it
When they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was ""I don't get it""
And I'm still havin trouble believin' it happened the way they said it
Had to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault
I've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss
But I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss
So I be sleepin' with one eye open and put cameras in my vault
I've been thinkin' and gettin' deep and they tryna tell I been preachin'
But I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin'
So stop reachin, stop leachin, I'm a fade 'em out like bleach and
In the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent
Europe to UK and Germany, travellin' currently
Made so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity
Accustomed to hittin' customs with that duffle full of currency
When God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me, Koopa

[Chorus: x4]
I'm just livin' my life, so cold
In the streets so I'm takin' it slow

Uh, yeah
I'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie

It a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time
But since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin' fine
I live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin'
And since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha)
I'm paralysis when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain
Feelin' like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain
Anything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name
Forgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin' insane
Media criticizing me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well
I just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga
I'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster
So every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin' for a gangster
It's bad enough the world we livin in all about money
Since we runnin' out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny
I've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it
I'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it

[Chorus: x4]

Last year was a hard one but life goes on
Thinkin' bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song
And the list goes on, all my niggas is gone
I'm tired of hearin' bad news, scared to pick up my phone
Got a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home
Just seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong
Kelvo, Arborea, even my girl Shantz
I just heard word she got stabbed to death today
Dear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain
From their family and their friends, please help us change
Still warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank
My girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin' out my drank
It's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen
Seem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end
I'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated
You never know when showin' your love might be related, ha ha

So I, just pull out the bazooka

Gripping on the wheel
Turn it turn it
Blow another stack
I earned it earned it
Blow another [unverified]

Pull another tram
Light another blunt
Burn it burn it
Flame it up
Hear my flow, I changed it up
Everybody grab your gats

And hold em, load, sock em
Lock em, cock em
And aim it up
Bang it up
Off in the sky
Catch me rollin' off in the ride

26 inches
Leave em defenseless
45 always tucked in the side
Open your eyes
See me cruisin'

'Cause I keep winning
And these boys keep losing
Plus I'm, the pimp of the year
Playas is hatin' and hos is choosing

Look at all the hos you losing
Then look at all the game I got
And you can catch me creepin' on the low low
Luda ridin' solo, beatin' the block

In the streets I'm peepin' game
I can't trust you, no no
All up in my bigness mayne
I stay on the low low

Say they really really fake
Can't mess with you no mo'
Closest people to you hate

Today we'll break through the walls set in our way,

No
You could say but you really won't know
You could say what you really want

You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
'Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying ""Hi Britney"" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line (The number you dialed has been disconnected)

Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm care free with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how I'm with her I feel whole too
Go ahead, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he's on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4AM and out at 8 for work
And I'm the reason we ain't made it work

Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before, I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back like ""that's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all this money hoping I don't get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams

Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful, too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop, helping him do good in school
Damn that acid it burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
High schools, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain’t tryna go out at all

Norma jean wouldn't kick it with farmer phil, but these kids these days, they get so
High, burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit, shit-faced
Faced it, 15 hits on this l elevated, train, and the craziest
Thing, got me feeling like Lauryn hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap bill bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it, probably shoulda been dead or in jail

You be flowing about drugs and a uzi
That's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the higgs boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did voltron
Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the obi-wan kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
Ima end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes

Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against we tryna get lucky

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes, and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lotta niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits

Move to the neighborhood, I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's rollie, and call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain save a hood, hood savior, baby boy, still get ID'd for swishers
Mama still wash my clothes, still with Save Money militia
Ima still watch my bros
Trapped in the middle of the map, with a little bitty rock
And a little bit of rap
That with a literary knack and a little shitty Mac
And like literally jack

Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

They merking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at? Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees, look like we had a fucking hurricane here
They be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position,
Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitching

If you was there, then we just knew you'd care, too

It just got warm out, this this shit I've been warned about
I hope that it storm in the morning, I hope that it's pouring out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dying first
Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer, so pray to God for a little more spring

Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'mma ball King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you want to play pool in my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a menage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up

I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face

You think of mother's bosom
She's so green you'd flip but probly shouldn't
I hope she catch her tail and her circles get smaller
Before the drill ain't a drill and the wolf is for real
And the wolf is for real

Now is this just a prisoner without a cage?
So trapped in this life, you better make it out alive
You better give it another try or you won't make it out alive

Now silent and slowly
After a while she's lonely
She waits to die
A livin' waste of time
All this green, no blue skies
All sunny days are cold as ice

If you try to fuck it up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you don't make the choice
And you don't use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instead
What you want is just within your reach
But you gotta practice what you preach
If you use sweat and tears
And overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

Wanna put you in a net for their light glow
Yellow brick high way, paparazzi pile-up on the high road
They just turned the sun into an idol
They just wanna see how high the sky go
Just to find how it feel to fall bad
Madonna said I remind her of Michael
Steady blowing up my head, blowing up my head
Put it on your wall
Put me in the school book, put me in the laws
Put me in a descant in the Synagogue
Firefly gold, wanna catch ya
Wanna catch you when your lights go dim
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen

Gotta be to fuck with the coldest

Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But she was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height to wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalt of Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal of tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with the foot on water and the foot on land
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs
It was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground",How Great,2016

I am him standing
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and your arms just to harness you up

Forget the truth inhale the lies
Just enjoy the show

I'm in the penthouse, baby
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs
Held back, I had to grab crab legs

Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view
What a dress, what a song
What a beautiful time

They never been in these rooms
Never stayed with these folks
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes

Forcing a new smile, he tells me another
He said ""What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?""
Then he pushed me off the top and said ""Jump, nigga jump!""

I'm tryna find God through a purchase, I'm not tryna go to church
Amen, Satan, told me not to serve

I only think about my come-up, capitalism

In years and cds, I put the indy in Windy City
Indian giver, Black father, White liar
Right next to Eazy like Mike Myers
Stare at the cue cards, take out the juke parts
Take out the God references, just leave the cool parts
I remember opening for Ben, wasn't no liquor at the show
And now the white girls call me nigga at my show
I wish that I could open twice, sit down at the open mic
Go back to the day before I became famous over night
I wish that I could open twice, sit down at the open mic
Go back to the day before I became famous over night

Chance the Rapper,"I think happiness went the other way
Sometimes you just have to wait
I never believed in God
But things got so fucked up
That I had to pray
I used to steal my Daddy's cabernet
Never thought it would turn into a rattlesnake
Thinkin', everything will be all right
If we could get thru the week
Maybe see another Saturday
All the while where we know where to go
Argue with the homies over who's gonna roll
Bumpin' Goodie Mob as some food for the soul
Till it's two in the morning
When rain hits the windshield
And everything is still
Nothing really is a big deal?
One hand on the steering wheel
And we gon' be all right

I had a brown paper bag
St. Ides in that motherfucker
In the city where we smash
5-0 comin' then you know I'm running
Crawling broken fences, when shit gets hard
You know who your friend is
And I lose perspective
Need to go to a place where I lose reception
Looking at the satellites pass by
Reflectin' on my past life
I can barely remember last night
Another  morning, swear its the last time
Where would I be?
Can't start over if you don't get a new ID
I know the devil fancy me
But that don't mean that motherfucker gets to dance with me

I bought a house, second guessing what I own now (What?)
Traffic moving kinda slow now (What?)
I watch the population grow wild (What?)
A bunch of people I don't know now (What?)
My city's changed and I'm zoned out
I thought about New York, maybe SoCal
Put up condos people can't afford now
Marks bulldozed been tore down
Overpopulated but the city is a ghost town
Keep a little real ones with me
When it goes down
Lack of diversity, I think about Sloane now
Only reason I would ever leave my hometown
If I still drink, I would crack a 40 ounce
Parents finally left, moved away, and they sold the house
It's really hard to ignore it now
Wish that we could sort it out
Last couple sips pour it out

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Que no vine aquí a morir 
Si no a hacer algo original

Quienes están locos en el mundo de hoy

Estarán ellos bien 
O yo estoy loco
Está todo al revés 
O soy yo

El tiempo que me queda aquí 
De seguro lo haré rendir 
Quiero mi huella en este mundo dejar 
Llenar de obras e ideas acá 
Y no entiendo por qué hay unos que 
Siguen a ciegas lo que otros piensan 
Y que alguien me explique por favor 
Si todo está al revés o al revés estoy yo

Estarán ellos bien 
O yo estoy loco
Está todo al revés 
O soy yo

Las pilas se agotan 
Lo antiguo se bota 
Las modas pasan 
El tiempo avanza 
Todo caga 
La vida se acaba 
Pero lo que hacemos queda para siempre

Y no sé por qué somos menos 
Los que nos preocupamos de ser verdaderos 
De no seguir al líder 
Y ser un pastor en vez de un cordero

Que vivir el arte como oficio

This is the window, this is the door
I wanna take eleven in your home
Is easy sing in english, everything sounds well

I'm sudaca ordaca and I like the maracas

But I don't care

Anyway don't understand nothing

Que se escuche en todos lados tu invitación 
Abre el corazón a un mundo mejor 
Vamos todos a luchar para que los sueños se hagan realidad

En este lugar, importa lo que dices 
Vale lo que haces, están los que te gusta hacer felices 
No hay fronteras, ni esquemas 
Estás en la nación, de tu imaginación 
No es un cambio permanente de ver la verdad 
Sino paralelamente hacer tu propia realidad 
Creando teorías, acerca de la vida 
Creyendo en lo que hacemos, confiando en algo nuevo 
Debes escoger muy bien a quién le entregas todo 
Puedes estar rodeado de gente e igual sentirte solo 
Sé sincero, pero guarda tus secretos 
Vive como quieras, no como te ordenan 
No hay limitación en la creación 
Así que presta atención 
No hay que ver para creer 
Sino creer para poder ver

De contarles esta narración 
Sobre el nieto de una estrella exitosa 
Esa perra de la tele famosa 
Recibamos con un gran aplauso 
La historia del perrito Lassio 
Él es un perrito muy querendón 
Y a su vez también es un poco collie's son (hijo de collie)

Él es un perrito muy guapetón 
Las perritas se derriten por verlo en acción 
Él presumía y se creía el mejor 
Y fue castigado por ser fanfarrón 
Un día conoció a una perra modelo 
Para su suerte ella andaba en celo 
Pero por mucho que estaba excitado 
No logró quedar bien parado

Pobre campeón, Lassio perdió su honor 
Su reputación por el suelo se quedó 
A concretar no alcanzó 
Por culpa de su maldición

Él hizo de todo para solucionar 
Los crueles síntomas de su enfermedad 
Trató con calmantes, pastillas adelgazantes 
Nuevos tratamientos y con medicamentos 
Probó con magia buena 
Trato con magia negra 
Masaje japonés 
Y con pulsera del poder 
Visitó especialistas 
Fue a un espiritista 
Hizo una manda 
Peregrinó a tierra santa 
Ni la ciencia, ni la fe, ni la homeopatía 
Lo ayudaron con su anomalía 
No le quedó otra que la resignación 
De aceptar su lassia condición

Hasta que un día una perrita lo vió 
Se acercó y sus partes nobles olió 
Mágicamente Lassio se fortaleció 
Sanseacabó su cruel maldición 
El no cabía en tanta alegria 
Ella no entendía, pero gracia le hacía 
Al fin y al cabo lassio se cruzó 
Y por fin con ella se pegó

Ya levantó su honor 
Su reputación radicalmente cambió

Que todo mal tiene solución

Que lo dulce se aprecia con lo amargo

Una entera, la otra a la mitad
Bajo tu cama las tres pondrás
Y a las doce, sin ver una sacarás
Mientras más cáscara tenga
Mayor fortuna obtendrás
Para ser un guitarrista de primera
Bajo una higuiera la noche deberás pasar
A las cero horas el árbol florecerá
Treparás entonces y de la flor te apropiarás
Así la gloria eterna
Podrás alcanzar

Pero si sientes duda alguna
Desconfías, te arrepientes
O miras hacia atrás
Al mismísimo diablo verás
Y el te cegará, ni flor, ni felicidad, ni nada
Jamás encontrarás, jamás encontrarás

Chancho en Piedra,"Porque el chileno es así

Llegamos tarde a todos lados 
Pero somos puntuales pa' llegar atrasados 
Vivimos siempre en los extremos 
Si no hay inundación una sequía tendremos 
Somos al peo, pero al buen peo 
Cada uno lleva adentro a un roto chileno 

Se que es malo generalizar 
Nunca ha sido bueno el prejuiciar 
Me pregunto si en el fondo pensarán igual 
Los que sienten diferente a la gente que se cree 
Que es distinta a los demás 

Ni lo uno ni lo otro, sino todo lo contario 
Es corta la distancia entre extraño y bizarro 
No todo bicho raro termina atrapado 
Unos se transforman vuelan y se van 
Y otros siguen para siempre igual a los demás",Porque el Chileno Es Asi,2002

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

People change, never stay the same
Losing faith in every single way
But I know it’s going to be okay
Getting by day after day

I got a lot on my mind, that's driving me without a wheel
Questioning my life like, Can I Live?
Is this what it is to be and lose yourself
And at the same time cursed of what you dream of yourself
You in the mirror and can't get a glimpse of yourself
Cause all you know is this guy that can't picture himself
Wiping tears from his eyes cause he don't know where he going
Got the coldest songs out but don't nobody a know it
You say you'll never run away but now you're packing your bags
The devil's laughing in your face all on your ass
While you mashing the gas and still pursuing your dream
Can't believe the next person cause the lie in between
It's not the end boy, it's just the beginning
Cause every lost a be a gain you're potentially winning 
You give it all, like you know it's your last
And people don't give a damn, unless they hear from your ass, it's sad

You can't see it in my face but then again know it's true
I'm human being cause I feel pain too
Promised everything but never given anything
They saying that I got, far from got it really what it seems 
Struggling to see these better days
Over work a nine to five still just under paid
I'm getting paid and pay bills on the same day, broke as shit
On my last two dollars, Johnny Taylor shit
To put this poetry in motion but running out of steam
Bleeding from the heart it got me down on bended knees
They only love you when you're up, cause when you're falling
Fake friends turn enemies regardless
But you don't hear me though, and some of you don't know me
You're just watching cause you're fearing what you don't see
People never change that's a lie cause in due time
Every second count, someday you'll realize 

People change, never stay the same
Losing faith in every single way
But I know it’s going to be okay

Change of Heart,"From the album slow down world

Kiss me sweet lover
And linger long in ecstasy.
Mingle our fluids,
Flirt let me flame thee.
Come into my parlour,
Come sip but a droplet
Of my secret rain,
Drink up my lovely,
And ease your pain.
'Cause I'm the black widow, woe,
I'm the black widow, woe,
And I eat my love
And I eat my love
And I eat my love
And I eat my love.
I offer my pleasure
But never my love,
You may need me forever
But I don't need your love.
If you try to repel me
Your body will howl.
I set your spirit free,
You can depend on me.
'Cause I'm the black widow, woe,
I'm the black widow, woe,
And I eat my love
And I eat my love
And I eat my love
And I eat my love.

we got to keep it true                   - you know what we do you know what
we do
we got to keep it true
relax your mind w/the music         - you know what we do you know what we do
sit back and vibe w/this true shit 

this isn't really what you think it is 
that is if you're even thinkin' in the first place
the first place isn't always the winner
and winnin' isn't everything 
and this is not a race
i am not a android i am not a mongoloid
i am not annoyed by the void in your brain
this is not a trick son you are not a victim
you are just a man be	-boyed out the game
let me explain
Abstract are you fresh?
ain't nobody fresher
but it's hard to get around w/out some clown tryin' to test ya
Acey are you dope?
dopest in the world
i give it to the moms and pops i give it to the boys and girls
oh so you a family man?
aren't we all aren't we all 
yes we are
trying to make jams man and expand my repertoire

we got to keep it true we got to keep it true   - relax your mind w/the music
you know what we do you know what we do  - sit back and vibe w/this true shit

well i be arrangin' thoughts in my brain cell family
 embarking on incredible creative routes
understanding me is truth shining like a lie
when i say break wide i mean take trips not just in your ride
in your mind
cause when you left you're right on time
the sun'll come out tomorrow and it'll set in the west
so i don't sweat the rest
who want to inhale stress
keep it true

you know we keep it true              - we keep it true we keep it true we
keep it true
you know we keep it true              - you know what we do you know what we
do
we got to keep it true                   - the W the W the W
we got to keep it true
relax your mind w/the music         - and keep it true and keep it true
sit back and vibe w/this true shit 

the world is full of bullshitters
liars and triers and quitters
could-a-beens want to be's thought-i-was isn't-i-is's 
and everybody in your business
damn
now what is really your main aim
when you are just a blotch and a stain on the planetary plane
just another name in the phone book of fame
bustin' out the seams it seems you haven't gained enough
to be seen in the right scene
your thoughts they seem so convincing hmmm
but your actions don't follow through
remember
never say never because it never comes true
your thoughts they seem so convincing for instance
you told me that you're a level higher
liar
element of desire earth and the wind and the fire
not
you ain't even halfway hot
not lukewarm you don't got no form
you (...?...)
all caught up in bein' waterproof
when you shoulda been tryin' to catch up w/the truth
for all intent and purposes your life on earth ain't worth it's weight in
gold
that's probably why you get blowed
cause people tell people things and people sell people things
that are useless and irrelevant
and it stifles my intelligence
i stay true

you know we keep it true   - and we keep on and keep on and keep on
you know we keep it true   - we keep it true we keep it true

you can mumble jumble if you got somethin' to say
but i doubt it's gonna affect me i row my boat steady
everready is my battery description
meaning i'm equipped to take long trips
and my brain cells overload when i get blowed
gotta bring it down there's a point where the joint stops
being passed through the fingers of a rhyme (?singers?)
the smoke from my last hit still lingers
bring us your tired and your weary and your poor
i'm a take you higher while you're hearing metaphors
and similes
assimilation of new creation
mind emancipation
rhymes command the nation
and so on and therefor and such and such
dust to dust i thrust from the ground
w/no where else to go but up L.A. is where i'm found
throwin' up sets and blowin' up sets and goin' up Stepney 
about to get a heavy track
(?or jimmy in the spot?)
or plenty of hip hop goin' round three
heavyweights it's your time so register
foundate your legacy we serve all them replicas
true style true style?
true style new style

you know we keep it true  - we keep it true we keep it true we keep it true
you know we keep it true  - the W and every crew we keep it true 
we got to keep it true       -  from me to you do what you do just keep it
true
we got to keep it true       - relax your mind w/the music

now i'm gonna take my last verse on a good note
you better prepare your footnotes
hold your wigs tight
open up the middle
(?center me in the more?)
words are the foundation action is the building and unity
and the concept to result in logic and the use of logic
now the object to be neutral partial to a judgement
and the subject's concentration here is the pop quiz
what hip hop is

you know we keep it true   -  relax your mind w/the music
we got to keep it true        -   sit back and vibe to this true shit
 
the wrong thing to do is stop",Keep It True,1995

Poppin droppin'
The amounts of cats but we ain't trying to hear nothing
Probably was wilder than wobbly are you the wiggy to give me
Hold me down and make me slow down to be twissy
Keep the ice out the club life - change face
Get on love wife while he on the license plates
Wait - make me think about you even when your not around
Use the bathroom put the toilet seat back down
Got me some sprinkles the hair with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways

While you're out with somebody else
No more staring at the phone

Just give me half of the rent and get out of here

Alegres porque él les canta
Se ríen de a pedacito

Larga en el monte, su voz pastosa
El hacha de la luna se derrama

Y sus ojos se le empañan

Se le endulzan las distancias

You make me feel cheap

Well, you told me I was special
And I swallowed that line
(Can't do it, I just can't do it)
You took what you wanted
But you won't give me mine
(Don't make me, just don't make me)

Now, I'm down and desperate
Won't you give me a hand
(Don't wanna, I just don't wanna)
Tell me I more than just a one night stand
(Don't wanna, I just don't wanna)

And you say it's done and over
(Can't do it)
It was only for one night
(Don't make me)

But you're makin' me feel so cheap
(Don't wanna)
Don't you know
That I'm not that kind of guy?

You make me feel cheap
You make me feel cheap
(Well, just one time)

Channel 3,"I saw you outside, why'd you have to follow me?
You wanted free ride, I just pretended not to see
There was a light rain, I didn't think it was that cruel
I didn't stop then, it's only two blocks to the school

Steel wrapped around the pole
Hot blood streams on cold cement
Burnt flesh in the air
Don't blame me for this accident

I felt a sharp flash from the corner of my eye
I turned my head then I had the feeling something died

Steel wrapped around the pole
Hot blood streams on cold cement
Burnt flesh in the air
Don't blame me for this accident

I would've know then, death was so near that day
I would've stopped then, perhaps it's too late to say
I could've loved you, I sat by you in history
This life is so short, now you're just a memory

Steel wrapped around the pole
Hot blood streams on cold cement
Burnt flesh in the air
Don't blame me for this accident

And now you're just a memory

Hah hah hah hah hah hahaha!

Everywhere I look there's another house negro
Talkin about they people and how they should be equal
They talkin but the conversation ain't goin nowhere
You can't diss hip-hop, so don't you even go there
C. Delores Tucker, you want to quote the scripture
Every time you hear nigga, listen up sista

I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster
I said I MC, she said, ""You're a gangster""
But she was caught up, she hit the floor like a breakdance
Wrapped her up like the arms in a be	-boy stance
Recognize moms I'm one of your sons I'm hip-hop
In the form of Channel Live and KRS-One
Representin MC's across America
She said, ""You're the one who be causin all that mass hysteria""

Wisdom shall come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
But you blinded by cultural ignorance and steady judging
But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love

She said, ""I like it, that's why I jock it""
Then I said, ""You only on my back because I fill brother's pockets""

I had to Rush Limbaugh, get that pig with an axe
Tuffy dips to the side, buckin cannons that's phat
Because he censors the uses of the metaphor
You can get the dick bum up
Because it's you that brings the, real horrorcore

Always seems to represent, minus three-sixty percent
For degrees full circle, dead from the purple
Rays of the sun I gots melanin so check it
Bag your nuts quick or get sick from being naked
Suspect it, was it a means for the end
For just a few to drive the Benz while you eat the pigskins
Turned you into mannequins, cause the trick of technology
A revelation, revelations
Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm Audi hundred forty four thousand with my people

From Caligula to Hitler, now it's Schwartzeneggar
A lust for the violence is the science of their behavior
Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy
Got my mind twisted like the blades of fonta leaf

So it wasn't hard for me to grab the mic and represent
Representing tormenting MC's craniums

I would've stopped then, perhaps it's too late to say

Burnt flesh in the air
Don't blame me for this accident

And now you're just a memory

Y es así que trato de contarte todo ésto que siento 
Y es así que estoy adormecido en el mar de ilusión 
Es así que todo vale todo y todo se termina 
Todo se termina 
Todo menos vos 

Y es así que trato de encontrarte por nuevos caminos 
Es así que en tu nombre hago rimas para ser feliz 
Es así que todo vale todo y todo se termina 
Todo se termina 
Todo menos vos 

Todo se termina 
Todo menos vos",Tu Nombre,2016

""Champion l'amour""

Quand elle me prend dans ses bras, que je la prends dans mes bras,
que l'on se prend dans les bras, nous deux z'entre quatre bras, émotion,
émotion, O tendresse et passion, dans notre feuilleton, c'est l'amour,
c'est l'amour le champion, oui, champion l'amour. Quand le maçon maçonne,
notre maison d'amour, qu'on voudrait la Garonne, quand on a que l'adour,
qu'elle me prend dans les bras, que je la prends dans les bras, que l'on se prend
dans les draps, quand son mari, quand son mari n'est pas là. Et, si on sort dans
la nuit noire, que le temps est brouillard, même en allumant les phares, il ne
pourra pas nous voir, nous, dans la belle automobile, nous jouons un vaudeville,
dangereux et difficile, à deux pas du campanile. Je sais cette femme est mariée,
et elle sait qu'elle est mariée, et je sais qu'elle est mariée, avec celui que je hais,
mais si elle s'est mariée, il y a quelques années, moi j'ai tout oublié, tout ça
c'est, tout ça c'est du passé, avant c'est toujours du passé. Oh !, je voudrais tant
te protéger, des dangers que cet homme laid, te fait courir mon adorée, je ne
pourrai lui pardonner, nous, dans la belle automobile, nous jouons un
vaudeville, dangereux et difficile, à deux pas du campanile, en double file.
C'est de la merde cette ville, jamais de place pour se garer, jamais de place pour
s'aimer. Et, si on sort dans la nuit noire, que le temps est au brouillard, même
en allumant les phares, il ne pourra pas nous voir, nous dans la belle automobile,
nous jouons un vaudeville, dangereux et difficile, à deux pas du campanile.
Oh !, si l'on pouvait s'envoler, et dans le ciel prendre le thé, sur un nuage de lait,
amoureux à tout jamais, oui, loin des juges et loin des lois, je me nourrirai de
toi, tu t'abreuveras de moi, et nous n'aurons plus jamais froid, plus jamais froid,
plus jamais froid, plus jamais froid...",Champion l'Amour,1999

And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Is a love I can be sure of

And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
I will melt your heart again
Remember the feeling as a child
When you woke up and morning smiled
It's time you felt like you did then
There's just no percentage in remembering the past
It's time you learned to live again at last

Come with me
Leave yesterday behind
And take a giant step 
Outside your mind

You stare at me in disbelief
You say for you there's no relief
But I swear I'll prove you wrong
Don't stay here in your lonely room
Just looking back at silent gloom
That's not where you belong
Come with me 
I'll take you where the taste of life is green
And every day holds wonders to be seen",Take a Giant Step,1992

You bring out the best in me 
That's why I love you 'cause your love is so real 

I'm floating down the aisle 
Watching you wanting me 
Wanna be yours forever 
Every step I make 
Every breath I take 
Is getting closer to you 
Forever 

our house will be home   
And love will keep growing 
With a family of our own 
We'll sit by the fire, tell stories and laugh 
And sometimes cry 
There'll be ups and downs, nothin's perfect 

but our love won?t be afraid to be strong and brave 
A lifetime together we?ll share 
Every emotion that true love can bear

Watching you wanting me

quand il court avec son parapluie

félix le chat, félix le chat
tu ne me rattraperas pas
je suis une souris qui danse,
je suis une souris qui chante
et tu peux toujours attendre
tu ne me croqueras pas
félix le chat, félix le chat
tu ne me rattraperas pas
félix le chat, félix le chat
je veux bien jouer avec toi

je suis une souris qui danse,
je suis une souris qui chante
je ne suis pas bien méchante
je veux bien jouer à chat
félix le chat, félix le chat
jouer à chat avec toi

c’est le plus comique des chatons
il mène sa vie en grand garçon
sème la panique, sème la police
traverse les stades comme un ballon
un jour il poursuit des sangliers
qu’il fait courir comme des lévriers
il a de l’adresse et tant d’allégresse
que toutes les souris sont folles de lui

félix le chat, félix le chat
tu ne me rattraperas pas
je suis une souris qui danse,
je suis une souris qui chante
et tu peux toujours attendre
tu ne me croqueras pas

je suis une souris qui chante
je ne suis pas bien méchante

And how long I've been so alone

And a siren wails in the night

And I can almost see through the dark there is light

And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought that I'd love anyone so much

I'll wait until the day I die

Has a silver lining

Suited in three-quarter Jordan's, pro-models 
And started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas 
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD 
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke 
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny 
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji 
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew 
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to 
Traveling like Vice Lords, down to the taste

Six deep in the Hyundai bumping Twilight Tone tapes 
Come home late calling broads hang up on they mother 
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other 
Get a room at the Dunes having bakeouts 
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out

My niggaz be fuckin' girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin' over if he said, ""Dumb bitch""
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
After parties in Wendy's parkin' lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin' off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

[Chorus]
It's remind-ing... mmm whooahhh yeahhh
It's remind-ing... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh

Check it
Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
and start thinkin' they thugs
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin'
Saved my day, dancin' on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin'
Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pourin'
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
and started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny

It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the taste
Not wantin to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
at em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up

[Chorus]

There go the break
To get the break go, it go OOH OH
Yeah, it go OOH OH
You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yo, check it, check it
Nowadays niggaz is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace
At times I contemplate movin' to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace
remindin' me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes

Come home late callin' broads hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes havin' bakeouts
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out
Then everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin' in
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin' in
Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T.
Rememberin' numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
My man Sef passed I feel hollow but still

Why do we give ourselves away,

Free to be sure of 
What I am and who I need not be 
Free from all worries 
Worries prey on oneself's troubled mind 
Freer than the clock's hands 
Tickin' way the times 
Freer than the meaning of free that man defines 
Life running through me 
Till I feel my father God has called 
Me having nothin' 
But possessing riches more than all 
And I'm free 
To be nowhere 
But in every place I need to be 
Freer than a sunbeam 
Shinning through my soul 
Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold 
Free from conceiving the beginning 
For that's the infinite start 
I'm gone - gone but still living 
Life goes on without a beating heart 
Free like a vision 
That the mind of only you can see 
Freer than a raindrop 
Falling from the sky 
Freer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes 
I'm free like a river 
Flowin' freely to infinity 
I'm free to be sure of what 
I am and who I need not be 
I'm much freer - like the meaning of the word free that 
crazy man defines 
Free - free like the vision that

If I gave you love
Then where would that leave me?
If I gave my trust
Would you use it against me?
And if love starts again
Would the ending be the same?
Or would you prove to be the only one for me?
If I gave love

If I could look into your eyes and see the truth
Then I would know if I should try to put all of my trust in you
Not having to worry about if things would change
Once I gave myself to you
I hope that you would stay the same

Cuz I put all my trust in the wrong hands
And I don't ever want to feel pain again
So how do I know that you're the right man?
But I pray that you are so our love could begin

If I gave you love
Then where would that leave me?
If I gave my trust
Would you use it against me?
And if love starts again

If I gave love

I'm takin' a chance on you and me boy
You've given me a reason to let you inside my life
I've been in love before, I know this feeling
I gotta know this time this love is right
I gotta know that love is right

Not enough just to say the words ""I love you""
(Can't say it baby, baby)
Gotta make sure that you're doin' everything you say
I'm not impressed by lines I've heard before
When it's said and done, those lines will fade away

If I gave you love
Then where would that leave me?
If I gave my trust
Would you use it against me?

If I gave you love
Then where would that leave me?
If I gave my trust
Would you use it against me?
And if love starts again
Would the ending be the same?
Or would you prove to be the only one for me?

Not much to ask of you
I ask that you be true
Don't take my love for granted
See I wont be played so easily
Been there, done that before
I can't go there no more
Please oh please don't get me wrong
I just want a love I can count on

If I gave you love
Then where would that leave me?
If I gave my trust
Would you use it against me?
And if love starts again
Would the ending be the same?

Chanté Moore,"Curtains falls down 
Lights come on 
I'm alone in the dark and I sang final notes from my heart 
Times when I write 
Late at night in my room 
The candles burn and the paper mirrors my choice of words 
Every Time I close my eyes and the world ain't on my side 
And I'm sure that I can't change a thing 
Then the sweetest man arrives 
In my life 

I am living out my dreams 
'Cause you gave me what I need 
You're the only air I breathe 
Your the only one can count on on and on 
I can always count on
On and on 
In my life 

I've learned to disguise with my eyes 
But he can see deep inside 
And he shares the feelings I try to hide 
Every time I close my eyes 
And the world ain't on my side 
And I'm sure that I can't change a thing

Smell the flowers in your valley

I remember the times we shared and I
Remember the long phone calls at night
You used to say the sweetest things
But today my phone rings and I wish
That you would just stop talking
I just can't take this anymore
You broke my heart and I know for sure
You're the man I thought you was
Compromised myself enough
Now it's times to stop living this lie now

Don't follow me home nigga
Stop ringing my phone nigga
Just leave me alone nigga
I wish you well but
Right now I'm just bitter

Why did you come into my life
You didn't plan to do me right
If you didn't mean forever more
Why'd you get with me for?

Than you feel
Our love can't be what it should be 
Not until
We face our fears internally from the past
And forgive ourselves for moving way too fast

If we continue not to let it go
Pretty soon we're at a dead end road
With hearts made of bitter stone
Unable to give or receive love, right

Just want to grow gray and old
And live and die in happiness as one soul
So come on, let's move on
Out of this storm

Everything we want
We can have baby
If we both want it bad enough, I know
Everything we want
We can have baby
But we must build our faith and trust, our love

We need to share the things we think, honestly
Without sacrificing peace and made uneasy
We must revive the trust between us once again
And share just as much when we were friends

Even after all that we've been through
I don't want nobody else but you
Better days are overdue for us two
Baby I just want to

Just want to grow gray and old
And live and die in happiness as one soul
So come on, let's move on
Through the storm, hey

Everything we want
We can have baby
If we both want it bad enough, I know
Everything we want
We can have baby
But we must build our faith and trust, our love

And constantly stressed

Forgetting how blessed we are to be together
We can do much better

That we can have it

I used to have a man
That didn't know what he had
Till he saw me in the hands of somebody else
I mean everyday flat no romance
Now he's sitting at home all by himself
Saying...

What did I do
It's not what you did
It's what you didn't do, didn't do
What can I say?
Not a word that'll get me back to you, back to you
Where did I go wrong?
Well remember the times when you didn't come home
I got tired of it, I'm sick of all this
When a woman's fed up 
Ain't nothing you can do about it

Go ahead with all of that
Cause when you had me
You didn't want me
You just treated me bad
Go ahead with all of that
So what you saw me with somebody else, What?
You're supposed to be mad
You better go ahead with all of that
Baby, baby tough, turn around and walk right out the door
Cause I gave you too many chances 
To fix our romance
But I don't want you no more

No more, no more, no
No more, no 
I don't want you 
No more, no, no more
No more, no more

Never took me out
Like I heard he was doing with this girl named Kim
I used to tell them
But he really never hit 'em till I quit 'em
I did the same thing to him
Now he wanna say

What did I do
It's not what you did
It's what you didn't do, didn't do

But I don't want you no more

This ain't something we can work out
Ain't nothing for you now to talk about 
And to get as far from each other as we can
Cause you don't know how to treat no lady
And you wanna act all crazy
Say the wrong words, do the wrong things
And expect me to take you back, no

Go ahead with all of that
Cause when you had me
You didn't want me
You just treated me bad

Can bring such agony

Prince Charming slay the dragon 
And come and rescue me
So many things have changed
But heartbreak feels the same
Well my strength is what I found
In the eye of a hurricane

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

Be still my heart
No one said there'll be days like this
Well I made it this far
I see where the end is gon' be
I said Chante, honey, gotta keep pressing on
My peace I found in the eye of a hurricane

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

We're supposed to love unselfishly
But somehow I find 
I'm crying myself to sleep, sometimes
Tell me whose at fault at taking care of me
It's me, myself and my heart and I
Somehow we find a way to try to love again
Yet when you lose you tried
But still you're playing a game, well
Just when you learn the rules
You learn the rules have changed
I'm never worried cause I know just who I am
When you live, you learn to be the same 
Even without the name

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy

Never gave me love in return

Chanté Moore,"The windows of the world are covered with rain
Where is the sunshine we once knew?
Everybody knows when little children play
They need a sunny day to grow straight and tall
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
When will those black skies turn to blue?
Everybody knows when boys grow into men
They start to wonder when their country will call
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
What is the whole world coming to?
Everybody knows when men can not be friends
Their quarrel often ends where some have to die

There must be something we can do
Everybody knows whenever rain appears
It's really angel tears
How long must they cry?

I went in town to shop around for something new
And thought I'd stop and have a bite when I was through

I looked around for someplace near, and it occurred to me
Where I had parked the car, there is a most attractive
French cafe and bar, it really wasn't very far

The waiter showed me to a dark, secluded corner
And when my eyes became accustomed to the gloom
I saw two people at the bar who were so in love
That even I could spot it clear across the room

Guess who I saw today, my dear
I've never been so shocked before

They didn't see me passing through

What I first think of
Is how the different we take
All the love we think we make
Loving in which I sing
Is so much more than a feeling
It has to be shared to be given

Love taunts, love leads
Love covers, love moves
Love sees, love gives
Love soothes, love magnifies
The good and takes us through the bad
Love is all that

Empty spaces left from good intentions
Bad choices, even crying
Trying hardly to dispel the misconceptions
And reveal what love really is

Love is all that

Speaks of love

Love will last, love will last
